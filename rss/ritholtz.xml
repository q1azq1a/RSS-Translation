href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/01/problem-solving-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">投资是一种解决问题的活动</a>，其中充满了机会，但也揭示了我们所有人都会犯的错误。如果投资的核心部分是对人类行为的研究，那么我们必须认识到人类行为的表现方式就是我们做出决策的方式。</p><p>为了成为更好的投资者，我们必须学习如何做出更好的决策。</p><p>你在这个兔子洞里掉得越深，你就越清楚地知道良好的判断和决策是多么重要。它影响你生活的方方面面，从你的配偶是谁、你的职业生涯有多成功、你的医疗保健结果有多好，以及你的人际关系有多充实。良好的决策会增加幸福感、提高生活满意度，甚至可能成为最好的人。</p><p>我并不是说你必须成为一名出色的投资者才能拥有美好的生活；我只是建议你必须成为一名出色的投资者才能过上美好的生活。相反，我希望你考虑一下投资所需的技能，以及它们如何转移到你在金融界之外所做的大部分事情上。</p><p>也许这就是我对投资的定义与主流不同的原因：</p><blockquote><p> “<em>投资是一门利用不完美信息对本质上不可知的未来进行概率评估的艺术</em>。”</p></blockquote><p>这 17 个词包含了很多细微差别。</p><blockquote><p> – “<em>艺术</em>”指的是这不是一门科学，并且没有适合每个人的单一最佳解决方案。</p><p> – “<em>不完美信息</em>”是指我们拥有的信息是动态的，充其量是不完整的，经常令人困惑，而且经常是错误的。没有人可能在任何特定时刻都知道所有需要知道的事情。</p><p> – “<em>概率评估</em>”认识到许多结果都是可能的；我们需要为未来潜在的结果做好规划，而不是一项。</p><p> – “<em>本质上不可知</em>”是一种非常谦卑的承认，表明我们对未来实际上知之甚少。几乎所有时候，我们不知道也不可能知道接下来会发生什么。这应该反映在我们的投资方式中。</p><p> ——“<em>未来</em>”需要乐观。在整个人类历史上，悲观主义者一直是这场交易的失败者。即使像互联网泡沫破裂、全球金融危机和新冠疫情这样的挫折也是暂时的。悲观主义是对人类聪明才智的赌注，而这是一场失败的赌注。</p></blockquote><p>我成年后一直在观察市场，更重要的是，观察人们在与这些市场互动时的行为方式。</p><p>鉴于行为经济学的广泛采用（包括卡尼曼、席勒和泰勒三度获得诺贝尔奖），我们今天倾向于认为这是理所当然的。就在不久之前，BeFi 还没有被投资者认真对待。</p><p>你做出决定的过程值得研究。无论我们谈论的是人生中的重要里程碑还是您的资产配置，都不要让您的决策默认设置成为“自动驾驶”。</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><em>以前</em>：<br /><a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/01/simple-but-hard/" target="_blank"

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-03/how-the-pandemic-small-business-boom-is-fueling-the-us-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">商业周刊</a>）</p><p> •<strong>一些美联储官员对加息过高持谨慎态度</strong>：随着通胀放缓，央行官员面临着困惑，但经济活动却比预期更为强劲。 （《 <a

•<strong>我们是否应该预期估值会随着时间的推移而均值回归？</strong>假设倍数均值回归是有道理的。在很长一段时间内，它们确实如此：在 40 年代末和 50 年代初，股票交易价格处于高个位数市盈率，在 60 年代和 70 年代初，股票交易市盈率高达十几倍，在 80 年代初回到高个位数市盈率，直接升至创纪录的在 20 世纪 90 年代末的大盘股增长牛市期间，该数字为 40+，然后在 2010 年代初的复苏期间下降至十几岁左右。但同样真实的是，确定这些回归的时机也很困难。 （ <a href="https://www.thediff.co/archive/should-we-expect-valuations-to-mean-revert-over-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">差异</a>）</p><p> •

•<strong>中国为何如此难以解决房地产危机</strong>：北京经常通过增加基础设施和房地产支出来解决经济问题，但现在沉重的债务负担使其难以遵循。 （ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/business/china-economy-property.html" target="_blank"

href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/universe-wasnt-empty-before-big-bang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">大思考</a>）</p><p> •<strong>特朗普的祝酒，各位</strong>：佐治亚州的起诉书称，特朗普精心策划了一场规模庞大的犯罪阴谋，涉及来自 6 个州的 20 多名具名和未具名的同谋，其目的是非法改变 2020 年 11 月的选举结果总统选举。这份起诉书没有任何微妙之处——实际上，它指控唐纳德·特朗普、鲁迪·朱利安尼、马克·梅多斯、约翰·伊士曼、杰弗里·克拉克、西德尼·鲍威尔和其他十几个人发动了一场不成功的政变。 （<a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/trumps-toast-folks"

名未被起诉的同谋。正如诺姆·艾森和艾米·李·科普兰指出的那样，史密斯的案件可能会被电视和音频观众屏蔽，而威利斯的诉讼很可能会成为连续几周必看的电视节目。 （ <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/trump-indictments-jack-smith-fani-willis-themes.html"

RITHOLTZ，商业硕士主持人：本周的播客，我能说什么？卡斯·桑斯坦（Cass Sunstein）是美国法学、法律、行为金融学、公共政策领域的知识分子。我什至不知道还能去哪里。这是一个多么令人着迷的职业，一个非常有趣的人。</p><p>我想当你的合著者都是诺贝尔奖获得者或乔治·卢卡斯时，生活会很容易。他在职业生涯中做了很多令人惊奇的事情，从最高法院到芝加哥商学院、芝加哥法学院、哈佛法学院，以及白宫的多个公共政策职位、公共服务职位，五角大楼的总检察长办公室。我的意思是，他的影响是如此深远和迷人。你有点忘记了他还在哈佛大学教授法律。</p><p>我发现这次谈话令人愉快、引人入胜、引人入胜。我想您也会，事不宜迟，与哈佛法学院的卡斯·桑斯坦 (Cass Sunstein) 坐下来。</p><p>卡斯桑斯坦，欢迎来到彭博社。</p><p>卡斯·桑斯坦，哈佛大学法学院行为经济学和公共政策项目创始人：谢谢，很高兴来到这里。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：非常感谢您加入我们。</p><p>因此，您与两位诺贝尔奖获得者合着了两本书，并且实际上与乔治·卢卡斯（George Lucas）合着了第三本书。那有多有趣？</p><p> SUNSTEIN：嗯，我想说这太棒了。写《星球大战》非常有趣——</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p>桑斯坦：——对于法学教授来说，这也是一件不太可能发生的事情。</p><p>里索兹：（笑声）</p><p>桑斯坦：与迪克·塞勒一起写书并不是一件疯狂的事情，但真的很有趣，因为他很有趣。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：在经济学或行为金融学领域，没有人能像迪克·泰勒那样。他是我最喜欢的人之一。</p><p> SUNSTEIN：同意，他很独特，和他一起写作每分钟都是一种快乐和欢笑。与丹尼·卡尼曼一起写作令人惊讶。他是我见过的最有创造力的人。他也非常自我批评。他对合著者的批评几乎和他对自己的批评一样，这是一次过山车和一次令人难以置信的学习经历，他的正直和“我们可以做得更好”的感觉让我大多数晚上都睡不着觉。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：据说他对每一个词、每句话都感到痛苦。从周日开始，任何内容都会经过九种方式的审查才能发表。</p><p>桑斯坦：这太轻描淡写了。所以你可能会在凌晨四点收到一封电子邮件，上面写着：“这一章太糟糕了。我不知道我们怎么能写出来。事实上，整本书都很糟糕。我不知道为什么我们决定写它。”两个小时后，他会说：“我看到了根本性的缺陷，我们必须放弃。”然后一个小时后，也许是凌晨 4.45，他会说，“我可能有办法纠正根本缺陷，但我不这么认为。”然后在早上 5.15，他会给你发一张纸条，上面写着：“我有一丝洞察力。可能会失败，但我会尝试一下。”然后在早上 5.45，他说：“我有了整章的新草稿。这是一场灾难，我确信这也非常糟糕，但灾难性要小一些。”</p><p> RITHOLTZ：（笑声）这听起来像是，跳到最后一篇并阅读它。因此，我们稍后会讨论您的很多著作，但在此之前，我想深入了解一下您的背景。您于 75 年从哈佛毕业，获得学士学位，于 78 年从哈佛法学院毕业。我认为 20 世纪 70 年代与 80 年代和 90 年代有很大不同，当时像哈佛法学院这样的地方有很多人想去华尔街，那个常春藤盟校法学院的时代是什么样的？</p><p> SUNSTEIN：这是 20 世纪 60 年代的后果。所以它比所有民权和越南事件都要晚，但它就像一股开始消退的浪潮，但极其明显。</p><p>因此，有些人希望在他们能找到的任何领域都拥有伟大的职业生涯。有些人想，我想让世界变得更美好。有些人认为，我有点厌倦了那些想让世界变得更美好的人，我不想成为那样的人。并且有不同类别的类型。气氛非常强烈，有一种感觉，我们的国家经历了一些非常痛苦和令人兴奋的事情。问题是，我们要往哪个方向走？那是前里根时代。你可以在我的一些同学身上看到里根时代的曙光。今天你甚至可以在我的一些同学身上看到一些觉醒的曙光。</p><p>批判种族理论即将诞生，你可以在那里看到它的起源，也可以看到联邦党协会，这是一个具有惊人影响力的保守运动。也就是说，理论基础是由 20 世纪 70 年代的 20 多岁的年轻人奠定的。</p><p>里索兹：有趣。</p><p>因此，您为马萨诸塞州最高法院法官本杰明·卡普兰 (Benjamin Kaplan) 担任书记员，然后为美国最高法院瑟古德·马歇尔 (Thurgood Marshall) 法官担任书记员，这是 79-80 年。请告诉我们一些这些经历是什么样的。</p><p>桑斯坦：嗯，马萨诸塞州最高法院的卡普兰法官，他没有出现在历史书中，但他可能会出现。他是一个公正而严谨的人，就像卡普兰这个词一样，公正而严谨。他有点像丹尼·卡尼曼（Danny Kahneman），他对每一个字都很着迷。他对自己也很挑剔，对他的职员也很挑剔。有一次，在我开始之前，有人告诉我，他要把你带到相当于木棚的地方，并威胁要解雇你，果然，这件事发生了，我的反应很激烈。</p><p>我对他说：“这不公平。”这真是一次邂逅。第二天他说：“你还在生我的气吗？”这是对我人性的认可。我说：“我仍然认为你不公平。”我们成了好朋友，我从他身上学到了很多东西。他曾是哈佛教授，也许是他这一代人中最好的哈佛教授，而且他是一位非凡的法官。马歇尔是一位历史人物，比生活更伟大，充满幽默、机智和道德承诺，但从未引起人们的注意。这更多是关于人的。这从来都不是关于他自己的。我从马歇尔那里学到的是，律师通常（至少在最高法院一级）关注纸面内容并思考，论点是否可靠？另一种纸是更好的纸吗？谁，哪位律师在优先权和法规方面的争论更有优势。</p><p>马歇尔当然想到了所有这些事情，但他看到了纸人的背后。这对我来说是一个持久的教训，有人是脆弱的，或者不是脆弱的，但他是一个在案件中处于危险之中的人。</p><p>他一直想知道这些人是谁，以及他们的实际利害关系是什么。在成千上万的类似情况中，他们可能是投资者，他们可能是工人，他们可能是公司，他们会受到什么影响？他所指出的这一点比当时的任何一位法官，而且我认为也许比历史上的任何一位法官都更重要。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你完成了你的职员工作，然后去了芝加哥大学，最终在那里担任了 27 年的教授。这跑得真好。是什么让芝加哥成为如此特殊的教学地点？</p><p>桑斯坦：我应该说，我确实有过一些介于两者之间的经历，这不像在巴黎度假或当商店扒手。</p><p>我在司法部呆过一段时间……</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>桑斯坦：我在卡特和里根领导下的法律顾问办公室工作了一年，该办公室就总统提议的行动的合法性向总统提供建议。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：因此，与在最高法院面前辩论的副检察长不同，这是直接与美国总统合作。</p><p>桑斯坦：是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：还有他的员工。</p><p>桑斯坦：好吧，当你直接说时，确实如此，只是我与里根总统的会面次数为零。我和里根总统的调解互动次数大约有五次，为总统做的工作量基本上是每天。</p><p>因此，副检察长办公室在最高法院面前对案件进行辩论，法律顾问办公室解决冲突，例如国务院和国防部之间的冲突，或者如果总统说，“我可以签订条约，或者我可以解雇空中交通管制员，或者我可以为公民权利做点什么吗？”法律顾问办公室负责回答这一问题。</p><p>我认为它至少和副检察长办公室一样有趣，因为你不是向法庭恳求，“请同意我们的观点。”你实际上是在解决争议。它介于法官之间，你写意见，有点像法官，你是行政部门政治运作的一部分。如果总统想做某事，你不会对总统想做的事漠不关心。但说不是该办公室的一个非常光荣的传统。我们说不多。你说不的原因之一是总统有义务忠实地执行法律。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>桑斯坦：这是庄严的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我们现在还这样做吗？我们是否已经放弃了这一点？</p><p>桑斯坦：不，这种情况仍然会发生。因此，在最近几任总统的领导下，法律顾问办公室偶尔都会说不。现在有些时候，法律顾问办公室更具政治性，比如说，什么是正确的词？</p><p>里索兹：妥协了？</p><p> SUNSTEIN：我想用一个更温和的词，但这并不是一个坏词。</p><p>里索兹：我没必要这么做。我与法律界没有任何联系，所以我可以投下任何我想要的炸弹。我知道你需要比我更谨慎一些。</p><p>桑斯坦：我认为法律顾问办公室的法律独立性随着时间的推移而变化的说法是正确的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：好的，这很公平。</p><p>桑斯坦：但按照传统，它不仅仅是一个走狗。然后，正如你所说，我去了芝加哥大学。我去那里是因为我担心当一名教授就像二十多岁时退休一样。我想，这不是我想做的。</p><p>里索兹：我听有人说过，美国最后的地主贵族是终身教授。</p><p>桑斯坦：这就是我所害怕的。所以我想，你知道，我在司法部，我在最高法院做书记员，我有职业计划，而只是坐在办公室里思考，我有什么想法，那感觉并不真实就像生活一样。感觉更像是愚蠢的。</p><p>但在芝加哥大学，教师们充满了活力和活力。无论他们是在提出关于法律经济分析的新想法，还是关于自由意味着什么的新想法，或者关于证券法的新想法，都像是电动的。这就像巴黎。芝加哥大学法学院当时是一个充满活力的知识界，他们说维也纳曾经是这样，柏林曾经是这样，剑桥和牛津曾经是这样，芝加哥就是这样。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你仍然引用“彻头彻尾的芝加哥人”吗？</p><p>桑斯坦：我不会这么说。我认为每个人都是他们自己，而不是芝加哥人或纽约人，请原谅我那些认为自己是纽约人的人，你就是你自己。但我确实受到了这样一个事实的启发和影响：在芝加哥，过去和现在都有强烈的好奇心和一种试图找出真相是令人兴奋和崇高的感觉。</p><p>于是我见到了加里·贝克尔，这位获得诺贝尔奖的芝加哥伟大经济学家，几乎是一位法学教授，他一直都在身边。伙计，他以为我满嘴胡言吗？</p><p>里索兹：（笑声）</p><p>桑斯坦：当他在他的工作室里问我问题时，你的感觉是错的，同时还有一种我永远不会忘记的尊重感。他是一个巨人，而我却是一个无足轻重的人。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：等等，等等，等等，我必须在这里打断你。所以你不是为一个最高法院做书记员，而是为一个州和最高法院做书记员，然后你在总法律顾问办公室为白宫服务，突然你又变成了一名 1L 官员，感觉恐慌情绪上升，我会不会弄错并在大家面前感到尴尬？</p><p>桑斯坦：嗯，有点像那样。请注意，当时我 20 多岁，我记得迪克·波斯纳 (Dick Posner) 为芝加哥大学新人为我举办的一次晚宴，乔治·斯蒂格勒 (George Stigler)，他也是诺贝尔奖获得者，也在场，他问我教什么我正在教福利法。那是我的课程之一。</p><p>里索兹：在芝加哥。</p><p>桑斯坦：在芝加哥，这是关于社会保障法和反贫困法。乔治·斯蒂格勒说：“你为什么要教这个？ “美国没有穷人。”他写了一篇论文，表明如果你每周赚 6 美元或其他什么，我应该说，旨在表明，如果你每周赚 6 美元，你就会没事。我对此的反应是，你的名字可能是斯蒂格勒，你可能是诺贝尔奖获得者，但我不相信那篇论文是正确的。他比我聪明、博学得多。这是一顿​​糟糕的晚餐。</p><p>但当时我确实有一种感觉，也许现在，我会尽力而为。我并不觉得我一定是错的。我记得斯蒂格勒的凶狠，贝克尔是一位伟大的人，既尊重又怀疑。斯蒂格勒既轻蔑又好奇参加我们晚宴的这个年轻傻瓜是谁。</p><p>但当时在场的迪克·波斯纳（Dick Posner）也是一位巨人，在那次晚宴上他很友善。所以他看到我遇到了麻烦，因为斯蒂格勒非常聪明和敏捷。波斯纳同意斯蒂格勒的观点，为我辩护，这是一段伟大友谊的开始。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这真的很有趣。谢天谢地，美国没有穷人，因为只要想想在大城市看到无家可归者和无力支付医疗费用的人是多么不舒服。我的意思是，什么样的国家有这样的东西？我的意思是，谢天谢地他是对的。</p><p>桑斯坦：是的，我们可能需要累进所得税之类的东西，以及就业计划和教育机会。</p><p>里索兹：这是一个令人着迷的讽刺，你的职业生涯从芝加哥开始，现在你已经在哈佛工作了一段时间，往返于公共服务领域，但仍在哈佛法学院呆了很长一段时间。至少在法律思想方面，这些似乎是知识谱系的终点。</p><p>我是否夸大了这一点还是公平的？</p><p>桑斯坦：这是一个很好的问题。所以当我在那里的时候，芝加哥是中间偏右法律思想的中心。它有很大比例的最有影响力的右翼中间派人士，他们非常棒，而且他们仍然是很好的朋友。哈佛是批判法律研究的诞生地。这已经不再是一个东西了，但那是法律和经济学的中间偏左，这是中间偏右。</p><p>但我想，即使我在芝加哥，我也不是中间派。我认为法律和经济学非常重要，并且走在正确的道路上。我认为批判性法律研究是一堆形容词和名词，并没有真正意义重大。但我很钦佩哈佛的宪法法律人士，他们对法律的头脑确实非常清醒。我很钦佩哈佛的学生，他们在知识兴趣、知识背景、政治等等方面都如此多样化。芝加哥也有知识多样性，但规模较小。</p><p>所以我觉得哈佛有点像纽约，芝加哥有点像波士顿。更小，联系更紧密，每个人都与其他人联系，我爱他们两个。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你在哈佛大学和一些传奇教授一起工作。我想，当吉多·卡拉布雷西 (Guido Calabresi) 担任院长时，你与他有重叠吗？</p><p>桑斯坦：你知道，他在耶鲁大学，我非常了解他，我非常爱他，他现在已经90多岁了，他对我影响很大，哈佛和耶鲁经常有智力上的互动，这些互动正在孕育着。友谊，芝加哥和耶鲁也是，卡拉布雷西是法律经济分析的创始人，多一点，比如说，关注穷人，人们在挣扎，然后是芝加哥经济学，所以有耶鲁学校和芝加哥学校和卡拉布雷西，我不能说他是一位导师，但他对我来说就是这样的感觉。</p><p>里索兹：劳伦斯·特里布（Lawrence Tribe）可能是该国杰出的宪法学者，我是否再次强调了这一点，或者这是一个公平的-</p><p>桑斯坦：我认为这有点像篮球，有些人像迈克尔·乔丹，有些人像勒布朗·詹姆斯，还有一些人——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：两者都不会出错，对吧？</p><p>桑斯坦：当然，比尔·拉塞尔是有史以来最伟大的赢家。部落是我的老师。</p><p>里索兹：哦，真的吗？</p><p>桑斯坦：他可能是这三个人中最像迈克尔·乔丹的一个。他的智力运动能力过去和现在都是……</p><p> RITHOLTZ：下一个水平。</p><p>桑斯坦：下一个级别。当他还是我的老师时，他很有魅力，思路清晰，想法丰富。当时他正在写他的伟大论文。这是思维的篝火，在建设性的、篝火摧毁中，部落没有摧毁任何东西。我觉得他很耀眼。他为我写了一封信，实际上是为了我与马歇尔法官一起担任最高法院的书记员，对此我非常感激。他仍然是一个很好的朋友。而且，你知道，他在很多方面都与我不同，尤其是最近几年。他更多地参与政治，这不是我的典型风格，但我对他充满钦佩。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的，真的很有趣。</p><p>那么让我们来谈谈这个程序。是什么导致了这样的事情发生呢？这听起来不像典型的法学院课程。</p><p>桑斯坦：完全可以。因此，我想现在每个人都知道，关于人类行为的行为经济学和行为科学工作出现了爆炸式增长。所以我们知道人们如何偏离完美理性。因此，人们往往只关注短期，而不是长期。他们常常表现得不切实际的乐观。他们的注意力是有限的。他们可以被操纵，因为他们会专注于产品的一两个功能，而不是七个功能。这意味着他们将获得两个他们喜欢的功能和五个他们从长远来看会鄙视的功能。所以我们对此了解很多。</p><p>这对法律具有重大影响。因此，就信托义务而言，就信托人而言，他们必须告诉人们什么？他们必须向人们明确什么，而不仅仅是告诉人们？行为科学告诉我们很多关于这一点的信息。</p><p>如果我们思考言论自由法，思考思想市场，行为科学、行为经济学可能会告诉我们一些关于人们如何感到困惑或愚弄的事情。如果我们谈论财产法、侵权法或合同法，就必须了解人们将如何对法律的规定做出反应。因此，如果法律有一个默认条款，比如说，您必须在合理的时间内履行义务，并且履行义务的公司认为合理的时间可能意味着明年。法律对此有何规定？所以有无数的问题。算法和人工智能现在是法律试图找出具有行为特征的首要考虑因素。这就是我们正在对我们的程序所做的事情。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这听起来真的很有趣。</p><p>我猜想，自从您与迪克·塞勒（Dick Thaler）合着《助推》（Nudge）以来，这是第一个与塞勒或行为经济学和公共政策项目合作的书？</p><p>桑斯坦：我给你讲一个故事。在遇到泰勒之前，卡尼曼、特沃斯基和泰勒的工作给我留下了深刻的印象。所以我想，就是这样。我开始写一些论文，其中一篇叫做“法律行为分析”。然后泰勒来到了芝加哥大学，我们开始一起吃午餐。当我开始与他合作时，他正在与一位名叫克里斯汀·乔勒斯（Christine Jolles）的法学教授合作撰写一篇论文，我认为这篇论文进展得太慢了。我说，“如果你不写那篇论文，”我会写我的论文，它可能会抢走你的风头。虽然不会比你的好，但会早一些。”</p><p>里索兹：（笑声）</p><p>桑斯坦：迪克说，这对我来说是一个美妙的时刻，他说，“你为什么不加入我们呢？”我们一起写的。因此，在遇到泰勒之前，我对行为学很感兴趣，在遇见泰勒之后，我在这方面有了世界上最好的合作伙伴。 And then when I went to Harvard, our program that followed, and some of it involves nudges, some of it has nothing to do with nudges, but all of it has to do with behavioral science.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you also co-wrote “Noise” with Danny Kahneman. It seems that there&#39;s a theme in all your books, “Nudge”, “Noise”, “Sludge”. You&#39;re constantly looking at the decision-making process and not just from an academic perspective, but how it affects people in the real world, how it affects organizations, how it affects individuals. Tell us a little bit about the integration of behavioral finance and behavioral economics with law.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, well, let&#39;s talk a little bit about groups, shall we?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: If you get a group of like-minded people together, they typically end up thinking a more extreme version of what they thought before they started to talk. So if you get a group of people who tend to think, you know, we ought to invest in X, take your pick. Soap, there&#39;s a new kind of soap. We ought to invest in X. That&#39;s the average view. Soap, everyone needs to be clean. And with climate change, soap is going to be crazy. Soap companies. If that&#39;s the average view, but I&#39;m starting to convince myself, by the way, to invest in soap companies, which is probably not necessarily right, let&#39;s put it that way.</p><p> If people talk with one another and they start with an initial disposition, they tend to think an extreme version of what they thought. They become more confident, more unified, and more extreme.</p><p> This is a real problem for companies. It&#39;s a real problem for law. We have data suggesting if you get three judges who are let&#39;s say Democratic appointees on a court of appeals, not two Democratic appointees and one Republican, three Democratic appointees, the likelihood of a left of center opinion shoots up really dramatically. That&#39;s a crazy finding, because if you have two Democratic appointees on a three judge panel, they have the votes. They don&#39;t need that Republican appointee, but they are much more moderate, and it&#39;s symmetrical. Three Republican appointees are much more right wing in their voting patterns than two Republican appointees on a panel with one Democratic appointee.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So groupthink, even amongst judges, is worse if there&#39;s three of them and no countering voices versus, hey, we have a majority and we&#39;re going to sign how we want, but everybody kind of wants to be rational and cooperative? Is that the suggestion?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And here&#39;s the really cool thing. There was a book called “Groupthink” a few decades ago. It&#39;s a fantastic term. It&#39;s not clear what groupthink is, and if we clarify what it is, it&#39;s not clear whether it exists. So the rigorous efforts to test groupthink have a bunch of question marks. But there&#39;s something like groupthink which does exist, which is a testable hypothesis, which is if you get a group of people, it will end up after deliberation in a more extreme point in line with its pre-deliberation tendencies. So that&#39;s a mouthful. But let&#39;s suppose you have a group of six people deciding whether to invest in soap or instead electric cars. Those are the options. So let&#39;s say four of them think soap and two of them think electric cars and they think the same thing, they think what they do with equal intensity.</p><p> At the end of the discussion, the prediction is the group is going to go soap, soap, soap, soap, soap, and it&#39;s going to do that with a considerable confidence as well as unanimity. That will be the statistical regularity. And I&#39;ve done work on political issues, climate change, affirmative action, same sex stuff, where if you get a group that has a conservative disposition, they go whoosh to the right after they talk with one another. If they have a left of center disposition, they go whoosh to the left after they talk with one another. And Kahneman and I did a study with this on punitive damages, jury awards, where if a jury&#39;s mad at a company, they&#39;re going to be super mad at a company after they talk with one another, which helps explain why punitive damages are both unpredictable and often really, really high.</p><p> So that&#39;s the logic.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s take that basic concept and apply it to online, where you have social media and all sorts of trolling activities and you end up with conspiracy theories like QAnon. How should public policy deal with these sort of things between anti-vaxxers and anti-democratic election deniers. This is a genuine threat to the health and safety of the country.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: So back in 2000, I agreed to write a book for Princeton University Press called “Republic.com.” And I had a title, but I didn&#39;t have a book. And I had six months of failure, like unbelievable failure, like either nothing or it was terrible.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You sound like Danny Kahneman.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I was worse than Kahneman because what he didn&#39;t like in his own work, his work is actually good. What I produced in those six months was in fact horrible. I still have it somewhere. But then I thought, okay, the real problem is echo chambers and the absence of shared exposure to things. And then when I thought echo chambers, shared exposures, I sketched out nine chapters and I wrote a chapter a day and I had a book after nine days. I&#39;ve never had anything like that. It was like a frenzy, a happy frenzy of book writing. And that book has now gone through three editions. It was first called “Republic.com.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “Hashtag Republic Divided Democracy In The Age Of Social Media”, that one?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s the very recent one. And it&#39;s exactly on your point. So what should be done by various actors I think is a really hard question, but the existence of the problem is palpable. If you&#39;re thinking about yourself just as an individual, to try to be exposed to diverse ideas is a really good idea. There are apps, there&#39;s one, I don&#39;t know if it still is working, I hope so, it&#39;s called “Read Across the Aisle”, where you can tell whether you&#39;re just reading one kind of thing or another kind of thing. So there&#39;s self-monitoring. I know that some social media platforms have thought hard about how to handle the echo chamber phenomenon, and hard also about how to think about the misinformation problem.</p><p> And there are various things that behavioral scientists would counsel consideration of, including warnings, including reduced circulation levels, including in extreme cases, very extreme cases, taking things down, not through government, because then there&#39;s a First Amendment issue, but through voluntary action. And one size doesn&#39;t fit all, but I agree this is a very serious challenge.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So a different book, I assume, is “On Rumors, How Falsehoods Spread and Why We Believe and What Can Be Done”. It seems like we are very predisposed to believe nonsense if it confirms our prior beliefs. We believe what we want to believe and who cares about the facts?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so here let&#39;s talk about three things, might we? The first is if I tell you that it&#39;s raining outside right now, you aren&#39;t going to think “He&#39;s fooling me, it&#39;s sunny and beautiful outside.” You&#39;re probably going to think “Maybe I should get an umbrella.” So when people hear something, and there&#39;s probably a good evolutionary explanation for this, under ordinary circumstances, they think it&#39;s true. And that truth bias, as it&#39;s sometimes called, is essential if we try to live in a world in which we thought everything people said was false, we couldn&#39;t get through a day.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Cooperative primates in a social group provide a survival advantage, so you&#39;re not inclined to disbelieve someone looking in your eye and telling you something.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely, but truth bias can lead us in really terrible directions, and that&#39;s independent of motive. So I don&#39;t need to want to think it&#39;s raining to think if someone tells me it&#39;s raining, it&#39;s umbrella time. That&#39;s one, truth bias.</p><p> The other thing is confirmation bias, where if we&#39;re told things that fit with what we think, we tend to like that, and we tend to believe it because it fits with what we think. And that can aggravate the problem of echo chambers where people&#39;s confirmation bias is being catered to.</p><p> So if you think the thing is your investment in X is really going great, even though all the indication is that it&#39;s risky, the confirmation, the confirmatory material will have credibility.</p><p> We have recent data suggesting there&#39;s a third thing, which is I think cooler than truth bias or confirmation bias, its name is desirability bias. And it&#39;s like confirmation bias, except it&#39;s different. And maybe I like it because of the phenomenon it draws attention to, because I find it desirable in a way that indicates it&#39;s fun.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So the desirability bias appeals to your own desirability bias.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, it does because it fits with my conception of human nature.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, so a little confirmation bias there, wow.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Both, but let&#39;s pull them apart a bit. So desirability bias means that people believe things if they find it enjoyable to believe them, where enjoyable is a big concept. So it might mean it makes them smile, it might make them feel secure, it might mean it makes them feel pleased, it could make them feel grateful, it can be any number of things. But desirability bias and confirmation bias are emphatically not the same thing.</p><p> You might hear something that fits with your belief, that is like you&#39;re really sick, but you don&#39;t want to believe that because you don&#39;t want to believe you&#39;re really sick. And so if something is disconfirming but desirable, the data we have suggests that the desirable will beat the confirmatory. So if you think the economy&#39;s going to go sour and then you learn that&#39;s not true, you might well be extremely credulous, meaning willing to believe the happy thing, even though it&#39;s disconfirming of your belief.</p><p> So desirability bias means things that please us we will tend to believe, even if they are disconfirming of what we start believing.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really intriguing. What I find so fascinating about confirmation bias is the underlying investment in the model of the world our brains create. I think our brains consume 25% of our daily energy. And so the models we create over time, we are so reluctant to challenge. We don&#39;t want to look for disconfirming evidence because hey, we have all these sunk costs over here to bring up another fallacy. Tell us a little more about how you test for desirability bias and how it manifests in things like public policy.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so let&#39;s talk a little bit about confirmation bias.</p><p> If I believe that the Holocaust happened, if I read something saying it didn&#39;t happen, I will dismiss that, not because I&#39;m pleased that the Holocaust happened, but because I am so clear that the Holocaust happened, that the information that&#39;s inconsistent with my belief has no credibility. So it&#39;s Bayesian. It&#39;s not about motivation. So I believe that dropped objects fall. If a magician comes to me and says, “You know, you&#39;re not quite right on that,” I will think, “Magician, you&#39;re pretty good at your job, but I really believe dropped objects fall.” It&#39;s not about my motivations. It&#39;s just what I start with.</p><p> So a lot of what we call confirmation bias is Bayesian updating, given our priors, we dismiss what is disconfirming on the ground that how can it be true that dropped objects don&#39;t fall? Or how can it be true that Bill Russell isn&#39;t the greatest winner in the history of organized sports? I have actually an emotional investment in that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I was going to say, one sports opinion which is emotion, the other is physics, but hold that aside. So desirability bias, even if disconfirming, seems to have a great resonance within ourselves, why do we think that is?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so that&#39;s about motivation. Desirability bias isn&#39;t about rational updating, it&#39;s only about motivation. Here&#39;s something that pulls them apart, I&#39;m going to give a simplified version of the best data I&#39;m aware of on this, where people in the 2016 election who favored Trump or Clinton also had predictions about whether Trump or Clinton would win before the election.</p><p> Let&#39;s take Clinton voters. If they thought that Trump would win, and then they were given information that suggested Clinton would win, they found it particularly credible. Now, that was disconfirming information. It suggested what they believed would happen was false, but it was pleasing information. It suggested that the information they were receiving would make them smile rather than suffer. And it worked exactly the same for Trump voters who thought that Trump would lose, but then when they got information suggesting that Trump would win, they thought, I&#39;ll believe that. And it&#39;s because it was desirable.</p><p> So we&#39;re just learning about desirability bias. It has an overlap with optimism bias. It has implications for law. So in law, among real lawyers, you can create something pretty funny instantly, which is you tell them, you know, imagine you&#39;re representing the plaintiff in a lawsuit. What are the chances the person will win? They say really high. If you ask the same kind of people you&#39;re representing the defendant, what&#39;s the chance the defendant will win? They say the chances are really high. So you can instantly put people in the role of plaintiff&#39;s lawyer or defense counsel, and that their predictions about outcomes will fit with what they think is desirable, given the role they assumed 30 seconds ago.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So that&#39;s kind of interesting. Let&#39;s relate this to another book, “How Change Happens.” When we look at things, sexual harassment, smoking, white supremacy, gay rights, climate change, seems like there&#39;s been an ongoing evolution. Some of these things are very gradual. Even things like seatbelts took suddenly, I think the number today is something like 10 or 15% of people don&#39;t use seatbelts, but the number was 40% to 50% for long, long periods of time until we started with the beeping to nudge them to do that. So tell us a little bit, how does social change happen? Is this Hemingway-esque or is it continually gradual and not all at once?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Well, okay, so to understand this, we need to have some moving parts.</p><p> One thing is that people have in their heads beliefs and desires that they don&#39;t tell anyone about. So you might think, I think that violence against people of color is pervasive and horrible, or you might think, I think meat eating is a really bad idea, or you might think, I think gun rights are very important and it&#39;s terrible that there are people in the United States who are seeking to disarm the American public.</p><p> Okay, people who think all of those three things at some point over the last 50 years have shut up, thinking if they say any of those things, they will be ostracized or disliked or something.</p><p> Think of political correctness writ large. Sometimes what happens, and this is the first moving part, is that people are given a permission slip. So it might be that a political candidate says, “Black lives matter.” Or it might be that a prominent female actor says, “I was sexually harassed, and if you were too, say #MeToo on Twitter.”</p><p> Or it might be that someone says, “I think people should be allowed to get married, regardless of whether they want to marry a man or a woman, regardless of their gender, and it&#39;s a free country” go for it. And then people will feel licensed to say what they had shut up about.</p><p> And for many social movements, the fall of communism is an example, the rise of the Federalist Society in the United States is another example, I saw that in real time, the success of President Trump, the success of President Obama, for all their differences, those all involved in significant part, people being given a permission slip that they never had before.</p><p> A second thing that matters is that whether we want to participate or endorse a social change depends on what our threshold is for doing that. Now, it might be a threshold for becoming active. It might be a threshold for just voting for someone. It might be a threshold for saying something. And we all have different thresholds and we probably don&#39;t know what they are. So if you think of some movement for something, a lot of people participated in it, maybe the civil rights movement that Martin Luther King helped lead.</p><p> And there were people who had a very low threshold, they were just going to go for it. And there are others who would join if a certain number of people joined. And the thresholds really matter and we don&#39;t know what their distribution is in advance and it has to play itself out. So that happened with seatbelt buckling.</p><p> And the third thing, which is maybe most important, is social influences. So you might buckle your belt if everyone else is buckling their belt. There are other people who won&#39;t buckle their belt if no one&#39;s buckling their belt. I remember a time when if you buckled your belt, you were saying that the driver is extremely dangerous or you were saying that you were yourself really cowardly and timid. And who wants to buckle their belt and accuse a friend of being an unsafe driver or disclose that you&#39;re a terrified, scared rabbit? And now buckling a seat belt doesn&#39;t accuse the driver and doesn&#39;t confess timidity and the social norm changed.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Can I share a quick story? I had Bob Schiller on the show a couple of times and once he had to go someone from here and we took a cab together, I think it was to the New York Times building. And we got into the back of the cab and Bob buckles his safety belt in the back of the cab.</p><p> I&#39;m like, well, here&#39;s a guy who studies behavioral finance and is an economist, I hadn&#39;t really, I always wear my seatbelt when I&#39;m driving, or in the front seat, you get into the back, you don&#39;t even think about it. Maybe I&#39;ve been overlooking this. Because of who he was and all the social proof involved, it changed my perspective on wearing a seat buckle, seatbelt in the back of a car. It was just like exactly what you&#39;re describing, suddenly the whole framework completely shifted.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, that&#39;s fantastic. That&#39;s a great example. And something like that is happening, you know, for non-political issues, for economic choices, for investment decisions. And it happens really fast. So you can see a flood of movement towards something or away from something just because people think that other people are joining that flood.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk a little bit about this book. I&#39;m kind of intrigued by the idea that you started writing this in the 1990s. Is that possibly correct?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That is correct.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: 30 years, I thought you were so prolific. Why so long?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It&#39;s a slow burn. This book is a slow burn. So I thought the idea of how we decide how we decide, it&#39;s one of the most fundamental things of all. And I thought there should be a book on this and I co-authored a paper on it in the 1990s, but I never figured it out until yesterday.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So how has your thinking about decision-making evolved over that time?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I think the fundamental idea, which was developed in a paper with a philosopher named Edna Ullman-Margalit, is that we have an identifiable set of strategies. It&#39;s going to be very intuitive when we&#39;re stuck. So we might flip a coin. We might decide who&#39;s an expert. I&#39;ll trust the expert. We might decide, I&#39;m not going to marry her, I&#39;m going to live with her. That&#39;s like a really small step.</p><p> We might decide that, you know, I&#39;m just going to opt, where it&#39;s not about flipping a coin, it&#39;s not like picking, flipping a coin, it&#39;s like I&#39;m going to do something really big, like jump over a chasm. Or it might mean we might think that we&#39;re going to adopt a rule. No liquor ever, except maybe Saturday night. And if you think about business decisions, each of these strategies is used all the time, sometimes deliberately. The head of a company will say, “Here&#39;s our rule,” or will say, “If we&#39;re stuck, “we&#39;re going to go to this person,” or will say, “You know, it&#39;s a coin flip.” And we&#39;re not as disciplined sometimes as we should be in thinking about these, but that&#39;s the basic framework. What I hadn&#39;t thought through was, how do we decide whether to acquire information? How do we decide what to believe? How do we think about algorithms? How do we think about freedom?</p><p> And these questions, which are all basically part of the same thing, were stirring around in the head and I kind of figured out at least provisional responses to the questions in the course of the book.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So opt, delegate, no, believe are the four big frameworks. But given your background in behavioral finance, let&#39;s talk a bit about biases. how should we contextualize heuristics that can derail our cognitive processes when someone is trying to make a rational decision? Maybe they do, maybe they don&#39;t.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so one bias is present bias, where today really matters, and the future is a foreign country called later land, and we&#39;re not sure we&#39;re ever going to visit. And that actually has roots in the brain, present bias. And we know if we&#39;re making investment choices, if we think what we want to really maximize is wealth this week, that&#39;s probably dumb. It&#39;s going to produce a lot of problems. This is your field, of course. And we might decide we&#39;re just going to adopt a rule for investments which will counteract our own present bias.</p><p> Or we might think in state government, let&#39;s say, that unrealistic optimism is part of the human species. Thank goodness for that. If you&#39;re being chased by a lion, you ought not to think the lion&#39;s faster than I am. I&#39;m going to die soon. You ought to think I can really run. That&#39;s optimistic. It&#39;s probably unrealistically optimistic.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Or just run faster than the guy you&#39;re with, right?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely, completely. And then the lion will eat that other person who is profoundly to be hoped is not a dear friend. So optimistic bias can create problems.</p><p> So we might think that given unrealistic optimism with respect to medical decisions, we&#39;re just going to rely on the doctor. That&#39;s one thing you might do.</p><p> Or you might think if you&#39;re a judge, you might think I&#39;m prone to mistakes with respect, this might be the future, I&#39;m prone to mistakes with respect to dealing with certain kinds of people, let&#39;s call them criminal defendants, and sentencing, I might be biased against one group or another, I don&#39;t even know, and I&#39;m going to rely on the algorithm.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m always fascinated by the sentencing studies that show the longer a judge is sitting on the bench that day, the closer we are to lunch, the worse the sentences are. It seems almost as if they&#39;re not algorithms, they&#39;re fallible humans making decisions, some of which are not great.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, the most fun of these kinds of studies is if the judge&#39;s football team won over the weekend, the judge is more lenient on the next day than if the football team lost.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Amazing.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk about some other influences. We&#39;ve talked about social media and mass media and there&#39;s misinformation is ripe. There&#39;s even propaganda on social networks. How does that impact our decision-making process? Especially if it seems the people most affected are the least aware of these very, very below the radar or not so below the radar influences?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: This is a fantastic question. And here&#39;s something over the last maybe 15 years, when Dick Thaler and I started working on “Nudges” we were, and we remain, very upbeat about the potential use of GPS-like things. to help overcome people&#39;s biases. When I say GPS-like things, I mean a GPS device, it&#39;s a nudge, it helps you get you where you want to go, it gives you the best route. If you don&#39;t like what it says, you can ignore it, so it&#39;s completely freedom producing, or freedom maintaining.</p><p> And then there are other things like a package that says “This has shrimp in it” I personally am allergic to shrimp, so hooray for that disclosure. or you can have something that tells you a warning about side effects and they might be relevant to your choices. These are all nudges.</p><p> Okay, and they are designed to help people deal with their cognitive limits. They might involve a bias, they might involve an absence of information. But we know, and this is what at least I wasn&#39;t sufficiently alert to in 2008, that self-interested or malevolent types can use behavioral biases to manipulate people.</p><p> So you might use present bias to try to get people to buy some product where the long-term economic effects are horrifying, though the first week is going to be pretty good, or you might get people to buy some product where you&#39;d have to be crazy optimistic to think it&#39;s a sensible thing to do because the risks associated with it are horrible, or, and I think this is the most fiendish of all, you might use people&#39;s limited attention to get them, let&#39;s say, to opt into something, which is going to be really hard to opt out of, and once they&#39;ve opted into it, they&#39;re stuck with something that&#39;s going to be very expensive and not beneficial.</p><p> So the manipulation of people, we&#39;re just talking about the economic sphere right now, poses a very serious challenge and social media, et cetera, make this unprecedentedly doable. I&#39;ve worked with private sector entities which are trying to use behavioral stuff to improve outcomes for their customers and their investors, and that&#39;s fantastic.</p><p> But there are others who are trying to improve outcomes for themselves, which is also fantastic, but not if it&#39;s at the expense of the most vulnerable.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned present bias, I love this Danny Kahneman quote, “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you&#39;re thinking about it.” That really says everything. Talk about present bias. In the moment, it&#39;s very hard to let anything else come into the picture. How should we act around that? And how should public policy be set up to not let people&#39;s wetware be taken advantage of?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: No, that&#39;s fantastic. So the only exception to Kahneman&#39;s phrase, nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you&#39;re thinking about it, is that statement. That statement is as important as it is when you&#39;re thinking about it.</p><p> So it might be that policy makers can put on people&#39;s view screens things that they&#39;re not thinking about. So let&#39;s say you&#39;re buying some product and that there are add-on fees of various kinds that are findable but not really there and people aren&#39;t thinking about them. To put those add-on prices on people&#39;s view screens is a really good idea for companies actually to do that and use competition to promote fuller clarity on the part of consumers. That&#39;s a really good idea. I think for securities, the securities laws, there&#39;s a lot to say about them. But insofar as they&#39;re trying to prevent people from falling victim to present bias or limited attention or unrealistic optimism, That&#39;s an extremely worthy goal.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite intriguing. So I love this line in the book, “Get drunk on wine, poetry, or virtue,” in “Decisions About Decisions.” Tell us what that means, wine, poetry, or virtue.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so that&#39;s from a poem by Baudelaire, which is the improbable spirit guide of the book. And the title of Baudelaire&#39;s poem is “Get Drunk.” And for a law professor to celebrate a poem with that title is a little unlikely, but I&#39;m going to own it, where what Baudelaire says by “Get Drunk” is basically take life by the horns and be thrilled by it. And there&#39;s also something about human diversity that what makes you get thrilled, maybe wine, good, Don&#39;t overuse it, but go for it. If that&#39;s what gets you thrilled, or if it&#39;s poetry, go for that. Or if it&#39;s virtue, good works. That&#39;s admirable, of course, and if it also is for you, like wine, hooray.</p><p> Now, of course, we&#39;d want to say, I think, that maybe a little more in the way of good works and a little less in the way of wine is a good thing, but that&#39;s a buzzkill on my part, And the point of this part of the book is when we&#39;re making about decisions, about decisions, think about what makes life fabulous. That&#39;s really important. And I think the behavioral types, including yours truly, often may be overweight a little bit. What makes life long and underweight a little bit? What makes life fabulous? So the first generation of behavioral work is really healthier, wealthier, safer, more prosperous, and those are really important. But also, kind of better days. And Baudelaire, get drunk, he&#39;s all over that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I interpreted Baudelaire as consumption, art, and intellect. Those are the three broad topics, which seem to cover a lot of human behavior. But let&#39;s stick with happiness. You referenced some surveys that show people are less happy than ever, even though by any objective measure, whether you&#39;re looking at crime or healthcare or longevity, except for the past couple of years, post-pandemic, or poverty or literacy, or just go down the list, by just about any measure, Americans and humanity as a whole are better off than they were 20, 40, 60 years ago. Why do surveys say people are unhappy? Is there a problem with the survey? Is it 24/7 social media, or do we just not know how good it is?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s a fantastic question. So let&#39;s think about two things. First, day-to-day experience. Are people thinking, that was a great day, Monday was terrific, Tuesday was good, Wednesday not so much. That&#39;s one thing. The other is not day-to-day experience, but what kind of lives are people having? Are they going to the doctor a lot? Are they learning? Are they being treated with respect? People care about two things that happiness doesn&#39;t capture. One is how meaningful their life is, and the other is how much psychological richness or let&#39;s call it diversity in their life they have. So they might have a meaningful happy life, but they might be doing the same thing over and over again. People don&#39;t like that. A lot of people don&#39;t like that so much. They want to do something else.</p><p> So happiness, meaning, psychological richness. And it&#39;s important to say that day-to-day happiness is really important, but it isn&#39;t everything. Now, with the surveys suggesting that some people in some populations, maybe America is less happy now than it was at a certain point. I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s an expressive statement that pandemic time, terrible, or political polarization, I&#39;m not liking that, or whether instead it&#39;s actually, my life isn&#39;t so good. So I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve gotten to the bottom of what the data actually shows about the happiness part. If it is the case that people actually are less happy, if that&#39;s true, that&#39;s a very serious, not good thing and we want to figure out why.</p><p> When I was in the White House under President Obama, we did, as the government always does do, cost benefit reports, cost and benefits of regulations, and we added stuff on happiness, on subjective well-being. the UK government, they&#39;re very concerned about this. And I do think it&#39;s an important field of endeavor to try to figure out, are people thinking life is great or is it not so great? And is that translated into depression and anxiety, et cetera?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let me push back a little bit on the use of surveys and Amazon&#39;s Mechanical Turk and all these things. So the granddaddy of this in my field is when you are setting up a portfolio for an investor, “Hey, tell us about your risk tolerance. So you conservative, are you moderate? Are you aggressive? What&#39;s your investment posture?” And whatever they tell you is a lie because all they&#39;re really telling you is, here&#39;s how the market has done over the past 90 days. And if it&#39;s gone down, I&#39;m very risk averse. And if it&#39;s gone up, I&#39;m very aggressive.</p><p> Every time I see a survey, I can&#39;t help but think, “How much are you going to spend on Christmas gifts this year? What is the direction of the economy? Are we on the right track or on the wrong track?” I love the surveys right after the presidential election where, what&#39;s the state of the economy? Suddenly the Democrats were here, the Republicans were there, their guy loses, it flips. And then the next election, the same thing happens.</p><p> So what is the value of surveys when people really don&#39;t know what they think, hardly know what they feel, and have no idea what&#39;s going to happen in the future?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s also a fantastic question. I&#39;m doing surveys right now, that is right now, on whether people like algorithms. And so I&#39;m asking people, would you choose an algorithm or a person with respect to an investment decision? Or an algorithm or a person with respect to a vacation? Where are you going to go? or algorithm or a person with respect to health decisions. And I&#39;ll tell you what makes me think that the very preliminary results, you&#39;re going to be the first person to hear it, are not useless. That if you tell people things about the algorithm, which give people clarity on the data on which the algorithm is relying, and like there&#39;s a lot of it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Like the MRI or CAT scans that the algos clearly do better than the humans?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, it&#39;s in the direction of that, what I did. then the percentage of people who embrace the algorithm jumps dramatically. And if you tell people things about the human alternative, like this is a doctor who&#39;s been a specialist in this for 30 years, then the interest in the human being increases significantly.</p><p> So the direction of the results in the survey about which you would rely is consistent with thinking people are attentive to whether the algorithm is just a thing or whether it&#39;s got a terrific data set and whether the person is just a person or someone who has 30 years of experience in the vacation sector, let&#39;s say. So that survey, and it&#39;s top of mind for me because I&#39;m working on it now, seems instructive. And TBD, this might be a book in the fullness of time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I would expect nothing less.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: With respect to happiness, let&#39;s consider three things, shall we? Efforts to measure people&#39;s experience in real time. So like on a scale of one to 10 right now, I&#39;m approximately 10 because I&#39;m really enjoying talking about this. I find that 10, of course I would, but I find people&#39;s answers, how happy are you right now? How anxious are you? How stressed are you? How angry are you? Angry, zero. Stressed, me right now, two. Anxious, me right now, one. And these are all credible in real time. That&#39;s one way of doing it that seems pretty good at getting how people are. If people are in the midst of dealing with a really angry and difficult young child, people will give answers.</p><p> I&#39;m really not having a great time right now. And that&#39;s credible about their emotional state. Then there&#39;s at the opposite spectrum, how satisfied are you with your life? And these are crude because it might be that if people had a really good date the night before, they&#39;ll say, and so, but there is stability on these things and there are within nation differences that are interesting and seems to be telling us something. So there&#39;s a lot of work on whether life satisfaction is kind of crude but directionally informative. I tend to think yes.</p><p> And then there are things in between where you ask people at the end of the day, and Danny Kahneman has pioneered this, called the day reconstruction method. You ask people, “How were you?” This is less demanding for the experimenter than trying to ask people every second, “How are you?” And if you ask people that enough, they&#39;re going to say, “I&#39;m really irritated “because you keep asking me how I am.”</p><p> So Kahneman asks at the end of the day, “How were you when you were taking care of your kids? “How were you when you were on social media? “How were you when you were at work? “How were you when you were commuting?” And the results are pretty credible. People really don&#39;t like commuting, and they really do like, let&#39;s call it intimate relations.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: To say the very least, right.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s the people are very, very positive about that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s quite fascinating. Which leads us to talk about the book you wrote on Star Wars, “The World According to Star Wars.” This became a New York Times bestseller, great reviews. What led a Harvard Law professor to write a book on Star Wars?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: My son, who was six or seven, got obsessed with Star Wars, and we watched it together, and I thought, you know, I like Star Wars. At that point, I wasn&#39;t crazy about Star Wars. And I thought, what is it about Star Wars so that my young boy would go nuts for it when it&#39;s a long time ago?</p><p> And so I got focused on its enduring appeal. And then I thought the idea of writing a book about it was too crazy not to go forth with. And no publisher for a long time had even a little bit interest in it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: So I almost thought I was going to publish it myself as a something. I talked to my literary agent about publishing it myself, which I&#39;d never done before, because I enjoyed it so much. And then at the last minute, a prominent publisher thought, we&#39;ll give this one a try.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We&#39;ll circle back to that concept of people in industries not knowing what works. But right in the beginning of the book, you drop a number that is mind-blowing. The Star Wars franchise has earned $42 billion worldwide. That&#39;s an insane number. How has a movie earned that much money?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It&#39;s probably a lot higher now.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, you have the Mandalorian and Boba Fett and all of the streaming versions and countless, countless animated things. Plus the Disney rides. It really is its own industry.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely. And one thing is that success breeds success. The other thing is that it&#39;s amazing. So the George Lucas ones, especially, I say, apologies, Disney people.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re right with that. You&#39;re okay with that.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Thank you for that. And he did something incredible. So it had a foundation, but he also benefited from a lot of serendipity. That helped.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk a little bit about a concept I love from William Goldman, who wrote “Princess Bride,” and he was the script doctor on “All the President&#39;s Men” and “Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.” just a legend in Star Wars and his concept is nobody knows anything, certainly not about the future, about what might resonate with the public. All the studios originally passed on “Star Wars”, they passed on “Raiders of the Lost Ark”, almost all the publishers rejected JK Rowling. You referenced the Sugarman documentary, which was really quite fascinating. So it really leads to the question, what makes a form of entertainment have this sort of cultural resonance? You mentioned Lucas got lucky. Still, it&#39;s more than just dumb luck. There&#39;s got to be some level of quality there, right?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It has to be great. So another example, I&#39;m writing a book right now called “How to Become Famous”, and it&#39;s about exactly this. And it was inspired by the Beatles, where the Beatles, everybody turned down to the Beatles. They wrote letters to Brian Epstein, the Beatles guy, agents saying, “The boys won&#39;t go.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Guitar music is over.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, and the Beatles themselves said, “We&#39;re in big trouble, we can&#39;t get a record deal.” They became the Beatles. Did they come close to failing?或许。</p><p> Okay, so clearly you&#39;re right, you need quality. But consider the following fact, that John Keats, often thought to be the most beautiful poet in the English language, died at the age of 25. He was very ambitious, he thought he failed, and he put on his grave something like he whose life was written in water. And Jane Austen, maybe the most beloved novelist, was not thought to be the greatest novelist of her time. She wasn&#39;t thought to be the greatest female novelist of her time. How she became Jane Austen is a very complicated story.</p><p> The story of John Keats and Jane Austen is across generations, I think the story of the Beatles and Star Wars within a compressed period where something catches a wave. Now it has to be great to catch a wave. If it&#39;s just someone who doesn&#39;t know how to surf, they&#39;re going to fall. So it has to be great. But what happened with Star Wars, we can talk a bit about the merits, But I think what really happened was social influences, which is not to diminish the amazingness of the “Star Wars” movies, but people wanted to go see “Star Wars” because everyone was going to see “Star Wars.” And that happened early on. So the people thought not to see “Star Wars” is to miss out, it&#39;s like, who do I think I am on this earth not to go see “Star Wars.” I remember that by the way.</p><p> And that wasn&#39;t because it was fantastic, though it was fantastic, it was because other people thought it was fantastic.</p><p> Taylor Swift is a current example. I think Taylor Swift is completely amazing, but her amazingness does not account for the fact that she&#39;s so famous. It&#39;s that people love her. And even people who don&#39;t love her are interested in her or pretend to love her. I&#39;m here to say I&#39;m not pretending to love her. I really loved her. I thought her music was great, even before she was quite what she is now, because Neil Young, who&#39;s one of my heroes, said Taylor Swift is the real deal, and I thought I have to listen to Taylor Swift.</p><p> So this is all around us, and there are people who are not like George Lucas, or not like Taylor Swift, or not like the Beatles, who maybe were about as amazing, but something didn&#39;t happen for them, and we&#39;ve never heard of them, or we will hear of them. Day after tomorrow.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There&#39;s a fascinating section in Derek Thompson&#39;s book, “How Hits Happened”, about how the impressionists were essentially more or less ignored. I think Van Gogh never sold a painting in his lifetime. But one of their members who came from a wealthy family left a whole run of these Impressionist paintings with the edict that left it to the French government and this has to be displayed on the museum and if not, you can&#39;t have them. And very unhappily, the French government did and suddenly it became a sensation. But for that, who knows, Monet, Manet, Pissarro, go down the whole list, may not be part of the pantheon that we look at today.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely. I love Derek Thompson&#39;s book, and I think that&#39;s a fantastic example. So one way to think about it is that the phenomenon of power loss is highly relevant to success and failure, where we tend to think of things as linear with respect to growth, but that&#39;s not true for video games, it&#39;s not true for films, it&#39;s not true for novels, it&#39;s not true for art. It&#39;s a power law, this is very slightly technical for yours truly, the English major, not technical for you, the math guy. But if we understand the phenomenon of power laws and how they work, then we&#39;ll get real clarity on spectacular success, including that of Star Wars.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Very much a winner take all sort of phenomena.</p><p> So let&#39;s bring Star Wars back to behavioral economics. You note in the book whenever people find themselves at some sort of a crossroad within Star Wars, the series proclaims you are free to choose. This is the deepest lesson of Star Wars, which kind of reminds me of you and Thaler&#39;s work in “Nudge” in terms of setting up choice architecture. Was that a conscious explanation?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Well, Thaler and I were very focused on preservation of freedom and continue to be. And some of our friends on the left are mad at us because we&#39;re pro-freedom. That&#39;s probably a self-serving way to describe it, but I&#39;m sticking with it.</p><p> The thought of some of our friends on the left is that we need much more in the way of coercion and mandates, and of course they have a role. But Thaler and I are very big on investor freedom, consumer freedom, America, exclamation point. Star Wars is similar. It&#39;s art, it&#39;s not social science. And as between art and social science, at least my current mood, I go for art. And I love them both, but Lucas is an artist. And it&#39;s his soul that&#39;s speaking. And I don&#39;t know how conscious he was about this, though I can tell you a little story if you want.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Go ahead, sure.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so freedom is the theme. Darth Vader, who&#39;s the worst person in the universe, maybe the second worst, at the crucial moment exercises his freedom because he believes that saving his son is more important than fidelity to the emperor, and he sacrifices everything. That&#39;s his choice, and that saves him. So it&#39;s in some ways a spiritual, even a Christian book about freedom, and this is what makes it, I think, transcendent. My story is that after I did the book, the one person who I was most terrified to see was George Lucas, whom I knew a tiny, tiny, tiny bit. And I was at a big event with maybe 300 people, and there in the distance was George Lucas, and he started walking toward me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Beeline, you see him coming toward you.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, and I thought, he was walking fast, but steadily, and I thought, please God, let Harrison Ford be right in back of me. Please God, let someone whom he knows be in back of me, please God, let him not be walking toward me. But he&#39;s continuing to walk toward me and it&#39;s about 200 yards and now he&#39;s 150 yards away, now he&#39;s 100 yards away. And I thought maybe I can be like some character in Star Wars where I can make myself meld into the floor.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: This is not the law professor you&#39;re looking for.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: No, no, no, no, I thought can I do a mind trick so he doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s me? Or can I make myself really tiny or can I make myself pure liquid? But he&#39;s walking toward me. And then he said the most terrifying words I&#39;ve ever heard. from a human being, which is he said, “I read your book.” And I thought, oh my gosh, what&#39;s going to happen?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Here it comes.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And then he paused and he said, “Without any sense of pleasure,” he said, “I liked it.” And then he said, without any sense of pleasure, no smile. He said, “It&#39;s good.” Then he paused and said, with no smile at all, he said, “You got what I was trying to do.” And then he paused and he said, start to smile. And he said, “But the other books on Star Wars, they&#39;re terrible.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And then he got a big smile and got really happy. And he said, “And you made mistakes.” I loved him so much that he wasn&#39;t going to flatter me, he wasn&#39;t going to say anything, you know, you wrote a good book. But he was as nice as he could be, and he has become a friend. And we talked a bit about the book, and he said at one point, “You have no idea how much work I put into the prequels.” And I said, “Don&#39;t you know who you&#39;re talking to? I wrote a book on this. I know how much work you put in the prequels” and he smiled.</p><p> And then he described one of my alleged mistakes, and I&#39;m not going to disclose what it was because that would be violating of confidence, but I don&#39;t believe it was a mistake at all. I think he was retrofitting something in the genesis of the Star Wars movie.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which he has been known to do.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Which he has been known to do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Very often he engages in little revisionist</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Literary history.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And I think that&#39;s great for a great artist, writer. This was a private conversation where he had no stake in anything, but we argued a little bit. I thought this is pretty surreal that I&#39;m telling George Lucas about the genesis of the “Star Wars” movies, that I&#39;m believing myself rather than George Lucas, and that might have been motivated recently.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Hey, if George Lucas said your book on “Star Wars” was good and the rest of them were not, that&#39;s a giant win. You can&#39;t do much better than that.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I think what he, I like to think-</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s pretty clear that the book, so this is a, your regular books are academic and deeply researched, and they&#39;re not lightweight. This on the other hand is a fun, I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s a lightweight read, but it&#39;s an easy read, and it&#39;s clear a lot of thought depth went into it to say what is the genesis of “Star Wars”, not just the Joseph Campbell man of a thousand faces, but what are the philosophical motivations of Lucas, what is he trying, you know, the relevance about Nixon moving to authoritarian and the freedom, like it&#39;s clear thought went into this and he picked that up.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, thank you for that.谢谢。</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I only have you for a few minutes. Let me throw you a couple of curveball questions, and then we&#39;ll quickly do our speed round on our favorite questions.</p><p> So you were a professor at University of Chicago, where Richard Posner was also a professor. He once was the most cited law professor in the US until you came along. Tell us a little bit about your relationship with Posner.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It was very good. So early on he was a giant and he was very skeptical of some of the things I thought, but he was very engaged and very collegial. So it was all substance, not personal. And I just learned so much from him. His comments on my papers, which he thought were bad papers, were instructive comments and they made them less bad papers. Engaging with his thinking was a gift to me and I think as skeptical as I was of maybe 90% of what he thought, I ended up agreeing with maybe 40% of what he thought and I think he wouldn&#39;t want to think of himself as a mentor of mine, but he was.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s address some of the things he thought of. Law and economics initially was considered fairly radical and an extra legislative backdoor to affect the judicial process. Tell us a little bit about his philosophy, which in small measure he recanted after the financial crisis.</p><p> He said, “My core belief is the company&#39;s own desire to preserve their reputations should have prevented them from doing what took place during the financial crisis.” I don&#39;t know how much of a, if that&#39;s a full recant or just a post-financial crisis, what the hell happened, but tell us about his theories.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: So I think the largest contribution Posner made was to think, what are the consequences of law for people and how can we be empirical about that? So is the law contributing to well-being? Is it leading to economic growth? Is it destroying wealth? Is it helping consumers and investors or is it hurting them? And that insistent focus on what are the consequences of law, that was for me then, and I&#39;m smiling now, it was like a breath of fresh air. When I was in law school, we never asked about that. We asked what was analogous to what? And Posner just said, “What does this mean for people?” In a way that had no sentimentality to it, it had numbers. And that&#39;s amazing.</p><p> Then there was the idea that the common law is efficient. So he thought the law of private property, contract, and tort in England and America just is efficient. That&#39;s how he made his reputation. I don&#39;t think that survived, but it&#39;s not crazy false. It&#39;s not wildly inefficient and it&#39;s pretty efficient. So I think that was a fundamental contribution.</p><p> His kind of Chicagoist skepticism about the role for government regulation and such, I think that was really a third order idea. The more fundamentalist think about the consequences. I don&#39;t know what to think about recantation by him. It may be that just under the spell of a horrible economic downturn, he thought there were some things I thought that weren&#39;t right. But more fundamental was his focus on evidence and data than his thinking that I am a Chicago school person.</p><p> And on behavioral economics, my own focus, he really did shift. And he wrote me a note saying he shifted. In the early days, Thaler and I gave a talk at Chicago in which he was fiercely skeptical and he wrote about behavioral economics in a way that was full of dismissiveness and he ended up being, I think the word a convert is accurate and that&#39;s because he thought the evidence supported it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, when you look at the original pre-behavioral model of economics, the fundamental premise is false. Humans are rational profit-maximizers, we&#39;re not. And if your foundation is false, well, how high can that building on top of it go?</p><p> All right, so I only have you for a few minutes. Let&#39;s jump to our favorite questions, our speed round that we ask all of our guests. And let&#39;s start with what&#39;s been keeping you entertained? What are you either listening to or watching these days?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: There&#39;s a show on Netflix called “Vortex,” which I love, love, love, love. It&#39;s French, it&#39;s about time travel.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, really?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And it&#39;s about romance, and it&#39;s about the economy, and it&#39;s about heroism, and it&#39;s about the future and the past, and it&#39;s not to be missed, “Vortex.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We&#39;ll definitely check it out. Do you speak French or are you just a Francophile or?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Je parle un très petit peu.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Un peu. If you haven&#39;t seen “Call My Agent,” strong recommend. It&#39;s absolutely delightful. So you&#39;ve mentioned several mentors. Who helped guide your career?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I would single out a recently deceased law professor named Lloyd Weinrab who taught a course at Harvard on law and philosophy in undergraduate course, which I took on a kind of flyer and it alerted me to a world I had no idea existed. So I would single out Lloyd Weinreb.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What are some of your favorite books? What are you reading right now?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: My favorite book of all time is “Possession” by AS Byatt. It&#39;s the greatest work of fiction in the English language.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And I reread it every few years, and it&#39;s completely great. Reading right now, John Stuart Mill&#39;s “The Subjection of Women,” which, because I&#39;m writing about liberalism as a political theory and where it came from, and Mill on equality and liberty is relevant, let&#39;s say.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Just to say the very least. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either law or behavioral finance?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Find things you love and focus on them because even if you don&#39;t succeed spectacularly, at least you will have loved not succeeding spectacularly. And if you focus on the things you really enjoy and love, the chance that you&#39;ll succeed skyrockets.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And our final question, what do you know about the world of law, constitution, nudges, sludges, noise, behavioral finance today that you wish you knew 40 or so years ago when you were first getting started?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Well, I wish I&#39;d known about the horror of sludge understood as administrative burdens, waiting time, long forms, in-person interview requirements, things that make it so that if you&#39;re kind of doing well in life, but you need help of one kind or another, it&#39;s really hard to get it. Or if you&#39;re struggling in life, let&#39;s say you&#39;re old or you&#39;re sick, or you&#39;re poor, or you&#39;re struggling, you&#39;re lonely, the various administrative burdens we impose on people, they are like a wall that our society erects often inadvertently. Take down that wall, Mr. Whomever.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Quite fascinating.

He has a great ability to identify a variant perception versus the Wall Street consensus and express that view in a deeply researched market position. As we learned in Michael Lewis&#39; book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393338827/thebigpictu09-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Big Short</em></a> , he had the courage of his conviction to stay with his position even as lots of others opposed it. The result was an incredible performance in the mid-2000s through the GFC — when real estate fell 32% nationally, and the S&amp;P 500 crashed 58% peak-to-trough. Every long-only fund was deeply negative.</p><p> I share that caveat because making a bet and staying with it, is very different than making a forecast. What you say in an interview or tweet out during the trading day is <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2015/01/forecasting-is-marketing/">free marketing</a> , costs you nothing, and is typically forgotten.</p><p> Except when people like <a href="https://twitter.com/adamkhootrader/status/1691397274524631040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Khoo</a> &#39;s keep track of what you have been saying. Khoo looked at Michael Burry&#39;s predictions since 2015 and whether markets followed his forecasts or not. It was mostly “not;” Burry, since famously nailing the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, has been looking for a replay of that era to no avail, making regular predictions about an imminent stock market crash.</p><p> Khoo has tracked the result of these forecasts, and they are not exactly generating Alpha:</p><blockquote><p> On Dec 2015, he predicted that the stock market would crash within the next few months.<br /> ->; SPX +11% Next 12 months<br /> On May 2017, he predicted a global financial meltdown<br /> ->; SPX +19% Next 12 months<br /> On Sept 2019, he predicted that the stock market would crash due to a bubble in index ETFs<br /> ->; SPX +15% Next 12 months<br /> On March 2020, he revealed a massive bearish bet<br /> ->; SPX +72% Next 12 months<br /> On Feb 2021, he predicted that the stock market would crash due to a speculative bubble. Shorts Tesla.<br /> ->; SPX +16% Next 12 months<br /> On Sept 2022, he predicted that the stock market warned of more failures, bottom not hit yet.<br /> ->; SPX +21% Next 11 months<br /> On Jan 2023, he predicts a recession and new round of inflation. Says “ SELL”<br /> ->; SPX +17% Year to Date<br /> On Aug 2023, Reveals Short Positions on the SPY and QQQ<br /> ->; SPX ???</p></blockquote><p> I always want to tread lightly when trashing someone else&#39;s forecasts — it&#39;s not that I am on the other side of the trade, or disagree with any single position, or this or that prediction. It&#39;s the entire idea that you as an investor should care about <em>anyone</em> else&#39;s forecasts. If you want to dive into the why of this, see our archive of <a href="https://ritholtz.com/predictions-and-forecasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Predictions and Forecasts</a> — its a great primer to start learning more about the <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2005/06/apprenticed-investor-the-folly-of-forecasting-2/"><em>Folly of Forecasts</em></a> .</p><p> But this specific set of forecasts is problematic for a very specific reason: Forecasters who make one great outlier call correct a) tend to make lots more outlier forecasts; and, b) these tend to be believed by TV viewers.</p><p> We were reminded of this by Joe Keohane, writing at the Boston Globe in 2011:</p><blockquote><p> “How can someone with the insight to be so right about a major event be so wrong about so many other ones? According to a recent study, it&#39;s simple: The people who successfully predict extreme events, and are duly garlanded with accolades, big book sales, and lucrative speaking engagements, don&#39;t do so because their judgment is so sharp. They do it because it&#39;s so bad . 。 。</p></blockquote><p> In other words, it got <em>good to them</em> . What should actually be a once-in-a-lifetime great or lucky prediction becomes their standard operating procedure. Keohane was writing about Nouriel Roubini, but it&#39;s just as applicable to Burry.</p><p> The takeaway for investors is the same as always: If you are going to put capital at risk, make sure you <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2021/04/purposeless-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know why</a> .

Direct lending tends to provide more conservative risk-return profiles than leveraged loans and high yield bonds. For investors willing to lock up capital and commit for an extended period, direct lending offers access to an asset class with appealing enhanced yield and downside mitigation.

This gives the ruble less value than a single American cent and represents a loss of nearly 40% of its value since the beginning of the year. The ruble immediately plunged following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It saw an uptick at the end of that year but has been falling ever since.

My <em>Sunday morning</em> look at incompetency, corruption and policy failures:</p><blockquote><p> • <strong>The Ghost Fleet Helping Russia Evade Sanctions and Pursue Its War in Ukraine</strong> : Turkish companies have bought dozens of tankers that ship Russian oil.

And… Where&#39;s the SEC?</strong> It reached the point that there were more companies than acquisition targets. So many, in fact, that so far this year SPAC Track says 142 SPACs were liquidated without ever finding a business to merge with. That compares to 144 in all of last year. ( <a href="https://herbgreenberg.substack.com/p/spacs-the-implosion-continues-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herb Greenberg</a> ) <em>see also</em> <strong>Why Most SPACs Suck</strong> : The investing world is as much a victim of Sturgeon&#39;s Law as anything else. Dating back to 1953, this maxim was coined by the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon, who, in response to a critique of his genre made the insightful observation that “90% of everything is crap.” The simple reality is that most human attempts at creation fail, many quite spectacularly. This not as a curmudgeonly observation, but rather, the joyful celebration of how rare true success is.

Debt collection is a fascinating (and frequently depressing) underbelly of finance. It shines a bit of light on credit card issuance itself, and richly earns the wading-through-a-river-of-effluvia metaphor.

Hell, take the rest of the year off!</p></blockquote><p> Okay, a little more snarky than typical Fed communications.

Every Inflation Era Is Different<br /> 2. Lose the 2% Inflation Target<br /> 3. FOMC is Always Late!<br /> 4. Inflation Expectations Surveys Are Useless<br /> 5.
