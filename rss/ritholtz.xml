Weinstein、Woodline Partners 联席首席投资官 Mike Rockefeller、Fernbridge Capita Management 创始人 Brennan Diaz 和 Knighthead Capital Management Co- 讨论了当前推出对冲基金的环境创始人托马斯·瓦格纳。</p><p>跳跃后的成绩单……</p><p></p><p><span id="more-314436"></span></p><p></p><p>我们有一个了不起的小组来讨论在当前环境下推出对冲基金的感觉以及成为新兴经理人需要了解的一些事情。让我从左到右介绍面板。</p><p>迈克·洛克菲勒 (Mike Rockefeller) 是价值 60 亿美元的多头空头股票基金 Woodline Capital 的联合创始人。此前，他是 Citadel 的成功下午； Woodline 于 2019 年推出。是对的吗？有二十亿美元。</p><p>伊拉娜·温斯坦 (Ilana Weinstein) 是 IDW 集团的创始人。它是对冲基金领域的顶级猎头公司之一。她刚刚在公司庆祝了她的 20 周年纪念日。如果你读到被聘用的基金之间的重大变动，他们经常跳槽，Iaw 就是幕后的推动者和摇动者。</p><p> Tom Wagner 是 100 亿美元信贷和事件驱动基金的联合创始人。骑士头资本最近。他获得了英国伯明翰足球联赛和体育场，并有兴趣与汤姆布拉迪一起组建 Pickle Ball 球队。我误读了阵容，所以我要说。</p><p> Brennan Diaz 是市值 10 亿美元的 FirmBridge Capital Firm 的创始人。他来自以前的公司，Viking 他在 2020 年底推出了 Firm Bridge。好，好时机。采用对冲基金的方法进行多头投资。我们有大约 50 分钟的时间。如果最后有时间，我们会看看听众是否有任何问题。但是，让我们从谈论当前环境开始吧。</p><p>从大流行到新的加息制度，这几年是疯狂的。构想当今环境中正在发生的事情，以及在这种情况下管理基金是什么感觉？</p><p>那么让我们从你开始吧，迈克。</p><p>当然。因此，我认为一个主题是，分配者对他们收到的回报质量和他们愿意支付的回报越来越敏感。他们想要的是不相关的 alpha，你采用了这个概念，但是你看看传统的多头、空头对冲基金，他们运行的 Indio 投资组合不到 30%，这意味着这些回报高度依赖于宏观因素，<br />您将受到非常不可预测的因素。<br />我认为越来越多的人认为，投资组合的高区域可以预测不相关的 alpha 流。<br />这就是为什么你看到多经理资产大幅增加的原因<br />这些资产自 2017 年以来翻了一番以上。如果您查看 2023 年推出的一些顶级产品，ILX 和<br />免费的石头。这种趋势看起来还在继续。原因是多经理为客户提供一站式服务<br />分配器，您可以获得高无线电、低音量持久返回流和<br />你可以在一次投资中做到这一点，在那里你可以扩大规模并消除复杂性，从中内置的多样化<br />开始吧。这是正确的。很多让我们谈谈当前的环境。你从人才的角度来看。<br />告诉我们告诉我们你看到了什么。我要缩小范围，因为如果你们都想创办一家对冲基金，我认为我们需要从高层开始<br />我要给你宏，然后我们就快点走。逐个策略。巴里，你和我谈过这个<br />最近。对我来说，至少几个月前英国《金融时报》发表了一篇令人惊叹的文章，其中说这是新闻<br />我。我知道有很多对冲基金，但显然对冲基金比汉堡王多。<br />好的。没错，三万对冲基金。<br />您应该记住的另一件事是对冲的平均寿命<br />基金三年。所以，如果你们想成立一个基金，并且不希望它只是另一个倒闭的汉堡王，<br />您需要了解每种策略中的情况。迈克谈了一点关于长，<br />做空股票。不是像死神那样，而是<br />现实情况是，如果你不是一个多头经理并且你没有积极进取<br />管理市场风险，那么你就属于做多、做空的范畴<br />可能承担集中的、更集中的定向风险的单一经理人。如果你看看这些基金如何<br />在过去的整整两年中，二十一和二十二年的平均表现<br />这些基金的累计回报下降了 40%。好吧，有些基金跌幅高达 60%。<br />比如老虎环球。因此，如果您考虑损失给 LP 的美元，理解这一点很重要，因为 40% 的对冲<br />基金宇宙做多，做空股票。所以我敢打赌，你们中有相当一部分人正在考虑开始做多、做空股票<br />基金。有大量的，嗯，丢失了。所以 Tiger Global 2021 年之前是 10000<br />十亿。特立独行140亿。 1300亿。然后非老虎幼崽喜欢藻类 30<br />十亿。感知100亿。当你平均下降 40% 时，这对行业来说是一个巨大的损失。<br /> 2022 年，超过 50% 的总亏损来自股票多头空头<br />基金和对冲基金清算的一半来自多头空头股票基金。所以你真的需要考虑一下，如果你<br />不要像 Mike 那样属于全 alpha 非相关类别。<br />你提供的价值是什么？宏非常不稳定的返回流。<br />对大多数宏观基金来说，2021 年是糟糕的一年。二二十二年伟大的一年。又是二十三。<br />不是那么好的一年。你又看到 Roe Coast、Castle、Hook Element Element 等品牌基金收取 40% 的费用，能够上涨<br />到 2020 年，收缩并试图阻止信贷负回报造成的损失。一个亮点，但我想我确定汤姆<br />将更多地讨论这个。你真的需要规模才能竞争。然后是多个经理，这将是你最大的问题，因为<br />一个新出现的经理。您将如何在从分析师到 PM 都可以提供一切的范例中竞争人才。<br />他们有规模，有资本，有资源。他们有成为 APM 的途径。他们有积极的回报。<br />他们有经济学。他们就像，就像我的脚趾姐姐。<br />你知道，我们曾经有过小虎崽。现在我们有了多经理幼崽。迈克就是其中之一。<br />他说我喜欢。我希望没事。我同意这种观点。他现在提供战略<br />对多管理人基金的投资。我喜欢 Sit It Out 的两个人<br />Mike 和他的团队投入了资金，他们将推出 20 亿 Brad Stone Grove 和其他 Citadel 人将推出许多<br />数十亿。从 GE Shore 出来的安德鲁·小森 (Andrew Komori) 正以 30 亿美元启动。所以投入战斗。<br />这就是你要进入的环境。而我作为一直在招聘的人<br />在过去的 20 年里，我和我的团队在这个行业工作，我们正在与世界上最大、最成功的基金合作，这很艰难。<br />人才稀缺。他们有很多选择。<br />而且我认为多经理动态只会让它变得更加激烈。所以。所以让我看看布伦丹要说什么<br />对这个。你是小组中唯一孤独的人。做长有那么难吗？<br />只有你如何从你的投资中找到这个环境<br />风格？好吧，我的意思是，我认为迈克向她提出的所有观点都是正确的。我认为整个理由<br />仅从多头、空头背景出发的背后是意识到市场结构正在发生变化。<br />获得短期 alpha 和短期 alpha 曲线的能力正在发生变化，因此以相同的投资风格维持短期总敞口的能力正在发生变化<br />并产生那个水平的 alpha 并没有那么多。所以我有点感觉到投资组合的空头压力<br />空头净值更高，这是绝对回报产品的两个糟糕选择，但与分类账一起看<br />仍然非常强烈地感觉到我们正在访问的 alpha 池，他们看起来基本上是 18 到 18 到 36 个月。<br />所以不是着眼于 5 到 10 年，而是 18 到 36 个月。期待基础业务将获得什么收益和<br />考虑绝对值。内在价值，并在真正有吸引力的机会上集中押注。<br />但是那个窗口不仅像以往一样有吸引力，而且在某些方面它变得更有吸引力。某种程度上是由潜在的空头驱动的<br />市场的长期波动。因此，从长远来看，我不认为只管理是更难管理的。<br />我认为这实际上是物质上的。李智惠比较轻松。这就是我们走那条路的原因。<br />我也认为有物质需求。我认为 Mike 的观点是 100% 正确的。分配者想要为价值买单。正确的。<br />你知道，从历史上看，投资者投资对冲基金并不是为了支付贝塔费用。他们一直愿意支付费用<br />beta 因为潜在的假设是你会向他们提供足够的 alpha 来支付 beta 成本。然而，有大量的<br />世界上想要数据曝光的资本，非常非常大的资本池，总是会有糟糕的曝光。<br />因此，我认为向人们传达的信息是，我将承担赌注风险，我个人希望自己的资本能够获得这一点风险。<br />随着时间的推移，我想要 beta，因为收集风险溢价的 beta 应该是正的。你只在我产生时付钱给我<br />对你有价值。价值被定义为相对于标准普尔指数的超额回报。我认为这与<br />有很多资本提供者。我认为这对像我这样投资的人来说是一个机会，他们认为<br />如果他们愿意，就像我一样出去并继续执行。<br />但是，您知道，您必须拥有正确的模型。你必须有一个真正一致的费用结构，你必须有点<br />愿意走那条路。所以你知道，我认为它在很多方面都是一样的。它正在响应同样的趋势<br />迈克正在谈论并朝着不同的方向发展。所以澄清一下，有些人所谓的活动费用，即利润<br />参与仅在 SPF 通常的回报之上。<br />所以我想说，这实际上更有优势，而且我们的管理费经常是未来的预付款。所以我们必须在我们之前生成Alpha<br />获得任何类型的奖励。正确的。所以这个想法是随着时间的推移<br />基金，这将是一个很长的生命。当你当我们当我们结束时，<br />我们会回头看看。已经产生的 alpha 经济效益的 70% 将流向投资者，30% 将流向投资者<br />计入经理。我们努力使它尽可能干净和透明。这给我们带来了更大的波动<br />在我们相对于其他模型的整体激励费用收入中。但我认为从人才的角度来看这是非常容易解决的<br />谈谈那个。但这是基础模型。十分有趣。汤姆，你如何看待这股潮流<br />环境以及您如何在内部找到信用世界<br />耳机领域？好吧，首先，我要感谢 Barry 让我来到这里并感谢大家参加。<br />欣赏它。你知道，信贷与我们今天看到的和我们投资的所有其他资产类别有关。<br />我们有 100 亿中的一个，其中 6 个是永久资本。所以我们做的不仅仅是信贷。我们基本上可以在任何地方做任何事情<br />世界。我们今天需要信贷，尤其是私人结构性信贷。所以救助融资，过桥贷款，<br />融资是提供增长资本，所有结构都像信贷提供的<br />相对于我在 25 年中见过的风险而言，阿尔法值最大<br />一直在做这个这是非凡的超额回报。那是因为它不是液体。<br />我认为你们所有人或在座的那些正在考虑启动对冲基金的人的一件事是，目前存在极端的推拉效应<br />对于流动性，明显的回报。投资者或分配者没有流动性<br />他们需要产生回报，尤其是在利率更高的情况下，他们的门槛都提高了，而且他们陷入了更老的困境<br />投资，尤其是私募股权。他们可能需要一段时间才能恢复到他们过去产生的阿尔法生成回报。<br />所以他们希望你流动并产生回报。这在今天是不可能的。所以你必须找到适合的利基市场<br />你。我认为我能给那些考虑发布的人最好的建议就是忘记所有的噪音，忘记什么<br />市场想要。忘记 LP ISE 想要什么。做你会擅长的事情。你的策略是什么并不重要。<br />不管你的结构是什么。不管你的费用是多少。如果你相对于发布的任何基准都很好，你就会<br />做得很好。您的业​​务将会增长。你会赚很多钱。你会快乐地退休，你的孩子。<br />如果他们不想，您永远不必工作。你会做的很好。但如果你试图硬塞进<br />不合适的东西，它会变得非常错误。我认为我能给你的第二个最有价值的建议是<br />与您听到的所有这些价值数十亿美元的发射的所有例子不同。这不正常，对吧？<br />这不正常。你可能认为你将以 10 亿美元启动。很多帮助我们开始。我们认为我们将在 2008 年 3 月 16 日推出十亿五。<br />我们刚从新兴经理人会议上走出来，人是完美的。我当时想，这太容易了。<br />然后八周，我们筹集了 15 亿。我们将以 30 亿美元启动，Ken Griffin 支持我们。<br />这就像有史以来最伟大的事情。第二天，贝尔斯登破产了。到我们 6 月 3 日推出时，<br /> 2008年，我们拥有4.13亿元的资金。世界刚刚改变。我们什么也没发生。我们追求的所有投资都是<br />好的。我们的头几年非常壮观。就像一切都很顺利，结果还不错。但第二条建议是你<br />不能指望成为数十亿美元的发射。那么这是什么意思呢？这意味着您必须做所有事情。<br />您最好了解如何设置计算机和电话。你最好不要调试你的电脑。你最好知道如何接听电话<br />礼貌地。你不应该为你的老人煮好咖啡。你停下来。你会做所有这一切。但不要自欺欺人。<br />而且，如果您不将数十亿美元的资金锁定多年，那么您将面临很大的风险。<br />您创建的成本结构与您的资本可能存在的位置不相容，而不是它现在的位置。所以我建议你做什么<br />你擅长并学习如何做好每件事，并且非常非常努力地工作并坚持一段时间。<br />如果你喜欢它，它就会成功。所以。那么让我们来解决这个问题。你刚刚触及了那个子量表<br />操作。当你不能开出巨额支票和<br />你正在运行小规模？让我们从你开始吧。当然。他从不跑任何东西。这还算公平。但是相对来说。<br />是的。它只是为了建造而已。好吧，你知道，有一部伟大的电影于 1989 年上映。<br />所以你可能不知道它，但如果你没有看到它，请感受一下梦想。<br />主角雷·金塞拉，由凯文·科斯特纳饰演。<br />他在他的玉米地中间，他听到一个声音。如果你建造它，他就会来。他不知道这是什么建筑。<br />但他决定在他的玉米地里建一个棒球场。你瞧，一群死去的棒球<br />球员出现在他家并开始打棒球。你应该有那部电影告诉你的心态，那就是如果你<br />建造它，他们就会来。如果您有差异化的价值主张。人们会投资，你知道，这<br />这个小组是一个很好的代表，因为它是所有不同的策略。除了我们，我们都是我们所拥有的，人们忘记的是我们提供的是<br />一个产品。所以你必须问自己，好吧，我为什么在这里？我提供的产品是什么<br />什么样的客户群会想要这个产品？如果你及早投资于你的基础设施，如果你在你之前雇用<br />有资本，没有之后，那我想你会得到那个资本。你知道，我的好朋友布兰登<br />Haley 是 Holocene 的创始人，他在 2017 年有超过 20 名员工没有<br />零零美元。他最终成为了一个巨大的<br />巨大的发布，因为他把这个故事卖给了投资者。所以这就是我会采取很多的心态。<br />不过，迈克，我认为不同之处在于你是。你来自城堡。布兰登来自 said it all。<br />人们愿意在你建造它之前来，因为他们知道你们每个人都代表 ISE，我们作为一家公司非常不愿意。<br />我会的，我会和你坦诚相待的。与新兴经理一起工作，因为事实是，你们中的大多数人并没有以数十亿美元的价格启动。<br />您可能甚至没有以数亿美元启动。鉴于人才市场竞争激烈，真的很难<br />有才华的人会支持你。没有概念证明，因为他们在你身上下了两个赌注，这超出了他们的范围<br />他们通常下的赌注。他们把赌注押在你这个新创始人身上。你以前从来没有这样做过。<br />他们打赌你可以扩大规模，你值得进入战壕并咧嘴一笑，而且你可以成长。<br />我想好消息，不幸的是，关于我的坏消息，这只是一个预测，只是生活中的事实。你们中很少有人会大规模推出<br />如果你不到两亿五千万。其实我认为你不需要担心这个。<br />你们可能不同意我的看法，但如果你是一个非常小的基金，你们中的许多人可能从 2500 万、5000 万或 1 亿开始，你可以聘请<br />初级人。您可以从卖方雇用人员。你可以雇用银行业以外的人<br />他们是多个。我们很高兴能在谈判桌上就座。我也认为这很难<br />除非人们认识你并且之前曾与你共事过，否则事情的另一面是。你是一个好导师吗？<br />你能开发它们吗？你会公平地付钱给他们吗？他们是否加入了具有伟大文化的特殊事物？<br />有跑道吗？这些都是我们处理的所有事情，以帮助人们跨越鸿沟，从他们所在的地方走向一个更大的地方。<br />建立经理并让他们在所有这些方面感到满意。所以那也在那里。如果他们没有和你一起工作过，你<br />知道，他们真的不知道它适合的可能性有多大。而你，反过来，也不想<br />把你并不真正了解的资深人士带入董事会，并且必须给他们大量的基金积分。然后如果你结束它可能不会成功<br />解决实现规模的高级问题。然后我们进入<br />建立一个对你有吸引力的经济结构<br />投资人员。我想说的一个指导原则是，作为一个新基金，这是一件好事。<br />在那里工作的每个人的价值创造速度应该与坐在大型老牌公司那里的大部分时间截然不同<br />价值已经创造。那我的意思是什么？如果我们称之为 25% 到 30% 的投资会得到回报，并且<br />领导班子。这是平均水平，这是一种粗略的想法。但我认为方向性是正确的<br />这里。你应该谈论 30% 到 50% 到你雇用的人的程度。<br />再一次，这是进一步的发展。一旦你有了规模，可以吸引更多资深可靠的人加入<br />他们表现出色的程度，他们可以雇用和培养人才，然后您就可以吸收更多资本并创造更多价值。<br />但归根结底，每个人都会以同样的方式在你生活的一寸之内提到你。 L P 会想得到一分<br />对你的看法。人才也会。这就是您要提前告诉他们的内容，希望这很有吸引力。<br />但更具吸引力的是前进的道路。而且您不希望他们低估您的任何承诺或愿景<br />给他们是因为他们在市场上听到的。所以这是要记住的事情，我认为当你添加两者时非常重要<br />在会议中，短期内可能不会那么多，但肯定会随着你的进步而努力接触真正有才华、成熟的人。<br />布伦丹，你在争夺人才时遇到过同样的情况吗？看看你的旅程是什么样的。<br />好吧，我认为它有点侧重于您正在招聘的人才类型，就像来自我们不雇用的基金世系的世界<br />经验丰富的人，在我工作过的公司中有一种基本观点，即我们雇用经验不足的人，我们培训和<br />开发它们。当你是小规模时，这显然更容易对齐，但这并不是因为规模而做出决定。<br />这就是我来自的世界做事的方式。不过，我认为，老实说，你必须现实地看待<br />你可以花多少钱的信封是什么，它看起来像什么，以及你可以通过它获得什么人才。所以你必须非常友善<br />早些时候对汤姆奎因深思熟虑。我是什么我想做什么？我的策略是什么样的？那个商业计划是什么样子的？<br />从指导和领导力的角度来看，我能做什么？那么它是如何工作的<br />经济角度来看，无论是对天一而言，还是做一个诚实点。随着时间的推移它看起来像什么？经济轨迹是什么样的<br />喜欢成功吗？随着你的成功，我认为你想对周围的人保持透明，第一天是什么样子，什么<br />可以随着时间的推移进化到什么程度，以及触发该进化的参数是什么。我要说的另一件事是<br />根本不同的是，分析师我猜我们所有的公司可能都在做你知道的，他们都是分析师，可能<br />略有不同的事情，每家公司的工作都不一样。而且我认为你想明确你将要投资的方式<br />期望分析师做的事情的类型。那将会有一些公司的自然自我选择，个人<br />那些想要拥有他们认为自己可以在不同环境中或多或少取得成功的人。让我跟进。<br />当您谈论雇用人员、指导他们和塑造他们时。它只是分析师还是交易员和 PMS 以及基金内的其他人？<br />我会说我的一般观点是它几乎是真实的<br />整个公司，当我想到我曾经合作过和过去合作过的成功的公司时，你会看到<br />在那里非常成功的人。他们都不是真正的高级雇员。<br />他们是被聘为资历较浅的人，并接受了培训和发展。公司，在很多这样的公司中，一些<br />他们曾经犯过的最大的招聘错误中，有比这更高级的。我们的流程也是如此。这对其他人来说并非如此<br />过程。所以我认为总是有一种自然的吸引力让你变得更年轻，在训练和训练方面经验更少<br />培养那些人。这只会让我在当前环境中更容易，因为我不是在竞争，你知道的，<br />很多人。但是你也没有将一个完全成型的人注入到生态系统中，可以这么说，在我们的业务中。<br />而且你不使用组织会排斥生物体。它几乎肯定会继续。<br />现在的另一件事是作为一名没有太多资金的新经理。请记住，LP P 正在对您下注。<br />作为经理打赌你。还没有上板凳。如果你只是用少量资金启动。<br />有趣的一点，汤姆。你已经这样做了一段时间了。您在招聘或建设方面竞争人才的经验如何<br />在所有？是的，这真的很有挑战性。我认为，在第二次融资时，这始终是业务中最艰难的部分<br />钱。这可能就是，你知道的，从人们那里分钱。我们有很长的禁闭期，其中很多<br />真的很长。所以这总是最长的过程。但是，你知道，我认为这是一个你知道的，<br />今天这是一个独特的挑战，因为过去 15 年发生了变化<br />那些年，我们奔跑的夜晚。我们是新一代的专业人士，正在进入这个行业或已经进入这个行业，期望很高<br />更早。我想这是你知道的，这在一代人中很常见，比如 25 岁<br />到 30 多岁，30 岁。这很难，因为如果你<br />想想过去 15 年，我们已经 15 年没有经济衰退。真的吗？那意味着你真的不知道<br />你在做什么，因为如果你有。是的，你投资了一年利率上涨。好的，但您还没有投资<br />经济衰退。所以很难找到有经验的人，那些相对年轻的人，他们对如何看待<br />坏事可以。正确的。我们已经了解了更高利率会发生什么，或者我们开始学习<br />更高的利率会发生什么，即使是我或比我更有经验的人也没有与之抗争过。<br />自 70 年代后期以来就没有发生过。所以，你知道，我们看到了新事物。嗯，这意味着如果你有朋友<br />那些没有经历过的人，就算能想象出来，也是不一样的，真​​正经历过。所以管理还没有的人<br />有经验，有挑战，对于你作为新兴经理人，你需要以控制风险和保持员工积极性的方式来做到这一点。<br />这很有挑战性，对吧？当他们相信自己应得的更多时，他们会真诚地认为他们分担了更多的责任，<br />更多的资历，更多的经济。但他们还没有经过战斗测试。这是一个艰难的动态。这是你真正需要成为的人<br />对你的管理方式非常周到。我会说不要屈服于压力，你知道的，找到合适的人<br />明白这是一个过程。他们必须致力于与您一起建立业务，否则它将自行崩溃。<br />我认为我们最近看到的另一件值得注意的事情是对冲基金领域存在一些非常高的成本结构。<br />你知道，8%，8% 的固定成本，这太疯狂了，太疯狂了<br />这不是开办和经营企业的方式。如果您的固定成本明显高于保证费用<br />然后你调整资本损失。正确的。如果你不能建立那个缓冲垫并且你处于危险之中，就像看看<br />你自己就像一家企业，你会投资那家企业，因为你是有限合伙人，你会以同样的方式看待它并说，如果我分配会发生什么<br />这个生意？就像我不想像每个人都在跑门一样。如果我是，你知道，蚂蚁和<br />我身后的大象，今天不会是好日子。所以你必须考虑成本结构，这与你如何<br />管理人员，这与雇用何种类型的人员相一致。所以这是一个多变量分析，我绝对不聪明<br />足以解决。但你知道，对我来说，这是一种感觉，你知道，你可以雇用你认为好的人的类型<br />合身。而且我认为新经理有责任考虑，好的，谁。 Who do I want to have effectively in the<br /> trenches with you? Because I think the reason a lot of firms fail in that first three to five year period is because they build<br /> themselves or they expect stratospheric growth. And the reality is it can be really lumpy.<br />正确的。 You just don&#39;t know. You are experienced a good one. We launched we thought we&#39;re going have tons of capital. We had last the market&#39;s fall off a<br /> cliff and I mean, like felt like really, really off a cliff. And no one. We didn&#39;t expect that.<br /> But we built the business to be able to withstand that. And then we grew.真的。 Rapidly after that, because we set up for, you know what, if everything goes<br /> wrong. So I threw a lot into the mix there. But I think all of these things are important considerations when you&#39;re<br /> hiring. It can go great. You can build your huge success and have it. And that&#39;s fantastic. But the odds are that that won&#39;t happen.<br /> The markets won&#39;t give it to you. The personnel won&#39;t be there, know the capital won&#39;t come in the way you expect.<br /> So if you build a sense of conservatism, when you build a buffer around your business, you&#39;ll get to escape velocity. Really interesting.<br /> I&#39;m intrigued by anyone who&#39;s working for you who was born after before.<br /> If they were born after 1987, they&#39;ve never experienced a recession in their professional career. It&#39;s pretty, pretty, pretty amazing.<br />所以。 So let&#39;s talk a little bit about you mentioned your piece. How do each of you differentiate<br /> yourself? What&#39;s your selling point when you&#39;re either trying to bring in capital or hire somebody or in any other way, make<br /> yourself differentiated from the masses that are out there? Let&#39;s start with you, Mike.当然。<br />所以。 So our view is and was that the successful funds in the next decade are those that will be doubly built<br /> businesses. As Tom mentioned, you know, you have to think about this as a business. And those that can attract, retain and<br /> develop talent with a competitive advantage. And, you know, this past weekend, there was a Formula One race in Monaco.<br /> So I&#39;ll use that as an example, because a durable, successful hedge fund is a<br /> lot like an F1 racing team.正确的。 You have the racers, you have your investment team. That&#39;s the DNA of your business. But without a great car, you can&#39;t win<br /> races. And behind those cars, OK, you have<br /> mechanics, engineers, strategists, teams of people that are helping.<br /> And similarly, the hedge fund of today and for the next decade will be a hedge<br /> fund that has an infrastructure that can support their investment team, allow<br /> them to operate at peak performance, and then run the business of a fund. And that&#39;s a different job than what all of us here as investment managers do.<br /> That&#39;s not our expertise. So you have to have that infrastructure and those experts in-house to help you do that.<br /> And that I think that has been a big selling point for our LP was in the<br /> beginning. But also the talent that we bring in knowing that we&#39;ve built this to last. What I&#39;m hearing from you, Mike, is that<br /> generating alpha, that&#39;s table stakes. That&#39;s just what you need to sit down.<br /> Everything beyond that seems to be where you separate yourself from the crowd.<br />绝对地。 LP want to know that they can put capital in. They know it&#39;s going to be an illiquid<br /> investment and know that they are putting capital into a stable, durable business and that&#39;s what you have to provide them.<br /> When you launch, a lot of you have a unique perspective on differentiators<br /> and hedge funds. Tell us what you see from your vantage point. Well, people come in and they meet with<br /> us and they talk about what they&#39;re going to do. And I will tell you, having seen a gazillion presentations, investor<br /> materials, letters, it&#39;s great to have that stuff on.<br /> Done in a way which obviously you&#39;re gonna put time into it.<br /> You want to feel proud of it, but at the end of the day, my feeling is this industry is for the most part, very commodity.<br /> And the reason I went through the different strategies is to let you know<br /> that to the extent you&#39;re launching a strategy that has not performed well in<br /> the last couple of years, L PS are not going to give you the benefit of the doubt. It doesn&#39;t matter what your presentation<br /> materials look like. It just doesn&#39;t. You&#39;re going to have to put up performance. And the biggest piece of advice I can give you is maybe, you know, you can say<br /> you&#39;re differentiated all of this stuff. You&#39;ve got to start investing as quickly<br /> as possible. You bang the tin cup for capital for the first three to six months. You do what you can and then stop,<br /> literally stop. As counterintuitive as that sounds, what<br /> you want to do is start to prove and show some proof of concept, because unless you are coming from a fund that is a top multi manager or you&#39;re coming<br /> from on ie a great fund that is pedigreed and L PS want more of that<br /> DNA. Like I&#39;ll give you another example. Last year Broadwell launched. That was a fund started by Alex Carnell.<br /> A CAC came out of Deerfield and had a huge reputation in health care and he launched with over 3 billion dollars. So unless there&#39;s something that peace<br /> can seek sink their teeth into in terms of the DNA that you carry, you&#39;re going<br /> to have to show them what you can do. And then, yes, it becomes a question of how do you beg, borrow and steal to fund the enterprise while you&#39;re putting out<br /> performance so that you can then go back to LP is raise capital and also get that talent, because now this Field of Dreams has some skin on the bones.<br /> Brennan, what do you think? What what is the differentiator for you as a long only fund manager? I mean, I think the easy answer is that<br /> we&#39;re a long only had a manager that&#39;s doing concentrated hedge fund like investing and there&#39;s people that do that.<br /> So I would like but the field there is a lot smaller<br /> and the pools of capital allocated against long only there are pretty large as a lot of money can pass. There&#39;s a lot of money in long other<br /> long only strategies. So it&#39;s different than launching, you know, a higher fee product like a long shore product where you&#39;re competing<br /> against, you know, the likes of the world where they&#39;re making those tradeoffs. It&#39;s a little bit different.<br /> I would also echo the idea that my experience and not every allocator is the same allocators want to invest in what they perceive as institutional<br /> scale managers. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you need to have 30 employees, but they want to. They may want to look at as a real<br /> business. They want to understand the plan. They want to understand how you think about the growth of the business, the<br /> contingencies of the business, what your strategy is, how you&#39;re building the culture. Because to be perfectly frank, that I<br /> think that&#39;s the that&#39;s the easiest thing to kind of underwrite from an outside perspective. Always harder to underwrite stock pitches. I find it hard to underwrite stock<br /> pitches if I don&#39;t know the stock really, really well. And so I think you want to you want to invest in that part of the business.<br /> And what that investment looks like is going to be specific to your strategy.正确的？ It looks very different for a motel<br /> manager than it than it does for a smaller organization. But you can still get to that level of institutional scale as a smaller manager<br /> if you if you make it a priority and you&#39;re thoughtful around how that looks<br /> both day one and what your communication looks like for what it should be over time. Tom, what&#39;s your big differentiator?<br /> I don&#39;t think we really have one. No, I think I was a great quote pit bull<br /> that not picking know where random sports investments. Seth Klarman. I read a great quote by him.<br /> I think it two weeks ago and he said, we&#39;re fortunate to be unconstrained by a<br /> specific investment strategy from the group directly. That&#39;s so beautiful, right? Because what are you paying outposts<br /> for? You&#39;re paying them to go out and find great investments where there&#39;s downside protection.<br /> So the way that we present what we do is that we can invest anywhere in the world, really in anything but everything we do.<br /> We take a credit approach, too, which is we have an extreme focus on capital preservation and we try to structure for the best possible return.<br /> Sometimes it&#39;s an equity return or linked return or convertible or warrants so we can gain an equity return. But that&#39;s really the approach.<br /> So every investment that we pursue, we take that approach with the investment that we made in the in the football team in the UK was structured as a as a<br /> secured loan with, you know, the ability to eventually, you know, gain full<br /> control. You know, a lot of the investing that we&#39;ve pursued. Has been structured in that way, and I<br /> think that&#39;s a differentiator because it&#39;s it&#39;s a little different than investing in somebody that&#39;s going to go trade high yield bonds or do public<br /> distrust. And I think the second thing is, at least from my core business, which we started as a distressed debt fund.<br /> The distress that funds just went off the rails. The last 15 years that the way that they operate is they they look at it a<br /> business as a carcass and then approach it to fight over the carcass.正确的。 We look at a business that might be a<br /> carcass and say, can we revive that thing?正确的。 Because if you can, the the pie that<br /> you&#39;re fighting over grows. And that&#39;s a lost art for a lot of investors in turnarounds like different many real turnaround experts anymore.<br /> And that is how you make tons of money, at least in my subsector.<br /> And so I think we&#39;ve done that pretty well. We&#39;ve invested in a few businesses the last few years where we had control that<br /> we&#39;ve turned around. Our biggest short going into the Covid was Hertz. It&#39;s now our largest long we&#39;ve ever had in the history of the firm and it was a turnaround play centered around<br /> electrification. So I think you&#39;ve got again, it goes back to, I said, the very beginning. You&#39;ve got to find what you&#39;re good at<br /> and what you love and then apply it to your strategy and do that. Like just do that. Forget all the noise.<br /> Just do what you love and what you&#39;re good at. And the rest of it should should be OK. And also having a structure that<br /> supports what you do is very advantageous. I mean, I don&#39;t want this to be lost on you. Of that, 10 billion or billion is in an insurance company.<br />是的。 And the up and you have one another for two and a half that&#39;s in drawdown, right?<br />当然。 So there&#39;s no timeline to returning capital. You some of our capital is literally insurance companies. Permanent, permanent.<br /> And then one of the drawdown funds the investor. It&#39;s really like uber wealthy family. When we draw the capital, we never have<br /> to give it back. Now, we don&#39;t get paid until we give it back. But we don&#39;t actually have to give it<br /> back in. Our fee is a sliding. Don&#39;t steal this, by the way, so we can really good idea. Took a long time to come up with this. The fee is a sliding scale based on the<br /> IRR. So there&#39;s this weird push pull because you know, sometimes you do a great investment. You compound at 40 or 35 or 30 for the first 18 months and then, you know,<br /> you&#39;re not going to continue compounding at that rate. You&#39;re probably going to slide to a lower level. Well, we have to decide, do we want to capture the higher incentive fee or we<br /> want to hold it and make a larger point. I always go for the larger, more.正确的。 But the worst thing you can do is try to<br /> live off of IRR. It&#39;s not possible you can&#39;t eat those make is what you want. So that duration of capital is hard, but<br /> the dumbest decision I ever made was pursuing long duration capital. We would be three times larger, four times larger if I had just built the<br /> Cielo business and listened to a lot of em like hired people to do right, do direct lending and do his all the things I tell you to do.<br /> No, but you were like you always had good ideas, like this is what your peers are doing. And you had very, very good advice over<br /> time that I listened to none of. And I&#39;m much poorer for it. Well, but friends at 10 million dollar fund.<br /> So there you go. No, but it&#39;s why I said you&#39;re going way back. I want permanent capital because I just<br /> said we have permanent capital. We can do whatever we want like we could by English soccer teams. Now, what I said we can do. We can make investments that really compound for a long period of time.<br /> And so we focused on doing that. Maybe it was a good decision that maybe it wasn&#39;t.时间会证明一切。<br /> But again, it went back to. That&#39;s what we love. That&#39;s what we wanted to do. But my point being, it&#39;s not just the<br /> strategy, it&#39;s also the structure. You get out for sure created a structure which is like I mean, it&#39;s almost a mini Apollo.<br /> It is. You created a structure where you just charge on Alpha Keys can get behind that. It may be long only, but you&#39;re just charging on Alpha and you&#39;re all alpha.<br /> So and you have all of the DNA from one of the greatest hedge funds in the world. You know, these are things that make<br /> each of these guys differentiated to your question and unique. And the reality is there are very few individuals that come to market with<br /> that skill set and that foresight. So so since I wrote us back that that&#39;s true. Since we brought up L P&#39;s and<br /> Allocators, I want to skip ahead to this question. What&#39;s what&#39;s the hardest question that you get asked by your limited partners<br /> or allocators? What&#39;s the most challenging question they throw at you will start with you again. Yeah, I think there are two hard questions.<br /> One is on the topic of exiting people and you know, that is mostly an<br /> objective decision, but there&#39;s a lot of subjectivity to it as well. And I think, you know, LAPD wanted to be objective and it&#39;s sometimes hard to<br /> explain. Explain some of the background to why we might keep somebody versus versus exit to them.<br /> I think the second question that they ask and we have a tough time with there&#39;s just on adapting any strategy that we have at, you know, LP is<br /> don&#39;t want you to adapt and change the business model that you promised and that and that. And I think that&#39;s. Completely fair. But there are times that are critical in<br /> a fund&#39;s life that you need to adapt or you&#39;ll die and sound money, too.例如。正确的。<br /> So, you know, whatever it may be, that that is a hard question to answer<br /> because, you know, most of the time what they want to hear is don&#39;t change your your path at all. You want to know why?<br /> I do want to. But I also want to comment on what Mike said. I do. That&#39;s true. But when you have however many years of<br /> putting up great performance and delivering exactly what you promised O PS, there is a higher receptivity I think to then whatever you see the pivot<br /> points as I&#39;ve seen this with other clients as well, that maybe started as one thing and as long as they didn&#39;t stray too far from their core DNA, I one<br /> client that is now 50 billion. He was 30 billion two years ago and he&#39;s done it through us thinking through quick other strategies and other<br /> products that are tangential but still related. And he&#39;s got credibility with his piece because of what he&#39;s delivered on<br /> turnover. OK, I just have to comment on this because, you know, like it&#39;s such a it&#39;s the bane of my existence.<br /> And I think it&#39;s one of the biggest problems in our industry. People are terrified, LPC are terrified to fire people, they think somehow it&#39;s<br /> going to reflect poorly on their ability to retain a team, their culture.<br /> Something bad&#39;s going on at the fund. You mean he&#39;s terrified of people?<br />是的。但。 But they&#39;re they&#39;re terrified. Oh. Oh, he&#39;s will think.对不起。 That&#39;s what I meant. Mm hmm.<br /> You have to be. You have to give people room to fail or to succeed, rather give them runway, give them tools, help them develop.<br /> But at a certain point, you need to graciously exit them. If they&#39;re not cutting it because the majority of you will not have a pass<br /> through model.好的。 I mean, that&#39;s just the truth. And you&#39;re gonna have a little problem called network, which is Peter over here.<br /> I&#39;m going to use just simple illustration. His ideas put up 100 hundred million of piano, piano.<br /> And Paul over here. Lost 100 million and you&#39;re zero. And what you don&#39;t want to do was Peter and Paul.<br /> You want to pay from you want to take from this guy to pay that guy. It&#39;s hard to take from this guy to pay that guy because you&#39;re going to end up<br /> losing your best people. And you also don&#39;t want your aides to feel like they&#39;re surrounded by a bunch of BS or worse yet, CS.<br /> So you need to manage people who are not cutting it and give them time to succeed. You need to manage them out.<br /> And don&#39;t worry about about your L PS because at the end of the day you&#39;re going to have a much bigger problem if your stars leave the door.<br /> They appreciate you cutting your losses. If I just want to manage talent the way you manage a portfolio, you. That&#39;s how you have to approach it.<br /> You have to be. You have to be rigorous. You have to be you know, you have to make tough decisions. You can&#39;t worry about anything else. This is the biggest problem.<br /> It&#39;s not just emerging managers, but in general that I see in our industry. And the best founders, OK, are the ones who do this really, really well.<br /> And sometimes, you know, people sort of they get a bad rap for it, but they&#39;re also the best at developing people and giving people the most runway.<br /> It&#39;s about creating an environment which attracts rock stars. On your question. Toughest question.<br /> One of the things you mentioned, Tom mentioned is I how you&#39;re going to pay<br /> for resources. So if you have a 2 percent management fee and you&#39;re in a 100 million dollar fund and you come from a fund, we&#39;re<br /> used to having tens of millions of dollars spent on research and software and data and corporate access. You have to answer the question to<br /> appease as to how you&#39;re going to fund that. You can&#39;t have you touched on this? You can&#39;t have 100 million dollar fund<br /> to meet a 2 percent management fee. And then one million dollars spent on<br /> fund expenses because that&#39;s a 3 percent drag on returns out of the gate. And it&#39;s even higher if you&#39;re if you&#39;re less.<br /> And the answer to that question really has to come back to how are you special?好的。 You don&#39;t need all these data sources.<br /> I&#39;m going to do X. I&#39;m going to do really well. And here&#39;s what I need. And be very precise about what you&#39;re<br /> bringing to the table and the resources you need to support that. The reality is you&#39;re not competing head on with these funds that spend tens of<br /> millions of dollars or even hundreds of millions of dollars on research. Brendan, what&#39;s the toughest question you get asked by potential employees?<br /> Let&#39;s say during the fundraising process, for me, the toughest is always what what your target that you&#39;re going to raise, to which my answer is I have<br /> no idea. You tell me.我们拭目以待。 I&#39;m going to launch it and we&#39;re gonna see what it is and it&#39;ll be what it is. Now, I would say that you&#39;re the hardest<br /> question. I always it&#39;s a little bit like last question. How do you how do you differentiate yourself versus other funds? Because I always inherent in that<br /> question is you have to know what that other fund is doing. And like I am a strong believer that unless you&#39;re in the walls and you&#39;re<br /> left, you understand exactly how the investment process works. It&#39;s really hard to compare yourself to another fund. And so I try to turn it back to this. Know, this is how we invest.<br /> This is how we do things. You compare that to the other people you kind of see in the market. But during the fundraising process,<br /> we&#39;re going to everyone in this room that&#39;s about to go through it. You know, the how what you what what what your target for raising.<br /> I always found somewhat amusing because I don&#39;t think anybody really knows until the last minute. Tom, how about you?<br /> I&#39;m looking for a doozy for it. I love the question. What do you see as the great opportunities over the next six months?<br /> You&#39;re literally like, really the answer to that question. I wouldn&#39;t need you as an LP to be retired, like managing my own money to<br /> someone else to be a manager in one office. I&#39;d be a professional fly fisherman, you know, like March know, 60, 20, 0 8.<br /> No one knew that. We&#39;re about to embark on the greatest run in distressed financials we&#39;ve ever seen.正确的。 September 10, 2001, no one knew there&#39;d<br /> be a huge opportunity in airlines. You know, just kind of go through history like you just don&#39;t know. So I think my answer to this question.<br />真的吗？ And playing off a little bit of the other comments is. Don&#39;t worry about what the LPC think.<br />好的。 Just say what you do, what you believe is right for generating returns. Because I&#39;ll tell you, particularly as a<br /> distressed investor. The fees are always wrong. Always like very, very rarely do we make a new investment and make people go,<br /> wow, that&#39;s great. Usually the like, oh, my God, really? Like, you really think that&#39;s a good investment?是的。 Like this.<br /> What&#39;s going to happen? Like, oh, my God, he&#39;s lost his mind. So I think you have to balance the fact that your the asset manager, you&#39;re the<br /> business builder. Just be honest.正确的。 And stick to your your strategy.<br /> But don&#39;t get swayed by what the crowd thinks. That&#39;s that&#39;s a surefire way to fail. Let&#39;s stay on that ends of the panel for<br /> this question. Tell us the biggest surprise or lesson learned over the years. What really sticks with you?<br /> I&#39;m still doing it now. I think the fact that I like it so much.是的。<br /> I came from you know, I was on a sell side trading floor with a thousand people. And it was sort of like, you know, very<br /> collegial. Lots of interpersonal reaction, interaction. Very loud, boisterous.<br /> I loved that and thrived in it. I know it&#39;s super surprising. And the you know, when you go to run your own firm and you start kicking,<br /> you&#39;re small. It&#39;s just totally different. And I wasn&#39;t sure that it would give me the same level of satisfaction that<br /> we&#39;ve that I get energized every day. It&#39;s been way better. You know, afros gone. I lost all my hair, which probably is a<br /> stress levels up, but it definitely has been a pleasure and far exceeding what I ever anticipated.<br /> Brendan, what&#39;s the biggest lesson or biggest surprise that you learned over the past few years? I think the biggest surprise and I think<br /> it&#39;s not intellectually a surprise, but it&#39;s a little bit like having kids. You don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like until you&#39;ve got them.<br /> If you&#39;ve worked, if your background is working in other funds, working with other people, you have peers, you work with other people who appear as if<br /> something&#39;s going wrong. Complain to those peers when it&#39;s yours, it&#39;s you and the way you behave, the way you act and who you<br /> talk to in all matters because you&#39;re setting the culture of the entire organization. And that&#39;s you know, the thing Jim<br /> Parsons, who who I worked with before told me before I started with the highs are higher and lows are lower and you kind of feel it more internally<br /> in the ability to socialize it out is less there. And so it&#39;s one of those things. It&#39;s not obviously I&#39;d say that I think<br /> I run the room. But again, the. Of course it is. But until you go through it, you don&#39;t<br /> know what it&#39;s like. And again, highs or higher lows are lower. I think it nets out to being awesome.<br /> But prepare yourself for that and prepare yourself that it&#39;s different and how you behave matters. Alina, you&#39;ve seen you&#39;ve seen so much<br /> from your vantage point. Tell us, what would the biggest surprise was for you? Well, we&#39;ll save the biggest lesson for<br /> the last question. But now what what really was like, I just want to answer it this way. I mean, it nets out that it&#39;s awesome<br /> when you&#39;re successful. But the the common the most common thing I hear. I mean, I get this literally at least<br /> once a week from real managers. These aren&#39;t guys who couldn&#39;t cut it. These are guys who got to at least two, three, four hundred million.<br /> They had actually good returns even with the volatility of the last couple of<br /> years. And they are they&#39;re closing shop. And you just need to be aware of this or they&#39;re just not having fun anymore.<br /> You talked about having fun and loving it. You go into this business for you go into the idea of starting a fund.<br /> You&#39;re all emerging managers for two reasons. You believe in your strategy and you want to put it out into the<br /> world with your own imprimatur. And what you don&#39;t really realize or maybe you realize it, but yes, like the cabin having kids analogy, it&#39;s not<br /> until you&#39;re in the seat that it&#39;s really tangible. These two things, investor and entrepreneur.<br /> These two hats you need to wear are actually in conflict with each other and<br /> every moment you spend, particularly as a new manager, not investing and many of<br /> you will not be able to afford out of the gate the same infrastructure that these guys could see you&#39;re gonna get pulled into.<br /> Each are issues and legal issues and administration issues. And God, you&#39;re gonna be dealing with LP sometimes 100 percent of your time and<br /> you&#39;re going to be trying to put up great performance. And that&#39;s exhausting and it&#39;s sad, but there are many.<br /> I just have to tell the truth. There are many examples of individuals<br /> who got to a point where one might call them successful. They&#39;re running hundred million five hundred million.<br /> I have one guy who&#39;s running a billion and a half. His returns have suffered because of the distraction or they&#39;re just not having<br /> fun anymore because the thing that got them into this in the first place was a love of investing. And they find themselves actually<br /> focused on a whole host of other issues, which really are not how they want to spend their time. So if this is what you really want to do<br /> and it&#39;s an itch you want to scratch, you should go do it. But to the extent what you really want to do is have autonomy, invest, had<br /> scale out of the gate, have great resources and not that fast necessarily about all the rest of it. We should have that conversation.<br /> And if you do launch and you launch successfully, we&#39;ll have that conversation, too. Mike, what was the biggest lesson,<br /> biggest surprise to you? Yeah, you know, and Bear, you asked this question when I was on another panel with you a couple of years ago.<br /> An interesting article. Interestingly, it&#39;s the same answer. And, you know, this is a talent driven business.<br /> And what&#39;s been most surprising is the compounding effect of great talent. You always think about it in financial terms, but people who hire great people<br /> and keep the bar high, it&#39;s amazing what it does to your business. And so that&#39;s been the biggest surprise continues to be.<br /> So we&#39;re just about out of time. We don&#39;t have time for audience questions. But let me just throw one last question.<br /> Ten second response from each of you, and we&#39;ll start with Tom.<br /> One piece of advice for someone about to launch a new fund. Just as I said earlier, do you love surround yourself with people that you<br /> that you really want to work with and stay true to your initial objectives,<br /> one of which has to be to work as hard as you possibly can?正确的。 Yeah, I would. That kind of a corollary that I don&#39;t don&#39;t try to sell people on what you<br /> think that you want to hear. You have to come to market with a perspective. You have to have a strong point of view.<br /> And that either works or it doesn&#39;t. And that&#39;s the bet you have to kind of underlying make. But it won&#39;t work if you try to go if<br /> you try to shoehorn it into something that it&#39;s not. Alana, take your time. With respect to hiring people, build<br /> this on the right way. LP is would rather see a longer and slower ramp and off with respect to optimizing your investment team and your<br /> non investment team and performance. First, focus on putting up the numbers.<br /> Final word. Mike, what do you got? I have to say, in honor of the late Sam Zell who said this, go for greatness<br />可以？ Mike Rockefeller, ILana Weinstein, Tom Wagner, Brendan Diaz, thank you so much for your time and your insight and<br /> gratitude.谢谢。</p><p></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/06/masters-in-business-the-emerging-manager-playbook/">Masters in Business: The Emerging Manager Playbook</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com">The Big Picture</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded></item><item><title> Transcript: Ramit Sethi</title><link/> https://ritholtz.com/2023/06/transcript-ramit-sethi/<dc:creator><![CDATA[Barry Ritholtz]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 12:00:04 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[MiB]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://ritholtz.com/?p=314561 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p>﻿   The transcript from this week&#39;s, Ramit Sethi on Living Richly, is below.

Ramit Sethi is a fascinating guy with really an amazing and fascinating career, starting out studying psychology and a little bit of finance at Stanford. He started a blog, which eventually became a podcast and a book, and is now a Netflix series. Depending on the platform, it&#39;s either “I Will Teach You to Be Rich,” the book, or the Netflix show “How to Get Rich.”</p><p> And it&#39;s not rich in terms of how to pile up money, but rather how to live a rich life by treating money as a tool to do the things that you want to do. That&#39;s one part financial freedom, one part prioritization of your life, and one part less stress and worries about financial matters. It&#39;s really a very thoughtful and intelligent approach to thinking about spending. And I found the conversation to be really interesting.</p><p> I&#39;ve chatted with Ramit before. I think he&#39;s really a fascinating guy, and I&#39;m glad we finally managed to get him in to the studio for a podcast. The show on Netflix is really quite interesting, and his just whole approach is intelligent and joyful and really very pleasant as opposed to the usual spending scolds who make money like a drudgery in a bore. He&#39;s not like that at all, which probably accounts for a lot of his success. He makes what is otherwise a potentially challenging subject very interesting.</p><p> I found this conversation to be delightful, and I think you will also.</p><p> So, with no further ado, my sit-down with Ramit Sethi teaching you how to live a rich life.</p><p> Ramit Sethi, Founder and CEO, I Will Teach You to Be Rich: Thanks for having me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, good seeing you again. Good to have you. So, before we get into the Netflix series and the book, let&#39;s talk a little bit about your background. You get a scholarship in high school, you put it in the stock market, and immediately lose half. How do you lose half of your money that quickly?</p><p> SETHI: Well, everybody thought they were a genius including me in 1999, 2000. Kind of sounds familiar to all of our crypto friends from the last few years. So, I was sitting there reading Industry Standard, remember that magazine?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> SETHI: And all these this media about how the stock market was going up 15 percent a week.所以…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Forever.</p><p> SETHI: Trees grow to the sky.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> SETHI: Always, and so I said, cool, I&#39;m going to get in on this, and I took the first scholarship check which they sent to me, that&#39;s usually not how it works, they usually send it to the school.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: And you know, for a 17-year-old kid, that&#39;s a lot of money I put in the stock market, and I lost half of it within weeks. And in retrospect, that was probably one of the best lessons I ever got.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You know, if you step into a casino and the bells and lights go off and you win money, you&#39;re screwed the rest of your life.</p><p> SETHI: Cause you think you&#39;re a genius.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, how hard is it?</p><p> SETHI: So, then I end up going to college. I had other scholarships that paid my way through, which was very fortunate. And I was learning about money, reading all the books, all the magazines, watching the shows, and I was also studying social psychology. So, I was studying human behavior, persuasion, and I was really, it reminded me of that book “The Emperor Has No Clothes” because the advice that we all get about money, for the last 30 plus years, makes no sense if you understand psychology. And that&#39;s when I started to develop my own philosophy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And let&#39;s talk a little bit about that academic study. Stanford BA Information and Society with a minor in psychology, a master&#39;s in social psychology and interpersonal processes. It sounds like you knew exactly what you wanted to do from a fairly early period in your life.</p><p> SETHI: No, I&#39;m not so sure. I think, you remember that famous Steve Jobs commencement address?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The speech, sure.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Absolutely.</p><p> SETHI: That was my graduation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Get out.</p><p> SETHI: Yes. So, he said, you often can&#39;t tell where you&#39;re going until you look backwards, and you connect the dots.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Makes sense.</p><p> SETHI: And I found that to be profoundly true for me when I was in college, I was super interested in why we do the things we do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: For example, why do we all talk about, you know, I should probably go to the gym a little bit more, but we don&#39;t. I find that profoundly interesting because we sometimes will say it&#39;s about money, it&#39;s about time, but deep down there are deeper reasons and so being at Stanford and being able to study a science technology and society and psychology and sociology, that really allowed me to understand more of why we do what we do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really interesting. I&#39;m trying to remember the date. I think it&#39;s January 19th is when the average New Year&#39;s resolution has been broken.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, there&#39;s some — you know it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s some nuance, I think, to New Year&#39;s resolutions, I used to be kind of like scornful. Ah, you know, the gym piles up and then it empties out. Now I think I&#39;ll take any opportunity where people are motivated to change. And if it is a 20-year high school reunion, if it&#39;s January 1st, doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> SETHI: Will most people flush out? Probably. But there&#39;s a few who will make it meaningful for them and commit to it. And for me that&#39;s a win.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, I&#39;m skipping ahead a little bit, but you write a lot about instead of focusing on goals focusing on processes, clearly psychology helps there too it&#39;s easy to make a small change in how you do things as opposed to this immense, hey I really want to be jacked for my 20th reunion.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, one of the most interesting emails I got from my newsletter subscribers was a woman who wrote me and said, you know, you talk about going for a run or going to the gym, and she goes, I have told myself that I want to go for a run five times a week for years, and I never do it, and I just wrote back to her and I said …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Go for a walk.</p><p> SETHI: … why don&#39;t you go once a week? And her response was so fascinating. She said, why would I do that, that will make no difference. I find that extremely fascinating, she would rather — yes, she would rather dream about going five times a week then actually go once a week, and so many of us do this with our money. We&#39;d rather dream about having 10 million then start investing $100 a week.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Perfect is the enemy of the good, isn&#39;t it?</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really fascinating. So, you start the blog in 2004, more or less.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, while I&#39;m in college.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You were an early adopter, as was I. How did that evolve into a book?</p><p> SETHI: The blog was not some master genius stroke. It was my frustration because–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Come on, tell the truth. You&#39;re like, I&#39;m going to blog for 20 years and then Netflix is going to come along.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Netflix, which didn&#39;t even exist.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: By then it was just DVD by mail.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, so okay, I was trying to teach my friends in college about personal finance. We&#39;d be sitting around the dining halls, someone would be complaining about their fourth overdraft fee, and I would go, hey, you should just come. I have this one-hour presentation I do on money. And they were like…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wait, this is in college you would do this? No kidding.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and so they would go, yes, that sounds really cool. And they would never show up.</p><p> Another fascinating peculiarity of human behavior, when it comes to money events, most people hate them because when they physically go they feel bad, and the older you get, the worse you feel, because you feel, I should have learned this earlier, my friends were 20 years old, and they already felt like they were behind imagine a 45, 55 year old at a 401k seminar, they don&#39;t want to go. So I did this for a year and a half nobody virtually nobody came like 10 people, and I finally said, I was a cocky college kid, I go, you know what the world needs to hear what I know. But they were certainly not listening. So, I started a blog.</p><p> I said, maybe these lazy college kids will read it from their dorm. And that actually turned out to be exactly right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, was there ever an actual job out of Stanford or did the blog lead to?</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Tell us about your first gig.</p><p> SETHI: So, I had some internships in college and then when I graduated, I accepted an offer from Google actually. And they said, you should take some time. You know, you&#39;ve been in school for a long time.</p><p> I said, yes, I plan to. I&#39;ll be talking to you guys in three months. So, I took the summer off. One of my buddies said, “Hey, I&#39;m starting this thing. Why don&#39;t you start it with me?” So, I started this little collaboration company with my friend. We were co-founders. And it sort of blew up that summer. And I ended up saying to Google, “I really appreciate you guys, but I think I&#39;m going to stick with this.” And I was at that company, which was an online collaboration company, for several years, till about &#39;09.</p><p> Meanwhile, I was doing my blog on the side, and it was just getting bigger and bigger.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Whatever happened with the collab company?</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s still around, it&#39;s still around.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There was no big exit, you didn&#39;t ring the bell and say?</p><p> SETHI: No, there was no exit, we were not here at Bloomberg. It was sort of earlier than Google Docs, and it was a Wiki, now it&#39;s sort of pivoted into B2B.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Kind of interesting, so you&#39;re working on the blog since &#39;04, somewhere along the lines there&#39;s a self-published eBook or something like that?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, around 06, 07 I said I want to see if anybody on the internet will actually pay for anything, I had not made a cent from the blog. It was just me doing it as a hobby. So, I created this eBook and I decided to sell it for $4.95 cents, and I was very terrified, it&#39;s like any artist who&#39;s ever sold something.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure. It&#39;s validation.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and like what is the world going to think? I had such low confidence that I didn&#39;t even set up a distribution system I just said when the receipt comes in through PayPal, I&#39;ll manually attach it to an email because I thought 50 people would buy it, two interesting things happened first I was terrified of people calling me a sellout because back then to me selling something was sort of the antithesis of creating value and I actually did get called a sellout, I had people who had been reading me for free for years who turned and they said “Oh so it&#39;s I will teach Ramit to be rich.”</p><p> And that really hurt. When I think back to some of the most painful moments over a 20-year career, that is definitely one.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Because everything in the world is free. You should work for free. Media subscription should be free. Nobody should ever pay for anything.</p><p> SETHI: Correct. And if you do, you&#39;re trying to get one over me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re a sellout. I&#39;ll tell you something funny and people you know, we never quite had that accusation, but for the better part of 15 years before I started accepting capital, it was, “Hey, everybody&#39;s telling you how to manage your assets the wrong way. Here, you could do it yourself. Here&#39;s the right way to do it. You could do it. It takes a little discipline, a little time, and very little money. Manage it yourself.” And to my chagrin, people started saying, “Hey, I like the way you think, but I don&#39;t have time for this. You take my money.” “No, no, don&#39;t you understand? This is all about you can do it yourself.” “I&#39;m busy. You do it.” All right, and that&#39;s how a business was born, but I don&#39;t look at that as selling out. I don&#39;t look at what you did as selling out. $5 is not going to kill anybody.</p><p> SETHI: Exactly, and you know if they didn&#39;t like it I refunded them. That was what was fascinating.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Money-back guarantee on the, wow.</p><p> SETHI: And then the second thing that was fascinating to me was I had a small cadre of very loud vocal people who were angry. But…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: that&#39;s true on every website.</p><p> SETHI: Exactly, but the people who bought, I could see their statistics. Their open rates on my emails were quadruple the rate of everybody else. They email me saying, hey, this was great. When are you creating the next thing? I sat there looking at the data, looking at the emails, and I go, wait a minute. There&#39;s something qualitatively different about buyers and non-buyers. That led to the next three or four years of learning how to sell, how to create value, and not worry about selling out, but do it in a very ethical way. Do it my way.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And did the eBook eventually lead to “I Will Teach You to be Rich” the book?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, I think I became more comfortable. I think one of the biggest mistakes people make when thinking about writing a book is doing it too early. I waited until I had my philosophy dialed in. I treated my blog like an experimental lab. So, I tested it with different incomes, different industries, different geographies. By the time I wrote it, I knew what I was going to say.</p><p> And so that came out in March &#39;09, which actually happens to be the bottom. I&#39;m the bottom. But I remember going around, here we are in Manhattan, I remember going on book tour, and this book came out and a few months before my publishers had sort of sent me a note, are you sure that this information is still relevant because of what&#39;s going on? I go, good information has nothing to do with time. If anything, it&#39;s even more relevant because now low cost, long term investing makes sense, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p> So, I go on book tour to 13 cities and in every city, I&#39;m sitting in the green room waiting for a news director to come out and they go, we&#39;re not going to talk about investing today. I go, what? And they go, there&#39;s 10 percent unemployment. People just want to know how to get by. And I looked at them and I thought to myself, we&#39;ll talk about that. There&#39;s definitely some ways to save money.</p><p> But that also means the majority of people are employed and everybody knows that at some point the market will come back and they want to position themselves.</p><p> So, they just looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at them like, I don&#39;t really care what you say. I&#39;m going on air, I&#39;m going to say what I want. And I think that has been true since 2009 until now. Every time I do media, the predominant question is, times are tough, things are crazy, how do we get by?</p><p> And I go, I simply don&#39;t accept the premise anymore.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: I go, wait a minute, first of all, in certain areas, things are better than ever. Second, regardless of what we&#39;re talking about here, there are ways to get ahead and actually make money fun.</p><p> So, I&#39;m just not going to indulge the idea that money has to be purely a nuisance, purely an annoyance. No, let&#39;s start off by talking about how money can be amazing and joyful and create a rich life.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really love that. And I have to start out with a confession. When this book first came out, I hated the title.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I thought it was just another get rich quick scheme, some sort of nonsense, and it was one of the guys I worked with that said, no, no, that&#39;s not what this book is about. You got to read it. So I started thumbing through it and I&#39;m like oh this is not about getting rich, this is about figuring out what money as a tool can do for you and how to use it properly, it&#39;s a very different headspace than most of the here&#39;s how to invest and get rich.</p><p> What led you to that sort of approach and that title?</p><p> SETHI: Well, I was sober when I chose that title, okay? I want to — I was a college kid, and I named my website I will teach you to be rich. I always have loved provocative names. I do love being ultra-clear about what I&#39;m going to promise. I have these digital programs. One of them is find your dream job. It&#39;s very clear what you&#39;re going to get.我喜欢。</p><p> But I will say that I&#39;m not offended by what you said because if you go and read it, there are people who talk about the book. I feel very fortunate that people spread the word a lot and they will almost always introduce it in the exact same way.</p><p> They&#39;ll go listen …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Ignore the title.</p><p> SETHI: They go, this book, it sounds like a scam, but “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” is actually really good and that&#39;s fine with me when you hear that title, I love a big promise, but what I love even more is over delivering on it.</p><p> So, it&#39;s not just about getting rich. It&#39;s actually about being rich, and being rich means not it means how to earn money, it means how to talk about money and even how to spend money all of those things including managing money are part of a rich life.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, let&#39;s delve deeper into the concept of a rich life. I love this quote. a rich life is lived outside the spreadsheet. explain that.</p><p> SETHI: Well, there&#39;s too many nerds probably half the people listening to this who love their spreadsheets, hey guys, do you want to do an amortization table? You want to do a Monte Carlo analysis? And they do that for 35 years tweaking numbers I go you won, you won the game. It&#39;s fine, turn the page on your life and go to the next chapter.</p><p> Once you have your asset allocation dialed in, your automatic contributions dialed in, all the basics, then you can move on. And part of that involves designing your rich life. Let&#39;s talk about that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes, I really want to get into that because when we talk about the show, that really is a focus and you really kind of rocked some people back on their heels and make them address things they don&#39;t want to address. I&#39;m assuming that the blog and the podcast led to a lot of those interactions that ended up in the book.</p><p> SETHI: 100 percent. Yes, the blog gave me a lot of raw material because I had a chance to talk to people at different incomes, et cetera. You know, a rich life, most people expect a money book to start with a chapter on budgets. That&#39;s virtually every money book. And that is, in my opinion, a total turn off.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Buzzkill.</p><p> SETHI: Okay, some average person opens up a book. They&#39;re already feeling nervous judge. They open up the first chapter that author says, okay here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. We&#39;re going to get a budget. Everybody hates the word budget. I hate budgets myself. I don&#39;t keep one and now you&#39;re going to go through the last 12 months of spending which are not conveniently found anywhere, you know, you did it wrong, but I want you to go and spend the next 20 hours writing this stuff down just so you can be judged.</p><p> It&#39;s like, no thanks, I&#39;m going to put this right back on the shelf.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: So that is a lack of understanding psychology.</p><p> What I did with the book was to understand where do people want to start? Let&#39;s get them a quick win. Number one, everybody has credit cards, everybody misunderstands how to use them, and there are actually some secret perks that people have no idea about. Let&#39;s get you a quick win. You got a late fee? Read these words off the page. In fact, here&#39;s the phone number you call, and you will get your $37 fee waived. People do that, they don&#39;t believe it. And they do it, they go, oh my god it worked. And like that they realize they&#39;re on board, I can take control of my money, not let every financial company control me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes, I was genuinely shocked and again the Netflix series is in my head. People have 18 credit cards, 20 — who has 20 bank accounts, it&#39;s you&#39;re just what you&#39;re paying in fees seems to be exorbitant.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, a lot of people who watched that show “How to Get Rich” on Netflix they told me like, I had no idea how little people know about money, but to me, I&#39;ve been talking to everyday people for the last 20 years, so it doesn&#39;t faze me to have 20 savings accounts to not know how much you&#39;re spending on fees.</p><p> Of course, you don&#39;t, that&#39;s like asking me, Ramit, do you have a carburetor in your car? I go, what the hell&#39;s a carburetor? I don&#39;t know, I turn the key it works, that&#39;s my understanding.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, let&#39;s talk about the money dial, where did the concept of that come and how do people actually use your money dial?</p><p> SETHI: When I talk about a rich life people like the term they go, rich life. What is that? So, you know first let&#39;s just start with that, a rich life can be traveling two months a year, a rich life can be wearing a beautiful cashmere coat, it could be picking up your kids from school every afternoon. Your rich life is yours.</p><p> And so, people they buy into that they go. Oh wow.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not just materialism. It&#39;s not just shiny things. It sounds like it&#39;s choices and freedom and much less worry.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, but it&#39;s being very, very specific about it so freedom is when I ask people, what is your rich life? 90 percent of people say the same answer to me across the world. They go I want to do what I want when I want. They really think that they&#39;re clever.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: I go wow that&#39;s so interesting, I never heard that before.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SETHI: And then I go so what do you want, and they just stare at me because that is how far most of us have thought. And they&#39;ll say something like travel. I go, okay, where? They go, Europe. I go, where? I want to know what airline seat you&#39;re going to sit in, I want to know where you&#39;re going to stay, what you&#39;re going to eat, I want to know who&#39;s going with you for how long, that&#39;s a vivid and specific vision of a rich life.</p><p> So, an easy way to do this for everybody listening is let&#39;s do this quick exercise together. The first question I have for you, Barry, is what do you love spending money on?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Dining, entertainment, things like that.</p><p> SETHI: Fantastic. Dining is actually the number one response money dial, or it&#39;s what I call a money dial.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, number one is eating out or dining. Number two is travel. Number three is health and wellness. Number four is my money dial, convenience. And then there&#39;s a variety of others.</p><p> So, the second question is, Barry, if you could quadruple the amount you spend on dining, what would it look and feel like for you?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That would be a terrifying number.</p><p> SETHI: Tell me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, my wife and I also really like cooking, so we cook at home, we just redid a kitchen, we have this lovely chef&#39;s kitchen. So, I try and balance having fun and playing some music, cracking a bottle of wine and working on a recipe. That&#39;s a lot of fun. As is, you know, we just had an insane lunch at the Restoration Hardware.</p><p> SETHI: I love that place.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Just exorbitant. But, you know, as an occasion, I&#39;m like, don&#39;t even think about it. Just let&#39;s order what we want and not even think twice.</p><p> SETHI: So, you are in an unusual position because you, I&#39;m guessing, you&#39;re not really price sensitive about eating out.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, you and I have previously discussed pain points in spending. Like for me it&#39;s clothes because everything is an expensive bib eventually.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And look I&#39;m wearing nice pants.</p><p> SETHI: I told Barry, my wife&#39;s a personal stylist, I said Barry let&#39;s do this.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> I mean I&#39;m wearing nice clothes today, but I can rationalize dropping a couple hundred bucks on a meal without even thinking twice about it. But you walk into certain stores, 800 bucks for a pair of shoes, 400 bucks for a shirt, it&#39;s a little more challenging because I&#39;m hard on everything. I know that the shirt will eventually have spaghetti stains on it and the sneakers the shoes will be destroyed, but that&#39;s my pain point.</p><p> SETHI: Okay.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not cars. It&#39;s not watches. It&#39;s not food.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s clothes.</p><p> SETHI: So, people listening, they&#39;re saying okay I eat I like to eat out or I like to travel and the second question when I ask, what would it look like if you could quadruple your spending? People smile because they go, wow, they never thought of it, most people when it comes to food. They give me the same answer, they go, wow, I probably have to watch what I eat because I&#39;d be eating up four times a week and I go…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not bigger portions. It&#39;s going to nicer places.</p><p> SETHI: That&#39;s right. So, most of us think linearly, I go, what? Are you going to go to Chipotle four times a week?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SETHI: Might you go to a different caliber?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: And this is where it becomes really fascinating, a rich life is not simply more frequency, a money dial turned all the way up could be eating at a beautiful Michelin-starred restaurant for lunch, it could be going — if you turn it all the way up, you might go to Italy with your loved one, go to a farmers&#39; market with a chef and make the food together.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That sounds like fun.</p><p> SETHI: So, the point of a money dial and the point of a rich life is to really get specific about What it would look like to turn it up then you will understand what I mean when I say I want you to spend extravagantly on the things you love as long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don&#39;t.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And that&#39;s a really fascinating aspect to your writings and to the show because People seem to be somewhat agnostic about their spending habits regardless of whether it&#39;s important or not.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And you know if you get — if you could get people to focus on oh, you want this big expensive trip or this nice car or whatever it happens to be, well to get there you just have to stop throwing money away on junk, you&#39;re about halfway there.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What&#39;s the pushback to that from clients? From people?</p><p> SETHI: Most people have simply been taught that they should cut back a little bit on everything. What a demoralizing philosophy Oh, I should cut back 5 percent on asparagus 5 percent on my car 5 percent on rent 5 percent on cable, it&#39;s like that is so ineffective, that&#39;s why there are so many folks out there who berate people about buying a…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A spending scold.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: if you&#39;re one latte away from your retirement being messed up you got bigger …</p><p> SETHI: Bigger problems.</p><p> And truthfully a coffee a day is not going to change your financial life in any material way but there are certain five or ten big things that make a huge difference so what I encourage you …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s go through those.</p><p> SETHI: All right, what I tell people is stop asking three-dollar questions, start asking $30,000 questions, those would be am I automating my savings and investments? Have I made rules for myself such that if I&#39;m saving 5 percent this year, I&#39;m going to increase it by 1 percent per year, that right there if you do that for your savings and investment is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than all the coffee you&#39;ll ever buy. Am I paid well? Have I learned the skills of negotiating my salary? Have I managed my asset allocation and my investment fees?</p><p> If you do these few things, you&#39;ll be light years ahead of agonizing over the price of broccoli.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. It&#39;s whenever I read the spending scolds, they always have half the story. Never buy a sports car, never buy a sailboat, never buy a…</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s always no, no, no.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But the right way to say that is never buy a sports car if you can&#39;t afford a sports car.</p><p> SETHI: Correct.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But if you can afford it, go buy whatever the hell you want. And that focusing on the spending but ignoring the hey, is this a rational expenditure for someone who is earning enough to pay for that vacation, that house, that car, why not?</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s a very simple puritanical view that people in personal finance espouse, which is it&#39;s really easy to tell people no to everything. A blanket no, but it&#39;s much harder.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s lazy.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, it&#39;s intellectually lazy, but I think it&#39;s much more fascinating and nuanced to show people you can actually spend more on the things you love. For example, I just posted a picture of my car. I&#39;m not into cars, not at this phase of life, and I know you are super into it, so this is interesting. I posted my car, it&#39;s an old, of course it&#39;s a Honda Accord, all right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s a very reasonable —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We had a Honda Accord Cross Tour, probably the best car I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s fantastic.</p><p> So, I could go buy any car, but to me, it&#39;s great. I hardly drive, I have it, it&#39;s fine. One day, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get a much nicer car. And so, I posted this just to show people, look, this isn&#39;t my thing, it&#39;s where I cut costs mercilessly but when I travel, I love hotels, I love clothes those are the things that are important to me and so I want people to actually have this highly dichotomous way of spending, you spend extravagantly on certain things…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A barbell.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, a barbell and then you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don&#39;t.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I really like that concept. So, speaking of staying within your spending limits, if you&#39;re making 70 grand a year, maybe a $4,000 handbag isn&#39;t the best use of your money.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s very likely although if they tell me, hey I pay 18 percent of gross for my rent. I would go, cool, what are you doing with the rest? They go, I love a bag. I go, how long is it going to take you to save? They go, I know my numbers, 14 months. Fantastic, but I will say you know we want to be reasonable the fact of the matter is 90 plus percent of people do not know their basic numbers.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What are your thoughts on the early retirement fire movement?</p><p> SETHI: I like any movement that gets Americans to think about increasing their savings rate. I love that. I love a movement that gets people to be goal oriented. I love that.</p><p> However, it quickly crosses over into obsession over pure metrics and truthfully accumulating money is never the goal. That is living in the spreadsheet.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m glad, I&#39;m glad you said that, I remember reading a blog post by someone who was in that space, and they were stressing because they had a houseguest who was taking a long hot shower.</p><p> SETHI: Come on.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I swear this is true, and the long hot shower was going to be expensive and it&#39;s like again if a hot shower, the cost of that is too much, what are you going to do when you&#39;re old if you&#39;re retired in your prime living earning spending years, it just makes no sense.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s — that&#39;s when you&#39;ve gone too far, imagine you have a pair of eyeglasses. The primary money lens that we use in this country is cost we go to the store. We look at the cost. I get it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The wrong measure.</p><p> SETHI: There are so many other lenses, so for something like black pepper, which I don&#39;t really care about I&#39;ll use cost fine, but for other things like a pair of shoes which I am going to keep for seven years or taking my parents out to a really nice restaurant, I&#39;m going to use different lenses, so there are lenses like security and safety, delight, results. That&#39;s why somebody might hire a personal trainer instead of doing it on YouTube. Even just luxury. So, what I want is for people like a symphony, you got to be able to have different instruments, not only the instrument of cost. And that&#39;s where I think people go wrong.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really fascinating.</p><p> I&#39;ve always thought of you as like a financial advisor, but on the show, It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re a therapist/counselor. Each of these vignettes are like interventions.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: How do you think of this? Am I mis-describing you? How do you think of your own work? What&#39;s your job title?</p><p> SETHI: Well, you can call me what you want. I mean, I get judged by the results of the people I work with, which I love. I think that money is so much more than just what&#39;s on the page. And ultimately, through the show and through my podcast, I&#39;ve become much more interested in the interpersonal dynamics. Couples, even individuals, they know that they should probably save more. They know that they should probably pay off debt. Why aren&#39;t they? And that to me is where we begin to peel the onion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s more counseling than it is financial advice. And on the show, I&#39;ve seen some themes come up over and over again. So first, none of these people, they don&#39;t track their spending, there&#39;s no budget, there&#39;s not even the mental buckets of, I&#39;m going to spend this much on entertainment and this much on rent. It just is a fire hose coming in and a fire hose going out.</p><p> SETHI: That&#39;s very astute. I think that the way most people think about money is purely reactive and purely transactional. So, it goes like this. Our printer broke down. Let&#39;s buy a new printer. Our kids need soccer cleats. Let&#39;s go buy soccer cleats. Oh my gosh, we got our credit card bill. I guess we spent that much on sprinklers at Home Depot. That&#39;s basically the next 40 years of life and that&#39;s true. That&#39;s true. And so, I have a lot of compassion because we&#39;ve all done that in some way. It could be fitness. It could be relationships It could be anything.</p><p> You and I understand that you should probably have certain mental buckets and you should probably go on offense instead of defense and we get that after you understand this stuff, it&#39;s not that hard. If you don&#39;t even know, for example, how to decide if you can afford your car, then that is really where we&#39;re starting.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Or your house people were living in houses with HOA fees and repair costs that they seemingly never thought of.</p><p> SETHI: Well, this is the number one thing You know when I when I talk to folks the number one and number two area, they overspend on number one is their house because they have no sense of, they don&#39;t even know that 28 percent rule, they don&#39;t know 28 36. That&#39;s very technical and the second area they overspend on is their car. Now why, what is in common with both of those? First, they&#39;ve gotten more expensive recently yes, but two, there are gigantic phantom costs with each of those.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: When I show people for example that if you take a mortgage, you might as well just add on 50 percent to that mortgage to account for taxes, interest, maintenance, opportunity costs they are shocked they can&#39;t believe it. In fact, when I go further and tell them that it&#39;s actually been a better decision for me to rent than to own, It&#39;s like somebody&#39;s telling them the sky is green.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, the American dream has been you know, you find your little place, you buy it you own it. No one could raise your rent. You can paint the walls any color.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and you&#39;re not throwing money away on rent, funny you never say that when you go out to a restaurant, you&#39;re throwing money away in a restaurant and then they go, oh, you&#39;re paying your landlord&#39;s mortgage. I go, are you concerned about paying your sushi restaurant owner&#39;s mortgage? No, it&#39;s a bunch of almost religious aphorisms, they lack any substance and so we simply meaninglessly repeat these phrases. I don&#39;t want to throw rent away. Easier than teaching opportunity cost and doing a buy versus rent calculation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, let&#39;s talk about a couple of other things on the show that I was fascinated by.</p><p> Reckless spending is kind of a theme. We mentioned the $4,000 handbag for somebody who really…</p><p> SETHI: Who could not afford it.正确的？</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Or the guy who was spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars each month on video games. I mean one video game should keep you busy for a month not dozens, that was sort of a …</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: An obsession.</p><p> SETHI: So that that&#39;s really interesting, when I heard that, I really want everyone watching “How to Get Rich” to notice my reaction. When people — first of all, it is extremely intimate for people to admit all their financials to anyone, and I had all of their financials.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I saw this — by the way you walk through, here&#39;s their credit card spending, here&#39;s what&#39;s in their savings account, one of the people who&#39;s spending a ton of money literally had five dollars and change in their savings account.</p><p> SETHI: Until now you&#39;ve never been able to actually see inside people&#39;s …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s pretty horrifying.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s fascinating to me. It&#39;s like a microscope You know, they see a spreadsheet to me when I look at someone&#39;s money, I see a family trip to Disneyland or I see a beautiful outfit or I see early retirement, and that&#39;s what I wanted to shift into.</p><p> So, when people invite me into their homes and they open up their finances to me. They are very brittle, they&#39;re expecting me to come down like a pile of bricks and say you&#39;re doing it all wrong and a lot of times I just go, that&#39;s really interesting. Why&#39;d you do that? What do you love about video games, and you can see them visibly loosen up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re very genteel with these people, there&#39;s no finger wagging, there&#39;s no scolding, and you very gently nudge them to that you give them I forgot which woman it was, Maybe it was the gymnast, you gave her three choices choice a, do nothing.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Choice B, do something little.</p><p> Choice C, do something large. And nobody wants to do nothing.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, well …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: They have agency they&#39;re saying well, I&#39;m not going to do A, so now it&#39;s their decision.</p><p> SETHI: Correct? So, there&#39;s a lot of psychology into play.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> SETHI: And if you&#39;re listening and for example, you&#39;ve had a spouse maybe who&#39;s just seemingly not interested in money or your kids or anyone around you where you&#39;re or you can even bring yourself sometimes to figure out how to spend money more meaningfully, a lot of us think that the solution is found in a spreadsheet and it&#39;s not.</p><p> For every single person on the show and on my podcast, there is something much deeper going on and it&#39;s easy. In fact, it&#39;s lazy to throw a bunch of numbers, here&#39;s a compound interest chart. That&#39;s not going to change anybody&#39;s life.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: We&#39;ve all seen it; we all know what it says. But to understand, for example, what did your parents say around the dinner table? And you will always hear people repeating phrases like, we can&#39;t afford it, money doesn&#39;t grow on trees. Now imagine hearing that 10,000 times growing up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You left the door open again, must I pay to heat Eva Lane?</p><p> SETHI: Exactly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I heard that growing up constantly.</p><p> SETHI: Bingo. And so, a lot of the folks, whether it be on the show or on my podcast, they&#39;ll do very well. They may get a great job, accumulate money, and they can afford any lunch, they can afford a trip, but some of them agonize over it.为什么？</p><p> They think, oh, I&#39;m bad, I feel guilty buying this business class trip, but really it often traces back to what they heard from their parents.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. Let&#39;s talk about married couples that don&#39;t have a joint checking account. Two different couples with, that&#39;s unfathomable.</p><p> SETHI: Really? That surprises you?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Shocking, shocking. Because I remember when I first got married, I&#39;m married 30 years already, we had separate checking accounts and my wife is like, why do you need to hide your money from me?</p><p> I&#39;m not hiding, first of all, she was making more than me and second, I&#39;m not hiding, I have this account, you have that account, we merged everything and never looked back.</p><p> By the way, she takes care of the bills because when we were younger, when the lights went out, that&#39;s how I knew it was time to pay the electric bill.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SETHI: First of all, congratulations on 30 years, that&#39;s amazing. That&#39;s the ultimate part of a rich life. I&#39;m not surprised that so many couples don&#39;t have joint accounts, but I&#39;ll tell you something that might surprise you. I actually don&#39;t have a problem if couples have separate accounts, here&#39;s what&#39;s really going on the people that get into financial trouble in relationships tend to have separate accounts, but it&#39;s not the separate accounts that cause the problem, it&#39;s the fact that they simply slid into this relationship as individuals and never sat down and discussed, how do we want our money to go?</p><p> So, if they sit down and they go, you know what? I think we prefer to have separate accounts. We can combine as necessary. I say fantastic, but most people with separate accounts never had that conversation and that is the plan.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not just the separate accounts, It&#39;s the separate spending and separate priorities where how are we going to save if you&#39;re buying X or Y or Z?</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We&#39;ll never get out of debt. We&#39;ll never buy that house, which was one of the couples&#39; motivation.</p><p> SETHI: This is very common.</p><p> So, you know, on the podcast, I only speak to couples. And you&#39;ll get these patterns. One is an over spender; one is an under spender. I had a particularly fascinating couple; I think it was around episode 20. He wrote me in all caps, he said, Ramit, please help. My wife of 21 years is about to divorce me because I&#39;m too cheap.</p><p> I was like, click, so I immediately click and respond to him. I brought him on the show with his wife. I had reviewed all their finances and she was angry, in fact almost checked out. And she said, I don&#39;t understand why after 20 years of marriage, he doesn&#39;t trust me, our yard is the only unlandscaped yard. She said, he asked me to find mattresses for our two girls, I spent a week creating a spreadsheet. And he said, that&#39;s too expensive, the mattresses were something like 500 bucks. Their net worth, Barry, can you guess?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Five million dollars.</p><p> SETHI: It was around 13 million dollars.</p><p> And so, when you hear that —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, 500 bucks for a mattress is just irrelevant.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s meaningless. It would be easy to simply say, this guy&#39;s nuts, why don&#39;t you loosen up?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: He&#39;s got issues for sure.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and that&#39;s where I start. That&#39;s where I go, let&#39;s talk about it. Non-judgmentally, but let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s going on. Remember, she was about to divorce him. And so, you can listen to the episode, episode 20, and you can hear how that conversation evolves. It&#39;s much deeper than math.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, this raises a really interesting question, people reveal very embarrassing challenging financial habits, how did you get these folks to come clean on them?</p><p> SETHI: On the show…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> SETHI: We have casting so casting went out and found particularly interesting situations and I gave a lot of guidance as to what type of people are especially interesting, on my podcast that was the hardest thing of all is to get people to open up all of their financials.</p><p> Not only have we been able to do that, now we have them on video just like on the show. That&#39;s very intimate. I&#39;m not sure I would go on a show like that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: What I&#39;ve learned about the psychology of people appearing on this is you have to understand that most people feel truly lost when it comes to money. They don&#39;t know who to trust. They don&#39;t even know the difference between the word financial advisor and 401k like those two, they&#39;re in different universes to us but to somebody walking on the street, those words are all jumbled up into the personal finance or confusing money cloud, and so when they hear somebody who comes and says like, hey, I&#39;m not going to judge you if you like a purse, I&#39;m not going to judge you if you like to eat out, fine, I like a couple nice things myself, that&#39;s cool, let&#39;s talk about what your rich life is and how we can use your money to get there.</p><p> They are willing to open up anything if they know that they can trust me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really intriguing. So, let&#39;s — we were talking earlier about budgeting and you know credit scores and things like that.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk a little bit about people who have more money than they know what to do with because they&#39;ve spent their whole life working and saving and investing and suddenly, they have a hard time pivoting to, hey I could take that trip, I could buy that sailboat, I could do what I want. what sort of advice do you give to these folks to allow them to be more comfortable to make that transition?</p><p> SETHI: This is my favorite topic, Barry, because nobody really talks about it and it&#39;s very politically incorrect.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We talk about this in the office all the time it comes up constantly partly because we have a lot of wealthy clients, but also partly because we&#39;re big believers in as you suggest, you have to use money as a tool to live your richest life, what advice do you give these folks?</p><p> SETHI: One way to think about it is you really have your prime spending years between the ages of 40 to 60, so think about that before 40 most people don&#39;t really have money after 60 there may be health issues whether it be with yourself or somebody in your family that you have to take care of, whatever, things happen.</p><p> So, if you accept the idea that your prime spending years are between 40 to 60, what does that mean for you? And suddenly, traveling to certain places becomes an urgency. Eating at a certain restaurant you&#39;ve always wanted to becomes an urgency. This requires a change. One, the idea of shifting from accumulation to de-accumulation is really hard. That&#39;s why, you know, when people retire, they start freaking out because they&#39;re not getting the income even though the interest pays more than they would have ever made.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, they&#39;re not getting the income and they have a lot more hours in the day to go out and spend money.</p><p> SETHI: Exactly. The second thing is people often make this jump they go, well, if I go eat at that restaurant, I don&#39;t want to have to become that rich guy who&#39;s eating there. I go, you think you&#39;re going to trip and fall and eat at a Michelin starred restaurant every single night? It&#39;s like, get real, I trust myself enough to know that I can drive a car twice and not have to buy ten of them. I trust myself enough to know Barry&#39;s going, well, I don&#39;t know about that. He goes, have you been in my Porsche?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SETHI: Okay, maybe not. I trust myself enough to know that I can eat at a nice restaurant for an anniversary and say wow I really love that or that wasn&#39;t my thing, but it was cool and not have to do it every night.</p><p> Many of us have simply never built the skill and it is a skill of spending money, so we&#39;ve earned it, we&#39;ve managed it, but we never actually built a skill of spending it meaningfully and that&#39;s why we have to start almost like we&#39;re building a new muscle.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: How do you address the guilt that some people feel when they say I&#39;m spending my kids&#39; inheritance?</p><p> SETHI: I don&#39;t — first of all, it&#39;s lazy for people when I ask them, what&#39;s your rich life? They go, you know what? I&#39;m so simple. I&#39;m just a simple person. I really want to just provide for my kids.</p><p> I go, that sucks, that&#39;s a boring answer, and that&#39;s intellectually lazy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SETHI: So you worked your entire life. Oh and you never modeled building good spending habits.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: You literally accumulated it like Scrooge McDuck and you&#39;re handing it over to your kids without any modeling? No, that&#39;s actually unacceptable to me. I told my parents, my parents had very modest incomes growing up and we told my mom and dad I sat down with them because they were nervous about spending money because they had gone through the same thing.</p><p> And I said, let&#39;s look at the numbers I mean it very simple for them and I said, mom and dad, what are you going to do with this money if you don&#39;t start spending it? And they&#39;d never really thought about they go, we&#39;ll give it to the kids. I go, we don&#39;t want one cent, you taught us how to be educated you taught us good values, we want you to spend every last cent and maybe even more. And so, I put them on a travel budget, and I said you have to spend this much every single month, in fact they&#39;re abroad right now, which I&#39;m so happy about.</p><p> The guilt of not leaving money for your kids really is a deeply emotional response. You want to leave them money? Please do, leave them some, but more importantly leave them a model of your spending money on the things that matter to you.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do you get the kids involved? Do you get the whole family involved when you&#39;re talking with a wealthy family that&#39;s having some issues with figuring out how to live their rich life?</p><p> SETHI: The first thing I do is work with the parents. Parents are obsessed with the question about should I give them an allowance? Should I not?</p><p> I go, listen, that&#39;s like someone saying I want to meet the person of my dreams. What kind of shoelaces should I wear? I go it&#39;s irrelevant, an allowance is not the primary issue. What I ask him is how do you talk about money at home, and they go, we don&#39;t talk about it. I go, why not? They go, because our parents never talked about it. I go, okay, we&#39;re going to start talking about it.</p><p> Second, do you ever get excited about it? Most people have never conceived that they can get excited about money, they see it as something negative something to protect their children from and so I suggest some gentle things, if their kid is very young. I say you know bring them over on your lap and say, you know mommy&#39;s going to log into the credit card, this is what allows us to buy the food that we eat can you help me push the button and then as they get older, empower them to make decisions about a vacation or a dinner out.</p><p> It&#39;s not about an allowance, you can give them an allowance or not that&#39;s not the point, the point is to model healthy relationship with money.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really, really interesting, we in the office we set up so we&#39;ve had a robo advisor internally for six seven years already and we advise parents to set up small accounts for their kids, so they start investing at eight, twelve …</p><p> SETHI: Love it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Fourteen years old, it doesn&#39;t have to be a lot of money but they get to watch it grow.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And it&#39;s really like oh this is something that I could continue to do on my own.</p><p> SETHI: And they talk about it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> SETHI: I had another fascinating couple they&#39;d been dating for a year, they&#39;re in their late 30s he had started a business and he was paying himself $2,000 a month. She was making $200,000 per month.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A month?</p><p> SETHI: She was making 100 times what he makes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, she&#39;s making $2.5 million. That&#39;s a nice income.</p><p> SETHI: Very nice in her late 30s. She had more money than she would ever need and they struggled. The reason they came to me was it was about who&#39;s going to pay the check for dinner. So, believe it or not, this is a real deal. So, I took the call and what became very clear was I asked her, when did you first learn about investing? And you know what she said, Barry? She said, age five. Her parents started talking about compound interest. Age five, which is what wealthy families tend to do. Then I asked him, when did you learn about investing? He goes, I started reading your book about two weeks ago.</p><p> So, imagine a guy who has a 30-year deficit on learning about a concept as important as compound interest. We can&#39;t expect everybody to have the same knowledge. We all start at different parts in life. For me, physical fitness, I wish I learned how to deadlift when I was 16, I didn&#39;t. But if you can give your kids an advantage, and certainly your partner, it is to talk about money regularly and positively.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, before we get to our favorite questions, a quick curve ball question. Got to ask, how did the Netflix deal come about? Did they reach out to you? Did you reach out to them? Was there a third-party intermediary? How do you suddenly get a Netflix series?</p><p> SETHI: They reached out to me. I remember where I was, they emailed me and it said, would you be interested in sitting down for a meeting and also should we communicate through you, or do you have representation?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: Two things happened to me. First off, I didn&#39;t believe it was from them so I went up to the “from” and it said “@netflix.com.” I was like, wait a second.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, you can fake that though, that&#39;s easy enough.</p><p> SETHI: So, I was like, this is crazy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: If you hit reply, that&#39;s when you know it&#39;s real.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, that&#39;s a good tip. Well, I&#39;m glad it worked out. The second thing that occurred to me was, I don&#39;t even know what they meant by representation. I&#39;m not a Hollywood guy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;ve been running my business for 20 years on the internet.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re New York based, right?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and then LA now.</p><p> But I didn&#39;t even know, so I had to learn, how do you find an entertainment lawyer? I literally went on Google and searched entertainment lawyer, and I had to learn the entire business, which I&#39;m just, just, just starting to grasp. It was a totally fascinating journey and they had been wanting to do a money show. In fact, every network has been wanting to…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SETHI: But money&#39;s really hard on TV. It&#39;s boring, it&#39;s often very depressing. And so, I told them point blank, I said, “Look, I&#39;m interested, but I want to do it my way. “I do not want to berate some couple, for how much they spend on Reese&#39;s Pieces cups. And they said, no, no, no, we want you to do it your way. They gave me broad creative control.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s great.</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;m very thankful.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is there going to be a second season?</p><p> SETHI: We will see.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I mean, given that it&#39;s top 10 trending, you got to think it&#39;s interesting. What was the experience like putting this together? It&#39;s obviously, it&#39;s not writing, it&#39;s not podcasting, it&#39;s very different. You&#39;re pretty telegenic. Did you did you find the transition to video challenging at all?</p><p> SETHI: Definitely Well, you know, I got a lot of nice comments from people around the world and I thought to myself, wow so all it takes for me to look good is to throw up a multi-million-dollar crew with the best cameras in the world and makeup and I said, wow. Okay, I&#39;ll take it I&#39;ll take whatever it takes, you know, what was challenging most of all was the intimacy of going into people&#39;s houses.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> SETHI: like in the first scene you see me visiting Matt and Amani. I meet their family their children, that is as intimate as it gets to be in someone&#39;s living room talking about money.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Looking at their — looking literally at their…</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Their statements, their credit card spending.</p><p> SETHI: And watching fights happen in front of me, which I do love a good fight I mean, I love reality TV myself, but you have to remember …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh no, it gets uncomfortable.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and it should, right? Money is uncomfortable.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> SETHI: And that&#39;s okay, but all this time there&#39;s a tight camera on my face and I&#39;m thinking oh my — like is this really happening so to me that&#39;s what is the magic of the show is, I don&#39;t know anything about them all I know is their name and their financials, same as you and together we go and discover what&#39;s going on.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, it&#39;s definitely entertaining, we&#39;ll blow through five questions really quickly starting with other than “How to Get Rich” what else are you streaming on Netflix or anything else.</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;m watching “Indian Matchmaking” just because I love it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Come on.</p><p> SETHI: My parents had an arranged marriage you know I have to watch this. It&#39;s you know, it hits home. And on the podcast side there&#39;s a couple, one is there&#39;s an interesting podcast about Rolls-Royce and it&#39;s called “Ghost Stories” it&#39;s about their Ghost and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a little bit like markety but I just love craftsmanship, I love design, so I get to hear from the designers.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And you&#39;re not sporting a watch, I&#39;m surprised, I figure that you&#39;re a clothes guy.</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;m a hotel guy and clothes and convenience, like personal training, things like that. Watches.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Doesn&#39;t do anything for you.</p><p> SETHI: Nah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;ll tell you a funny story about that later.</p><p> Second question, who are your mentors? Who helped shape your career?</p><p> SETHI: BJ Fogg, one of my professors at Stanford. I learned from him at the Persuasive Technology Lab. He&#39;s still a close friend of mine. Jay Abraham taught me a lot about putting my customers and clients at the center of my world. Those two were very influential and continue to be.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now?</p><p> SETHI: One of my favorites is “The Color of Law.” That&#39;s a book about redlining. It&#39;s about race and real estate in this country. Most people have no idea that real estate is deeply, deeply built around race. It&#39;s racist. It&#39;s a racist institution in our country.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And has been for a long, long time.</p><p> SETHI: For decades. It is built that way.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do you think people really don&#39;t know that?</p><p> SETHI: They do not know.不。</p><p> No, no like 100 percent …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The inner cities and slums and the highways that will cleave the lower-income part of the town right in half.</p><p> SETHI: No, Barry, they have no idea.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right your face.</p><p> SETHI: No, you can&#39;t miss it unless you&#39;ve been radicalized to ignore it so no they do not know and they don&#39;t want to know, and that&#39;s why every time I talk about books I talk about this book “The Color Of Law” it is staggering to learn what happened in our country.</p><p> And then I&#39;m reading a book right now called “Unreasonable Hospitality” the manager of 11 Madison Park. Wow, really interesting how they took that restaurant to be …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Top-rated Michelin star-rated.</p><p> SETHI: I just love a good hospitality story.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Last two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in either financial counseling or investing?</p><p> SETHI: Gosh, I would say first off talk to people who are in the industry and were in the industry and left, talk to at least 15 people and find out what&#39;s their lifestyle like, do they get to travel do they enjoy it what do they like what are they not like? Find out if it&#39;s for you and then the second thing I would say is if you are interested in financial counseling, therapy, et cetera, you&#39;re going to learn the technical skills but the skill that I think is underrepresented when it comes to money is understanding people. So psychology is absolutely critical and that will set you apart.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Our final question, what do you know about the world of advice and financial planning and counseling that you wish you knew 20 years or so ago when you were first getting started?</p><p> SETHI: Education alone is not the answer.</p><p> I often get people saying, “Ramit, we should teach your book in high school.” and I actually disagree. Education alone doesn&#39;t solve the problems we have, it helps, but there are structural changes that need to be made such as building more housing, there are also ways of communicating about money which is why I did this Netflix show and my podcast to show people that money can actually be fun and joyful and not simply something that you need to do like flossing your teeth.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It doesn&#39;t have to be a drag.</p><p> Tell people where they can find you, your website the name of the show and the book and everything else.</p><p> SETHI: The name of the show on Netflix is “How to Get Rich” My suggestion is watch the first three minutes and notice the differences in how we talk about money.</p><p> My podcast where I speak to couples from all over the economic spectrum is “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” and my book is also called “I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Ramit, thank you so much for coming in today.

Merely shifting your frame of view by a few degrees can reveal what you may have missed in your initial viewing. This is very easy to do when you are looking through the viewfinder of a camera, but much more challenging when you are intellectually pondering a set of choices.</p><p> Here are a few of my favorite perspective-changers:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Non-Farm Payroll</strong> : There are about 158.6 million people in the US labor market. Each month, about 1.5% of that labor pool, or a bit over 2 million people, leave their jobs. Sometimes it is due to retirement, death, sabbaticals, parental leave, but most often, it is to switch jobs, go work for another firm or start their own business. Similarly, when you hear about those new Non-Farm Payrolls jobs, some are new or returning entrants into the workforce, but most are those people exiting their old jobs and beginning a new one.</p><p> Essentially, monthly Non-Farm Payrolls is the net difference between these two groups: Job leavers and job starters. The actual number itself is far smaller and less significant than you hear about publicly. The monthly number ( <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t13.htm">May 2023</a> = 339,000) is a tenth or so of the ~1.5% of the 159m total. Hence, any given monthly NFP datapoint is a <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2011/02/nfp-over-over-least/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiny, noisy, modeled number</a> , filled with all manner of adjustments and revisions.</p><p> What really matters is the series trend: Are we consistently creating jobs over time? Is that multi-month trend rising or falling?</p><p> Monthly NFP is likely the single most overrated economic data point in the US, while the intermediate term employment trend is the most underrated. When you have 14 straight upside surprises, perhaps something is off in your model…  [UPDATE: June 5th: <a href="http://The government numbers are not fake. They're just noisy. https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/in-which-david-sacks-and-balaji-raise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noah Smith</a> weighs in]</p><p> <strong><u>Traffic</u></strong> : I love getting a text from someone apologizing for getting stuck in rush hour traffic and they are going to be late.</p><p> It&#39;s fascinating how people see themselves apart from the crowd; their ego does not allow them to see themselves as ordinary member of the masses. It always reminds me of the scene from <em>Life of Brian</em> : “ <a href="https://youtu.be/KHbzSif78qQ">You are all individuals</a> .”</p><p> Here is the context shift: Driving at rush hour, you are not “ <em>stuck in traffic</em> ,” <em>you ARE traffic</em> . (Amazing how few people realize this).</p><p> <strong><u>Inflation</u></strong> : Similar to traffic, when consumers have to pay up for scarce goods, it is often said they are <em>suffering from inflation</em> .</p><p> While it may be painful, that oversimplifies what is actually happening: Purchasing discretionary goods at higher prices is a decision made by someone who has chosen to pay a higher price in order to obtain a good they desire.</p><p> Bidding up prices for scarce goods? It is much more accurate to say consumers are not so much <em>suffering from inflation</em> as they are one of the primary <em>causes of inflation</em> .</p><p> <strong><u>Analyst Estimates</u></strong> : Earnings <em>never</em> miss estimates. Rather, it is the estimates – the opinion of analysts – that were wrong. Morgan Housel loves pointing out that Earnings are whatever they are going to be as a function of a company&#39;s revenues relative to its costs.</p><p> Earnings are a fact, analysts&#39; earnings estimates are an opinion. If a company&#39;s earnings are above or below consensus, it was the analysts who got it wrong and not vice versa.</p><p> <strong><u>Fair Value</u></strong> : <em>Valuation of equities</em> is one of those things that seems to confuse so many. About half the time it will be above average and the other half of the time it will be below. By definition, average is not necessarily where you are going to spend most of your time. My colleague Ben Carlson likes to point out that average annual returns for the S&amp;P500 is 8%, a number that market almost never returns on an annual basis.</p><p> Fair value is that singular point in a cycle that equities race by in the early stages of a secular bull market to the upside; some years later, these same market averages will plummet past that spot as the bear market ramps and prices fall. It is a point in space and time that is incredibly brief.</p><p> Stocks do not magically return to their historical average fair value as if they were a Roomba going back to their charging stations.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align: center;"> ~~~</p><p> Those are some of my favorite perspective shifters, I hope you find them to be a useful way to reset your own perspectives.</p><p></p><p></p><p> <em>Previously</em> :<br /> <a class="gtrackexternal" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/02/nfp-over-over-least/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFP Day: The Most Over-Analyzed, Over-Emphasized, Least-Understood Data Point</a> (February 4th, 2011)</p><p><del> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2013/06/most-important-blah-blah-blah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THE MOST IMPORTANT EVER NFP</a></del> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2013/06/most-important-blah-blah-blah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blah blah blah</a> (June 7, 2013)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2016/05/161589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Knows Nuthin&#39;</a> (May 5, 2016)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/06/inflation-blame-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who Is to Blame for Inflation, 1-15</a> (June 28, 2022)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/forecasting-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forecasting &amp; Prediction Discussions</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><span id="more-314426"></span></p><p></p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/estimates-E.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-314538" src="https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/estimates-E.png" alt="" width="700" height="486" srcset="https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/estimates-E.png 837w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/estimates-E-300x208.png 300w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/estimates-E-768x533.png 768w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/estimates-E-250x174.png 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p><p></p><p></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/06/change-your-perspective/">Change Your Perspective</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com">The Big Picture</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
