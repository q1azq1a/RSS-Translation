href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/01/problem-solving-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">投资是一种解决问题的活动</a>，其中充满了机会，但也揭示了我们所有人都会犯的错误。如果投资的核心部分是对人类行为的研究，那么我们必须认识到人类行为的表现方式就是我们做出决策的方式。</p><p>为了成为更好的投资者，我们必须学习如何做出更好的决策。</p><p>你在这个兔子洞里掉得越深，你就越清楚地知道良好的判断和决策是多么重要。它影响你生活的方方面面，从你的配偶是谁、你的职业生涯有多成功、你的医疗保健结果有多好，以及你的人际关系有多充实。良好的决策会增加幸福感、提高生活满意度，甚至可能成为最好的人。</p><p>我并不是说你必须成为一名出色的投资者才能拥有美好的生活；我只是建议你必须成为一名出色的投资者才能过上美好的生活。相反，我希望你考虑一下投资所需的技能，以及它们如何转移到你在金融界之外所做的大部分事情上。</p><p>也许这就是我对投资的定义与主流不同的原因：</p><blockquote><p> “<em>投资是一门利用不完美信息对本质上不可知的未来进行概率评估的艺术</em>。”</p></blockquote><p>这 17 个词包含了很多细微差别。</p><blockquote><p> – “<em>艺术</em>”指的是这不是一门科学，并且没有适合每个人的单一最佳解决方案。</p><p> – “<em>不完美信息</em>”是指我们拥有的信息是动态的，充其量是不完整的，经常令人困惑，而且经常是错误的。没有人可能在任何特定时刻都知道所有需要知道的事情。</p><p> – “<em>概率评估</em>”认识到许多结果都是可能的；我们需要为未来潜在的结果做好规划，而不是一项。</p><p> – “<em>本质上不可知</em>”是一种非常谦卑的承认，表明我们对未来实际上知之甚少。几乎所有时候，我们不知道也不可能知道接下来会发生什么。这应该反映在我们的投资方式中。</p><p> ——“<em>未来</em>”需要乐观。在整个人类历史上，悲观主义者一直是这场交易的失败者。即使像互联网泡沫破裂、全球金融危机和新冠疫情这样的挫折也是暂时的。悲观主义是对人类聪明才智的赌注，而这是一场失败的赌注。</p></blockquote><p>我成年后一直在观察市场，更重要的是，观察人们在与这些市场互动时的行为方式。</p><p>鉴于行为经济学的广泛采用（包括卡尼曼、席勒和泰勒三度获得诺贝尔奖），我们今天倾向于认为这是理所当然的。就在不久之前，BeFi 还没有被投资者认真对待。</p><p>你做出决定的过程值得研究。无论我们谈论的是人生中的重要里程碑还是您的资产配置，都不要让您的决策默认设置成为“自动驾驶”。</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><em>以前</em>：<br /><a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/01/simple-but-hard/" target="_blank"

•<strong>一些美联储官员对加息过高持谨慎态度</strong>：随着通胀放缓，央行官员面临着困惑，但经济活动却比预期更为强劲。 （《 <a

•<strong>我们是否应该预期估值会随着时间的推移而均值回归？</strong>假设倍数均值回归是有道理的。在很长一段时间内，它们确实如此：在 40 年代末和 50 年代初，股票交易价格处于高个位数市盈率，在 60 年代和 70 年代初，股票交易市盈率高达十几倍，在 80 年代初回到高个位数市盈率，直接升至创纪录的在 20 世纪 90 年代末的大盘股增长牛市期间，该数字为 40+，然后在 2010 年代初的复苏期间下降至十几岁左右。但同样真实的是，确定这些回归的时机也很困难。 （ <a href="https://www.thediff.co/archive/should-we-expect-valuations-to-mean-revert-over-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">差异</a>）</p><p> •

20 多名具名和未具名的同谋，其目的是非法改变 2020 年 11 月的选举结果总统选举。这份起诉书没有任何微妙之处——实际上，它指控唐纳德·特朗普、鲁迪·朱利安尼、马克·梅多斯、约翰·伊士曼、杰弗里·克拉克、西德尼·鲍威尔和其他十几个人发动了一场不成功的政变。 （<a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/trumps-toast-folks"

名未被起诉的同谋。正如诺姆·艾森和艾米·李·科普兰指出的那样，史密斯的案件可能会被电视和音频观众屏蔽，而威利斯的诉讼很可能会成为连续几周必看的电视节目。 （ <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/trump-indictments-jack-smith-fani-willis-themes.html"

RITHOLTZ，商业硕士主持人：本周的播客，我能说什么？卡斯·桑斯坦（Cass Sunstein）是美国法学、法律、行为金融学、公共政策领域的知识分子。我什至不知道还能去哪里。这是一个多么令人着迷的职业，一个非常有趣的人。</p><p>我想当你的合著者都是诺贝尔奖获得者或乔治·卢卡斯时，生活会很容易。他在职业生涯中做了很多令人惊奇的事情，从最高法院到芝加哥商学院、芝加哥法学院、哈佛法学院，以及白宫的多个公共政策职位、公共服务职位，五角大楼的总检察长办公室。我的意思是，他的影响是如此深远和迷人。你有点忘记了他还在哈佛大学教授法律。</p><p>我发现这次谈话令人愉快、引人入胜、引人入胜。我想您也会，事不宜迟，与哈佛法学院的卡斯·桑斯坦 (Cass Sunstein) 坐下来。</p><p>卡斯桑斯坦，欢迎来到彭博社。</p><p>卡斯·桑斯坦，哈佛大学法学院行为经济学和公共政策项目创始人：谢谢，很高兴来到这里。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：非常感谢您加入我们。</p><p>因此，您与两位诺贝尔奖获得者合着了两本书，并且实际上与乔治·卢卡斯（George Lucas）合着了第三本书。那有多有趣？</p><p> SUNSTEIN：嗯，我想说这太棒了。写《星球大战》非常有趣——</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p>桑斯坦：——对于法学教授来说，这也是一件不太可能发生的事情。</p><p>里索兹：（笑声）</p><p>桑斯坦：与迪克·塞勒一起写书并不是一件疯狂的事情，但真的很有趣，因为他很有趣。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：在经济学或行为金融学领域，没有人能像迪克·泰勒那样。他是我最喜欢的人之一。</p><p> SUNSTEIN：同意，他很独特，和他一起写作每分钟都是一种快乐和欢笑。与丹尼·卡尼曼一起写作令人惊讶。他是我见过的最有创造力的人。他也非常自我批评。他对合著者的批评几乎和他对自己的批评一样，这是一次过山车和一次令人难以置信的学习经历，他的正直和“我们可以做得更好”的感觉让我大多数晚上都睡不着觉。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：据说他对每一个词、每句话都感到痛苦。从周日开始，任何内容都会经过九种方式的审查才能发表。</p><p>桑斯坦：这太轻描淡写了。所以你可能会在凌晨四点收到一封电子邮件，上面写着：“这一章太糟糕了。我不知道我们怎么能写出来。事实上，整本书都很糟糕。我不知道为什么我们决定写它。”两个小时后，他会说：“我看到了根本性的缺陷，我们必须放弃。”然后一个小时后，也许是凌晨 4.45，他会说，“我可能有办法纠正根本缺陷，但我不这么认为。”然后在早上 5.15，他会给你发一张纸条，上面写着：“我有一丝洞察力。可能会失败，但我会尝试一下。”然后在早上 5.45，他说：“我有了整章的新草稿。这是一场灾难，我确信这也非常糟糕，但灾难性要小一些。”</p><p> RITHOLTZ：（笑声）这听起来像是，跳到最后一篇并阅读它。因此，我们稍后会讨论您的很多著作，但在此之前，我想深入了解一下您的背景。您于 75 年从哈佛毕业，获得学士学位，于 78 年从哈佛法学院毕业。我认为 20 世纪 70 年代与 80 年代和 90 年代有很大不同，当时像哈佛法学院这样的地方有很多人想去华尔街，那个常春藤盟校法学院的时代是什么样的？</p><p> SUNSTEIN：这是 20 世纪 60 年代的后果。所以它比所有民权和越南事件都要晚，但它就像一股开始消退的浪潮，但极其明显。</p><p>因此，有些人希望在他们能找到的任何领域都拥有伟大的职业生涯。有些人想，我想让世界变得更美好。有些人认为，我有点厌倦了那些想让世界变得更美好的人，我不想成为那样的人。并且有不同类别的类型。气氛非常强烈，有一种感觉，我们的国家经历了一些非常痛苦和令人兴奋的事情。问题是，我们要往哪个方向走？那是前里根时代。你可以在我的一些同学身上看到里根时代的曙光。今天你甚至可以在我的一些同学身上看到一些觉醒的曙光。</p><p>批判种族理论即将诞生，你可以在那里看到它的起源，也可以看到联邦党协会，这是一个具有惊人影响力的保守运动。也就是说，理论基础是由 20 世纪 70 年代的 20 多岁的年轻人奠定的。</p><p>里索兹：有趣。</p><p>因此，您为马萨诸塞州最高法院法官本杰明·卡普兰 (Benjamin Kaplan) 担任书记员，然后为美国最高法院瑟古德·马歇尔 (Thurgood Marshall) 法官担任书记员，这是 79-80 年。请告诉我们一些这些经历是什么样的。</p><p>桑斯坦：嗯，马萨诸塞州最高法院的卡普兰法官，他没有出现在历史书中，但他可能会出现。他是一个公正而严谨的人，就像卡普兰这个词一样，公正而严谨。他有点像丹尼·卡尼曼（Danny Kahneman），他对每一个字都很着迷。他对自己也很挑剔，对他的职员也很挑剔。有一次，在我开始之前，有人告诉我，他要把你带到相当于木棚的地方，并威胁要解雇你，果然，这件事发生了，我的反应很激烈。</p><p>我对他说：“这不公平。”这真是一次邂逅。第二天他说：“你还在生我的气吗？”这是对我人性的认可。我说：“我仍然认为你不公平。”我们成了好朋友，我从他身上学到了很多东西。他曾是哈佛教授，也许是他这一代人中最好的哈佛教授，而且他是一位非凡的法官。马歇尔是一位历史人物，比生活更伟大，充满幽默、机智和道德承诺，但从未引起人们的注意。这更多是关于人的。这从来都不是关于他自己的。我从马歇尔那里学到的是，律师通常（至少在最高法院一级）关注纸面内容并思考，论点是否可靠？另一种纸是更好的纸吗？谁，哪位律师在优先权和法规方面的争论更有优势。</p><p>马歇尔当然想到了所有这些事情，但他看到了纸人的背后。这对我来说是一个持久的教训，有人是脆弱的，或者不是脆弱的，但他是一个在案件中处于危险之中的人。</p><p>他一直想知道这些人是谁，以及他们的实际利害关系是什么。在成千上万的类似情况中，他们可能是投资者，他们可能是工人，他们可能是公司，他们会受到什么影响？他所指出的这一点比当时的任何一位法官，而且我认为也许比历史上的任何一位法官都更重要。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你完成了你的职员工作，然后去了芝加哥大学，最终在那里担任了 27 年的教授。这跑得真好。是什么让芝加哥成为如此特殊的教学地点？</p><p>桑斯坦：我应该说，我确实有过一些介于两者之间的经历，这不像在巴黎度假或当商店扒手。</p><p>我在司法部呆过一段时间……</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>桑斯坦：我在卡特和里根领导下的法律顾问办公室工作了一年，该办公室就总统提议的行动的合法性向总统提供建议。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：因此，与在最高法院面前辩论的副检察长不同，这是直接与美国总统合作。</p><p>桑斯坦：是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：还有他的员工。</p><p>桑斯坦：好吧，当你直接说时，确实如此，只是我与里根总统的会面次数为零。 The number of mediated interactions I had with President Reagan was about five, and the amount of work that I did for the president was basically every day.</p><p> So the Solicitor General&#39;s office argues the cases in front of the Supreme Court, the Office of Legal Counsel resolves conflicts, eg between the State Department and the Defense Department, or if the President says, “Can I make a treaty, or can I fire the air traffic controllers, or can I do something about civil rights?” The Office of Legal Counsel is the one that answers that question.</p><p> And I think it&#39;s at least as interesting as the Solicitor General&#39;s office, because you&#39;re not pleading to a court, “Please agree with us.” you&#39;re actually resolving a controversy. And it&#39;s kind of in between being a judge, you write opinions, kind of like a judge, and you are part of a political operation that is the executive branch. And if the president wants to do something, you&#39;re not indifferent to the fact that the president wants to do that. But saying no is a very honorable tradition in that office. And we said no plenty. And one reason you say no is the president has an obligation to take care of the laws be faithfully executed.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And that&#39;s solemn.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do we still do that anymore? Have we kind of waved that off?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: No, that still happens. So under recent presidents, all of them, the Office of Legal Counsel has occasionally said no. Now in some times, the Office of Legal Counsel is more politically, let&#39;s say, what&#39;s the right word?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Compromised?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I want to use a softer word, but that&#39;s not a bad word.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I don&#39;t have to. I have no ties to the legal community, so I could drop whatever bombs I want. I know you need to be a touch more circumspect than I.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I think it is correct to say that the legal independence of the Office of Legal Counsel varies over time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Okay, that&#39;s fair.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: But by tradition, it is not just a lackey. And then, as you say, I went to the University of Chicago. I went there because I was fearful that being a professor would be like retiring in your 20s. And I thought, that&#39;s not what I want to do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The last landed gentry in America are tenured professors, I&#39;ve heard someone say.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s what I was fearful of. So I thought, you know, I was in the Justice Department, I clerked for the Supreme Court, I had career plans, and the idea of just sitting in an office and thinking, what ideas do I have, that didn&#39;t feel really like living. It felt more like stultifying.</p><p> But at the University of Chicago, the faculty was full of dynamism and energy. And whether they were producing new ideas about the economic analysis of law or new ideas about what freedom means or new ideas about the securities law, it was like, it was electric. It was like Paris. And the University of Chicago Law School at that time was as lively an intellectual community as, They say Vienna at one point was like that, and Berlin at one point was like that, and Cambridge and Oxford at some points have been like that, Chicago was like that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Are you still a quote “Chicago person through and through?”</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I wouldn&#39;t say that. I think that everyone is themselves, rather than a Chicago person or a New Yorker, forgive me for those who consider themselves New Yorkers, you&#39;re yourself. But I was certainly inspired by and influenced by the fact that at Chicago, there was and is intense curiosity and a sense that trying to figure out what&#39;s true is thrilling and noble.</p><p> So I saw Gary Becker, who won the Nobel of the great Chicago economist who was almost a law professor, who was around all the time. Man, did he think I was full of nonsense.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And when he would ask me questions in his workshop, the feeling of you are wrong was combined with a feeling of respect that I&#39;ll never forget. He was a giant and I was a nothing.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wait, wait, wait, I have to interrupt you here. So you come out of clerking not for one Supreme Court, but a state and the Supreme Court, then you are serving the White House in the Office of General Counsel, and suddenly you&#39;re a 1L being pulled on again, feeling that panic rise, am I going to get this wrong and be embarrassed in front of everybody?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Well, a little like that. So I was in my 20s, mind you, and I remember a dinner that Dick Posner had for me as a newcomer to the University of Chicago and George Stigler, who was also a Nobel Prize guy, was there and he asked me what I taught and I was teaching welfare law. And that was one of my courses.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: In Chicago.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: In Chicago, and it was about social security law and anti-poverty law. George Stigler said, “Why would you teach that? “There aren&#39;t any poor people in America.” And he had written a paper showing that if you earn $6 a week or something, purporting to show, I should say, if you have $6 a week, you&#39;re going to be fine. And my reaction to that was, your name may be Stigler and you may have been a Nobel, but I don&#39;t believe a second that that paper is correct. And he was much smarter and more learned than I was. And it was a terrible dinner.</p><p> But I did have back then, maybe now, a sense that I&#39;m going to give it my best shot. And I didn&#39;t have a sense that I was necessarily wrong. And I remember Stigler&#39;s fierceness, and he was, Becker was a great man who was respectful as well as skeptical. Stigler was contemptuous as well as curious about who was this young fool who was at our dinner party.</p><p> But Dick Posner, who was there, who was also a giant, was, at that dinner, he was kind. So he saw I was in trouble because Stigler was so amazingly smart and quick. And Posner, who agreed with Stigler, came to my defense, and that was the start of a great friendship.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really quite interesting. And thank goodness there are no poor people in America, because just think about how uncomfortable it would be to see homeless in big cities and people unable to pay for medical care. I mean, what sort of a country has that sort of thing? I mean, thank goodness he was right.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, we probably need a progressive income tax or something and jobs programs and educational opportunity.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So here is the fascinating irony about your career starting in Chicago and now you&#39;ve been at Harvard for quite a while, back and forth to public service, but still at Harvard Law School for quite a while. It seems like those are the end points on the intellectual spectrum, at least in terms of legal thought.</p><p> Am I overstating that or is that fair?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It&#39;s a great question. So Chicago when I was there was the center of right of center legal thought. It had a very large percentage of the most influential right of center people and they were fantastic and they continue to be great friends. Harvard was the place where critical legal studies was born. It&#39;s kind of not a thing anymore, but that was the left of center to law and economics, which was the right of center.</p><p> I thought even when I was at Chicago, though, I wasn&#39;t right of center. I thought law and economics was extremely important and kind of on the right track. And I thought critical legal studies was a bunch of adjectives and nouns and not really adding up to much. But I admired at Harvard the constitutional law people who were fantastically clear-headed about the law for sure. And I admired the students at Harvard who were so diverse in terms of intellectual interests and intellectual background and politics and everything. Chicago has intellectual diversity too, but it&#39;s just smaller.</p><p> So I felt that Harvard was a little like New York City and Chicago was a little like Boston. Smaller, more tightly connected, everyone to everyone else, and I love them both.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you work at Harvard with some just legendary professors. Did you overlap with Guido Calabresi when he was, I think, dean of-</p><p> SUNSTEIN: You know, he was at Yale, and I know him very well, and I love him dearly, and he&#39;s 90-something now, and he was a great influence on me, and Harvard and Yale often have intellectual interactions that are breeding a friendship, and Chicago and Yale also, and Calabresi was a founder of economic analysis of law, and a little more, let&#39;s say, focused on poor people, and people are struggling, then Chicago Economics, so there&#39;s a Yale school and a Chicago school, and Calabresi, I can&#39;t quite say he was a mentor, but he feels like that to me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And Lawrence Tribe, probably the preeminent constitutional law scholar in the country, is that, am I, again, am I overstating that, or is that a fair-</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I think it&#39;s a little like basketball, and some people like Michael Jordan, and some people like LeBron James, and some people-</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You can&#39;t go wrong with either, right?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And Bill Russell, of course, was the greatest winner of all time. Tribe was my teacher.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, really?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And he was maybe of the three, the most like Michael Jordan. His intellectual athleticism was and is…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Next level.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Next level. And when he was my teacher, he was charismatic, he was clear, he was bursting with ideas. He was writing his great treatise at the time. And it was a bonfire of thinking, in a constructive, bonfires destroy, Tribe didn&#39;t destroy anything. And I thought he was dazzling. And he wrote a letter for me actually for my Supreme Court clerkship with Justice Marshall, which I&#39;m very grateful for. He&#39;s still a great friend. And, you know, he&#39;s in many ways, he&#39;s different from me in the last years, particularly. He&#39;s more politically engaged in a way that is not my typical style, but I&#39;m full of admiration for him.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really quite interesting.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk a little bit about this program. What leads to something like this coming about? It doesn&#39;t sound like your typical law school sort of class.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely. So there has been, as I think everyone&#39;s aware now, an explosion of work in behavioral economics and behavioral science about human behavior. So we know how people depart from perfect rationality. So people are often focused on short-term, not the long-term. They&#39;re often unrealistically optimistic. Their attention is limited. They can be manipulated because they&#39;ll focus on one or two features of, let&#39;s say, a product rather than seven. And that means they&#39;ll get two features they like and five that they in the long run will despise. So we know a lot about that.</p><p> This has major implications for law. So with respect to fiduciary obligations, let&#39;s say of a fiduciary, what do they have to tell people and what do they have to make clear to people and not just tell people? And behavioral science tells us a lot about that.</p><p> If we&#39;re thinking about free speech law and we&#39;re thinking about the marketplace of ideas, behavioral science, behavioral economics might tell us something about how people get confused or fooled. If we&#39;re talking about property law, tort law, or contract law, there has to be a sense of how people are going to react to what the law is doing. So if the law has a default term, let&#39;s say, that you have to perform in a reasonable time, and let&#39;s say the company that&#39;s doing the performance thinks a reasonable time means maybe next year. What does the law do about that? And so there are a zillion questions. Algorithms and AI are kind of top of mind now for the law to try to figure out that have a behavioral feature. And that&#39;s kind of what we&#39;re doing with our program.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That sounds really interesting.</p><p> I&#39;m assuming since you co-authored “Nudge” with Dick Thaler, which came first, working with Thaler or the program on behavioral economics and public policy?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I&#39;ll tell you a story. Before I met Thaler, I was overwhelmed in the best way by the work of Kahneman and Tversky and Thaler. So I thought, this is the thing. And I started to work on some papers, one of which was called “Behavioral Analysis of Law.” And then Thaler came to the University of Chicago and we started having lunch together. And I started working with him when he was working on a paper with a law professor named Christine Jolles that I thought was going too slowly. And I said, “If you don&#39;t write that paper, “I&#39;m going to write my paper, and it might steal your thunder. It won&#39;t be as good as yours, but it&#39;ll be earlier.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And Dick said, and this was a fantastic moment for me, he said, “Why don&#39;t you join us?” And we wrote it together. So I was intrigued by the behavioral stuff before I met Thaler, after I met Thaler, I had the world&#39;s best partner on this stuff. And then when I went to Harvard, our program that followed, and some of it involves nudges, some of it has nothing to do with nudges, but all of it has to do with behavioral science.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you also co-wrote “Noise” with Danny Kahneman. It seems that there&#39;s a theme in all your books, “Nudge”, “Noise”, “Sludge”. You&#39;re constantly looking at the decision-making process and not just from an academic perspective, but how it affects people in the real world, how it affects organizations, how it affects individuals. Tell us a little bit about the integration of behavioral finance and behavioral economics with law.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, well, let&#39;s talk a little bit about groups, shall we?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: If you get a group of like-minded people together, they typically end up thinking a more extreme version of what they thought before they started to talk. So if you get a group of people who tend to think, you know, we ought to invest in X, take your pick. Soap, there&#39;s a new kind of soap. We ought to invest in X. That&#39;s the average view. Soap, everyone needs to be clean. And with climate change, soap is going to be crazy. Soap companies. If that&#39;s the average view, but I&#39;m starting to convince myself, by the way, to invest in soap companies, which is probably not necessarily right, let&#39;s put it that way.</p><p> If people talk with one another and they start with an initial disposition, they tend to think an extreme version of what they thought. They become more confident, more unified, and more extreme.</p><p> This is a real problem for companies. It&#39;s a real problem for law. We have data suggesting if you get three judges who are let&#39;s say Democratic appointees on a court of appeals, not two Democratic appointees and one Republican, three Democratic appointees, the likelihood of a left of center opinion shoots up really dramatically. That&#39;s a crazy finding, because if you have two Democratic appointees on a three judge panel, they have the votes. They don&#39;t need that Republican appointee, but they are much more moderate, and it&#39;s symmetrical. Three Republican appointees are much more right wing in their voting patterns than two Republican appointees on a panel with one Democratic appointee.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So groupthink, even amongst judges, is worse if there&#39;s three of them and no countering voices versus, hey, we have a majority and we&#39;re going to sign how we want, but everybody kind of wants to be rational and cooperative? Is that the suggestion?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And here&#39;s the really cool thing. There was a book called “Groupthink” a few decades ago. It&#39;s a fantastic term. It&#39;s not clear what groupthink is, and if we clarify what it is, it&#39;s not clear whether it exists. So the rigorous efforts to test groupthink have a bunch of question marks. But there&#39;s something like groupthink which does exist, which is a testable hypothesis, which is if you get a group of people, it will end up after deliberation in a more extreme point in line with its pre-deliberation tendencies. So that&#39;s a mouthful. But let&#39;s suppose you have a group of six people deciding whether to invest in soap or instead electric cars. Those are the options. So let&#39;s say four of them think soap and two of them think electric cars and they think the same thing, they think what they do with equal intensity.</p><p> At the end of the discussion, the prediction is the group is going to go soap, soap, soap, soap, soap, and it&#39;s going to do that with a considerable confidence as well as unanimity. That will be the statistical regularity. And I&#39;ve done work on political issues, climate change, affirmative action, same sex stuff, where if you get a group that has a conservative disposition, they go whoosh to the right after they talk with one another. If they have a left of center disposition, they go whoosh to the left after they talk with one another. And Kahneman and I did a study with this on punitive damages, jury awards, where if a jury&#39;s mad at a company, they&#39;re going to be super mad at a company after they talk with one another, which helps explain why punitive damages are both unpredictable and often really, really high.</p><p> So that&#39;s the logic.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s take that basic concept and apply it to online, where you have social media and all sorts of trolling activities and you end up with conspiracy theories like QAnon. How should public policy deal with these sort of things between anti-vaxxers and anti-democratic election deniers. This is a genuine threat to the health and safety of the country.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: So back in 2000, I agreed to write a book for Princeton University Press called “Republic.com.” And I had a title, but I didn&#39;t have a book. And I had six months of failure, like unbelievable failure, like either nothing or it was terrible.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You sound like Danny Kahneman.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I was worse than Kahneman because what he didn&#39;t like in his own work, his work is actually good. What I produced in those six months was in fact horrible. I still have it somewhere. But then I thought, okay, the real problem is echo chambers and the absence of shared exposure to things. And then when I thought echo chambers, shared exposures, I sketched out nine chapters and I wrote a chapter a day and I had a book after nine days. I&#39;ve never had anything like that. It was like a frenzy, a happy frenzy of book writing. And that book has now gone through three editions. It was first called “Republic.com.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “Hashtag Republic Divided Democracy In The Age Of Social Media”, that one?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s the very recent one. And it&#39;s exactly on your point. So what should be done by various actors I think is a really hard question, but the existence of the problem is palpable. If you&#39;re thinking about yourself just as an individual, to try to be exposed to diverse ideas is a really good idea. There are apps, there&#39;s one, I don&#39;t know if it still is working, I hope so, it&#39;s called “Read Across the Aisle”, where you can tell whether you&#39;re just reading one kind of thing or another kind of thing. So there&#39;s self-monitoring. I know that some social media platforms have thought hard about how to handle the echo chamber phenomenon, and hard also about how to think about the misinformation problem.</p><p> And there are various things that behavioral scientists would counsel consideration of, including warnings, including reduced circulation levels, including in extreme cases, very extreme cases, taking things down, not through government, because then there&#39;s a First Amendment issue, but through voluntary action. And one size doesn&#39;t fit all, but I agree this is a very serious challenge.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So a different book, I assume, is “On Rumors, How Falsehoods Spread and Why We Believe and What Can Be Done”. It seems like we are very predisposed to believe nonsense if it confirms our prior beliefs. We believe what we want to believe and who cares about the facts?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so here let&#39;s talk about three things, might we? The first is if I tell you that it&#39;s raining outside right now, you aren&#39;t going to think “He&#39;s fooling me, it&#39;s sunny and beautiful outside.” You&#39;re probably going to think “Maybe I should get an umbrella.” So when people hear something, and there&#39;s probably a good evolutionary explanation for this, under ordinary circumstances, they think it&#39;s true. And that truth bias, as it&#39;s sometimes called, is essential if we try to live in a world in which we thought everything people said was false, we couldn&#39;t get through a day.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Cooperative primates in a social group provide a survival advantage, so you&#39;re not inclined to disbelieve someone looking in your eye and telling you something.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely, but truth bias can lead us in really terrible directions, and that&#39;s independent of motive. So I don&#39;t need to want to think it&#39;s raining to think if someone tells me it&#39;s raining, it&#39;s umbrella time. That&#39;s one, truth bias.</p><p> The other thing is confirmation bias, where if we&#39;re told things that fit with what we think, we tend to like that, and we tend to believe it because it fits with what we think. And that can aggravate the problem of echo chambers where people&#39;s confirmation bias is being catered to.</p><p> So if you think the thing is your investment in X is really going great, even though all the indication is that it&#39;s risky, the confirmation, the confirmatory material will have credibility.</p><p> We have recent data suggesting there&#39;s a third thing, which is I think cooler than truth bias or confirmation bias, its name is desirability bias. And it&#39;s like confirmation bias, except it&#39;s different. And maybe I like it because of the phenomenon it draws attention to, because I find it desirable in a way that indicates it&#39;s fun.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So the desirability bias appeals to your own desirability bias.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, it does because it fits with my conception of human nature.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, so a little confirmation bias there, wow.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Both, but let&#39;s pull them apart a bit. So desirability bias means that people believe things if they find it enjoyable to believe them, where enjoyable is a big concept. So it might mean it makes them smile, it might make them feel secure, it might mean it makes them feel pleased, it could make them feel grateful, it can be any number of things. But desirability bias and confirmation bias are emphatically not the same thing.</p><p> You might hear something that fits with your belief, that is like you&#39;re really sick, but you don&#39;t want to believe that because you don&#39;t want to believe you&#39;re really sick. And so if something is disconfirming but desirable, the data we have suggests that the desirable will beat the confirmatory. So if you think the economy&#39;s going to go sour and then you learn that&#39;s not true, you might well be extremely credulous, meaning willing to believe the happy thing, even though it&#39;s disconfirming of your belief.</p><p> So desirability bias means things that please us we will tend to believe, even if they are disconfirming of what we start believing.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really intriguing. What I find so fascinating about confirmation bias is the underlying investment in the model of the world our brains create. I think our brains consume 25% of our daily energy. And so the models we create over time, we are so reluctant to challenge. We don&#39;t want to look for disconfirming evidence because hey, we have all these sunk costs over here to bring up another fallacy. Tell us a little more about how you test for desirability bias and how it manifests in things like public policy.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so let&#39;s talk a little bit about confirmation bias.</p><p> If I believe that the Holocaust happened, if I read something saying it didn&#39;t happen, I will dismiss that, not because I&#39;m pleased that the Holocaust happened, but because I am so clear that the Holocaust happened, that the information that&#39;s inconsistent with my belief has no credibility. So it&#39;s Bayesian. It&#39;s not about motivation. So I believe that dropped objects fall. If a magician comes to me and says, “You know, you&#39;re not quite right on that,” I will think, “Magician, you&#39;re pretty good at your job, but I really believe dropped objects fall.” It&#39;s not about my motivations. It&#39;s just what I start with.</p><p> So a lot of what we call confirmation bias is Bayesian updating, given our priors, we dismiss what is disconfirming on the ground that how can it be true that dropped objects don&#39;t fall? Or how can it be true that Bill Russell isn&#39;t the greatest winner in the history of organized sports? I have actually an emotional investment in that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I was going to say, one sports opinion which is emotion, the other is physics, but hold that aside. So desirability bias, even if disconfirming, seems to have a great resonance within ourselves, why do we think that is?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so that&#39;s about motivation. Desirability bias isn&#39;t about rational updating, it&#39;s only about motivation. Here&#39;s something that pulls them apart, I&#39;m going to give a simplified version of the best data I&#39;m aware of on this, where people in the 2016 election who favored Trump or Clinton also had predictions about whether Trump or Clinton would win before the election.</p><p> Let&#39;s take Clinton voters. If they thought that Trump would win, and then they were given information that suggested Clinton would win, they found it particularly credible. Now, that was disconfirming information. It suggested what they believed would happen was false, but it was pleasing information. It suggested that the information they were receiving would make them smile rather than suffer. And it worked exactly the same for Trump voters who thought that Trump would lose, but then when they got information suggesting that Trump would win, they thought, I&#39;ll believe that. And it&#39;s because it was desirable.</p><p> So we&#39;re just learning about desirability bias. It has an overlap with optimism bias. It has implications for law. So in law, among real lawyers, you can create something pretty funny instantly, which is you tell them, you know, imagine you&#39;re representing the plaintiff in a lawsuit. What are the chances the person will win? They say really high. If you ask the same kind of people you&#39;re representing the defendant, what&#39;s the chance the defendant will win? They say the chances are really high. So you can instantly put people in the role of plaintiff&#39;s lawyer or defense counsel, and that their predictions about outcomes will fit with what they think is desirable, given the role they assumed 30 seconds ago.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So that&#39;s kind of interesting. Let&#39;s relate this to another book, “How Change Happens.” When we look at things, sexual harassment, smoking, white supremacy, gay rights, climate change, seems like there&#39;s been an ongoing evolution. Some of these things are very gradual. Even things like seatbelts took suddenly, I think the number today is something like 10 or 15% of people don&#39;t use seatbelts, but the number was 40% to 50% for long, long periods of time until we started with the beeping to nudge them to do that. So tell us a little bit, how does social change happen? Is this Hemingway-esque or is it continually gradual and not all at once?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Well, okay, so to understand this, we need to have some moving parts.</p><p> One thing is that people have in their heads beliefs and desires that they don&#39;t tell anyone about. So you might think, I think that violence against people of color is pervasive and horrible, or you might think, I think meat eating is a really bad idea, or you might think, I think gun rights are very important and it&#39;s terrible that there are people in the United States who are seeking to disarm the American public.</p><p> Okay, people who think all of those three things at some point over the last 50 years have shut up, thinking if they say any of those things, they will be ostracized or disliked or something.</p><p> Think of political correctness writ large. Sometimes what happens, and this is the first moving part, is that people are given a permission slip. So it might be that a political candidate says, “Black lives matter.” Or it might be that a prominent female actor says, “I was sexually harassed, and if you were too, say #MeToo on Twitter.”</p><p> Or it might be that someone says, “I think people should be allowed to get married, regardless of whether they want to marry a man or a woman, regardless of their gender, and it&#39;s a free country” go for it. And then people will feel licensed to say what they had shut up about.</p><p> And for many social movements, the fall of communism is an example, the rise of the Federalist Society in the United States is another example, I saw that in real time, the success of President Trump, the success of President Obama, for all their differences, those all involved in significant part, people being given a permission slip that they never had before.</p><p> A second thing that matters is that whether we want to participate or endorse a social change depends on what our threshold is for doing that. Now, it might be a threshold for becoming active. It might be a threshold for just voting for someone. It might be a threshold for saying something. And we all have different thresholds and we probably don&#39;t know what they are. So if you think of some movement for something, a lot of people participated in it, maybe the civil rights movement that Martin Luther King helped lead.</p><p> And there were people who had a very low threshold, they were just going to go for it. And there are others who would join if a certain number of people joined. And the thresholds really matter and we don&#39;t know what their distribution is in advance and it has to play itself out. So that happened with seatbelt buckling.</p><p> And the third thing, which is maybe most important, is social influences. So you might buckle your belt if everyone else is buckling their belt. There are other people who won&#39;t buckle their belt if no one&#39;s buckling their belt. I remember a time when if you buckled your belt, you were saying that the driver is extremely dangerous or you were saying that you were yourself really cowardly and timid. And who wants to buckle their belt and accuse a friend of being an unsafe driver or disclose that you&#39;re a terrified, scared rabbit? And now buckling a seat belt doesn&#39;t accuse the driver and doesn&#39;t confess timidity and the social norm changed.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Can I share a quick story? I had Bob Schiller on the show a couple of times and once he had to go someone from here and we took a cab together, I think it was to the New York Times building. And we got into the back of the cab and Bob buckles his safety belt in the back of the cab.</p><p> I&#39;m like, well, here&#39;s a guy who studies behavioral finance and is an economist, I hadn&#39;t really, I always wear my seatbelt when I&#39;m driving, or in the front seat, you get into the back, you don&#39;t even think about it. Maybe I&#39;ve been overlooking this. Because of who he was and all the social proof involved, it changed my perspective on wearing a seat buckle, seatbelt in the back of a car. It was just like exactly what you&#39;re describing, suddenly the whole framework completely shifted.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, that&#39;s fantastic. That&#39;s a great example. And something like that is happening, you know, for non-political issues, for economic choices, for investment decisions. And it happens really fast. So you can see a flood of movement towards something or away from something just because people think that other people are joining that flood.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk a little bit about this book. I&#39;m kind of intrigued by the idea that you started writing this in the 1990s. Is that possibly correct?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That is correct.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: 30 years, I thought you were so prolific. Why so long?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It&#39;s a slow burn. This book is a slow burn. So I thought the idea of how we decide how we decide, it&#39;s one of the most fundamental things of all. And I thought there should be a book on this and I co-authored a paper on it in the 1990s, but I never figured it out until yesterday.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So how has your thinking about decision-making evolved over that time?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I think the fundamental idea, which was developed in a paper with a philosopher named Edna Ullman-Margalit, is that we have an identifiable set of strategies. It&#39;s going to be very intuitive when we&#39;re stuck. So we might flip a coin. We might decide who&#39;s an expert. I&#39;ll trust the expert. We might decide, I&#39;m not going to marry her, I&#39;m going to live with her. That&#39;s like a really small step.</p><p> We might decide that, you know, I&#39;m just going to opt, where it&#39;s not about flipping a coin, it&#39;s not like picking, flipping a coin, it&#39;s like I&#39;m going to do something really big, like jump over a chasm. Or it might mean we might think that we&#39;re going to adopt a rule. No liquor ever, except maybe Saturday night. And if you think about business decisions, each of these strategies is used all the time, sometimes deliberately. The head of a company will say, “Here&#39;s our rule,” or will say, “If we&#39;re stuck, “we&#39;re going to go to this person,” or will say, “You know, it&#39;s a coin flip.” And we&#39;re not as disciplined sometimes as we should be in thinking about these, but that&#39;s the basic framework. What I hadn&#39;t thought through was, how do we decide whether to acquire information? How do we decide what to believe? How do we think about algorithms? How do we think about freedom?</p><p> And these questions, which are all basically part of the same thing, were stirring around in the head and I kind of figured out at least provisional responses to the questions in the course of the book.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So opt, delegate, no, believe are the four big frameworks. But given your background in behavioral finance, let&#39;s talk a bit about biases. how should we contextualize heuristics that can derail our cognitive processes when someone is trying to make a rational decision? Maybe they do, maybe they don&#39;t.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so one bias is present bias, where today really matters, and the future is a foreign country called later land, and we&#39;re not sure we&#39;re ever going to visit. And that actually has roots in the brain, present bias. And we know if we&#39;re making investment choices, if we think what we want to really maximize is wealth this week, that&#39;s probably dumb. It&#39;s going to produce a lot of problems. This is your field, of course. And we might decide we&#39;re just going to adopt a rule for investments which will counteract our own present bias.</p><p> Or we might think in state government, let&#39;s say, that unrealistic optimism is part of the human species. Thank goodness for that. If you&#39;re being chased by a lion, you ought not to think the lion&#39;s faster than I am. I&#39;m going to die soon. You ought to think I can really run. That&#39;s optimistic. It&#39;s probably unrealistically optimistic.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Or just run faster than the guy you&#39;re with, right?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely, completely. And then the lion will eat that other person who is profoundly to be hoped is not a dear friend. So optimistic bias can create problems.</p><p> So we might think that given unrealistic optimism with respect to medical decisions, we&#39;re just going to rely on the doctor. That&#39;s one thing you might do.</p><p> Or you might think if you&#39;re a judge, you might think I&#39;m prone to mistakes with respect, this might be the future, I&#39;m prone to mistakes with respect to dealing with certain kinds of people, let&#39;s call them criminal defendants, and sentencing, I might be biased against one group or another, I don&#39;t even know, and I&#39;m going to rely on the algorithm.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m always fascinated by the sentencing studies that show the longer a judge is sitting on the bench that day, the closer we are to lunch, the worse the sentences are. It seems almost as if they&#39;re not algorithms, they&#39;re fallible humans making decisions, some of which are not great.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, the most fun of these kinds of studies is if the judge&#39;s football team won over the weekend, the judge is more lenient on the next day than if the football team lost.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Amazing.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk about some other influences. We&#39;ve talked about social media and mass media and there&#39;s misinformation is ripe. There&#39;s even propaganda on social networks. How does that impact our decision-making process? Especially if it seems the people most affected are the least aware of these very, very below the radar or not so below the radar influences?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: This is a fantastic question. And here&#39;s something over the last maybe 15 years, when Dick Thaler and I started working on “Nudges” we were, and we remain, very upbeat about the potential use of GPS-like things. to help overcome people&#39;s biases. When I say GPS-like things, I mean a GPS device, it&#39;s a nudge, it helps you get you where you want to go, it gives you the best route. If you don&#39;t like what it says, you can ignore it, so it&#39;s completely freedom producing, or freedom maintaining.</p><p> And then there are other things like a package that says “This has shrimp in it” I personally am allergic to shrimp, so hooray for that disclosure. or you can have something that tells you a warning about side effects and they might be relevant to your choices. These are all nudges.</p><p> Okay, and they are designed to help people deal with their cognitive limits. They might involve a bias, they might involve an absence of information. But we know, and this is what at least I wasn&#39;t sufficiently alert to in 2008, that self-interested or malevolent types can use behavioral biases to manipulate people.</p><p> So you might use present bias to try to get people to buy some product where the long-term economic effects are horrifying, though the first week is going to be pretty good, or you might get people to buy some product where you&#39;d have to be crazy optimistic to think it&#39;s a sensible thing to do because the risks associated with it are horrible, or, and I think this is the most fiendish of all, you might use people&#39;s limited attention to get them, let&#39;s say, to opt into something, which is going to be really hard to opt out of, and once they&#39;ve opted into it, they&#39;re stuck with something that&#39;s going to be very expensive and not beneficial.</p><p> So the manipulation of people, we&#39;re just talking about the economic sphere right now, poses a very serious challenge and social media, et cetera, make this unprecedentedly doable. I&#39;ve worked with private sector entities which are trying to use behavioral stuff to improve outcomes for their customers and their investors, and that&#39;s fantastic.</p><p> But there are others who are trying to improve outcomes for themselves, which is also fantastic, but not if it&#39;s at the expense of the most vulnerable.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned present bias, I love this Danny Kahneman quote, “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you&#39;re thinking about it.” That really says everything. Talk about present bias. In the moment, it&#39;s very hard to let anything else come into the picture. How should we act around that? And how should public policy be set up to not let people&#39;s wetware be taken advantage of?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: No, that&#39;s fantastic. So the only exception to Kahneman&#39;s phrase, nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you&#39;re thinking about it, is that statement. That statement is as important as it is when you&#39;re thinking about it.</p><p> So it might be that policy makers can put on people&#39;s view screens things that they&#39;re not thinking about. So let&#39;s say you&#39;re buying some product and that there are add-on fees of various kinds that are findable but not really there and people aren&#39;t thinking about them. To put those add-on prices on people&#39;s view screens is a really good idea for companies actually to do that and use competition to promote fuller clarity on the part of consumers. That&#39;s a really good idea. I think for securities, the securities laws, there&#39;s a lot to say about them. But insofar as they&#39;re trying to prevent people from falling victim to present bias or limited attention or unrealistic optimism, That&#39;s an extremely worthy goal.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite intriguing. So I love this line in the book, “Get drunk on wine, poetry, or virtue,” in “Decisions About Decisions.” Tell us what that means, wine, poetry, or virtue.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so that&#39;s from a poem by Baudelaire, which is the improbable spirit guide of the book. And the title of Baudelaire&#39;s poem is “Get Drunk.” And for a law professor to celebrate a poem with that title is a little unlikely, but I&#39;m going to own it, where what Baudelaire says by “Get Drunk” is basically take life by the horns and be thrilled by it. And there&#39;s also something about human diversity that what makes you get thrilled, maybe wine, good, Don&#39;t overuse it, but go for it. If that&#39;s what gets you thrilled, or if it&#39;s poetry, go for that. Or if it&#39;s virtue, good works. That&#39;s admirable, of course, and if it also is for you, like wine, hooray.</p><p> Now, of course, we&#39;d want to say, I think, that maybe a little more in the way of good works and a little less in the way of wine is a good thing, but that&#39;s a buzzkill on my part, And the point of this part of the book is when we&#39;re making about decisions, about decisions, think about what makes life fabulous. That&#39;s really important. And I think the behavioral types, including yours truly, often may be overweight a little bit. What makes life long and underweight a little bit? What makes life fabulous? So the first generation of behavioral work is really healthier, wealthier, safer, more prosperous, and those are really important. But also, kind of better days. And Baudelaire, get drunk, he&#39;s all over that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I interpreted Baudelaire as consumption, art, and intellect. Those are the three broad topics, which seem to cover a lot of human behavior. But let&#39;s stick with happiness. You referenced some surveys that show people are less happy than ever, even though by any objective measure, whether you&#39;re looking at crime or healthcare or longevity, except for the past couple of years, post-pandemic, or poverty or literacy, or just go down the list, by just about any measure, Americans and humanity as a whole are better off than they were 20, 40, 60 years ago. Why do surveys say people are unhappy? Is there a problem with the survey? Is it 24/7 social media, or do we just not know how good it is?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s a fantastic question. So let&#39;s think about two things. First, day-to-day experience. Are people thinking, that was a great day, Monday was terrific, Tuesday was good, Wednesday not so much. That&#39;s one thing. The other is not day-to-day experience, but what kind of lives are people having? Are they going to the doctor a lot? Are they learning? Are they being treated with respect? People care about two things that happiness doesn&#39;t capture. One is how meaningful their life is, and the other is how much psychological richness or let&#39;s call it diversity in their life they have. So they might have a meaningful happy life, but they might be doing the same thing over and over again. People don&#39;t like that. A lot of people don&#39;t like that so much. They want to do something else.</p><p> So happiness, meaning, psychological richness. And it&#39;s important to say that day-to-day happiness is really important, but it isn&#39;t everything. Now, with the surveys suggesting that some people in some populations, maybe America is less happy now than it was at a certain point. I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s an expressive statement that pandemic time, terrible, or political polarization, I&#39;m not liking that, or whether instead it&#39;s actually, my life isn&#39;t so good. So I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve gotten to the bottom of what the data actually shows about the happiness part. If it is the case that people actually are less happy, if that&#39;s true, that&#39;s a very serious, not good thing and we want to figure out why.</p><p> When I was in the White House under President Obama, we did, as the government always does do, cost benefit reports, cost and benefits of regulations, and we added stuff on happiness, on subjective well-being. the UK government, they&#39;re very concerned about this. And I do think it&#39;s an important field of endeavor to try to figure out, are people thinking life is great or is it not so great? And is that translated into depression and anxiety, et cetera?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let me push back a little bit on the use of surveys and Amazon&#39;s Mechanical Turk and all these things. So the granddaddy of this in my field is when you are setting up a portfolio for an investor, “Hey, tell us about your risk tolerance. So you conservative, are you moderate? Are you aggressive? What&#39;s your investment posture?” And whatever they tell you is a lie because all they&#39;re really telling you is, here&#39;s how the market has done over the past 90 days. And if it&#39;s gone down, I&#39;m very risk averse. And if it&#39;s gone up, I&#39;m very aggressive.</p><p> Every time I see a survey, I can&#39;t help but think, “How much are you going to spend on Christmas gifts this year? What is the direction of the economy? Are we on the right track or on the wrong track?” I love the surveys right after the presidential election where, what&#39;s the state of the economy? Suddenly the Democrats were here, the Republicans were there, their guy loses, it flips. And then the next election, the same thing happens.</p><p> So what is the value of surveys when people really don&#39;t know what they think, hardly know what they feel, and have no idea what&#39;s going to happen in the future?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s also a fantastic question. I&#39;m doing surveys right now, that is right now, on whether people like algorithms. And so I&#39;m asking people, would you choose an algorithm or a person with respect to an investment decision? Or an algorithm or a person with respect to a vacation? Where are you going to go? or algorithm or a person with respect to health decisions. And I&#39;ll tell you what makes me think that the very preliminary results, you&#39;re going to be the first person to hear it, are not useless. That if you tell people things about the algorithm, which give people clarity on the data on which the algorithm is relying, and like there&#39;s a lot of it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Like the MRI or CAT scans that the algos clearly do better than the humans?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, it&#39;s in the direction of that, what I did. then the percentage of people who embrace the algorithm jumps dramatically. And if you tell people things about the human alternative, like this is a doctor who&#39;s been a specialist in this for 30 years, then the interest in the human being increases significantly.</p><p> So the direction of the results in the survey about which you would rely is consistent with thinking people are attentive to whether the algorithm is just a thing or whether it&#39;s got a terrific data set and whether the person is just a person or someone who has 30 years of experience in the vacation sector, let&#39;s say. So that survey, and it&#39;s top of mind for me because I&#39;m working on it now, seems instructive. And TBD, this might be a book in the fullness of time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I would expect nothing less.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: With respect to happiness, let&#39;s consider three things, shall we? Efforts to measure people&#39;s experience in real time. So like on a scale of one to 10 right now, I&#39;m approximately 10 because I&#39;m really enjoying talking about this. I find that 10, of course I would, but I find people&#39;s answers, how happy are you right now? How anxious are you? How stressed are you? How angry are you? Angry, zero. Stressed, me right now, two. Anxious, me right now, one. And these are all credible in real time. That&#39;s one way of doing it that seems pretty good at getting how people are. If people are in the midst of dealing with a really angry and difficult young child, people will give answers.</p><p> I&#39;m really not having a great time right now. And that&#39;s credible about their emotional state. Then there&#39;s at the opposite spectrum, how satisfied are you with your life? And these are crude because it might be that if people had a really good date the night before, they&#39;ll say, and so, but there is stability on these things and there are within nation differences that are interesting and seems to be telling us something. So there&#39;s a lot of work on whether life satisfaction is kind of crude but directionally informative. I tend to think yes.</p><p> And then there are things in between where you ask people at the end of the day, and Danny Kahneman has pioneered this, called the day reconstruction method. You ask people, “How were you?” This is less demanding for the experimenter than trying to ask people every second, “How are you?” And if you ask people that enough, they&#39;re going to say, “I&#39;m really irritated “because you keep asking me how I am.”</p><p> So Kahneman asks at the end of the day, “How were you when you were taking care of your kids? “How were you when you were on social media? “How were you when you were at work? “How were you when you were commuting?” And the results are pretty credible. People really don&#39;t like commuting, and they really do like, let&#39;s call it intimate relations.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: To say the very least, right.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: That&#39;s the people are very, very positive about that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s quite fascinating. Which leads us to talk about the book you wrote on Star Wars, “The World According to Star Wars.” This became a New York Times bestseller, great reviews. What led a Harvard Law professor to write a book on Star Wars?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: My son, who was six or seven, got obsessed with Star Wars, and we watched it together, and I thought, you know, I like Star Wars. At that point, I wasn&#39;t crazy about Star Wars. And I thought, what is it about Star Wars so that my young boy would go nuts for it when it&#39;s a long time ago?</p><p> And so I got focused on its enduring appeal. And then I thought the idea of writing a book about it was too crazy not to go forth with. And no publisher for a long time had even a little bit interest in it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: So I almost thought I was going to publish it myself as a something. I talked to my literary agent about publishing it myself, which I&#39;d never done before, because I enjoyed it so much. And then at the last minute, a prominent publisher thought, we&#39;ll give this one a try.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We&#39;ll circle back to that concept of people in industries not knowing what works. But right in the beginning of the book, you drop a number that is mind-blowing. The Star Wars franchise has earned $42 billion worldwide. That&#39;s an insane number. How has a movie earned that much money?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It&#39;s probably a lot higher now.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, you have the Mandalorian and Boba Fett and all of the streaming versions and countless, countless animated things. Plus the Disney rides. It really is its own industry.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely. And one thing is that success breeds success. The other thing is that it&#39;s amazing. So the George Lucas ones, especially, I say, apologies, Disney people.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re right with that. You&#39;re okay with that.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Thank you for that. And he did something incredible. So it had a foundation, but he also benefited from a lot of serendipity. That helped.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk a little bit about a concept I love from William Goldman, who wrote “Princess Bride,” and he was the script doctor on “All the President&#39;s Men” and “Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.” just a legend in Star Wars and his concept is nobody knows anything, certainly not about the future, about what might resonate with the public. All the studios originally passed on “Star Wars”, they passed on “Raiders of the Lost Ark”, almost all the publishers rejected JK Rowling. You referenced the Sugarman documentary, which was really quite fascinating. So it really leads to the question, what makes a form of entertainment have this sort of cultural resonance? You mentioned Lucas got lucky. Still, it&#39;s more than just dumb luck. There&#39;s got to be some level of quality there, right?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It has to be great. So another example, I&#39;m writing a book right now called “How to Become Famous”, and it&#39;s about exactly this. And it was inspired by the Beatles, where the Beatles, everybody turned down to the Beatles. They wrote letters to Brian Epstein, the Beatles guy, agents saying, “The boys won&#39;t go.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Guitar music is over.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, and the Beatles themselves said, “We&#39;re in big trouble, we can&#39;t get a record deal.” They became the Beatles. Did they come close to failing?或许。</p><p> Okay, so clearly you&#39;re right, you need quality. But consider the following fact, that John Keats, often thought to be the most beautiful poet in the English language, died at the age of 25. He was very ambitious, he thought he failed, and he put on his grave something like he whose life was written in water. And Jane Austen, maybe the most beloved novelist, was not thought to be the greatest novelist of her time. She wasn&#39;t thought to be the greatest female novelist of her time. How she became Jane Austen is a very complicated story.</p><p> The story of John Keats and Jane Austen is across generations, I think the story of the Beatles and Star Wars within a compressed period where something catches a wave. Now it has to be great to catch a wave. If it&#39;s just someone who doesn&#39;t know how to surf, they&#39;re going to fall. So it has to be great. But what happened with Star Wars, we can talk a bit about the merits, But I think what really happened was social influences, which is not to diminish the amazingness of the “Star Wars” movies, but people wanted to go see “Star Wars” because everyone was going to see “Star Wars.” And that happened early on. So the people thought not to see “Star Wars” is to miss out, it&#39;s like, who do I think I am on this earth not to go see “Star Wars.” I remember that by the way.</p><p> And that wasn&#39;t because it was fantastic, though it was fantastic, it was because other people thought it was fantastic.</p><p> Taylor Swift is a current example. I think Taylor Swift is completely amazing, but her amazingness does not account for the fact that she&#39;s so famous. It&#39;s that people love her. And even people who don&#39;t love her are interested in her or pretend to love her. I&#39;m here to say I&#39;m not pretending to love her. I really loved her. I thought her music was great, even before she was quite what she is now, because Neil Young, who&#39;s one of my heroes, said Taylor Swift is the real deal, and I thought I have to listen to Taylor Swift.</p><p> So this is all around us, and there are people who are not like George Lucas, or not like Taylor Swift, or not like the Beatles, who maybe were about as amazing, but something didn&#39;t happen for them, and we&#39;ve never heard of them, or we will hear of them. Day after tomorrow.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There&#39;s a fascinating section in Derek Thompson&#39;s book, “How Hits Happened”, about how the impressionists were essentially more or less ignored. I think Van Gogh never sold a painting in his lifetime. But one of their members who came from a wealthy family left a whole run of these Impressionist paintings with the edict that left it to the French government and this has to be displayed on the museum and if not, you can&#39;t have them. And very unhappily, the French government did and suddenly it became a sensation. But for that, who knows, Monet, Manet, Pissarro, go down the whole list, may not be part of the pantheon that we look at today.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Completely. I love Derek Thompson&#39;s book, and I think that&#39;s a fantastic example. So one way to think about it is that the phenomenon of power loss is highly relevant to success and failure, where we tend to think of things as linear with respect to growth, but that&#39;s not true for video games, it&#39;s not true for films, it&#39;s not true for novels, it&#39;s not true for art. It&#39;s a power law, this is very slightly technical for yours truly, the English major, not technical for you, the math guy. But if we understand the phenomenon of power laws and how they work, then we&#39;ll get real clarity on spectacular success, including that of Star Wars.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Very much a winner take all sort of phenomena.</p><p> So let&#39;s bring Star Wars back to behavioral economics. You note in the book whenever people find themselves at some sort of a crossroad within Star Wars, the series proclaims you are free to choose. This is the deepest lesson of Star Wars, which kind of reminds me of you and Thaler&#39;s work in “Nudge” in terms of setting up choice architecture. Was that a conscious explanation?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Well, Thaler and I were very focused on preservation of freedom and continue to be. And some of our friends on the left are mad at us because we&#39;re pro-freedom. That&#39;s probably a self-serving way to describe it, but I&#39;m sticking with it.</p><p> The thought of some of our friends on the left is that we need much more in the way of coercion and mandates, and of course they have a role. But Thaler and I are very big on investor freedom, consumer freedom, America, exclamation point. Star Wars is similar. It&#39;s art, it&#39;s not social science. And as between art and social science, at least my current mood, I go for art. And I love them both, but Lucas is an artist. And it&#39;s his soul that&#39;s speaking. And I don&#39;t know how conscious he was about this, though I can tell you a little story if you want.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Go ahead, sure.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Okay, so freedom is the theme. Darth Vader, who&#39;s the worst person in the universe, maybe the second worst, at the crucial moment exercises his freedom because he believes that saving his son is more important than fidelity to the emperor, and he sacrifices everything. That&#39;s his choice, and that saves him. So it&#39;s in some ways a spiritual, even a Christian book about freedom, and this is what makes it, I think, transcendent. My story is that after I did the book, the one person who I was most terrified to see was George Lucas, whom I knew a tiny, tiny, tiny bit. And I was at a big event with maybe 300 people, and there in the distance was George Lucas, and he started walking toward me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Beeline, you see him coming toward you.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, and I thought, he was walking fast, but steadily, and I thought, please God, let Harrison Ford be right in back of me. Please God, let someone whom he knows be in back of me, please God, let him not be walking toward me. But he&#39;s continuing to walk toward me and it&#39;s about 200 yards and now he&#39;s 150 yards away, now he&#39;s 100 yards away. And I thought maybe I can be like some character in Star Wars where I can make myself meld into the floor.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: This is not the law professor you&#39;re looking for.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: No, no, no, no, I thought can I do a mind trick so he doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s me? Or can I make myself really tiny or can I make myself pure liquid? But he&#39;s walking toward me. And then he said the most terrifying words I&#39;ve ever heard. from a human being, which is he said, “I read your book.” And I thought, oh my gosh, what&#39;s going to happen?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Here it comes.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And then he paused and he said, “Without any sense of pleasure,” he said, “I liked it.” And then he said, without any sense of pleasure, no smile. He said, “It&#39;s good.” Then he paused and said, with no smile at all, he said, “You got what I was trying to do.” And then he paused and he said, start to smile. And he said, “But the other books on Star Wars, they&#39;re terrible.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And then he got a big smile and got really happy. And he said, “And you made mistakes.” I loved him so much that he wasn&#39;t going to flatter me, he wasn&#39;t going to say anything, you know, you wrote a good book. But he was as nice as he could be, and he has become a friend. And we talked a bit about the book, and he said at one point, “You have no idea how much work I put into the prequels.” And I said, “Don&#39;t you know who you&#39;re talking to? I wrote a book on this. I know how much work you put in the prequels” and he smiled.</p><p> And then he described one of my alleged mistakes, and I&#39;m not going to disclose what it was because that would be violating of confidence, but I don&#39;t believe it was a mistake at all. I think he was retrofitting something in the genesis of the Star Wars movie.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which he has been known to do.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Which he has been known to do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Very often he engages in little revisionist</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Literary history.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And I think that&#39;s great for a great artist, writer. This was a private conversation where he had no stake in anything, but we argued a little bit. I thought this is pretty surreal that I&#39;m telling George Lucas about the genesis of the “Star Wars” movies, that I&#39;m believing myself rather than George Lucas, and that might have been motivated recently.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Hey, if George Lucas said your book on “Star Wars” was good and the rest of them were not, that&#39;s a giant win. You can&#39;t do much better than that.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I think what he, I like to think-</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s pretty clear that the book, so this is a, your regular books are academic and deeply researched, and they&#39;re not lightweight. This on the other hand is a fun, I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s a lightweight read, but it&#39;s an easy read, and it&#39;s clear a lot of thought depth went into it to say what is the genesis of “Star Wars”, not just the Joseph Campbell man of a thousand faces, but what are the philosophical motivations of Lucas, what is he trying, you know, the relevance about Nixon moving to authoritarian and the freedom, like it&#39;s clear thought went into this and he picked that up.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Yeah, thank you for that.谢谢。</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I only have you for a few minutes. Let me throw you a couple of curveball questions, and then we&#39;ll quickly do our speed round on our favorite questions.</p><p> So you were a professor at University of Chicago, where Richard Posner was also a professor. He once was the most cited law professor in the US until you came along. Tell us a little bit about your relationship with Posner.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: It was very good. So early on he was a giant and he was very skeptical of some of the things I thought, but he was very engaged and very collegial. So it was all substance, not personal. And I just learned so much from him. His comments on my papers, which he thought were bad papers, were instructive comments and they made them less bad papers. Engaging with his thinking was a gift to me and I think as skeptical as I was of maybe 90% of what he thought, I ended up agreeing with maybe 40% of what he thought and I think he wouldn&#39;t want to think of himself as a mentor of mine, but he was.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s address some of the things he thought of. Law and economics initially was considered fairly radical and an extra legislative backdoor to affect the judicial process. Tell us a little bit about his philosophy, which in small measure he recanted after the financial crisis.</p><p> He said, “My core belief is the company&#39;s own desire to preserve their reputations should have prevented them from doing what took place during the financial crisis.” I don&#39;t know how much of a, if that&#39;s a full recant or just a post-financial crisis, what the hell happened, but tell us about his theories.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: So I think the largest contribution Posner made was to think, what are the consequences of law for people and how can we be empirical about that? So is the law contributing to well-being? Is it leading to economic growth? Is it destroying wealth? Is it helping consumers and investors or is it hurting them? And that insistent focus on what are the consequences of law, that was for me then, and I&#39;m smiling now, it was like a breath of fresh air. When I was in law school, we never asked about that. We asked what was analogous to what? And Posner just said, “What does this mean for people?” In a way that had no sentimentality to it, it had numbers. And that&#39;s amazing.</p><p> Then there was the idea that the common law is efficient. So he thought the law of private property, contract, and tort in England and America just is efficient. That&#39;s how he made his reputation. I don&#39;t think that survived, but it&#39;s not crazy false. It&#39;s not wildly inefficient and it&#39;s pretty efficient. So I think that was a fundamental contribution.</p><p> His kind of Chicagoist skepticism about the role for government regulation and such, I think that was really a third order idea. The more fundamentalist think about the consequences. I don&#39;t know what to think about recantation by him. It may be that just under the spell of a horrible economic downturn, he thought there were some things I thought that weren&#39;t right. But more fundamental was his focus on evidence and data than his thinking that I am a Chicago school person.</p><p> And on behavioral economics, my own focus, he really did shift. And he wrote me a note saying he shifted. In the early days, Thaler and I gave a talk at Chicago in which he was fiercely skeptical and he wrote about behavioral economics in a way that was full of dismissiveness and he ended up being, I think the word a convert is accurate and that&#39;s because he thought the evidence supported it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, when you look at the original pre-behavioral model of economics, the fundamental premise is false. Humans are rational profit-maximizers, we&#39;re not. And if your foundation is false, well, how high can that building on top of it go?</p><p> All right, so I only have you for a few minutes. Let&#39;s jump to our favorite questions, our speed round that we ask all of our guests. And let&#39;s start with what&#39;s been keeping you entertained? What are you either listening to or watching these days?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: There&#39;s a show on Netflix called “Vortex,” which I love, love, love, love. It&#39;s French, it&#39;s about time travel.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, really?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And it&#39;s about romance, and it&#39;s about the economy, and it&#39;s about heroism, and it&#39;s about the future and the past, and it&#39;s not to be missed, “Vortex.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We&#39;ll definitely check it out. Do you speak French or are you just a Francophile or?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Je parle un très petit peu.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Un peu. If you haven&#39;t seen “Call My Agent,” strong recommend. It&#39;s absolutely delightful. So you&#39;ve mentioned several mentors. Who helped guide your career?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: I would single out a recently deceased law professor named Lloyd Weinrab who taught a course at Harvard on law and philosophy in undergraduate course, which I took on a kind of flyer and it alerted me to a world I had no idea existed. So I would single out Lloyd Weinreb.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What are some of your favorite books? What are you reading right now?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: My favorite book of all time is “Possession” by AS Byatt. It&#39;s the greatest work of fiction in the English language.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow.</p><p> SUNSTEIN: And I reread it every few years, and it&#39;s completely great. Reading right now, John Stuart Mill&#39;s “The Subjection of Women,” which, because I&#39;m writing about liberalism as a political theory and where it came from, and Mill on equality and liberty is relevant, let&#39;s say.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Just to say the very least. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either law or behavioral finance?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Find things you love and focus on them because even if you don&#39;t succeed spectacularly, at least you will have loved not succeeding spectacularly. And if you focus on the things you really enjoy and love, the chance that you&#39;ll succeed skyrockets.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And our final question, what do you know about the world of law, constitution, nudges, sludges, noise, behavioral finance today that you wish you knew 40 or so years ago when you were first getting started?</p><p> SUNSTEIN: Well, I wish I&#39;d known about the horror of sludge understood as administrative burdens, waiting time, long forms, in-person interview requirements, things that make it so that if you&#39;re kind of doing well in life, but you need help of one kind or another, it&#39;s really hard to get it. Or if you&#39;re struggling in life, let&#39;s say you&#39;re old or you&#39;re sick, or you&#39;re poor, or you&#39;re struggling, you&#39;re lonely, the various administrative burdens we impose on people, they are like a wall that our society erects often inadvertently. Take down that wall, Mr. Whomever.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Quite fascinating.

He has a great ability to identify a variant perception versus the Wall Street consensus and express that view in a deeply researched market position. As we learned in Michael Lewis&#39; book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393338827/thebigpictu09-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Big Short</em></a> , he had the courage of his conviction to stay with his position even as lots of others opposed it. The result was an incredible performance in the mid-2000s through the GFC — when real estate fell 32% nationally, and the S&amp;P 500 crashed 58% peak-to-trough. Every long-only fund was deeply negative.</p><p> I share that caveat because making a bet and staying with it, is very different than making a forecast. What you say in an interview or tweet out during the trading day is <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2015/01/forecasting-is-marketing/">free marketing</a> , costs you nothing, and is typically forgotten.</p><p> Except when people like <a href="https://twitter.com/adamkhootrader/status/1691397274524631040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Khoo</a> &#39;s keep track of what you have been saying. Khoo looked at Michael Burry&#39;s predictions since 2015 and whether markets followed his forecasts or not. It was mostly “not;” Burry, since famously nailing the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, has been looking for a replay of that era to no avail, making regular predictions about an imminent stock market crash.</p><p> Khoo has tracked the result of these forecasts, and they are not exactly generating Alpha:</p><blockquote><p> On Dec 2015, he predicted that the stock market would crash within the next few months.<br /> ->; SPX +11% Next 12 months<br /> On May 2017, he predicted a global financial meltdown<br /> ->; SPX +19% Next 12 months<br /> On Sept 2019, he predicted that the stock market would crash due to a bubble in index ETFs<br /> ->; SPX +15% Next 12 months<br /> On March 2020, he revealed a massive bearish bet<br /> ->; SPX +72% Next 12 months<br /> On Feb 2021, he predicted that the stock market would crash due to a speculative bubble. Shorts Tesla.<br /> ->; SPX +16% Next 12 months<br /> On Sept 2022, he predicted that the stock market warned of more failures, bottom not hit yet.<br /> ->; SPX +21% Next 11 months<br /> On Jan 2023, he predicts a recession and new round of inflation. Says “ SELL”<br /> ->; SPX +17% Year to Date<br /> On Aug 2023, Reveals Short Positions on the SPY and QQQ<br /> ->; SPX ???</p></blockquote><p> I always want to tread lightly when trashing someone else&#39;s forecasts — it&#39;s not that I am on the other side of the trade, or disagree with any single position, or this or that prediction. It&#39;s the entire idea that you as an investor should care about <em>anyone</em> else&#39;s forecasts. If you want to dive into the why of this, see our archive of <a href="https://ritholtz.com/predictions-and-forecasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Predictions and Forecasts</a> — its a great primer to start learning more about the <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2005/06/apprenticed-investor-the-folly-of-forecasting-2/"><em>Folly of Forecasts</em></a> .</p><p> But this specific set of forecasts is problematic for a very specific reason: Forecasters who make one great outlier call correct a) tend to make lots more outlier forecasts; and, b) these tend to be believed by TV viewers.</p><p> We were reminded of this by Joe Keohane, writing at the Boston Globe in 2011:</p><blockquote><p> “How can someone with the insight to be so right about a major event be so wrong about so many other ones? According to a recent study, it&#39;s simple: The people who successfully predict extreme events, and are duly garlanded with accolades, big book sales, and lucrative speaking engagements, don&#39;t do so because their judgment is so sharp. They do it because it&#39;s so bad . 。 。</p></blockquote><p> In other words, it got <em>good to them</em> . What should actually be a once-in-a-lifetime great or lucky prediction becomes their standard operating procedure. Keohane was writing about Nouriel Roubini, but it&#39;s just as applicable to Burry.</p><p> The takeaway for investors is the same as always: If you are going to put capital at risk, make sure you <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2021/04/purposeless-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know why</a> . Understand what you want to get out of markets. And always, <em>Think for yourself.</em></p><p></p><p></p><p> <em>See Also</em> :<br /> <a class="gtrackexternal" href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/09/that_guy_who_called_the_big_one_dont_listen_to_him" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That guy who called the big one?

Direct lending tends to provide more conservative risk-return profiles than leveraged loans and high yield bonds. For investors willing to lock up capital and commit for an extended period, direct lending offers access to an asset class with appealing enhanced yield and downside mitigation.

This gives the ruble less value than a single American cent and represents a loss of nearly 40% of its value since the beginning of the year. The ruble immediately plunged following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It saw an uptick at the end of that year but has been falling ever since.

And… Where&#39;s the SEC?</strong> It reached the point that there were more companies than acquisition targets. So many, in fact, that so far this year SPAC Track says 142 SPACs were liquidated without ever finding a business to merge with. That compares to 144 in all of last year. ( <a href="https://herbgreenberg.substack.com/p/spacs-the-implosion-continues-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herb Greenberg</a> ) <em>see also</em> <strong>Why Most SPACs Suck</strong> : The investing world is as much a victim of Sturgeon&#39;s Law as anything else. Dating back to 1953, this maxim was coined by the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon, who, in response to a critique of his genre made the insightful observation that “90% of everything is crap.” The simple reality is that most human attempts at creation fail, many quite spectacularly. This not as a curmudgeonly observation, but rather, the joyful celebration of how rare true success is.

Debt collection is a fascinating (and frequently depressing) underbelly of finance. It shines a bit of light on credit card issuance itself, and richly earns the wading-through-a-river-of-effluvia metaphor.
