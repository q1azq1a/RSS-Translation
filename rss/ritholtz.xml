主持的商业硕士节目。</p><p> BARRY RITHOLTZ，主持人，商业硕士：本周的播客中，我有一位特别的嘉宾。伊拉娜·韦恩斯坦 (Ilana Weinstein) 回来向我们讲述过去几年她一直在合作的所有竞争性招聘和超级明星人才的情况。对于许多对冲基金行业来说，2022 年无疑是充满挑战的一年，它确实区分了赢家和失败者。</p><p>她具有独特的优势，不仅可以了解对冲基金行业的表现，还可以了解如何成为优秀的 PM 和失败者。业内很少有人像她一样具有洞察力和影响力。我可以继续说下去，但我不想这样做，我只想说一下我与 IDW 的伊拉娜·韦恩斯坦 (Ilana Weinstein) 的对话。</p><p> IDW GROUP LLC 创始人兼首席执行官 ILANA WEINSTEIN： 谢谢巴里，也谢谢您的精彩介绍。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：嗯，很高兴你回来了，而且时机也很完美，因为对冲基金的世界里正在发生很多有趣的事情。但在我们开始之前，让我们先深入了解一下你的背景，我觉得这很有趣。</p><p>你从高盛到哈佛商学院再到波士顿咨询集团。您早期的职业规划是什么？你一生想做什么？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：当我在宾夕法尼亚大学时，我有一个想法，我想成为芭芭拉·沃尔特斯。这就是我的想法。所以我喜欢她作为开拓者的样子。她对人们进行了精彩的采访。她把其他人无法做到的人带到了谈判桌前。她没有接受“不”的回答。我只是觉得，这是她所体现并能够利用的一套非常酷、独特的技能。</p><p>我不知道。我的意思是，我正在研究 19 世纪文学。我的高级论文是关于达尔文主义和托马斯·哈代的。这些都不适合高盛。我最终来到高盛，真的是因为我不想去法学院，因为这就是英语和心理学专业所做的事情。</p><p>里索兹：当然。 –</p><p>韦恩斯坦：对吗？</p><p>所以，我也在大四中期跳槽到高盛，因为我错误地告诉面试我的人我可以立即开始。我已经完成了，我很快就完成了课程。巴里，我在大学时有点书呆子的感觉。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你是在高盛和宾夕法尼亚大学工作了整整四年吗？还是在高盛和宾夕法尼亚大学担任双重职务？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：我大四那年担负着双重职责。嗯，我在大三结束时完成了课程，然后开始在高盛工作。我在大四开始时参加了一些有趣的课程，然后在大四中期开始在高盛工作。但这使我能够做的就是早点去哈佛商学院，因为我处于非周期状态。</p><p>我在商学院的时候真的很年轻。在这段时间内，他们希望您至少拥有五年的工作经验。所以我非常清楚自己没有太多经验。 BCG 确实是一种追赶的方式。就像获得 MBA 学位一样，我并不是想成为一名顾问，而是想了解不同的行业和不同类型的问题。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么是什么引导您进入金融人才方面呢？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：在高盛，你知道，我意识到我并不真正喜欢金融。我可以做这项工作。我的工作做得足够好，进入了一所优秀的商学院，但真正让我兴奋的是——这就是 90 年代的高盛，当时它是一家私人合伙企业，吸引了最杰出的人，一些最杰出和最聪明的人在世界上。与他们打交道并与他们一起工作非常充满活力。</p><p>你知道，在 BCG，甚至回到史岱文森高中，我发现每个人都很聪明。你知道，当我想要置身于一个真正靠一群超级聪明的人为生、向他们学习的环境中。我觉得我能最好地做出贡献的方式是结合我在 BCG 和高盛的经验。 BCG 正在真正深入研究推动行业和公司发展的因素——战略。高盛非常以交易为驱动力，帮助人们从这一方走向另一方，而不仅仅是给他们提供建议。这就是我觉得我可以做出贡献的方式。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我知道我有天生的能力去寻找金融界一些最优秀、最聪明的阿尔法生成器。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：这是怎么发生的？我在 BCG 工作时，正值互联网泡沫变得越来越大。那是我大二的时候，我的全班同学都离开了，去加州创办了一家科技公司。我真的没有——那不是我的事。我对此不感兴趣。不是的，我对此并不热衷。所以我仍在试图弄清楚我的下一步是什么。别忘了我还很年轻。我当时二十多岁。所以我最终加入了一家大型猎头公司，因为我觉得我对现有的不同类型的问题以及如何通过人力资本解决这些问题有了更多的了解。这可能会让我对下一步想做的事情有一些功能上的了解。</p><p>加入他们后我发现我实际上非常擅长他们所做的事情。与此同时，互联网泡沫破灭了。他们的主要金融服务业务——银行业和股票——已经跌落悬崖。渗透进来的是所有的道具组。</p><p>我开始为其中一些团体工作，有点像对冲基金行业，只有这么多优秀且真正受控的团体，并且是最好的且真正控制该生态系统的团体。他们非常有俱乐部精神，他们最终推荐了我，我的生意从此呈指数级增长。他们会向我推荐一位。这些是这些自营团体所关注的第一类产品，非常复杂的金融工具。</p><p>因此，我们都在边走边学，仅仅凭借一次真正的搜索，它就让我成为了专家，因为没有其他人这样做，所以我从那里建立了我的业务。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你在 2003 年创办了自己的公司 IDW。顺便说一句，恭喜你，那是 20 年前的事了，所以今年你要庆祝一个重要的周年纪念日。是什么让你决定我知道我要独自出去？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：这是一个重要的周年纪念日，考虑到对冲基金的平均寿命为三年，我对此并不掉以轻心。我不知道你是否意识到这一点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：生命周期非常短，营业额巨大，而且不仅仅是高水位线。造成这种持续流失的因素有很多。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：没错。我独自出去是因为我真的只想专注于做我感兴趣的工作。我在这家更大的公司内建立了这项业务，主要与这些高辛烷值的道具团队合作，我觉得我可以随身携带它。他们并不真正关心。他们本身就是企业家。他们并不关心自己是一家拥有数百名员工、分布在许多办公室的大公司的一员。他们关心领域专业知识，这就是我提出来的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你提到了许多对冲基金的寿命是众所周知的短。这也是一个竞争异常激烈的领域，因此持久力确实很有价值。您经营自己的商店已经有二十年了。在一个以不长寿着称的空间里，长寿的秘诀是什么？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：让我来定义一下我们的工作，因为我觉得一个公平的误解可能是，作为一家招聘公司，我们的工作是帮助人们找到工作。这实际上不是我们所做的。我们与业内最领先的对冲基金创始人和人才合作，找出下一步发展方向，并让他们保持领先地位。</p><p>当您想到能够应对世界上最具影响力的对冲基金挑战的个人时，您会发现这些人都是最优秀的人。这些人不是通常会寻找的人。</p><p>因此，为了与他们互动，并不是要帮助他们找到工作。这确实为他们提供了他们尚不具备的信息和观点。因此，我希望我的公司能够在趋势、主题方面处于领先地位，并拥有这些人如果不与我们会面就无法理解的观点。我不在乎他们是否进行过交易。我认为，如果我们提出足够有力的理由，他们就会很聪明，如果有意义的话，他们会进行交易并做一些不同的事情。但每次会议我们都会学到更多，并且对下一个人来说我们会更有力量。</p><p>我给你举个例子。我们最近遇到了一位基金经理，他的基金正经历着一段艰难的时期。他们去年损失了 40 亿美元。这么大的高水印。今年他们又跌了。他对创始人对待他的方式感到非常满意。他说：“伊拉娜，我在那里已经有一段时间了。我实际上认为创始人对我非常公平。我没有亏钱。他向我保证今年一百万美元，明年一百万美元。”</p><p>与那些持有类似基金的人进行五次会议确实很有帮助，这些基金的损失也同样大，事实上，他们可能对这些损失负有更大的责任，并且能够告诉他，首先，你的基金，仅根据我的计算，就有2.5亿美元的管理费。所以我不确定这对创始人来说是否如此慷慨。第二，您可能有兴趣知道，这里有四到五个不同的基金处于相同的情况。创始人所做的就是保证他们的员工对损失负有比你更大的责任，是你所得到的损失的四到五倍。</p><p>所以这就是他脑子里开始有点不安的地方。然后我们上升到一个层次，讨论他是否正在学习使他在行业发展中处于领先地位的技能。</p><p>巴里，我想说，这是 20 年智慧的结合，是与无人能敌的最优秀人才交谈的结晶。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我想重点关注这一点，因为你在那里提出了一些非常有趣的观点。当您提到商业智能时，实际上它是对您熟悉的数据的精明使用，但它不在彭博终端上，也没有公开列出，这些都是非常严格掌握的信息。</p><p>你可能会在一个独特的情况下看到很少有人看到的风景。这有多大的优势？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：这就是一切。</p><p>里索兹：这就是一切。真的。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：所以想一想，你很快乐，你做得非常好，或者至少你认为你很快乐。你知道，当我们处理完你的事情时，你可能不会那么高兴。</p><p> （笑声）</p><p>韦恩斯坦：但从任何人的标准来看，你都做得很好。这些都是很大的数字。我们采访过的一些人的薪酬接近九位数而不是八位数。</p><p>里索兹：哇。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：所以这实际上并不是关于被剥夺权利或痛苦或需要找工作。他们不需要交易。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：好吧，这并不像，你知道，你坐在卖方，是的，你知道，你在股票销售台，有人不需要与另一边的高盛进行交易。电话，但他们确实需要与某人进行交易。这些人不需要交易。他们来与我们会面的唯一原因是因为他们会学到一些东西，并且他们会带着一些观点离开，就像我刚才给你的例子，他们没有以前有过。这与我认为大多数招聘公司所做的甚至真正能够做到的动态非常不同。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我知道你的工作与许多最大的对冲基金创始人密切相关。这不是“嘿，我需要填补一个座位。”让我们讨论一下我们想要采用或正在考虑采用的策略，以及我们如何将其落实到位并配备人员。</p><p>请告诉我们一些您所做的工作，这不仅仅是“嘿，我为新兴市场不良债务找到了合适的基金经理。”它比那复杂得多。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：还有更多。想想吧，巴里，当我们正在推动一艘战舰前进时。那并不那么容易。实际上，我认为您向我发送了这篇文章，因为我在短信中找到了您的名字，然后它就出现了。现在对冲基金比汉堡王还多，好吗？</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，没错，在全国范围内。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：你把它发给我了。</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：这些不像那些荒无人烟的小汉堡王。想想那些与我们合作的人，我不知道，他们是该领域快餐连锁店最大的特许经营权所有者。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：嗯，我在《华尔街日报》的专栏中读到了关于您的报道，那是在 2019 年大流行之前，您正在与 Point72 的史蒂夫·科恩 (Steve Cohen) 和 Citadel 的肯·格里芬 (Ken Griffin) 以及所有其他大型对冲基金进行交谈。我知道你不会透露你的客户，但《华尔街日报》肯定提到了这些。我想这些公司的创始人对他们想去的地方和想做的事情有着相当扎实的把握。您如何在战略方面与他们互动？他们对您的见解的接受程度如何？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：有时就像我所说的，在推动战舰前进方面，只是确保他们拥有适合其现有策略的最佳投资专业人士。正如我所说，这同样不是一件容易的事，因为门槛非常高，我们寻找的东西太多，而能够应对这一挑战的人却很少。</p><p>有时他们来找我们的想法是，你知道吗，有一个我们认为有意义的相邻策略。让我们考虑一下最好的方法。我们买基金吗？我们找到了我们认为可以筹集资金的人，并帮助他们进行计算。有时我会去找他们说：“我认为你们应该看看这个。”我刚刚和一位客户遇到过这种情况，他经营着一只非常大的基金，不是多经理基金，而是多策略基金。他和我一直在讨论如何让他的基金提升到一个新的水平，该基金已经非常大了，我的意思是非常大。</p><p>我们已经讨论过类似的事情，而且它是开放式的。他告诉我他正在经历的微积分，这就是我如何从现在的位置到达有意义的地方，比这要大得多。我们讨论了是否要更深入地研究现有战略、建立新业务、寻找可以在风险管理和投资流程方面为他提供更多帮助的人（几乎是联合首席信息官）。我和他进行了很多交谈，我说过，“我们需要退后一步，思考你真正需要什么”，因为这些是不同的技能，并且它们属于不同的人。但我也向他提出了一些想法。</p><p>激进主义又如何呢？那填空呢？他今天没有做但可能有意义并且相邻的事情，他正在探索所有这些事情。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你正在与大型对冲基金创始人和业内其他经验丰富的人士进行此类对话。我不得不想象，惊喜时不时就会出现。当你与什么样的事物互动时，你会感到震惊，“哎呀，我没有预见到会发生这种事。”我打赌你一定有很多精彩的故事。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：我愿意，巴里。我有点感觉，你知道——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你能在学校说话吗？或者——</p><p>韦恩斯坦：你必须等待这本书。</p><p> （笑声）</p><p>韦恩斯坦：也许有一天会有这样的一天。当我退休并以匿名身份发表文章时，我必须这样做。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：人们会明白的。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：他们可能会的。但无论如何，当我们到达那座桥时，我们就会跨过那座桥。</p><p>与人相处，总会有惊喜。这就是让我保持警惕的原因。这其中有太多的曲折。你认为你可以让某人在他们的生活中做好准备，他们有充分的理由应该辞职并去我们过去六个月一直为他们努力的方向，而他们最终留下来。</p><p>然后有些人就这样离开了，我认为要留住他们将是一场殊死搏斗。</p><p>里索兹：真的吗？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：但是你知道，建立我的业务对我来说是最令人惊讶的事情之一，这与我的客户无关，对于一家在行业中真正独特的利基市场告诉你，这只是一件有趣的事情。对冲基金行业是对的，我们为对冲基金行业招聘人员，我们的招聘水平我认为是不寻常的，为我们自己招聘是如此困难。</p><p>只是，这太难了，因为我们之前所了解的使我们与众不同的秘密武器的一部分，对我们来说，我们需要一个具有战略性、交易驱动、真正深入微观的人，你像所有人一样都提到过我们合并细节和信息，然后可以提升一个水平并弄清楚如何将其商业化。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你在哪里可以找到这样的人？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：这太难了。我们通常从银行雇用人员。我喜欢几年的经验，这样我们就可以塑造他们并教授他们。更多的经验并不一定有帮助。他们只能通过接触和坐在座位上收集的信息来学习很多东西。</p><p>但这很难，真的很难。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你提到了很多惊喜，没有震惊，它来自于人的因素。有哪些事情真正让你皱眉？是什么真正让你停下来？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：好故事有很多，巴里，但我要讲的一个故事是很早就讲的，希望如果主角自我认同的话，不会有人太推迟。那是 IDW 的第一年左右。我们正在与一位客户合作，他当时就是业内的知名人士，出色的对冲基金创始人，非常注重增长和卓越。我们第一次寻找他，是为了寻找信贷主管。我真的很想给他留下深刻的印象。经过多次尝试和错误后，我们找到了一个人，正如我之前所说，他并没有仔细观察，他就像是街上最大的农作物之一——信贷自营交易员。非凡的声誉。我不记得他是在贝尔斯登还是雷曼兄弟任职，但那是已经不复存在的银行之一。这不是他的错。但无论如何，在当时，这是一件大事。</p><p>没有兴趣参加谈判，但我解释了他应该参加的所有原因。选择性是一件很棒的事情。这是一个了不起的人。然后我很兴奋。安排会议。我们就说那是在收盘之后。那时大约是四、五点钟。我有点像看了一眼手机，等待它响起，听听这是一次多么精彩的会议。因为这个家伙就像一切一样。这就是我认为我们这次搜索想要的一切。</p><p>一小时后电话响了，是我的客户打来的。他说：“这种事永远不会再发生了。”</p><p>里索兹：哦，真的吗？</p><p>他这么说是什么意思？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：这样一来，你永远无法在一百万年内，我永远无法猜出他嘴里的下一串句子会是什么，显然这个家伙已经决定可以戴上帽子了。 - 衬衫和短裤，一双旱冰鞋，以最快 30 个街区的速度滑冰，到达四个季节，从入口处滑进去，直接上楼梯，然后直接滑进去参加他的会议，完全被汗水淋湿，轮子仍在转动。</p><p> （笑声）</p><p>韦恩斯坦：幸运的是，我的客户有幽默感，我们一起做了很多伟大的事情，但这对我来说是一个教训，巴里，你不能将智力与常识混为一谈。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么现在这其中有多少是常识，又有多少是这个人真的不想再找一份工作呢？他确实不想换。</p><p>温斯坦：我认为这是常识。我不在乎你是否想搬家。快点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我的意思是，即使在行业内也是如此。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：这是独一无二的。我有很多独一无二的故事，但你知道，重要的是从中学习。现在，我们让人们在一切方面做好准备。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：禁止滑旱冰。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：禁止滑旱冰！</p><p> （广告）</p><p>里索兹：我真的很喜欢《华尔街日报》关于你的文章，文章开头引用了这样的话：“在男性占主导地位的对冲基金世界中，伊拉娜·韦恩斯坦是最有权势的女性之一，但韦恩斯坦女士并不管理资金。相反，她会寻找那些这样做的人。”</p><p>那么让我们来谈谈这句话的前半部分，对冲基金的世界绝大多数是男性，在这个领域竞争是什么感觉？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：好吧，我只想说，我们不能忘记这仍然是一个年轻的行业。当你将它与法律、医学、与——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：几个世纪了，对吧。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：好的，医学、法律、咨询这些行业现在有超过 50% 的女性。我去的时候商学院是百分之二十左右。现在哈佛商学院我认为是 52% 或 53%。银行业变得更好。在高级队伍中，仍有一些工作要做。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：一般金融。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：变得越来越好。当然，在初级、中级和中高级职位中，大约有 50% 是女性。所以相对来说这仍然是一个年轻的行业。当我有这些问题时，我会告诉你，我觉得这些问题有点像全男性，那是什么样的等等等等。我觉得这是我参与过的最精英化的行业。我从 14 岁起就开始工作。我做过很多工作。当我在宾夕法尼亚大学时，有一个夏天我在一家律师事务所工作。正如你所指出的，我在高盛工作。我从事咨询工作。我与来自各个不同行业的首席执行官一起工作。这里的区别在于它是按绩效付费。这是按市场定价的。您每天每时每刻都清楚地知道自己所处的位置。而且团队规模很小。因此，即使是一个拥有 100 名 PM 的多经理团队，当你拉开帷幕时，这些 PM 的团队也很小。</p><p>您当然知道您的产品经理的表现如何，哪些是赢家，哪些表现不佳。</p><p>因此，创始人非常清楚谁是阿尔法生成者，而不是像私募股权那样，私募股权可能需要七到十年才能将您的投资货币化，或者在一个行业中，谁在做什么并没有那么明确的归属对于一个非常重要的团队来说是什么？</p><p>因此，创始人并不关心是男性还是女性，也不在乎谁占据席位。这一切都是为了生成阿尔法。顺便说一句，对于我和我的全女性团队来说，我们希望有一些多样性。</p><p>里索兹：哦，真的吗？那很有意思。我不知道。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：是的，是的。我们希望有一些多样性。一切都与我们成为他们的阿尔法人才来源的能力有关。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么，对冲基金界是否存在女性视角？因为在投资回报的学术研究中，有很多研究说，“嘿，男人太喜欢冒险了，他们太固执了，他们过于乐观了”，当他们看起来其他条件都相同时在一系列女性主导的基金与男性主导的基金的比较中，女性的表现优于男性。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：让我给你举一个小例子。早在 2009 年，或者也许是 10 年代，如果你还记得的话，对冲基金基本上都做空 Lululemon。我遇到了一个人，他告诉我，他当时的女朋友，现在的妻子，按照你的观点，现在凭借自己的能力非常成功，对他说：“你为什么缺这个东西？ ”他说，“嗯，因为这是为了瑜伽，而瑜伽是一种时尚。”她说：“你在说什么？我们穿这个，我自己和我的女朋友一直穿这个。顺便说一句，亲爱的，瑜伽并不是一种时尚。”</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>温斯坦：好吧，回到你的问题，现实是创始人想要的是尽可能多的思想多样性，因为如果你有不同的观点和更多的跳出框框思考，错误和推理就会更少。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：减少群体思考。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：是的。 –</p><p> RITHOLTZ：只能是好的。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：完全可以。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：但似乎并不是——</p><p>韦恩斯坦：嗯，我再说一遍，我认为这需要时间。它只会。这不是一个不需要女性的行业。恰恰相反。我的意思是，几乎从第一天起我就被问到了，而且，我已经这样做了很长时间了——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：给我找一些优秀的女性基金经理。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：我们热爱多样性。我们很喜欢，但归根结底，他们对有限合伙人负有聘请最佳人选的信托责任。如果当我们涉足这个行业时，很少有女性进入这个行业（这是一个相当有影响力的水平），那么我们真的没有任何人可以借鉴。所以我希望随着时间的推移——而且我认为情况正在改善。有迹象表明确实如此——越来越多的女性进入这个行业。他们在很棒的地方接受训练。他们最终成为我们运行下一个大型投资组合或启动新战略的绝佳候选人。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：《华尔街日报》的文章讲述了你在沃顿商学院向一群人、一群学生演讲的故事，有人问你为什么对冲基金中没有更多的女性，我不想抢风头，但讲述你向全班提出了什么问题以及发生了什么。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：嗯，课程结束时，一位女士问我，它实际上比巴里更具攻击性。我们做了整个客座演讲，她当然是我最后一个拜访的人。她说：“你们正在采取哪些措施来帮助女性在对冲基金行业占据更大的份额？”</p><p>我有点想，“天啊。”我立即变得有点防御性，但随后我吸了一口气，退后一步，看了看班级，大约是 50/50，男人，女人。我说：“让我从这些人开始吧。你们中有多少人有兴趣在对冲基金工作？”我想说大多数人都举手了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我打赌超过 51%、70%、80%。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：几乎是所有人。我不能——这是大多数人的观点。这是一片手海。然后我问了这些女士同样的问题，然后两只手举了起来。真的吗？我转向她说：“这就是你的答案。”</p><p>里索兹：对。去和你的同事一起努力吧。我能做的只有这么多。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：还有一些事情，就像必须有一个相互尊重的环境一样——第一，必须有一个对每个人都尊重的环境。</p><p>里索兹：当然。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：无论男人、女人还是其他人，我认为我们不需要像温室里的花朵一样被对待，对吧？所以我的意思是，这是一个艰难的行业。它确实具有竞争力，它以底线为导向，但它更注重结果，你知道吗？人们可以很简短，他们可以用子弹说话，他们，只是，有 -</p><p> RITHOLTZ：但我们都知道交易柜台上有女性。如果你对他们说错话，他们会把你劈成两半。他们很坚强，他们让这种经历更加坚强。我的意思是，假设女性基金经理或交易员是一朵娇嫩的花朵，这是一个非常 19 世纪的观点。我无法想象它仍然存在。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：我不知道人们什么时候会说管理者正在采取哪些措施来让环境变得更加宜人，这意味着什么。我不知道这意味着什么。这是完全热情好客的。它是关于那些能够进行出色分析并能够得出出色结果的人。你知道，其他一切对每个人来说都是相同的指标和相同的标准。这没什么不同。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么对于有兴趣在对冲基金领域工作的女性来说，更广泛的收获是什么？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：好吧，让我把它从对冲基金中拿出来。我认为这只是，让我们让它更笼统一些。我的意思是，对于对冲基金来说，对于男性和女性来说都是一样的。正在得到良好的训练。它确实是出于正确的原因而存在的。这是我们之前讨论过的所有事情，磨练你的技巧，提高你的学习和成长方法，并在你的学习和成长方法中保持领先地位，推动自己，并反思你是否没有成长。这不像是一个特殊的东西，再说一遍，对于女性和男性来说，没有一套特殊的东西。</p><p>作为一名女性企业家，我，你知道，作为一名女性，有些事情你确实需要解决，我想说，对于任何在生活中具有竞争优先事项的人来说，这可能都是正确的，无论是男性还是女性的主要照顾者儿童或年迈的父母或任何情况。但我只能从我自己的角度来说。我告诉人们的是，我告诉女性的是，你可以做所有事情，但不能同时做所有事情。</p><p>话虽这么说，我创办了自己的公司，购买并翻新了我的第一套公寓，并在同一年内怀孕了。但不同之处在于我拥有领域专业知识和声誉，而且我明白了。我认为进入一个学习曲线陡峭的新行业并同时处理其他优先事项是非常困难的。所以你必须以一种有意义的方式安排事情的时间。</p><p>我还认为你永远不应该道歉或感到内疚。对于一个职业妈妈来说，内疚是浪费时间。我并不是每次接送都在场，虽然距离很远，但在重要的时候我会在我儿子身边。我认为作为父母，让孩子融入你的成功和失败是很重要的。在他的成长过程中，我和他谈论了我所面临的挑战、胜利和失败。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：作为一名女性，您在男性主导的行业中面临着哪些挑战？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：不，我再次感觉到——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：或者只是一个竞争异常激烈的行业。</p><p>韦恩斯坦：只是建立企业的挑战。回到这一点，我认为我们已经能够为许多客户提供互补的观点。作为女人这是一个优势。有些东西我们看到而其他人看不到。</p><p>所以，就这一点而言，我认为你的孩子会因为接触到你所做的一切而真正成长和学习。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：既然在 IDW 工作了 20 年，并且团队全是女性，那么作为一名女性，您为男性主导的领域带来了哪些独特的视角？</p><p>韦恩斯坦：嗯，我确实认为作为一名女性意味着我们可能会以不同的方式看待事物，并且有稍微不同的视角，这对于那些从自己的生活经历中看待事物的人来说是互补的，对吧，这看起来很不同。 I&#39;ll give you a story early on, which I think speaks to that. This was maybe year one of IDW. We were still doing a lot of work for the prop desks, again, the precursors to the hedge funds. And we were working with one of the most aggressive sell-side firms on the street, certainly with respect to its prop businesses. And they wanted to build their structured credit business. And we went through a whole thing and we ended up making an offer to a guy who ran one of the biggest structured credit groups at a competing bank.</p><p> It was a great offer. It was a three-year deal, huge runway, great upside, and he could really build it and take it in whatever direction he wanted. And he was kind of fenced in where he was today. So much more open pathway.</p><p> And we went through the whole resignation conversation. We prep people within an inch of their lives before they walk in and they resign. And I told him to expect that he was this was going to be his 15 minutes of fame. He was going to go in and they were going to put more and more senior people at the bank in front of him and make him feel like if he were to leave, the bank would careen off a cliff, which we both know is not the case. They were fine with all due respect. I said to him they were fine before you showed up and they&#39;ll be fine after. You&#39;re great but it&#39;s going to be fine.</p><p> And he sounded good, he sounded solid, he knew to resign to his boss and basically get out of there and shut down other conversations.</p><p> So I tell my client and everyone at this bank was involved from the CEO on down. This was a very important person to them and they wanted to make sure it got done. And I tell them I feel really good, he sounds great, we&#39;re going to get this done.</p><p> Goes in the next day, knows to call me an hour into resignation, which he does. He tells me, “Ilana, it&#39;s going well, but they want me to meet the head of global markets to explain my thinking.”</p><p> I said, “We talked about this.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, walk out, you&#39;re done.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: You don&#39;t need to do this. We&#39;re either done or we&#39;re not. “No, no, no. I don&#39;t want to make my boss look bad. At least I need to explain it&#39;s not his fault. I owe them that much. I&#39;ve been here for this long, blah, blah, blah.” There&#39;s nothing I can say. He&#39;s going to do it. I reinforce the reasons. This has to end after this conversation.</p><p> Anyway, you can imagine where this ends up going. He&#39;s in a conference room. That additional conversation manifests into 10 additional conversations. They&#39;re now trotting out the entire management committee of the bank in front of him. The head of the bank&#39;s getting involved. His phone is now off. My team is calling onto the desk. We&#39;re trying to get through to him any which way we can. It is impossible. Meanwhile, my client on the other side is going bonkers because we&#39;re now late into the afternoon. We can&#39;t reach him, and they&#39;re second guessing their decision. Do we have the right guy? Doesn&#39;t he know what he wants? Is this a leader? Blah, blah, blah. Doesn&#39;t he understand? You know, this couldn&#39;t be clearer, the reasons he should make this decision. If he&#39;s not out of there soon, Ilana, we&#39;re pulling the offer. So–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which, by the way, is really not fair for a guy who&#39;s just trying to extract himself gracefully.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Totally. Right, and I explained that, but this, like we started this process, whatever it was, 7 am, we&#39;re now almost into the evening. So we&#39;re beyond gracefully. He&#39;s clearly getting bid back and they&#39;re upset, they&#39;re embarrassed, they feel maybe they have egg on their face and there&#39;s a lot of positioning and jockeying that goes–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Little ego involved also.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Yeah, I think about it and I really feel like that movie “No Way Out” with Kevin Costner. I just don&#39;t even know what to do anymore. Can&#39;t get through to him.</p><p> And then I remember he always talked about his wife and she clearly, as she should be, but it was lovely the way he always brought her up, was a big influence in his life and in his decision making. And I realized I have his home number.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Get the wife on the phone.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So I don&#39;t remember any of their names even, but I remember she was French. And she picks up the phone, so let&#39;s call her Monique. And I say, “Hello, hello? I don&#39;t know if you know who I am, Monique. I&#39;m Ilana Weinstein.” And before I can even finish, she says, “I know exactly who you are.” And I say, “Well, you know, we have a bit of a situation.” And I explained to her that the place her husband is resigning to go to is very upset. And I recount all the reasons this is a phenomenal opportunity. And I think they&#39;re going to pull the offer. And I just, you know, I can&#39;t get through to him. And I thought, you should be aware of that, given, you know, this is a decision I know you both came to.</p><p> And she says, “Ilana, I understand, leave this with me.” Five minutes later, Barry, my phone rings and he&#39;s out.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So, you know, I —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What did the firm he was going to have to say about this?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Oh, they were thrilled, are you kidding? But my point is, sometimes it does take, I guess, in jest, it takes a strong woman to sort of, you know, in this case, move the needle, or maybe two strong women, but, and I&#39;m not to say a man, it&#39;s not to say a man wouldn&#39;t have come up with this, but I do think there&#39;s something sometimes to coming at it from a female perspective, which is helpful.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Huh, to say the very least. I bet you have tons of other stories, tell us one.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: This is a more personal story, but I think just speaks to some of the obvious challenges of being a woman, and this was simply early days of IDW. As I said earlier, I did a lot of things within that first year, including getting pregnant. And we were invited to pitch for the business of what was one of the most exciting hedge funds at the time. It was a spin out from, so this would have been 2004, spin out from a well-known prop group, to my point on doing work for a lot of the prop groups. They had a lot of capital and they were on fire and they were building and the founder invited me to come in.</p><p> So here I am Barry, I&#39;m eight months pregnant —</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WEINSTEIN: And I&#39;m looking at myself in the mirror thinking, I wouldn&#39;t give myself this work. I mean, I look like I&#39;m about to pop, and that&#39;s not a negative, it&#39;s just like, again, competing priorities, right? So this is, he has a business to build and I have a small firm, so how is this going to work?</p><p> So I do what any good entrepreneurial eight month pregnant person would do, which is swath myself in loose black clothing. I absolutely still look pregnant. I mean, just to contextualize this, you know, I&#39;m a small person.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You are a thin five foot something.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. You look like, you must&#39;ve looked like the snake that swallowed the goat.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Well, it was better for me in that the weight was relatively evenly distributed. So I could, I gained 70 pounds when I was pregnant. I could look like–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you doubled in size.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Thank you, but yeah. I could look like a very heavy snake that swallowed a small goat. So that was what I was going for in this meeting. Because obviously he&#39;d know I was pregnant, but if I was looking three months pregnant or four months, that&#39;s a different story. Come in, we have a great meeting. By the way, thank God for big conference room tables because I slid myself, I kind of leaned back in the chair and slid under so he couldn&#39;t really focus on the fact that I really looked like I was about to pop.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Then your water breaks.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: No, no, not that, almost that good though. Almost that good. Great meeting, he awards us everything. Ilana, we&#39;re seeing eye to eye, you understand the business, there&#39;s all the stuff we need to build, let&#39;s get to it.</p><p> And I think to myself, okay, we can do this. We have a month and IDW works smart and hard and fast. A month for us is like five months for other people, we&#39;ll be great by the time I get birth. We sign the engagement letter. I&#39;m in the hospital with an emergency C-section within days. He is off to the races, like with the minute the letter&#39;s signed, he wants to know who do we have ready for him to meet. And I&#39;m not returning the call, right? Because for obvious reasons. So two days later, I call him. He&#39;s very gruff on the phone.</p><p> And I said, “Listen, I&#39;m sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I&#39;m uber responsive, but I think I have a good excuse.” I said, “Well, I&#39;m calling you from the delivery room.” “Delivery for what?” And —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: FedEx? What does he think you&#39;re talking about?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I said, “I just had a baby.” And there is, you could hear a pin drop on this call. Silence. I mean, and this isn&#39;t a guy who gets silenced easily. And I laughed and I said, “Listen, this should give you comfort. The fact that I&#39;m calling you from the delivery room, you know we&#39;re going to get this done for you. Come hell or high water.” So he laughed, and on we went.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s amazing.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Yeah. I mean, we have our own special, unique set of challenges, and that&#39;s an example of one.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. So before we get to our favorite questions, I just wanted to ask you a couple of things about just the state of the industry today and some of the changes we&#39;re going through. We are seeing the older generation begin to retire, you have Ray Dalio stepping down at Bridgewater, you have a lot of managers who are now in their late 60s, early 70s or beyond. Are we approaching a generational change over here?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: We are. It&#39;s early though, right? We haven&#39;t seen that much baton passing. Bridgewater is one. Davidson Kempner would be another. On a smaller scale Redwood, Sculptor, that one hasn&#39;t gone too well. There&#39;s been horrible fighting.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There&#39;s been a few of them that have kind of unraveled.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So it&#39;s early yet, but the key thing is that the LPs do not see the secret sauce as residing in the head of one person. I think, for example, multi-managers are set up well for this transition because by its very nature you have multiple managers managing the capital, it&#39;s not the founder. Or you have to create a real partnership or investment committee in order to have the decision making be more a result of everyone versus one person.</p><p> Elliott just created an investment committee in 2021, I think precisely to get things ready for succession planning.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, I don&#39;t want to suggest the top decile of firms are immune to this sort of succession issues or immune to a tough year in the market like 2022 or 2023, but it certainly sounds like the firms that have become more professional, more institutionalized, are better positioned to withstand these sort of transitions. Is that a fair statement?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: It is fair, but when we talk about top decile, let&#39;s not forget a lot of the funds I mentioned in the beginning were top decile funds and they are no longer. So things can unravel very quickly. You have to be front-footed. You have to be constantly thinking about how you can improve your process, even if things are going well, whether you&#39;re built for a different market environment and to be able to withstand the challenges that are going to be the result of that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really intriguing.</p><p> (ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk about this competition out there for some of the best fund managers. How aggressive is the fight for talent?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I would call it a feeding frenzy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really? That&#39;s quite a phrase. In terms of what people are paying or just the hunger for that sort of talent, why a feeding frenzy?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Well, I think I need to step back and explain where we are today as an industry.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So bear with me as I set the stage. Okay, and then we&#39;ll talk about the action going on on this stage.</p><p> So more so today than ever before, we have the haves and the have nots. There has never been a clearer bifurcation between the two. In the have not category, we&#39;ve got the long short equity funds that are directional and concentrated, which have had horrific performance. I&#39;m not exaggerating.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Tell us.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I&#39;m going to go there.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: This is what I love about Ilana, she does not hold back.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I don&#39;t hold back. I am a truth teller like it or not.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So long short not doing well.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: But let&#39;s talk about it because I&#39;m not sure people really know. If you —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s a lot of funds right?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: It&#39;s probably 40 something percent in the hedge fund industry.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Almost half.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Let me give you another statistic since you&#39;re asking about numbers. The Financial Times did an article at the beginning of this year and it talked about aggregate losses for 2022 in the industry. It was north of 200 billion of losses.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s some real money.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: The Tiger Cub community, which is a relatively small number of funds relative to all the Burger Kings and McDonald&#39;s out there, as we said earlier, there are tens of thousands of hedge funds. Do you know what percent just those funds, those descendants from Tiger management, small group of funds, do you know what percent they were of that total?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I would guess half of that total?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: No, I mean that you can&#39;t say half. It was 25%.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Okay, a quarter.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: A quarter. More than 25%. But that doesn&#39;t even–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But that&#39;s like a dozen funds, right?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Well, you know, maybe a little more, but that doesn&#39;t even include funds like other notable funds that are huge and have had huge drawdowns. Like Alkeon, which is a $30 billion fund pre its losses, or Whale Rock, which was $13 billion, or Red Mile, $10 billion. I mean, when you think about all of the directional long-short equity managers, it&#39;s an enormous list. Tiger Communities only is small-ish percent of that. What we did is look at, I had my team pull any fund that was a billion or greater, which is again, no small fee to get to that level of AUM. So these are the material players, most of whom are many multiples of that. And we looked at their performance over &#39;21 and &#39;22.</p><p> On average, Barry, these funds are down 30% to 40%, with funds like Tiger Global down as high as 60%. Tiger Global was $100 billion pre the losses. There was an article that came out the other day. They&#39;re now $51 billion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Cut in half.哇。</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Cut in half. So that&#39;s how much value has come out of the industry. And what that means is you have a huge high watermark to get out of. You have no performance fee and no line of sight to getting to one anytime soon, and you have AUM shrinking by virtue of the losses, as well as the fact that LPs are now rightly redeeming. That&#39;s just long short equity. Then we&#39;ve got macro, right? Which last year had a good year, but I feel like macro is very spiky. You have a good year, you have a bad year. So you&#39;ve got lots of choppiness in the macro world.</p><p> And then you&#39;ve got the other side of the ledger. So lots of funds that are having a really tough time of it. Huge percent of the hedge fund world. And the other side of the ledger are the multi-managers. We looked at their performance, the top multi-managers, over the last three years. And you know what that is, Barry? The cumulative performance there is if you&#39;re a multi-manager is at the low end, 35%.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: At the high end, north of 88%. That&#39;s Citadel leading the pack.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: But any of them you&#39;re going to have done better with than the whole cabal of funds I just mentioned.</p><p> And then you also have top multi-strategy funds like Golden Tree. There&#39;s a reason Steve Tanenbaum&#39;s fund was $34 billion in 2020. It&#39;s now almost $50 billion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: He&#39;s put up great consistent returns and he&#39;s been very commercial as to how he&#39;s grown the fund. So you would think to yourself, doesn&#39;t talent therefore in all the have-nots want to go to the haves? And the short answer is yes, although it&#39;s more nuanced than that because people will get into it, I&#39;m sure, at some point. There are all sorts of things that factor into why someone may not be so quick to leave, even in an obviously broken situation. But at least more people are coming to the table voluntarily than ever before.</p><p> But the difference is, and the reason I call it a feeding frenzy, it&#39;s not so much now we&#39;re getting somebody who is in what they feel to be a winning situation to think more broadly about their next opportunity, which is that&#39;s hard, right? They feel very happy. They feel they&#39;re treated well. And we have to architect something and a pathway that doesn&#39;t exist where they&#39;re at. And maybe they&#39;ll engage in a conversation to explore that further. And eventually maybe they&#39;ll make a move.</p><p> Now people are meeting with us. And there&#39;s a woman we met with recently who called herself, and we&#39;ve been dining out on this phrase ever since, multi manager curious.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s very funny.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I want to</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So she&#39;s having, they want to have conversations with everyone, and that makes it much more intense. It&#39;s not just one conversation. It&#39;s like seven conversations, and they really are relying on us to help guide them through that and figure out what the best fit is.</p><p> Another dynamic, Barry, that&#39;s important to keep in mind is because these are the haves, they have grown in some cases at a rate which is not sustainable. Some of these multi-managers are two and three X what they were even a few years ago. LMR in 2020 was 4.6 billion. Now it&#39;s 11 billion. Hudson Bay was five and a half billion then. Now it&#39;s almost 20 billion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow, that&#39;s four X. Geez.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: The reality is, and it&#39;s in a very short period of time, talent doesn&#39;t proliferate at that level. And when we talk about feeding frenzy, there&#39;s also a question as to how these funds are going to perform if they&#39;re not being disciplined about the amount of capital they&#39;re taking in to meet being able to hire good people to deploy it.</p><p> You look at a firm like Citadel, which is closed to new investors.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: They could be multiples of what they are. And the best funds are super disciplined about how they&#39;ve grown. Balyasny lost a lot of capital in 2018. It got down to $6 billion. It took five years to get back up to peak AUM, which is $20 billion now, but they were really disciplined about how they did it. They didn&#39;t just boom, double and triple within a few years. They built their infrastructure, risk management, and hired great PMs to lead these businesses. And that it&#39;s so important because you&#39;ll dilute returns without getting the talent piece right in keeping pace to AUM growth.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really interesting. So we&#39;re going to talk more about talent in a bit, but I want to go back to some of the things you raised that&#39;s really quite fascinating.</p><p> So it&#39;s obvious. If you&#39;re making a directional bet, or even worse, a leveraged directional bet, and you&#39;re your funds going to suffer. But I&#39;m kind of intrigued by what you said about macro. I know there&#39;s a wide dispersion of performance in macro, but if any year macro should have done well, it was 2022 where if you had the inflation side right, if you had the Fed– –</p><p> WEINSTEIN: They did, they did well in &#39;22.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: They should have crushed it.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I think the point I was making is, it&#39;s been choppy in that it&#39;s like &#39;22 was good, but then look at &#39;21 and look at &#39;23. So as–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s what you mean by spiky is it&#39;s not consistent over time.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: That&#39;s what I mean by spiky. I mean, an AUM, by the way, has followed that. Brevan Howard at peak was 40 billion, then it drops down to six and change in 2018, and now it&#39;s back up again. But that&#39;s what I mean by spiky, as opposed to an entity, whether it&#39;s a top multi-manager or a top multi-strat that is able to navigate different markets, put up consistent return stream over time, and for the multi-managers, do it totally uncorrelated. That&#39;s all out.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So that&#39;s where I was going to go. Multi strategy seems to be a very attractive approach.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Multi manager. You mean multi manager.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No, multi strategy because if you&#39;re a single strategy and it&#39;s either a bad part of the cycle or you just make the bet wrong, so leverage directional or macro.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: You have your hands in many different pots.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Something should be working and even what&#39;s not working is non-correlated.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Exactly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So is it safe to say that the top performing funds, the ones that have the best track record of attracting talent, are going to be the multi-strat, multi-managers? Or what is the distinction there?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: There&#39;s transition risk no matter what you do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Meaning somebody just jumping from one fund to another may not carry their performance with them.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Right, and they have to learn new skills. And the reality is people typically don&#39;t leave to go to do something similar. They leave to go do something which is a market step up from where they are.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: In terms of size or in terms of strategy or many things?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: In terms of many things. In terms of autonomy, in terms of size, in terms of wingspan, all sorts of things. What I was referring to is the gap that exists at the single strategy funds where at the end of the day, the ultimate arbiter of what happens at the fund is the founder. So it is attractive to go somewhere where you will now be given the ability to manage a portfolio and make decisions, or at least be on a path to learn how to do that.</p><p> And so there&#39;s greater receptivity to making that transition and taking on that transitional risk today, because the paradigm these people sit in is no longer working. These funds are underwater in a very extreme way.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s extrapolate this and talk bigger picture. What I&#39;m hearing from you is a specific single strategy founder-led fund entails different risks for star performers than does a more institutionalized professional multi-strategy fund that has the ability to ride out ups and downs. It&#39;s not whether or not their style is in favor at that moment. They&#39;re approaching investing from a much more, I know holistic is almost a dirty word, but a much more holistic approach by making sure that they&#39;re checking more boxes off.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Let&#39;s say it like this. I think that a lot of individuals sitting at these, I&#39;ll use long-short equities as the example, okay? Single manager, concentrated long short equity funds, those funds might have done well up until 2021, not because their process was so good, but they were the beneficiary of an upmarket.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: And you could just belong and do fine. And you didn&#39;t have to develop a shorting skill set. You didn&#39;t have to develop the ability to balance factors. You could just be long growth stocks. And you basically could just sort of do fine with very lazy risk management.</p><p> So in order to transition successfully to a multi-manager, which is far more disciplined in its approach to risk, you need to now learn a whole other set of skills which will enable you, and that should be attractive, to generate consistent returns over time. But these are not skills that you would have, these are not muscles you would have developed up to this point. So there is risk both sides in somebody making that transition.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So there&#39;s a risk for staying in a fund that is singularly focused and perhaps had the wind at their back for the past decade and got lucky, as well as the risk in transitioning. Is that a fair way to say it?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: 100%.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite interesting.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk a little bit about the hunt for talent. You mentioned superstars before. How do you identify a rising star?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Table stakes, good intellectual horsepower, work ethic, training, and a history of results. But I would call those things necessary but not sufficient. Because as we&#39;ve just talked about, there are a whole bunch of funds that may have had good outcomes over a period of time but didn&#39;t have great process.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So the other things we&#39;re really looking for under the hood are insatiable curiosity, self-awareness, a growth mindset coupled with an intense desire to improve and learn and passion. And I&#39;ll give you a quick story that I think encapsulates all of that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Real time. We just took this guy out. He hasn&#39;t even yet started at his new gig. So there&#39;s a person that, like I said earlier, we are in dialogue with people for a long time. We&#39;ve been talking to him for the better part of his 10 years of investing. To put a fine point on his successes, his early successes, he was made a PM, they call it something else where he was, but basically the same thing. He was made a PM after four years, four years of investing experience, he was made a PM.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Young, early.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Super early, never invested before. So after four years, they gave him capital, he was running a couple billion of GMV, complete autonomy, and a clear payout. So of course he didn&#39;t want to leave. Like again, the differences, there has to be something structurally inefficient in not working and broken to leave. So just to give that up, to go someplace else where on the margin some things would be better wasn&#39;t enough.</p><p> And we can explain why those differences are not marginal, but at the end of the day, he had a pretty good gig and was staying put. At the end of 2022, he asks for a meeting. Oh, and I&#39;ll give you another–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: He asks for a meeting.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: He asks for a meeting. Well, we keep in touch, but it was now something like, now&#39;s the time for us to catch up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;ve gotten into his head enough that he&#39;s starting to see cracks in the foundation.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Well, something specific happened. So four full years as an investment professional becomes a PM. In his second full year as a PM, he&#39;s paid seven million bucks. So this is not too shabby.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, not too shabby, right?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Guy&#39;s doing great. At the end of 2022, he asks for a meeting. We sit down and he says, I had a really bad year, which a lot of people did in &#39;22. This is not unusual. We just talked about it. And I said, are you under pressure? What&#39;s your relationship like now with the founder? He said, there&#39;s no issue whatsoever. Like, no issue because a lot of those losses came precisely — or the reason for those losses came because the founder likes us, which I knew, to be concentrated and put a lot of capital where we have high conviction.</p><p> So when I step back and look at my losses for the year, they were 100% in one name. And then I went back and looked at my history of returns, and what I found is my hit rate is exceptionally high. I have a really high batting average, which as you know, Barry, is very unusual in this industry. So I said to him, “Aha, so if you&#39;re going to win more than lose, why put all your eggs in just a few baskets?” Because the reality is it&#39;s just not worth the risk, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But that&#39;s the structure the founder wants.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: But that&#39;s the structure the founder wants. So what he realized, and especially in this new market paradigm that we&#39;re in, where things are not just going in one direction, and it&#39;s much more difficult to call things, and there was a lot more market risk entering into the equation of why things perform in the way that they do, he realized he wants to run more diversified and he wants to be somewhere that will teach him how to do that better and give him the resources to be able to do it. Because if you&#39;re going to have a lot more names in your book, you also need a bigger team.</p><p> And what I love about this story is it shows someone who refused to rest on his laurels.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Very self-aware.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Exactly.</p><p> He stepped back and figured out what he&#39;s best at, where he&#39;s stagnating, and put himself on a path to grow. I kind of almost think that this is a metaphor for the hedge fund industry writ large. There are so many funds that don&#39;t take that step back and think about what they need to do to improve themselves. They just kind of– like I said earlier, it&#39;s an upmarket. What we&#39;re doing is working. So why rock the boat? Or I won&#39;t name the fund, but you may guess who it is. There was a founder who shut down, who in large part think his approach to risk management wasn&#39;t that different at 30 billion of GMV from what it was at 2 billion. He just didn&#39;t develop–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Didn&#39;t adjust to the scale.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Didn&#39;t adjust to the scale and didn&#39;t develop the tools necessary to see correlations in the book that might not have been obvious.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let me circle back to the manager you were just referring to who had that high degree of self-awareness. Generally speaking, how rare are stars like that or superstars like that? It seems this guy checked all the boxes and even in an off year seemed to be trending in the right direction.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Yes, where he had no pressure from the founder. This wasn&#39;t like he felt that he was on shaky ground. Far from. Very rare. I would say it&#39;s a handful of times a year that I would call someone a superstar. It&#39;s everything I just described, but it&#39;s also the muscle memory of having done this for 20 years where it just kicks in. You know when you&#39;re sitting opposite someone that embodies all of that.</p><p> And some of the other things that, how do you know it when you see it? I talked about intense intellectual curiosity. One of the ways that manifests is these people are voracious consumers of information. You ask them what they do in their spare time, what they read. But it&#39;s what they read. And it&#39;s just it&#39;s coming out of their eyeballs, like all of this, the subject matter that they&#39;re interested in. It also goes to passion. And by passion, I mean a real desire to just be engaged in what they do 24/7.</p><p> But I am not talking about being passionate about their investments, because you really need to be unemotional when you&#39;re making decisions. And that maybe goes to low ego too. It&#39;s not about being “right” because being right and making money are two separate things.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: By the time you&#39;re right, you might have lost your shirt.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So literally the title of a Ned Davis book, “Being Right or Making Money.”</p><p> WEINSTEIN: You&#39;re kidding.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: 100 percent. The grandfather. Probably the most respected technician ever.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So honored to be in that same breadth.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So tell us about some of the current trends that you see in 2023 that might be a little unique or surprising versus what we&#39;ve seen over the past couple of years.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So in spite of everything I&#39;ve said, people can still be quite sticky. And there is this inertia that I often see where people overweight what can go wrong in making a move, underweight what they have to gain, and turn a blind eye to staying put.</p><p> And given the clarity of the situation right now, it is just mind boggling to me that people who assess risk for a living can still be so obtuse, for lack of a better word. And I think it goes to something that&#39;s really important, which is you have to be intentional about managing your career. Staying put cannot be just the default position.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is it just inertia? People just get comfortable and don&#39;t want to move?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I think people get comfortable and they feel like, again, it&#39;s economic loss aversion theory at work. They overweight everything that can go wrong and they really don&#39;t pay attention to if they make a move. They underweight what can go right and they&#39;re just not focused on the dire situation that they&#39;re in.</p><p> And when you&#39;re being deliberate about managing your career, you&#39;re asking, and I&#39;m not suggesting people hop around for the sake of hopping around, but you do need to ask yourself the tough questions at various pivot points. And this isn&#39;t just true for hedge funds, it&#39;s true for any industry. How is my fund or firm performing? How am I evolving? Am I learning the skills I need in order to be effective going forward? Am I on a path to grow? Am I stagnating or am I increasing my value and optionality in the market? Am I being paid fairly?</p><p> And to the extent that they&#39;re not and they&#39;re just literally sticking their head under the covers and not thinking about these things, they really need to ask themselves why that&#39;s the case. It&#39;s the number one reason people flame out. They don&#39;t keep pressing forward, don&#39;t keep improving, don&#39;t keep learning.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So that raises a really interesting question because you&#39;re suggesting that talent should be thinking about more than just salary and equity. There&#39;s a lot of other things they should be looking for. When you&#39;re counseling a superstar to switch funds, what are you telling them that they can get besides just, “Hey, here&#39;s money, and you get some equity in the GP” what&#39;s in it for them?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I think there&#39;s four main things. One is to be made better, to learn things that they&#39;re not learning where they&#39;re at, which more than ever today is important.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Matters, sure.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Number two is autonomy. And even if it&#39;s not complete jurisdiction over the portfolio, increased ability to impact the results. Okay? So people should really want that and that sense of agency.</p><p> The second thing is clarity. Not the number per se, that&#39;s important, but clarity around how we get to that number.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Meaning it&#39;s not a crazy calculation. You have an idea each month, each quarter, how you&#39;re personally doing the terms of –</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I&#39;m not saying it has to be. Well, I mean, if you&#39;re on a payout, then yes you do. But even in situations where you don&#39;t have a payout or points in the fund, you have to have clarity around why the founder makes the decisions he does. The most frustrating thing in this industry is for people who perform, who get netted, meaning the founder takes from Peter to pay Paul, and doesn&#39;t reach into his own pocket in order to do that.</p><p> And I was– and the fourth thing, just before I forget, is stability. I&#39;ll come back to compensation. Stability or clarity around compensation. Stability in terms of that you&#39;re not going to get blown out at the slightest misstep. These are the four things that are important to people. And stability that the fund is on solid footing, which increasingly is a more difficult thing given how many funds look today like melting ice cubes.</p><p> But back to compensation, the founder has to be clear on what the P&amp;L is of the fund and how he uses the management fee to the extent that there isn&#39;t a clear formula in terms of how you&#39;re paid. People need to understand why they&#39;re getting paid what they&#39;re getting paid.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I&#39;m a little confused. You&#39;re a rock star at one fund. You get an enticing offer in another fund and you may not know what your comp is going to look like even if you&#39;re putting up really good numbers. That&#39;s perplexing.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: If you&#39;re sitting at a fund where —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The guy across the hall is stinking the joint up, you&#39;re not going to get your bonus.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I mean, let&#39;s just say you put up $200 million, the guy across the hall lost $200 million. There&#39;s no pass-through model. So the founder is zero in terms of a performance fee if all he has is the two of you and he&#39;s allocated capital to you. So is he going to reach into his own pocket to make you whole or not? And if you don&#39;t have a payout that he has to abide by, that can be really frustrating if he doesn&#39;t actually make you, you know.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I think that would be good for your business, because that guy&#39;s going to be out the door. Hey, I don&#39;t care about who else you&#39;re hiring. If I&#39;m putting up good numbers, I expect you to at least have a conversation with me about, “All right, we&#39;re only going to give you half of what you expected because Bob across the hall blew up.” But I mean, what really happens in those circumstances?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Well, I mean, I will tell you 2022 was really interesting because I was pleasantly surprised by quite a few examples of founders who did reach into their own pocket to pay their best people like the story I told early on where some of these funds with very big holes still did substantial guarantees to retain their top people for this year and for next year.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Seems long term smart, right?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Long term smart, although the problem is to the extent those funds continue to lose AUM LPs are redeeming or don&#39;t get and/or don&#39;t get out of those high water marks in some reasonable period of time, that&#39;s not really sustainable.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, they could just dissolve and reform, then worry about that later.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: And also, those guarantees are ceilings, and really talented people want to be able to —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Have untapped ability to get paid.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Clear skies above, and if they do really well, they expect to get paid really well.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: But Barry, what you&#39;re picking up on, which is correct, is to the extent founders don&#39;t have a pass-through model, meaning everything is out of the management fee and performance fee.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: As opposed to segmenting four different funds and the performance fee goes to each of those individual silos.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Well, meaning they can pass through the expenses of the fund. So you can pass through the expense of paying that guy who made $200 million. All that should matter to LPs is your net return.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: So a pass-through model is a higher bar because there&#39;s more expenses at the end of the day, but these guys who have that very coveted fee structure are able to have that because their net returns are worthy of it. They have a high enough net return.</p><p> In any event, I do think what talent wants is a pathway where they have more agency over what they do and more control and clarity around how they get paid and just to be made better over time so they continue to evolve.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s flip the question. What are the top hedge funds looking for? It&#39;s got to be more than just P&amp;L. Tell us what the top funds want when they ask you to go find me a superstar in this space.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Coming up a level, I will tell you I do think funds trip themselves up sometimes in using terms like analyst and PM and partner because those things mean very, have very different definitions depending on who we&#39;re speaking to.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do they matter at some of the larger hedge funds or are people wearing multiple hats doing the same job?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: What I mean is we define, different founders define those things differently. So I&#39;ll give you an example. We did a search about eight years ago for a well-known single manager, long short equity founder, who&#39;d been around at that point for 20 years and had just had one of his most senior people depart. And what he told me he wanted was a partner. The guy was a partner. He wanted someone who, and he said he&#39;s willing to give this guy substantial points and would operate really as a PM alongside him.</p><p> I want someone who&#39;s going to be able to make decisions with me, help deploy capital, help size, help construct the portfolio, more of a PM than an analyst. And what I said to him is, “There&#39;s no one I can find you that has 20 years of working with you.” And the way that you evolved people, because everyone there was hired basically as a young analyst out of Goldman and then homegrown, he saw what people were capable of. They had wins with him over time, and then he gave them more and more responsibility.</p><p> So to go into the market and basically find what for him would be a stranger and put that person in at a senior level, I knew wasn&#39;t going to work. And in fact, what we ended up doing was putting in — It was a senior person, but it was someone who was less experienced, was really a senior analyst. was happy to have a seat at the table and be able to feed him ideas and over time morph into more of a PM or partner type role.</p><p> But PM means different things even among the multi-managers who do have that, you know, where that title really does mean they&#39;re giving somebody an allocation of capital and that person does have autonomy. In some places a PM is really, really, no, it&#39;s man, it&#39;s always managing capital but it might be a small amount of capital.</p><p> You might start with a paper book. It&#39;s like a mini PM, or a PM with training wheels. And you might be overseeing a very small team to start. In other places, we want somebody who can build a scale business out of the gate and can manage a lot of capital. And by the way, their definition of analysts may be different. There are places where being an analyst almost looks more like a PM. They are managing a significant amount of GMV. They do have a payout on that. Their definition of analysts may look, again, it may look more like mini PMs. So we really need to dig into these things and define what we&#39;re after.</p><p> And I would say for an analyst, that&#39;s idea generation, creativity, independent research, asking the right questions. For a PM, it&#39;s risk management, portfolio construction, hedging, sizing, the ability hopefully to build and manage a team.</p><p> And where we&#39;re looking for someone to build a strategy that&#39;s more like a founder. It&#39;s someone that we can raise capital around, potentially raise a fund around, and of course attract talent and also has a sense of what is needed with respect to technology and operations for their strategy. So different skill sets.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I was going to say it sounds far more complex than I think a lot of people might assume looking in from the outside. How important is fit? How do you figure out, hey, this square peg is going to fit or won&#39;t fit into that round fund. How do you evaluate personalities on top of all these really challenging skill sets? It sounds like it&#39;s not an easy thing to do.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: There are things we do to see how closely the candidate maps to what we will want them to do. We do case studies, idea pitches, mock portfolios, business plans. Those are all sort of the hoops we have them jump through. But then in addition, we do soft referencing as a firm. If you think of 20 years of meeting with the most talented people at every hedge fund, odds are if you&#39;re a candidate, Barry, I&#39;ve met with five other people from your fund that have a point of view on you.正确的？ So we very quickly get a 360 on how people think, their velocity of ideas, their response time, when they spot an opportunity, their ability to commit capital, and how they systematize their process so it&#39;s scalable and repeatable.</p><p> These are all the things we&#39;re going to dig into in finding out about people. And I also love it when someone comes in with a clear sense of attribution. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great sign if someone has no idea what their P&amp;L is. I get that often it&#39;s not tracked at many funds.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really? I&#39;m shocked to hear that because —</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Not formally tracked.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But you could still export your book to an Excel spreadsheet and say, “Here&#39;s where I am.”</p><p> WEINSTEIN: We&#39;re saying the same thing. I expect people to have done that. I expect people to have a clear sense of attribution. To the extent that they don&#39;t, it&#39;s not a good sign, is what I&#39;m saying.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No, I would not.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: But the best people come in, I mean, honestly, some of them come in with a huge spreadsheet, This is what I&#39;ve contributed. And by the way, here are all the things I wanted to do that the founder didn&#39;t let me do and how I would have performed if they&#39;ve let me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Now I&#39;m savvy enough after all these years to know and that if I add a little bit of a grain of salt and if I added up all of the returns of everyone we meet from fund A, B or C, it would probably be north of 300%. So you know, there&#39;s that. But I do think there is still something to a sense of ownership and directional truth.</p><p> And then the final thing I&#39;d say to you is there&#39;s always a leap of faith. I don&#39;t care how much work both sides do, and we do a lot of work to have a strong sense that the person will be successful. There&#39;s always a leap of faith because we&#39;re talking about different founders, different definitions of success and failure, different investing style, different approaches to training and development. And I always tell the clients I&#39;m working with that they have to lead with war stories. They have to lead with all the things that might have gone wrong early on when they recruit someone and how they help that person to get out of a hole and to go on and be successful. Because that&#39;s what&#39;s in the minds of people before they make a leap. What happens when things go south? How will I be treated?</p><p> And founders really need to, or whoever&#39;s doing the recruiting, and this is again any industry, you really need to lead with what constitutes failure. Losing money in and of itself, yes, you fail to make money, but why? How did you get yourself into that situation? So there&#39;s sort of like good failure, which is a learning experience and we think we can improve you, and let&#39;s define what is a situation where we think it actually isn&#39;t the right fit. You need to get people clarity.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Makes sense. A good process will occasionally have a bad outcome and you can&#39;t just assume every good outcome is the result of a good process.</p><p> All right, so I only have you for a few more minutes. Let&#39;s jump to our favorite question that we ask all our guests, starting with what has been keeping you entertained over the past couple of years? What have you been doing either when we were locked down or just out and about revenge traveling?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Revenge traveling. I took a fantastic trip with my son to Italy last summer.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I do recall we were talking about that and we didn&#39;t know what was going to happen. There was a couple of variants. We were both talking about traveling last summer. Where&#39;d you go in Italy?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: It&#39;s almost where didn&#39;t we go? We went everywhere. The only places we didn&#39;t go were Puglia. Am I pronouncing that correctly? Soft G, Puglia. And we didn&#39;t go to northern Italy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I&#39;ve never been to Lake Como and I want to check that out.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Phenomenal.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I haven&#39;t been to Milan, I haven&#39;t been to Modena, which is why I&#39;d love to go.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I have not been to Modena either. But for two foodies like us, that&#39;s worth hitting.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I have a friend who did this private tour where instead of staying at hotels, you stay at people&#39;s houses and they cook dinner for you and it&#39;s grandma making the secret family recipe and he said he came home 20 pounds heavier.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I&#39;m sure.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It was amazing. Let&#39;s talk about mentors. Who helped to shape your career?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: It&#39;s totally my parents.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I had amazing parents.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What did your parents do?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: My father ran a small insurance brokerage so he was an entrepreneur but small. I mean he was this is your classic first-generation immigrant story.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: My dad did grow up in the States. He was born and raised in Brooklyn, part of what we often term the greatest generation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: He volunteered to fight World War II. He was an amazingly patriotic person. He was a tail gunner for B-29s. They used to take us out. My parents used to take us out to airfields in the middle of nowhere to look at these old planes. Really hardworking guy. And I listened to all the issues that he would bring home and discuss with my mom, who&#39;s an amazingly smart woman. She can run circles around most people. And she was kind of the CEO of our family. She really pushed us to be our best. She helped my dad. She came here. She was a hidden child during the Holocaust.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh really?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: It&#39;s a whole story unto itself. She came to Israel, then her family emigrated to Israel, and then she came to the United States, met my father, and they were, we didn&#39;t have much growing up. They just, they did the best they could in the way of giving us stuff, but there wasn&#39;t really a lot of material wealth that I grew up with, far from, but I had great parents who taught me the importance of, by example, through my father and my mom, just in terms of her wisdom, of constantly pressing forward.</p><p> And, you know, there wasn&#39;t a lot of room for whining in my house. She&#39;s, you know, she was in the Israeli army. She&#39;s tough. She&#39;s strong. My dad, again, great, wonderful man who&#39;s a phenomenal salesperson, but worked super hard. And I admired his resilience. And it was about pushing forward and not giving up. And that, I think, is that grit and perseverance. We don&#39;t really talk too much about that. I actually think it&#39;s one of the most important determinants of someone&#39;s success in life and also professionally.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Grit and perseverance, good qualities to have.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk about books, what are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Well I love books that are about real life, could be a moment in time like Tom Wolfe type books, maybe the story is quote fiction, but loosely based on things that were happening then. or of course Michael Lewis, which is, those are real stories told in a highly entertaining way. The stuff I&#39;m reading now is courtesy of my 18-year-old son who&#39;s gotten into the habit of buying his mom books that he thinks she might like, and he&#39;s hit it out of the jackpot every time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Yeah, so now, thanks to Jordan, I&#39;m reading, I think it&#39;s called “Ticking Clock.” It&#39;s by Ira Rosen, who was a producer for “60 Minutes,” and he bought me that because he knows I love the movie with “The Insider” with Russell Crowe, which was an expose, of course, on the tobacco industry, but also on the world of journalism. And the book is fascinating. It&#39;s like being in the newsroom. It&#39;s all the intrigue that went on behind the scenes. It&#39;s just– it&#39;s an — and it&#39;s so funny. He&#39;s just– he&#39;s like this reverent, no BS, awesome, engaging storyteller. Phenomenal.</p><p> And then the other book I&#39;m reading that my son got for me is called “The Kings of New York” which is about really the New York skyline and the whole real estate industry. And again, told almost like a thriller in terms of how it unfolded, what all the inside baseball was and the rise and fall of a number of real estate dynasties.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite fascinating. Our final two questions, what sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in either hedge funds or talent scouting and recruiting.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: For anyone, the question is why do you want to do that? What is it? And if the answer for anything is because they think it&#39;s lucrative, that&#39;s not a good answer.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. By the way, I&#39;ve heard that time and again from people sitting in that seat. Hey, if you&#39;re in this game for the money alone, you&#39;re going to be disappointed.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: It&#39;s important to try, if you know what you want to do, that&#39;s great. I have a candidate right now who&#39;s been investing in biotech since he was 13. Yes, and so he knows what he wants to do. And I learned that because I said what you studied in college was really interesting. You were pre-med, which is tough enough, and also studying business. Like how did you know back then? He&#39;s like, I just knew. I knew I wasn&#39;t going to be a doctor. I was fascinated by biotech, but I wanted to come at it from the investing angle.</p><p> To the extent you don&#39;t really know, I think it&#39;s so important to try different things. To your opening questions to me, I didn&#39;t know. And I learned through all of my experiences, what I liked, what I was best at, and just as valuable, what I didn&#39;t like, and what I felt, you know, I wasn&#39;t a natural at.</p><p> I think it&#39;s okay to go on a bit of a journey early on, but you have to be on that journey aggressively. And meaning if what you&#39;re doing is not something that really is singing or speaking to you, you have to keep moving forward till you figure it out.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So purposefully —</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Purposefully, you can then lock in and really build something.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today, hedge funds, talent recruitment that you wish you knew 20 years ago when you first launched IDW?</p><p> WEINSTEIN: I&#39;ll use your word purposefully. It&#39;s really important for founders to manage their team purposefully, meaning you have to give people room to fail, but you also have to cut when it makes sense. And I think a lot of founders are afraid to do that because how will it look to LPs? It&#39;s uncomfortable to have to do those, to have to manage people out. What will it do to our culture? But a killer culturally is to be someplace where it becomes a hotbed for mediocrity.</p><p> And so —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A hotbed for mediocrity, meaning you just start accumulating key players.</p><p> WEINSTEIN: You just start accumulating deadwood. And it becomes, and I hear this time and again where people say, you know, where they haven&#39;t really been paid that well, well, there&#39;s this kind of smoothing effect that goes on at our firm where maybe I&#39;m not paid as well as I should be, but in down, you know, when things don&#39;t go that well at the firm, I also am not hit as hard perhaps as other places.</p><p> And I said, can we take a step back and look at your personal P&amp;L history? For the most part, you&#39;ve been a rock star every year you&#39;ve been there.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Why you hedging —</p><p> WEINSTEIN: Why on earth are you giving yourself an artificial ceiling here? And why are you, for someone who can never put up the goods, that&#39;s a great paradigm. Why is it for you? And so I think again, it all comes back to being front-footed as talent, but also as an institution in managing for growth aggressively.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Ilana, thank you for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Ilana Weinstein. She is the founder of the IDW Group and is known as one of the most powerful women in the world of hedge funds.</p><p> If you enjoyed this conversation, well, be sure and check out any of the previous 500 or so we&#39;ve done over the past nine years.

<sup>1</sup></p><p>截至目前，这些指数明显高于 2023 年 1 月 1 日的水平：纳斯达克 100 指数上涨超过 38%，标准普尔 500 指数上涨约 15.5%，罗素 2000 小型股指数上涨近 7% 。这些数字将使这一年的时间减少一半。</p><p>根据昨天关于<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/06/what-do-you-believe-why/">信仰体系和思维过程</a>的讨论来考虑这些收获，只是这一次，不是指反疫苗者和叛乱分子，而是想想你从基金经理、经济学家、策略师和各种专家那里听到的所有内容，他们自由地发表了意见2023 年这个市场将走向何方。</p><p>为什么他们如此确信自己知道会发生什么？他们的来源是什么？他们的流程？他们有没有考虑过他们可能错了的可能性？</p><p>更重要的是，<span style="text-decoration:

2023 年迄今的大部分涨幅只是 2022 年跌幅的恢复，因为利率上涨，对利润崩溃的担忧开始显现。</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-yr-JoJ.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"

Skylight entries, smoke bombs, and shootouts may be cinematic, but unless you want to go to jail, these are terrible tactics for stealing art. Violence and destruction in a museum only minimize your odds of success. Art crime, according to Stéphane Breitwieser, is best accomplished when no one knows that it&#39;s happening.
