RITHOLTZ，主持人，商业硕士：本周的播客，哦，我有一位额外的特别嘉宾。 Peter Borish，Tudor Investments 的二号创始合伙人，他直接与 Paul Tudor Jones 合作，最著名的是帮助他在 87 年崩盘前建立了非常激进的空头头寸。然后，不是在周一的混乱中，而是在周二接近底部的时刻进行报道，这确实是一个令人着迷的职业，对市场的独特视角。他不仅在布雷迪委员会任职，负责研究 87 年的崩盘，而且他在美联储、芝加哥贸易委员会和财政部的投资、交易和公共服务的历史也确实是无与伦比的，而且是一个相当出色的人。作为投资者和交易者的惊人记录。作为一名慈善家，Robinhood 的联合创始人受托人之一，他确实是一个令人着迷的角色。</p><p>我发现这是一门大师班，以谦虚的态度对待市场，并意识到自己的局限性，以便作为交易者和投资者获得最佳结果。</p><p>博里什是华尔街的传奇人物，我很高兴有机会与他坐下来讨论他的职业生涯以及他的投资、交易和慈善事业的方法。</p><p>话不多说，下面是我与都铎投资公司 (Tudor Investments) 前研究总监彼得·博里什 (Peter Borish) 的对话。</p><p>计算机贸易公司董事长兼首席执行官彼得·博里什：非常感谢。这只是表明我保不住工作。</p><p>里索兹：没错，没错。你不断地去参加下一场演出。</p><p>所以我很熟悉你的作品，但我敢打赌很多年轻的听众可能不知道你的恶名以及 87 年事故发生的情况。我们会解决这个问题的。</p><p>让我们从您的背景开始。是什么让您对市场和交易感兴趣？</p><p>嗯，我想这有点偶然。所以当我完成研究生学业时，我总是从密歇根开始，因为我是密歇根人。</p><p>里索兹：去蓝色吧。</p><p> BORISH：我在那里读了本科和研究生，并于 82 年完成了研究生学业，当时正是里根总统领导下的真正的经济衰退。我非常幸运地在纽约联邦储备银行找到了一份工作。</p><p>里索兹：做什么？</p><p>博里什：如果你还记得的话，当时我正在做的事情是最不发达国家，对吧，墨西哥危机。</p><p>里索兹：当然。</p><p>博里什：他们谈论的是，如果墨西哥增加石油供应，他们将获得更多收入。我傻乎乎地举手说：“是啊，但是如果他们增加供应，那不是会给价格带来下行压力吗？”他们有点像，你知道，你应该考虑研究宏观经济模型。这就是事情的真相。那时，外汇、期货和衍生品才刚刚起步。 1982 年是标准普尔期货诞生的一年。所以我进入了那个小组并做了一些研究。由于有点狂热，我为美联储研究了一种内部布莱克-斯科尔斯模型。这就是我的幸运并开始了我的职业生涯。</p><p>正如我所说，华尔街到处都是前美联储官员。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这是一个很好的描述方式。到处都是前美联储官员。因为美联储是经济学家和其他技术研究人员的巨大雇主，而且他们经常离开美联储并前往大商店。你没有走那条路。您离开美联储后，请告诉我们您的下一步职业发展。</p><p> BORISH：那是 1985 年，我在那里已经三年了，大约是你开始找工作的时候，我从华尔街的一些白鞋公司那里得到了一些工作机会，然后通过一个熟人，我认识了这个人，他是来自棉花交易所的保罗·都铎·琼斯 (Paul Tudor Jones)。他让我帮忙，因为他是纽约棉花交易所子公司的金融交易所主席。他们想开始交易一些期货合约。我想，“看，我还年轻。我单身。多么充满活力的个性啊。伟人。我要试一试。”这就是我在都铎王朝的起点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么 Tudor Investments 推出了 &#39;85？ &#39;84？</p><p> BORISH：保罗于 84 年 9 月开始工作。我是在85年初加入的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以实际上是公司的第二名？是那个地方吗……</p><p> BORISH：嗯，有人员和支持人员，但我是第一个真正的研究专业人员。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：请告诉我们一些你们在 86、87 年所做的事情。你在交易什么，他在看什么？</p><p>博里什：因此，保罗真正理解期货市场的天才之一是，大多数创新的风险管理方法都源于期货市场，因为使用保证金。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：没有犯错的余地。你不能只是说，“啊，让我们看看它是否会回来。”这不是——以及如何交易期货。</p><p>博里什：不，一点也不。因此，随着新的金融期货市场的出现、发展和启动，他正在采用他的技术、他的方法、他的纪律，并将其应用到新的期货市场和他的承诺中，我认为人们必须意识到这一点，因为今天能做什么，对吧，我手机上有FRED应用程序，我可以在百分之一秒内下载大量数据。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> BORISH：你不能在那里那样做。他通过我对数据做出了巨大的承诺。</p><p>我们会聘请暑期实习生将数据放入电子表格、构建模型和工作。他愿意，而且实际上在周末，我们会跪着，取出软盘驱动器，放入硬盘驱动器，更新计算机。我们正在按照他的交易纪律和方法将所有这些应用到新市场。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：保罗·都铎·琼斯的流程有一个有趣的差异。非常定量驱动，非常数学化。但他的方法还有另一面，远远超前于时代，非常行为化。</p><p>告诉我们一些他在观察市场和管理自己时所采用的心理方法。</p><p>博里什：保罗当时乃至今天的优势仍然在于，因为他一直在场内交易，并且知道大多数市场走势都会很快走向极端。市场花费大量时间无所事事，然后重新定价。所以你必须有那种纪律，你必须有那种耐心。如果你认为这将是一个加速点，那么你会尝试变得更大，但你必须有一个非常严格的停止。这是一种非常矛盾的方法，因为人们总是希望自己是对的。而你探索和交易的方式就是明白事实并非如此。</p><p>他总是说，“好吧，他们今天抓住了我，但我会以 100% 的利息把他们拿回来。”</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以人们也应该意识到，对于那些从未交易过期货的人来说，这与期权不同，本质上你可以提前承担损失，而他们所能做的就是将损失归零。选项，无论它走向何方，你都陷入困境。这并不是说，好吧，我们只是看看它是如何交易的。如果它继续对你不利，你要负全部责任，因此要承诺严格止损并采取严格的方法来管理下行趋势。</p><p> BORISH：是的，关于期货，你必须保持纪律。我认为新手期权交易者面临的问题之一是，因为如果你购买它们，你所能做的就是损失你的权利金。因此，如果你对市场有信心，你购买了溢价，然后它开始对你不利，你会说：“好吧，我仍然相信它，我仍然有溢价。”因此，很多时候，当您这样做时，您会进行交易，并且在心理上接受您将损失所有溢价的事实。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：提前记下你的损失。</p><p> BORISH：而在期货世界中，你不会这样做。你不能失去纪律，因为无论如何，市场都会约束你。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，不，这很有意义。所以你说过，只要我们谈论交易的纪律和管理，我真正喜欢的你的一句话就是，“交易和风险管理本质上是不自然的特征。”解释一下这是什么意思。</p><p>博里什：很高兴。</p><p>所以首先，我们总是说，“纪律先于愿景”。这意味着我们可以交谈，我可以思考，我们可以八卦，市场就会走向这里。你知道，这有点像谈论体育八卦。这并不是真正的交易。</p><p>这是一种有纪律、严格的方法。所以当我说这是一种不自然的感觉时，是因为我们所有人，我们大多数人，我现在已经习惯了，希望被人喜欢。所以你想在那里，哦，你是长苹果，我是长苹果，哦，我们都很聪明。但你必须有纪律说，等一下，一切都结束了，行动就在那里。所以这样想吧，地铁车厢里有 100 个人，他们都在做某事。如果我下车并进入另一辆车，而我处于短边，那么我就是那里的一个人。如果我遵守纪律，被拦下，你总是可以在地铁车厢里再挤一张。但当情况发生变化时，如果只有我一个人，而他们都跑光了，那就是市场下跌速度快于上涨速度的原因。</p><p>因此，从逻辑上讲，它必须是占据交易另一方的能力。但这并不意味着你应该为了逆向而逆向。这就是所有这些不同方法的区别。所以就有了趋势跟随，也就是顺应趋势。有波浪策略，它表示我们将尝试在这里找到拐点。它们都是很好的策略，但如果你没有严格的风险管理，你就不会赚钱。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，挑战在于大众是对的。大多数时候，如果你想成为一个逆向投资者，你就必须抓住那百分之二、三、四的人群都错的地方，并在所有人都走向门口之前退出。</p><p> BORISH：是的，你必须非常注意拐点。我一直在经历这个。人们会说，哦，你知道，市场随着时间的推移而上涨，而且是一条直线。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这不是交易，这是投资。</p><p>博里什：是的，但即便如此，我问人们，我说，好吧，你知道，你认为我今天看起来比昨天老吗？他们走了，不。我说，好吧，你认为我明天看起来会比今天更老吗？他们走了，不，我走了，太棒了，两点，一条线，永远不会变老，这太棒了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么我们来谈谈 87 年吧。从 82 年到 87 年初，市场经历了巨大的增长。请告诉我们一些关于你们进入这一年的定位。</p><p>鲍里什：让我们退后一步，因为市场不会直线上涨。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> BORISH：他们认为，是的，最低点是在 82 年 8 月，但在 84 年出现了严重的调整。然后甚至在 1986 年，也出现了一些真正令人痛苦的调整，特别是在 86 年 7 月 4 日和 86 年 9 月到期之后。</p><p>所以实际上是在 87 年 1 月，它开始在今年上半年开始腾飞。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：向上，就像强劲的反弹一样。</p><p> BORISH：反弹非常强劲。我想当我们在 8 月份达到高点时，对吧，它已经比去年上涨了 30% 以上。再次回到我刚才所说的，保罗给了我机会发挥创造性的研究想象力并将其花在一些数据上。我们很早就开始收集实时数据和建模。我提到我们雇了人。</p><p>所以我们找了一些人，当时有一本书，对，就是 1897 年至今的道指。我们必须在电子表格中输入这些数据。这非常复杂。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你必须不断更新，对吧。</p><p> BORISH：但是，你无法下载它，你必须检查它。当然，当人们输入大量数字时，就会出现拼写错误，因此您必须有图表才能看到所有这些不同的内容。考虑到我们在新的金融期货市场中所处的位置，我们开始建模和思考。如果你考虑一般或新市场的金融期货，我们总是有点像你有一个孩子，他们五岁、六岁，你认为你可以和他们交谈，你可以认为他们是理性，但他们不是。他们确实会发脾气。这种情况在衍生品领域发生过很多次。到了 87 年，没错，期货已经诞生了五年，人们认为将会有投资组合保险，将会有如此巨大的、始终的流动性，你可以持有更长时间的股票，你可以出售股票期货反对它。还有流动性连续性的假设。</p><p>因此，与此同时，我们了解到该模型和市场之下存在潜在的技术缺陷，我们正在构建这个模型，该模型实际上是在跟踪自 21 日低点以来发生的情况，我们将其与 21 日低点相对应。 82，以及将会发生什么。当我第一次建立这个模型时，我真的认为顶部将出现在 88 年初，而不是 8 月，次要顶部出现在 87 年 10 月，但后来技术面与基本面结合在一起，保罗是他真正拥有的伟大交易者有机会利用这一点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么在我们进入黑色星期一之前，您在一年中的什么时候开始看到基础市场出现裂缝？你在什么时候看到这个并说，“嘿，我们还有一些时间”，但你可以看到结束的开始即将到来？</p><p> BORISH：当市场在 8 月开始回调并进入 9 月到期时，请记住当时只有季度到期。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> BORISH：所以围绕这个有很多活动。当我们看到，研究的一部分是能够复制事物，所以你总是有假期，你会看到这一点。所以你有劳动节，你有三天的周末。因此，您可以根据价格活动、交易量和可能性将这些因素排列起来。如果你回到 29 年的场景，你也会看到劳动节后发生的事情，对吧？顶部是 29 年 9 月 3 日。然后你进行了调整，然后你进行了反弹。因此，当你因为当时全球发生的问题而使技术面与基本面保持一致时，同时，无论你相信与否，我们刚刚上任的美联储新任主席格林斯潘在。</p><p>所以这是一个菜鸟。现在你有了沃尔克·普赖尔，正如我想说的，你知道，年轻人拥有所有的动作，但老家伙赢得了冠军。因此，从某种意义上说，他面临着对此该怎么做的挑战。我们认为，在金融危机发生后，他将非常积极地降低利率，他也确实这么做了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：好吧，让我们回滚到崩溃前。那么黑色星期一之前的星期五，您的定位如何？都铎投资公司在那个周末的处境如何？</p><p> BORISH：所以类比确实在那个星期三敲响了红红的钟声，对吗？有下跌，达到技术水平，有反弹，然后失败。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，一次微弱的反弹，背后没有任何东西。</p><p> BORISH：是的，然后在那个星期五，我们觉得它就在那里，我们做空了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：有点短，非常短，你短了什么？</p><p> BORISH：我认为人们必须给出观点。请记住，我们当时并不是一家特别大的公司。所以对我们来说，我们是大空头。</p><p>然后在周末发生的新闻以及情绪的事实。仍然有人非常看好，有人认为他们可以受到保护，这就是大多数模型的地方，对吧，假设一致性，24 小时交易，你会没事的。你甚至可以去 98，对吧，有长期资本，这也是他们问题的一部分，但在周末，情况并非如此。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> BORISH：周一早上你们遇到了差距。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：市场缺口相当大。没有找到出价。你无法让人们打电话。告诉我们作为一名实际交易者，做空正在崩溃的市场的那一天是什么样的。</p><p>博里什：所以，你知道，这是一个非常非常有趣的观点，因为当你思考它时，这也是为什么我说拥有所有这些不同市场如此重要的优势之一。当你做空某种东西并且它下跌时，你就是一个自然的买家。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> BORISH：所以人们认为短裤不好，不，它们很好。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：他们是任何危机中的第一批买家。</p><p>博里什：是的，是的。那么问题是，正如我想说的，这是我对困境的定义。你是远离市场，看着其他人赚钱，还是进入市场，从而导致市场立即崩盘？</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以，但你在这次事故中是站在正确的一边的。</p><p>博里什：是的，我们是站在正确的一边。因此，有很多人处于这种进退两难的境地，因为市场如此强劲且缺乏纪律，具有讽刺意味的是，市场的买家更高，卖家更低。是的，每个人在 60,000 的时候都喜欢比特币，在 20 的时候他们都讨厌。你知道，那只是——</p><p>里索兹：这就是人性。</p><p> BORISH：是的，所以在这种情况下，他们不知道该怎么办。但随后恐慌袭来，他们开始抛售。所以我们从我们的经验中吸取了教训。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：告诉我们这一点，因为我记得您说过，从历史上看，当您查看其他崩溃事件时，最好的弥补机会不是崩溃当天而是第二天。告诉我们你是怎么下来的。</p><p>博里什：没错。因为当我之前提到1986年和7月时，9月我们实际上是做空的，然后我们在周一回补，市场继续下跌，直到周二中午。 9 月也这么做了，我想那是 9 月 13 日，很长一段时间，所以如果我没有确切的时间的话——</p><p>里索兹：对。但一般来说，糟糕的一天，人们第二天早上就好像让我摆脱这些东西一样。</p><p> BORISH：由于 24 小时交易，现在情况发生了一些变化，所以有时会出现极端情况，你确实会在低点和极端点收盘，第二天没有那么多跟进，但随后肯定会有跟进。</p><p>所以我们耐心等待，最终成为 20 号星期二的买家之一。我认为，我们执行的功能正是您在市场上想要的，对吗？短裤，我们正在覆盖，我们正在成为买家。我想，天哪，也许我们的一些买入有助于拉低价格。但我们真正做的不仅仅是股指期货。我们认为美联储和格林斯潘领导下将大幅降息。</p><p>记住，今天的 10 年是什么，370、375？</p><p> RITHOLTZ： 是的，不到四岁。</p><p> BORISH：当时远远超过六点，我认为接近七点。顺便说一句，从历史上看，今天市场上的情况是这样的，我认为风险回报是我们更有可能回到原来的状态，而不是回到原来的状态。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你不相信它，我们稍后会讨论每个人都预测较低的利率，我们会回到这一点。但您不仅做空股票，您的固定收益头寸是什么？</p><p>博里什：我们开始在整个曲线上购买大量固定收益期货，特别是在那时流动性最强的市场之一是欧洲美元期货，我们认为美联储将提供流动性，这是他们需要做的，他们确实做到了。</p><p>整个情况的讽刺之处在于，正是在那次崩盘之后，我们成立了罗宾汉基金会，认为那些在纽约不幸的人真的会受到市场低迷的影响。但美联储介入了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我们对此一无所知。正确的。</p><p>博里什：是的，美联储介入了。他们提供了流动性。正如我们在 08 年之后看到的那样，经济并不像今天那样必然依赖于股票市场。谁知道现在会发生什么。</p><p> （广告）</p><p> RITHOLTZ：对于那些可能没有看过的人来说，有一部著名的纪录片，我相信它的名字叫《交易者》，讲述了保罗·都铎·琼斯的故事。如果您还没有看过，可以在 YouTube、Vimeo 和其他地方观看。他是如何应对87年的混乱局面的？他的日子过得怎么样？</p><p> BORISH：嗯，对于我们俩来说，这确实是改变生活的一天。还有好人，也有伟大的人。在我看来，保罗是一位伟大的人，不仅作为一名交易员，而且作为一个个人，这也是他如此致力于纽约市和慈善事业的原因。</p><p>因此，当你做空某样东西时，它就会下跌，而很多其他人可能会受到伤害，从某种意义上说，总会有一点悲伤。这也是原因之一。当你走进去时，你会理智地想：“好吧，是的，也许我们会崩溃，但我们会做点什么。”但在情感上，你会想，“哇，在某些时候就是这样。我们不会受益。我们不想参与。第二天之后我们就不会再做空了。我们将等待，我们将拭目以待，我们​​希望支持市场和经济体系。对我来说，我们还相对年轻。保罗比我大五岁。但这是很多智慧，这也是我从中学到的东西。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：对于一个 30 岁的人来说。对于那些在 87 年交易不活跃的人来说，具有讽刺意味的是，不仅黑色星期一下跌了 22%，道琼斯指数也发生了变化，市场最终持平，上涨了 1%。考虑到这一点，这并不是可怕的一年。 88 年，事情又开始起飞了。事实证明，我们正处于长期牛市的早期阶段，而且您说过，您经常在长期牛市的早期阶段接受该测试。</p><p>请告诉我们一些关于 87 年崩溃后的想法以及十年后的情况。</p><p> BORISH：嗯，1988 年出现了最好的背离之一，即技术性买入。我认为，也许标准普尔指数为道琼斯指数或道琼斯运输指数创下了新低，但这一点尚未得到证实，市场情绪如此消极，这就是你必须保持灵活性的地方作为一名交易者，因为你会想，好吧，世界末日即将到来，然后我想我们很早就意识到它可能不会结束，或者至少今天不会。</p><p>所以现在你必须寻找机会，因为记住你正在管理别人的钱。你必须摆脱自己的观点，从你所处的知识迷雾中摇摇头，然后说这就是市场告诉我的。我需要倾听市场的声音。那是 1988 年，也是它真正起飞的时候。如果你考虑一下周期和时期，并进入 91 年布什一号领导下的伊拉克发生的事情，然后再次发生同样的事情，天哪。这也是一个非常有趣的教训，因为这是历史上我们第一次预先宣布发动战争的日期。</p><p>那么现在你如何进行风险管理呢？是的，你有模型，你通过它进行交易吗？你认为它不会发生吗？你这样做没有风险吗？</p><p> RITHOLTZ：您是在谈论布什二世和 03 年的伊拉克战争吗？</p><p>鲍里什：不，91 年的布什一世。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以有一个最后期限，而且……</p><p>博里什：是的，然后他进入了市场，之后市场开始起飞。你知道，在那段时间，从根本上、技术上来说，有很多很好的支持材料，因为你仍在从 87 年的恢复中，人们往往会记得发生在他们身上的最后一件事。所以他们总是感到害怕，因为他们认为市场会下跌，就像现在一样，他们担心自己会因为市场上涨而错过机会。我不太确定他们是否应该害怕错过。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：让我们继续讨论 87 年的情况，稍后我们将回到今天的市场。因此，87 年事后分析，你被财政部任命为美国总统市场机制特别工作组成员，由布雷迪领导，该工作组后来被称为布雷迪委员会。你发现了什么？调查 87 年空难原因的过程是怎样的？</p><p>博里什：首先，这是一种荣幸，当然我是那里最年轻的人，而且我仍然是许多员工的朋友。但我可以总结地告诉你，我们，都铎，远远领先于华尔街的所有其他公司，我们甚至不知道。但是报告中的所有数据，对吧，有一章是关于市场突破的，所有这些数据都来自我们。其他公司都没有这种能力，无论是 JP、高盛、MS、贝尔斯登，凡是你能想到的公司。正如我所说，这对保罗来说是一种功劳，他不仅愿意这样做，而且当时还愿意花资本投资数据和计算。</p><p>真正的结论是我们今天所处的位置，所有这些市场都是相互联系的，你知道纽约想责怪芝加哥，还有期权市场，它们都有点脱节，这就是联合工作组与财政部、美国商品期货交易委员会 (CFTC) 和美国证券交易委员会 (SEC)。这也是我们设置熔断机制的地方，你知道，某种价格限制。 87 年没有价格限制。</p><p>那么这也——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：意思是当东西下跌时，嘿，下跌 22%，这就是市场。现在是多少，7%？</p><p>博里什：是的。我认为有 3.5%、7% 和 15%。关键是有一个暂停，因为我们刚才提到了市场情绪，你需要后退一步。期货市场一直都有价格限制。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>博里什：从……</p><p> RITHOLTZ：锁定限制。这就是你在任何一天所能做的一切。</p><p> BORISH：顺便说一句，有时在短期内，这个限制会变得有点像磁铁，因为如果大豆的限制是 35 美分，而你下跌了 33 美分，你真的想持有多头头寸吗？回家过夜？</p><p>里索兹：对。所以两分钱。</p><p>博里什：但现在你可以坐下来，就股票而言，这只是一个暂停。让我们一起来吧。让我们看看那里发生了什么。做市商一直以来都很有效，对吧？即使在 08 年你就达到了这一点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：或者 2010 年和 2011 年的闪电崩盘。我们经历过这样的……</p><p> BORISH：是的，但是我们超时了，我们反弹了，现在我当然会关注其中的一些事情，并将数据视为潜在的有趣的技术指标，但那是另一天的事了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们继续讨论相互关联的市场的概念。我记得读过蒂姆·梅茨（Tim Metz）的书《黑色星期一》，他谈到了纽约证券交易所如何将芝加哥期货指数挂在墙上，以便交易者可以实际看到指数期货的情况。</p><p>过了一段时间，人们才意识到所有专家都在降低出价，因为他们正在关注股指期货。所有这些市场的相互关​​联程度如何？</p><p> BORISH：它们是完全相互关联的，因为流动性的关键是套利能力，而且有风险经理。所以标准普尔 500 股票，或者当时你有一个较小的指数，大约是道指合约的 28 个，所以你可以购买所有标的资产，你可以出售期货，反之亦然，或者你可以以任何你想要的方式旋转它。</p><p>如果您喜欢其中 27 种，您可以这样做并卖出期货，并隐式做空一种不存在的工具。</p><p>所以这些东西都是相互关联的，这一点很重要，因为要拥有一个成功的市场，你需要投资者，你需要投机者，当然，你需要自然的买家和对冲者，但你需要做市商和套利者来收紧市场，以便有足够的资金双方的流动性。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：您提到了 1987 年之后发生的许多变化。我们仍然很享受这一点。 08-09 年的影响是什么？我们还在应对那次事件的余震吗？我的意思是，显然，2020 年、2021 年和 2022 年，我们仍然处于中间，但今天仍然有 08-09 年的回声吗？</p><p> BORISH：我不知道是否可以说这是回声。当涉及到市场和流动性事件时，总是有一个学习过程。从短期来看，所有市场的变动总是由货币的供求关系决定的。 08年，有一些问题，不用说，但也有一些最近出现的事情。</p><p>例如，监管机构说：“哦，不，我们不应该被允许做空金融机构。”如果你还记得的话，08 年的混乱部分与此有关，因为他们禁止卖空。我想，监管机构在到期前这样做是非常明智的。所以你有大量的回补来消除空头头寸，但随后你摆脱了做市商。其中一些金融股在24小时内出现了10年的波动。这将消除大量流动性，然后市场将找到自己的自然水平，当时的水平要低得多。</p><p>里索兹：对。您希望人们作为买家介入以弥补这些空头头寸。你不希望有人私下宣传说公司即将倒闭，而实际上他们并没有倒闭。因此，不做空金融机构可以让我们提前了解 2023 年地区银行的情况。</p><p>您如何看待第一共和国和硅谷银行？这些是一次性的还是这是更系统化的东西的一部分？或者这只是美联储加息得太快以至于他们破坏了一切？</p><p>博里什：哇。这是一个非常有趣的问题。那么它是系统性的吗？我不认为这是系统性的。我认为这与这些公司管理层的经营方式有很大关系。 SVB 是一个特殊案例，因为风险投资资本大量流入。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> BORISH：问题是，这些总是会自然而然地被拿出来，因为你正在投资。与此同时，由于美联储正在进行加息活动，他们决定不再设立风险经理。</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But they did have hedges on in 2022. They just decided, hey, these are so profitable, we should ring the bell.</p><p> BORISH: Well, yeah, that&#39;s always, if you&#39;re hedging, you&#39;re hedging for a reason. And are you hedging to trade? There&#39;s a difference, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, they&#39;re a bank, so one would assume their hedging interest rate duration risk, they just saw the win and said, hey, everybody&#39;s going to get a good bonus this year.</p><p> BORISH: Right, but then they move from hedgers to speculators.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> BORISH: And if that&#39;s not your professional job, that becomes extraordinarily challenging.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: As we learned.</p><p> BORISH: And, you know, First Republic, which was a different type of institution, and they were basically, think about it in the old days, they were giving away the toaster to try to get accounts and then when rates started to go up. So think about this, right? The 10 year at its low in 20 was 20 basis points. Now we&#39;re at three seven. But historically, three seven isn&#39;t very high. And it goes back to my earlier statement that people anchor to sort of the high or the low, so they assume it&#39;s going back there. That&#39;s a big risk management mistake to make that assumption.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk a little bit about computerized trading, helping traders become better at their jobs, and hiring traders. Let&#39;s start with that. What sort of traits should hedge funds be looking for if they want to hire a successful trader.</p><p> BORISH: If you&#39;re referring to a discretionary trader, right, so that&#39;s one bucket versus sort of a model-based quantitative trader where you&#39;re looking at their track record.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Tell us about both.</p><p> BORISH: Well, so I&#39;m going to start first with the quantitative, it&#39;s a little easier. I&#39;ve never had a quantitative trader come to me with a bad simulated track record.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, well models are always fantastic.</p><p> BORISH: I&#39;m waiting for the guy to come in with a minus two sharp going “Wait, it can only get better.” Then I —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But by the way, what backtest ever is bad?</p><p> BORISH: Yes, yeah, well, I&#39;m super. I can predict yesterday perfectly. I&#39;m very good at that. I try to, you know, come on here, I&#39;ll tell you what happened, no problem.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Who has a better track record than Hindsight Capital? They&#39;re the best.</p><p> BORISH: Yeah, and it&#39;s the hedge fund is there, but it&#39;s why, in seriousness, that, you know, the first line of every disclosure document is past performance is not indicative of future results, but everybody looks at past performance.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> BORISH: So on the quant side, you have to look at real-time data, and you also have to segment it to sort of its strategy relative to market. So if you look at last year, a lot of CTAs and trend followers did really well, and you&#39;d have a great real-time track record associated.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you had a defined move in a specific direction that was sustained?</p><p> BORISH: Yes. So there&#39;s two things about that. One they&#39;ll come to me and go, “Oh man, man, we just had the best year since &#39;08. Another year where there&#39;s a lot of dislocations.” And I&#39;m like, “Man, that&#39;s fantastic. Once every 15 years, do me a favor. Come back in &#39;13, I don&#39;t want to be late.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BORISH: But the reality is if you want to dig deeper in that, then you start looking at, “Well, what markets did you trade? Why did you do that? Why did you exclude COCO? Well COCO is not a good trend following market. How do you know that? Well then you&#39;ve over optimized. So you really have to start digging deep, asking very, very tough questions when it comes to these quantitative strategies. Frequency of trading, volatility, draw downs, it&#39;s, and all this is more of an art than it is a science.</p><p> And that also applies on the discretionary trading side. But on the discretionary trading side, you have that other element that you have to put on top of that, which is the emotional and the psychological. And one of the things I always say is that every successful trader has a near-death experience. I just hope they have it before we&#39;ve allocated to them.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BORISH: And so it&#39;s not that they&#39;ve had it, it&#39;s how you recover from it. And so it&#39;s one of these things that math works. And so sometimes there&#39;s a trader and he&#39;ll come into my office and I&#39;ll go, “Pete, I can&#39;t believe it. I just had my worst day ever.” And I&#39;m like, “Well, I&#39;ve got good news and bad news for you.” And he goes, “Well, what&#39;s the good news?” I go, “Well, you&#39;re still within your risk parameters. You didn&#39;t violate any of our trading rules. So you still have a job.” And they go, “Well, then what&#39;s the bad news?” I go, if you&#39;re in business long enough, you&#39;re going to have a worse trade. Because that&#39;s just the law of large numbers. Records are made to be broken. If I told you 20 years ago that someone was going to break Kareem&#39;s scoring record in basketball, unbelievable.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You would have left him, right.</p><p> BORISH: And here we are, LeBron James did it this year. All the credit in the world for him. But it&#39;s a little bit like trading options. So if you continually buy premium, thinking a record&#39;s going to be broken, you probably run out of money before it does. And if you continually sell premium, thinking the record&#39;s never going to be broken, you go broke when it is broken. So you have to have that discipline and it&#39;s an extraordinarily tough business.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: To say the very least. Let&#39;s talk about a quote of yours that I happen to really like. “Fundamentals aren&#39;t wrong, you are.” Explain what that means.</p><p> BORISH: It means that the market is the scoreboard. And if you think you&#39;re right and you think the fundamentals are wrong, you&#39;re going to take a small loss and turn it into a large loss. Trading works best when the fundamentals and the technicals intersect. Too often, one just looks at either one or the other. So we could say today, “Well, we think the fundamentals are deteriorating. There&#39;s no way the S&amp;P should be at 4,200. I&#39;m going to get short.”</p><p> But there&#39;s no technical indication in the markets today that you should be short.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. The number of 52-week lows is falling, the breadth is pretty good, and when you look, especially outside of the US, a lot of positive uptrends. People have a tendency to ignore that, and they&#39;re just focused at what&#39;s going on. Look at the Russell small cap in the US It&#39;s doing terrible. We&#39;re due to crash.</p><p> BORISH: That&#39;s correct. So what you do for me in that case, I&#39;m looking for, if you want to look to sell it and pick level then you look for the Russell to start doing better and reaching key technical levels and then you can probe and you look for divergences all the time. So you look at the transports which have been lagging for today but these are all signs they&#39;re not things in which you should be taking action, you have to be patient and a lot of times you talk about traders and discretionary traders in particular and I&#39;ll speak to them, not trading is a trade.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> BORISH: And just because you&#39;re sitting in front of the screen doesn&#39;t mean you have to do something and that takes tremendous discipline because particularly if you get paid a share of the profits and you&#39;re like there&#39;s nothing going on. Now some of the best traders I know they&#39;ll be like okay I did something it&#39;s 10:30 I&#39;ve made some money I&#39;m out of here for the day.</p><p> And that&#39;s fine. However you do it, however you force your own self-discipline, but just trading to trade is a terrible strategy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s the great Warren Buffett quote, “Unlike baseball there are no cold strikes in markets.” You could sit there with a bat on your shoulder and just wait for your pitch.</p><p> BORISH: That&#39;s correct.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk a little bit…</p><p> BORISH: But a lot of people are in the business because they love the action and sitting…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh well we&#39;re all junkies we&#39;re all looking for that dopamine.</p><p> BORISH: So sitting with your bat on your shoulder is really tough for some people.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes, yes, absolutely. I&#39;m always surprised at traders who are also gamblers like to go to Vegas like to play blackjack it&#39;s like don&#39;t you get enough excitement from traders?</p><p> BORISH: I don&#39;t gamble at all I don&#39;t bet on — I&#39;m a fan right so I&#39;m a Michigan fan I&#39;m a Nick fan, God I&#39;m a Jets fan I&#39;m a Mets fan so we can…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you are a glutton for punishment.</p><p> BORISH: Yes, we could have a whole psychological segment.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Although at least Michigan has been doing, football&#39;s been doing better.</p><p> BORISH: Yes, and they had a good run in basketball. But I&#39;m a fan, I enjoy, I never bet on sports.</p><p> (ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about betting on natural gas.</p><p> We have had a kind of wild market in energy over the past couple of years. Not just the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but all the things that have been happening in both oil and gasoline and natural gas. You&#39;re a natural gas trader. How do you look at what&#39;s going on in that market, and tell us where the price of energy is going to be in a couple of weeks or months?</p><p> BORISH: So, for everybody that&#39;s listening, whatever I do, do the opposite, and you may have a chance of success. So natural gas, in terms of how it&#39;s behaved, it&#39;s had a round trip. So where the price is today is close to where oil was when it was zero in April of &#39;20, just to give you a sense.</p><p> So natural gas– –</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Crude oil is also round trip, and gasoline is almost a round trip.</p><p> BORISH: Yeah, but not nearly to the extent. So this again becomes listen to the markets, don&#39;t listen to the gossip. And so where we are right now, in my mind, in natural gas, which is different than crude, is a little bit counter cyclical because we&#39;ve had warmer than normal weather, we had extra storage, and that put downward pressure in winter.</p><p> Now it looks like that&#39;s going to reverse and we&#39;re going to have a sort of really hot summer, and you can ascribe that to climate change, or —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: El Nino and that stuff.</p><p> BORISH: Right, yeah, you can decide whatever you want to call it, but the facts are the facts, right? If it&#39;s hot and we&#39;re going to be burning and you&#39;re going to need to be cooling, at the same time, a lot of this thought that natural gas and the economy was going to weaken, And in general, we were taught to try to buy low and sell high. We just talked earlier how most times in the markets, buyers are higher and sellers are lower.</p><p> So we&#39;re sitting there trying to put a position on sort of spreading summer natural gas and hedging it a little bit by being short winter next year.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So we&#39;re recording this at the end of May 2023. How do you look at macro events, the Russian invasion of Ukraine just being one example, does that affect the way you look at what the market is telling you, or is that just gossip by the time it&#39;s in the newspaper it&#39;s already in the price?</p><p> BORISH: No, you have to look at all these things. I think there&#39;s an important lesson here. When there&#39;s tremendous amount of market uncertainty, you need to trade smaller. Because that&#39;s what kills you.</p><p> Periods of low volatility, which we&#39;re in now, then tend to be followed by higher volatility. A lot of models are predicated on looking backwards over recent volatility, and then you&#39;re trading too large.</p><p> And I really want to distinguish, because people talk all the time about black swans. And they go, “Oh, this black swan could happen,” or, “That black swan could happen.” And I&#39;m like, “If you&#39;re talking about it, it&#39;s not a black swan.” That&#39;s risk management. That&#39;s smart.</p><p> A black swan is when you wake up in the morning and a condo in Florida has collapsed or you wake up in the morning and Abe&#39;s been assassinated. These aren&#39;t things that you put into your risk management models. But if you survive, you win. So you should really probably at these periods of uncertainty. So is there going to be a Ukrainian offensive? What is that going to do? And how is that going to affect the situation with Russia? Are they going to be threatening? They are a nuclear power. Is that just a threat to try to keep them? Or God forbid, something worse happens. I have no idea. I don&#39;t think anybody can have that idea because you can&#39;t get into the head of the leaders of Russia to decide how they&#39;re going to act.</p><p> But from a trading perspective, I think that you need to trade smaller. Now, one of the things that I find really interesting right now, this time of year, is that because if there is climate change and you have grain prices that are pre-pandemic levels, it could be really fascinating and exciting to have sort of a summer rally in soybeans and corn. And the risk reward of buying them right here is fantastic. Because you&#39;ve had a wet period of time, if you get dry and you don&#39;t have good growing conditions in the Midwest here, at the same time you have uncertainty in the Ukraine, which is a large producer of grains.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Big breadbasket, yes.</p><p> BORISH: So, yes. So this could be, and there&#39;s nothing more fun than a summer bull market in grains.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I&#39;ve never quite heard that sentence before. Nothing more fun than a bull market in the summer and grains.</p><p> You&#39;ve pointed out the psychology and self-discipline. How can you teach traders to manage their emotions and to not allow either their enthusiasm or despair to affect their trading behavior?</p><p> BORISH: The best teacher, unfortunately, is failure. And how you deal with that failure. So many times, people would come into my office after a really bad day, they sit down, they put their hands on their head, and they go, “Oh, why the hell am I in this business?” Now, what you can do, and we&#39;ve all done this, if you get out of all your positions, you emotionally cleanse yourself. But are you able to get back in the game? Because you can emotionally cleanse yourself and leave the game, and you&#39;ll never be able to make your money back. So how do you handle that adversity?</p><p> Success, okay, most people enjoy success.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But it doesn&#39;t teach you anything.</p><p> BORISH: Correct, in the trading business, it&#39;s how you deal, what did you do? And you have to really be self-aware. Did I hold on to the position too long? Was I too big? Was I gossiping with other people and I lost my discipline? You really have to break it down and it all comes back to the fact that you have to admit that it&#39;s my fault as a trader. I&#39;m the one that screwed up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wait, you mean it&#39;s not the Fed&#39;s fault? Because I&#39;ve spent the past decade listening to managers and economists and traders tell me, “Well, my P&amp;L would be much better, but this QE and the Fed doing this, how can anybody trade in that environment?”</p><p> BORISH: Yeah, as the years have gone on, I&#39;ve gotten a lot better at taking credit for success and blaming others for my failure.</p><p> And, yeah, it&#39;s a good way to go, but you&#39;re living in Lalaland if that&#39;s how you think. You are what your track record is and it&#39;s the sports scenario. If you&#39;re playing baseball and the team gives you a shot and you&#39;re batting 150 and they take you out of the lineup, it&#39;s not the manager&#39;s fault.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s the umpire. The umpire is calling those outside pitches strikes. How can anybody get a fair shot at the plate with that?</p><p> BORISH: That&#39;s true but if he is just like in the markets, you have to adjust to it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s exactly right. So let&#39;s talk a little bit about Robinhood. It could be one of the more famous Wall Street-based philanthropies in New York, especially given its longevity. How did the idea come about? How big a factor was the &#39;87 crash in the creation of Robinhood?</p><p> BORISH: So it&#39;s probably, of all the things, something I&#39;m most proud about, being associated with that since the beginning. And again, really kudos to Paul for his leadership in doing that. So as I said earlier, we really thought that there could be some economic struggles following &#39;87. And one of the things about trickle down, and I need to fully disclose, yeah, I&#39;m a Democrat that believes in markets, is that when things go bad, it&#39;s those at the bottom that get hurt first.</p><p> And we&#39;ve seen that repeatedly. And so when we thought about helping New York, now you have to realize, 1988, we gave away $65,000.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> Not exactly a huge amount of money.</p><p> BORISH: No, last year we gave away 130 million.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s a chunk of change.</p><p> BORISH: Yes, and —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And you guys have been doing this every year for 35 years.</p><p> BORISH: Yes, and the model was different, and why did we start it? Because Paul&#39;s an entrepreneur, and the one thing, and we&#39;re market people, and we said, you know what, if we do a good job, we&#39;ll be able to raise the money, and I don&#39;t want people to give us money and us not spend it.</p><p> So we have two rules. One is if you give us a dollar, we&#39;re going to put it out the door in the next 12 months. And two, we&#39;re paying for the overhead, the board. So if you give us a dollar, it&#39;s getting paid. It&#39;s not being paid —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: 100 cents on the dollar goes out from donated cash.</p><p> BORISH: That&#39;s correct.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And who are the donors to the Robinhood Foundation besides you and Paul Tudor Jones and that original crew?</p><p> BORISH: There&#39;s literally thousands and after 9/11 and Sandy and during the pandemic, tens of thousands of donors from all different sizes. Now we&#39;re sitting here in Bloomberg and Mayor Mike through the Bloomberg Philanthropies is one of the largest donors and supporters of New York.</p><p> Now Robinhood focuses on sort of the overriding goal is mobility from poverty.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Meaning economic mobility, the ability to pull yourself out from a bad condition.</p><p> BORISH: That&#39;s correct and within that you know we&#39;re we were the first funders of charter schools in New York City. We&#39;re the largest funders of food pantries. You have to have a holistic approach and if you walk around New York and if you love New York City, what are the four issues? Right, you see them. There&#39;s homelessness, there&#39;s mental health, there&#39;s food insecurity, and there&#39;s immigration.</p><p> And that together, if you could do that through job training, through education, through support systems, and we do that also, we have, try to use technology to help that to put people on a path of a better life. Is it a challenge?绝对地。 But we go back about the trading business and talking about how bad a day can be. But the thing that keeps it always in perspective, no matter how bad a day I have, the people that we&#39;re helping, their days are far worse.</p><p> And if you keep that in perspective, you&#39;re going to help others who are less fortunate.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: How do you measure success for a charity? as a trader you get a P&amp;L, you know exactly whether you&#39;re right or wrong, how can you tell the impact of your dollars whether or not they&#39;re successful or not?</p><p> BORISH: So that&#39;s a really outstanding question and that&#39;s something that Robinhood has been particularly innovative in, in trying to measure metrics.</p><p> So if it&#39;s a job training program, it&#39;s not just a number of people that are in there for example. how once they graduate, where&#39;s their starting salary relative to where they were beforehand? Do they still have that job a year later? How are they making more money? Are they at some percentage above the poverty level?</p><p> If you&#39;re funding charter schools, where are they? Are the kids graduating? Are they going to college? Are you tracking them? Are they getting employment? So it&#39;s all very data intensive and metric intensive.</p><p> Now there are some things, right, if you&#39;re, if unfortunately, if you&#39;re a woman and you&#39;ve been battered, and you have kids, before they can go to job training or education, they need to have a safe place to stay. So we fund shelters and where we are, and we do food support, because it has to be a holistic approach, this movement from poverty.</p><p> And as a parent, just as you&#39;re dealing with your own children, that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a holistic approach. It&#39;s not, okay, here&#39;s one magic bullet. I wish that were the case, but it isn&#39;t. And like any organization, the key is not me, not Paul, not the other board members. It&#39;s the quality of the staff. And we have committed, innovative staff that has really pushed Robinhood along the way. And that started with our leaders and president from David Saltzman to Wes Moore, who&#39;s now the governor of Maryland, to our newest one, Rich Buery. And so we&#39;re really fortunate to have excellent team.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You mentioned charter schools. Tell us a little bit about the KIPP Charter School in the Bronx and why Robinhood has been so active in promoting and developing charter schools in some of the poorer neighborhoods in New York City?</p><p> BORISH: Well, we&#39;re markets people. So we think that competition is a good thing. We know that charter schools aren&#39;t going to be a replacement for all public schools, but if you think about technology in general, right, it&#39;s innovation and change. And if you think about the KIPP model, it&#39;s really like a parent. So if you have a child and they&#39;re not doing well, what do you do? You give them extra resources, you give them extra homework.</p><p> And so they may come home from school and you&#39;re working with them. Now if you have parents who are working the overnight shift in a hospital, they don&#39;t have that ability to give their children that extra time because they&#39;re working. So these schools do that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Meaning extended hours, tutors, et cetera.</p><p> BORISH: Exactly, they&#39;re providing the resources and the opportunities for those students who they wouldn&#39;t normally have in a traditional public school model.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about what you guys do for, at Robinhood, for public schools. Tell us about Math for America that seeks to improve math education in US public schools.</p><p> BORISH: So Robinhood Foundation, Math for America, those are the two not-for-profit boards that I sit on. And I&#39;ve been blessed, really, because Math for America was started by Jim Simons. And we all know what a legend Jim Simons is in the hedge fund world. In the education space, that model was predicated in how do we keep better math and science teachers in public schools? The assumption being, which isn&#39;t rocket science even though he is a rocket —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Pay them more.</p><p> BORISH: Well, yes, but for the students —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Give them the tools, give them the resources, yeah.</p><p> BORISH: If you have really good teachers, you&#39;re likely to have better outcomes. So how do you keep really good teachers in schools when there&#39;s a lot of competition for them? So we&#39;ve done two things at Math for America. We&#39;ve established a community of master math science teachers where they can come together and learn and teach and also we provide them a stipend so there&#39;s an incentive for them to stay in their schools and it&#39;s really fascinating because even though all the teachers in the schools aren&#39;t there, a good captain, good player makes the players around them better.</p><p> And so what they&#39;re doing and what they&#39;ve taken back from, you know, coming down to Math for America for the sessions and bringing it back to school, I think helps all the teachers, which helps all the students.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Before we get to our favorite questions, let me throw a curveball at you, which I find intriguing. You like to quote Captain EJ Smith, who famously said, quote, “When anyone asks me how I can best describe my experience in nearly 40 years at sea, I merely say, &#39;uneventful.&#39;” Why is that quote so intriguing to you?</p><p> BORISH: Well, not only did he say that, but he said it sort of just before the launching of the Titanic. And I think if you&#39;ve listened at all to–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And he was the captain of the Titanic. Yes, he was the captain of the Titanic. If you listen to anything or taken anything out of this podcast, is that complacency in anything but particularly in the markets is extraordinarily dangerous.</p><p> And one should take away from that that bad things can and will happen in the markets. That means trade smaller, have really good risk management, and don&#39;t believe your success when you&#39;re trading successfully.</p><p> (ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests, starting with, tell us what you&#39;ve been entertaining yourself with. What are you listening to or watching, be it Netflix or podcasts or whatever?</p><p> BORISH: Well, so we have a sort of group consideration at home. course we&#39;re finishing “Succession” right there&#39;s two left and at the same time, Barry, and “Ted Lasso” so those post Memorial Day, I think we&#39;re going to have to find some new things.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;ll make a recommendation to you it&#39;s only eight episodes and I&#39;m only halfway through it but “The Diplomat” yes that&#39;s next on our list.</p><p> BORISH: Yes, that&#39;s next – that&#39;s next on our list.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really well done really fascinating characters I&#39;m really I&#39;m really enjoying it.</p><p> BORISH: And when I&#39;m sitting around and trying to clear the ahead and reading. I try, I like historical novels.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well we&#39;re going to come up to books in a moment so put a pin in that. Tell us about your early mentors who helped shape your career.</p><p> BORISH: Well I was very, very fortunate as I said being at the Fed and in the research people there and of course there&#39;s Paul who was a mentor and because we&#39;re together on the board of the Robinhood Foundation is still a mentor because I think you can always learn different things. And believe it or not, a lot of the mentors now are people I read and listen to. And for example, I had the opportunity to be here at Bloomberg Philanthropies a few weeks ago and listen to Mayor Mike. And I try to take away things that I find insightful.</p><p> And sometimes I run into people and I&#39;ll say to them, you know, you may not remember this, because to you it was a throwaway line, but it had a lot of meaning to me. And I probably stole it and didn&#39;t give attribution to it. But I try, it doesn&#39;t matter who it is across the board. And it can be from a “Ted Lasso”, it could be from a book, it could be from a politician, it could be from anybody.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about books. What are some of your favorites and what are you reading right now?</p><p> BORISH: So as I mentioned, I read a lot of historical novels and there&#39;s an author by the name of David Liss who writes about England and coffee trading and those type of markets in the 1800s and that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m reading right now because the psychological aspect, even then, applies to today.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What else have you read recently that you enjoyed?</p><p> BORISH: I&#39;m going to read Michael Lewis&#39;s new book, of course.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, I&#39;m excited.</p><p> Coming out in September, October, something like that.</p><p> BORISH: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes, that&#39;s going to be great. So, our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in either trading or running a fund?</p><p> BORISH: So I think all college grads, all young people, you have to be willing to pay your dues. But the trading aspect, the hedge fund aspect, it&#39;s a lot like sports. The chances of being a pro is a low probability. So you should try and then if you have a chance of success, continue, but if not, then you need to pivot because what you don&#39;t want to be doing is saying, okay, I&#39;m going to be a lifetime player in the triple A&#39;s. And so, as in the minor leagues. But if you want to pursue it, you have to pursue it. But do your own work, right? Coming in, and I do a lot of global macro and risk-consulting and I always tell them, I go, “You&#39;re not paying me to read you “the Wall Street Journal or from Bloomberg.” I go, “If you want to have story time, it&#39;s great. “I&#39;ll pull up all the Bloomberg articles you want “and I&#39;ll read them to you.”</p><p> So don&#39;t rehash other things that people can easily get and think you&#39;re being innovative. Do your own work and you really need to be analytical.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And our final question, what do you know about the world of trading and investing today? You wish you knew 50 years or so ago when you were first getting started?</p><p> 50 or 40? Let&#39;s call it 40 years.</p><p> BORISH: Yeah, let&#39;s say 40.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I just put a decade on yourself. (LAUGHTER)</p><p> So 40 years ago, when you graduated in the 80s, what do you wish you knew then that you know now?</p><p> BORISH: I think it&#39;s always the same. I wish we didn&#39;t go through our own near-death experiences. We had that, as I said, every successful traders, We had big volatility in &#39;86, at Tudor that I mentioned earlier. I wish I knew how difficult it would be running my own CTA. So when I left Tudor, they seeded me. I bought the team of research. It was sort of the first quant trading on the street. And the whole business aspect of raising money, compliance, I wish I had a better understanding of that because it&#39;s just not your track record. And that&#39;s another big problem for graduates today. They think, “Oh, I have a great track record.” This isn&#39;t Field of Dreams. If you build it, they don&#39;t come. You need to have a really, really important process and I wish I was better at that at that time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: My colleague Ben Carlson calls that “organizational alpha” and I love that phrase.</p><p> BORISH: It is a great phrase.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.

Borish was founding partner and right-hand man to Paul Tudor Jones at <a class="gtrackexternal" href="https://www.tudor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tudor Investment Corporation</a> , where he was director of research for 10 years. Borish also previously served as chief strategist for Quad Group LLC. His philanthropy includes sitting on the board of directors of Paul Tudor Jones&#39; <a class="gtrackexternal" href="https://www.robinhood.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robin Hood Foundation</a> and Jim Simon&#39;s <a href="https://www.mathforamerica.org/">Math for America</a> .</p><p> He explains what the trading experience was like on Black Monday, 1987. As head of research for Tudor Investments, he built the models that Paul Tudor Jones relied on when he was short Future and Equities the Friday before.</p><p> He is fond of noting: “Markets spend a lot of time doing nothing, then they reprice.” That applied in 1987, which looked parallel in price activity and volume to the 1929 crash: A pullback in August 1987 into the Labor Day holiday, a peak near the September expirations, a modest selloff, and then a weak rally into October. That setup plus the mistaken belief that Portfolio Insurance would offer protection from losses, was the perfect up parallel. Then came the crash, and based on prior market history, they decided to wait until mid-Tuesday to cover.</p><p> Borish also explains why “Trading and risk management are inherently unnatural.” Successful trading requires a very counterintuitive approach that is uncomfortable to most people. He notes “Without discipline, the irony of markets is <em>buyers are higher, and sellers are lower</em> ; this is why everybody loved Bitcoin at 60,000 but hated it at 20.”</p><p> A list of his favorite books <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/06/mib-peter-borish/#more-315356">is here</a> ; A transcript of our conversation is <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/06/transcript-peter-borish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a> Tuesday.</p><p> You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/peter-borish-on-lessons-from-the-1987-market-crash/id730188152?i=1000618139072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTunes</a> , <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/46kbrXqeCvNnzJ0jefDbiH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> , <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/masters-in-business/episode/peter-borish-on-lessons-from-the-1987-market-crash-304711866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stitcher</a> , <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzRlNGNkOTEwLTQwYTEtNDYxOS1hNWYzLWFlMmIwMDEyZmZmZi81ODczYTNjYi0yOThmLTQwYmMtYjcxZi1hZTJiMDAxMzAwMGQvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe4PRejZgr0PzN7r8NikAnOqP70DHhoJ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> , and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-06-23/peter-borish-on-lessons-from-the-1987-market-crash-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> .

To be a successful investor you need to possess a number of different traits. You need to understand how math, statistics and probabilities work.

And you need the emotional discipline to stick with a reasonable investment strategy from manias to panics and everything in between.
