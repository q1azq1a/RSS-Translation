Mathieu Chabran 是总部位于巴黎的另类资产管理公司 TIKEHAU Capital 的联合创始人。他们管理着价值超过 400 亿美元的资产。</p><p>我发现这真的是一次关于从不同角度接近投资世界的精彩对话。富有创造力，跳出框框思考，不仅要模仿别人的做法，还要通过以不同的方式思考世界来创造新的机会。</p><p>谈话内容丰富，引人入胜。我觉得这很棒，我想你也会，不用多说，我与 TIKEHAU Capital 的 Mathieu Chabran 的谈话。</p><p> TIKEHAU CAPITAL 联合创始人 MATHIEU CHABRAN：谢谢你，Barry。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我忘了说，您已于 2022 年 1 月获得法兰西共和国总统颁发的法国荣誉军团骑士勋章。我们将在其他时间回过头来讨论。我不知道这与资产管理有多大关系，但让我们谈谈你在受到法国总统称赞之前所做的事情。</p><p>你在巴黎上学，但你在伦敦的美林和德意志银行开始了你的职业生涯。告诉我们一些关于那个背景的信息。</p><p> CHABRAN：是的，不，巴里，没错。你知道，这在欧洲是一回事，我实际上认为，伦敦仍然是你加入金融服务业时想要接触的地方。所以我很幸运能够在 90 年代后期在美林公司获得这个暑期实习机会。我遇到了安托万，实际上是我的共同创始合伙人。所以那是有一段时间了，但尽管如此，我不知道是不是一见钟情，但我们相处得很好，在投资银行工作了几年后，他加入了高盛。实际上，我加入了德意志银行。我们决定自己尝试一下。我们分别是 28 岁和 30 岁。</p><p>回顾过去，投资银行业务，即使银行已经不复存在，也是一次很棒的培训。我认为这是一次很棒的培训。我想我们学到了很多东西。你在投资银行业的风险敞口，我的背景是杠杆金融银行家。 90 年代后期，欧洲高收益市场的出现，你会以前所未有的方式印制交易。你得到了这种曝光，你是一个年轻的分析师，助理，你可以和管理团队一起参加路演。我回头看，就我们所获得的曝光度而言，这是一次地狱般的训练。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，我可以想象。你在巴黎上学时的计划是一直进入金融领域，还是你最初倾向于另一个方向？</p><p> CHABRAN：在加入巴黎的一所商学院之前，我在我的家乡普罗旺斯艾克斯学习政治学。当时没有迹象表明我会进入金融领域。</p><p>因此，当我接触到优秀的老师并开始学习时，顺便说一下，什么，又一次，回到 90 年代后期，但后来你开始读书，我不是在谈论理论书籍，但是一些经验，人们，我记得这些书，读过迈克尔刘易斯的“说谎者的扑克牌”，读过关于米尔肯和垃圾债券的“掠夺者的舞会”，这就是兴奋的开始。你就像，我必须接触到这一点。</p><p>所以不，没有写任何东西，但这是重要的一步。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：快进到今天。你现在在美国的一家大型欧洲公司工作，但实际上你的职业生涯是在伦敦的大型美国公司开始的。</p><p>查布兰：没错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：美国公司在欧洲与欧洲公司在美国的文化差异是什么？</p><p> CHABRAN：是的，这是一个有趣的问题。从美国的角度来看，巴里，有时，欧洲可能是一个简单的概念，但它是一个非常复杂的现实。所以在欧洲做生意显然是本地化，因为意大利不是西班牙，法国不是德国。有时，伦敦人认为他们涵盖了整个欧洲运动场，但这又是一个复杂的现实。</p><p>因此，当时遇到了为这些美国银行工作的美国人，现在他们明白了。那些成功的人，甚至是我们的一些同行、竞争对手、朋友、正在竞争和攻占欧洲市场的美国特许经营商，通常那些成功或非常成功的人是那些在实地花了很多时间的人.</p><p>然后相反，希望，在为美国特许经营工作，与人和伟大的导师共度时光，你知道，对我来说，我现在希望能更好地理解我们在这里扩张时的文化差异。我相信您会欣赏的，在纽约与美洲其他地方的现实情况截然不同，部分原因在于拜访美国中西部地区的新客户。</p><p>所以希望这里有一点融合，让它变得有价值。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我喜欢 Spalding Gray 的那句老话，“我不住在美国，我住在美国东海岸的一个小岛上。”因为就您而言，纽约不是堪萨斯城，堪萨斯城也不是迈阿密。但纽约绝对是它自己的生物。</p><p> CHABRAN：这是肯定的。你知道，对于我们 TIKEHAU 来说，这是在北美开设和扩张的重要一步。只是背景，巴里，当我五年前的今年 2018 年搬到这里时，我们在北美几乎没有任何关系。我们从客户的角度，从 LP 的角度进行了一些投资和关系。快进，今天接近我们在这里筹集的 AUM 的 10%。我们推出了新举措，我们试图与众不同。显然，这是一场长期的游戏，在美国开展业务时，你必须长期贪婪。</p><p>但在我们今天所从事的业务中，另类资产管理领域尽管具有竞争力，但现在的结构性机会使得你必须在这里做出的欧洲承诺必须是长期的。我亲自做出了承诺，我看到了路径，因为有扩展业务的空间。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：让我们来谈谈是什么导致了 2004 年决定推出 TIKEHAU Capital。你在德意志银行，你的同事 Antoine 在高盛。是什么让你说，“嘿，让我们把乐队重新组合起来吧？”</p><p> CHABRAN：嗯，你知道吗，这实际上又回到了我刚才所说的。我们看到了所有这些特许经营权的推出，显然在它们的顶端以及你能想到的所有今天引领行业的人，但当时他们管理着数百亿美元，这在当时是巨大的，但这只是今天的一小部分。</p><p>我们看到所有这些美国特许经营权在伦敦以外的欧洲推出，我们就像，“我们为什么不试一试呢？”我们学习了杠杆融资，我们学习了房地产债务，我们知道高收益，我们知道机会主义投资，我们就像，永远不会太晚，永远不会太早，我们决定使用我们收集的 400 万美元的巨额资产管理规模来自朋友和家人。</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> CHABRAN：所以你可以理解当时的挑战，但你必须从某个地方开始。</p><p>里索尔兹：对。那是在现金周围走来走去。</p><p>所以让我们谈谈不要太晚，也不要太早，你在互联网泡沫破灭后立即推出。</p><p>查布兰：正确。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：但是在金融危机爆发前几年……</p><p>查布兰：没错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那个时期是什么样的，那两次巨大波动事件之间的平静是什么样的？</p><p> CHABRAN：这是一次经历，因为互联网泡沫，我记得我是美林的一名年轻合伙人，所有的投资银行，他们必须重塑自己，以确保他们能够记住我们最近听到的留住人才再次。</p><p>所以他们创造了一些很酷的工作空间，你将不再打领带之类的，这都是一种物质形式，就好像有一种转变。然后，从我们推出全球金融危机时的第四年开始，我们在 TIKEHAU 开展业务已经三年，四年了。我记得我们感到无比自豪，因为当时我们与贝尔斯登银行合作，我们与雷曼兄弟合作，这是创业发展的一个步骤。然后突然之间，在周末，那些银行都不见了。</p><p>所以你就像一个年轻的企业家，离开了这种濒临死亡的经历，尽管你认为你已经接近确定，因为你正在与你能想到的最好的机构和对手合作。然后突然间，一切都取决于你如何看待和看待这个世界，永远不要把任何事情视为理所当然，永远处于挑战一切的世界中。</p><p>所以它对你每天早上的胃痛都没有好处，但只有偏执狂才能生存。我认为那是一次很棒的学习经历。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：让我们从商业角度谈谈贝尔斯登和雷曼之后发生的事情。贝尔斯登被摩根大通吸收。因此，您在贝尔斯登的联系人仍在营业。</p><p>雷曼兄弟最好的部分被巴克莱吸收了。所以我不得不想象很多在那些地方与你做生意的人都站起来了，你仍然有一些关系，或者我对此过于乐观了吗？</p><p> CHABRAN：不，不，以上都是。但更重要的是，正如我所说，在我们的发展过程中，永远不要想当然。因为雷曼兄弟是一家在周五晚上获得单一 A 级评级的银行，而它在周一早上违约了，即使我在草拟一点，从那时起，我们有 8 亿AUM，我猜。顺便说一句，我们有一个 20、25 人的团队，其中大多数人今天仍然和我们在一起。如果你允许的话，当你们一起工作时感觉很棒，因为那时你只需要看着某人的眼睛，你就会确切地知道他们将如何表现，因为我们一起经历过。</p><p>因此，对我们来说，超越人民和机构，这是旅程第二阶段的开始。我想说的是，所有这些事情是多么容易，也许不那么天真，因为它们并不容易。史蒂夫苏世民写了他的书。它被称为“需要什么”。所以对我们来说，一切都是平等的，这是旅程第二阶段的开始，不再是取笑的部分。</p><p>你有效地进入了真实的东西。</p><p>现在，积极的一面是，整个情况开始为替代市场带来很多光明。私人债务、私人信贷在欧洲闻所未闻，直到银行有效地陷入大规模的流动性紧缩，所有这些资产管理公司不得不介入并填补这一空白。对我们来说是一个很好的机会。当时的私募股权只是关于收购和杠杆收购。很少有人听说过需要加强创业公司资产负债表的增长股权部分，因为它不是，好吧，她并没有试图出售业务，这只是确保你找到合适的合作伙伴来加强资产负债表。等等等等。</p><p>我们开始了一个新的时期，在此之上加入了非常宽松的货币政策，这是私人市场新篇章的开始。我们很幸运能够在这个时候有效地踏上这段旅程。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：让我跟进金融危机之后的时期。显然，它具有很强的破坏性，造成了很多损失，很多人失去了工作，很多企业倒闭了，但听起来似乎在随后的事情中创造了很多机会。</p><p> CHABRAN：对我们来说确实如此。同样，挑战很多，但通过艰苦的工作和能够看到机会的人，并且可能采用欧洲的方法认为，是的，您可以在欧洲发展一个非常多本地足迹的组织，成为全球投资者的替代方案，以我必须承认，对于老牌客户来说，主要是美国人。那是非常令人兴奋的。进入那个领域非常令人兴奋。在某种程度上，我们一直期待着能够面对另一场危机的那一天。</p><p>我们都知道他们都是不同的，但准备得更好。有了更多的资源，有了更强大的平台，有了更大的足迹，有了更好的准备，把 COVID 放在一边，把 Brexit 放在一边，在过去 10 年、12 年里把所有这些小步骤都放在一边，我们一直在为什么时候做好更好的准备周期变化。</p><p>我们可能已经进入这个新周期的新篇章，提高利率，从一年前开始，我们认为它不会很快降低。因此，我们回到我们工作的基础，风险承保、风险评估、资产价格与资产估值不同。</p><p>我的意思是估值是以无风险利率贴现的未来现金流加上风险溢价。你猜怎么着？现在的无风险利率为 5% 不再为零，风险溢价比之前的 2% 更接近 5%。</p><p>所以突然之间，我们工作的全部优点又回到了球场的中心，这让我们的工作更加令人兴奋。</p><p>过去 12 个月以来，我们对今天的投资感到无比兴奋。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：让我们谈谈是什么将 TIKEHAU 带到了美国。显然你们在欧洲非常成功。您现在在全球拥有 13 个办事处。仅仅是美国市场的规模吗？这里的吸引力是什么？</p><p> CHABRAN：嗯，我的意思是，规模绝对是一个原因。但我要补充一点，我们当时刚刚上市，2017 年。对我们来说，上市可能远在近年来变得更加普遍之前，上市障碍的主要目标实际上是推广品牌，专营权。在 60 年代之际，我们从未出售过一股股票。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你们只允许一小部分公开，对吧？</p><p> CHABRAN：是的，没错。我们所有的历史支持者、股东，他们实际上一直在支持我们的业务。我们两次进入 ECM 市场，他们都加强了他们的所有权。因此，与许多 IPO 不同，IPO 是一种通过业务获利的方式，对我们来说，这实际上是关于使平台合理化。正如你所提到的，我们刚刚经历了 13、14 年的创业发展，这段时间非常坎坷。因此，这是一种使平台合理化的好方法，一个品牌，一个名字，让这个名字在那里。</p><p>那是在 2017 年，我们在巴黎泛欧交易所上市。来到美国，除了在某个时候来到美国别无选择。我们认为时机是正确的，因为我们现在和那时都有 200 亿资产管理规模。我们已经在亚洲工作了几年，而且前途无量。所以我决定来这里推广这个品牌，转化为商业关系，为美国投资者筹集更多资金，就你而言，美国是世界上最深的市场之一。</p><p>然后也开始在美国这里部署资本。</p><p>并不是说绝对没有资金短缺，而是正如我们喜欢在 TIKEHAU 所说的那样，创造而不是竞争。所以我们开始了像二级私人信贷这样的倡议。私人债务是这里的主流发展战略，我指的是全球和美国。我认为我们是最早进入二级私人信贷的公司之一。</p><p>快进几年，三年，现在我们可以展示战略的优点，战略的记录。我们开始扩展到中端市场基础设施。那是在拜登大选之前，当我们在欧洲的基础设施领域并不活跃时，所有的注意力都集中在基础设施上。</p><p>因此，我们试图找到一些可以让我们与众不同的游戏，不仅是相对于欧洲和亚洲投资者，而且是在美国，能够向 LP 讲述一个不同的故事，其中一个关键的差异化因素是皮肤我们作为组织的结构和创始人所拥有的游戏。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以很多上市的公司都拥有可用于收购的有价值的货币。这对思考有何影响？</p><p> CHABRAN：是的，没错，自上市以来我们非常有选择地使用了几次。 Infra 是其中之一，另一个是欧洲的房地产。我的意思是，他们是非常有选择性的补强收购。在我们的业务中进行收购总是一个大赌注，对吗？我们从事人事业务，你需要化学反应，我的意思是，你需要文化来解决问题。</p><p>但展望未来，可以肯定的是，与几年前相比，我们今天在反收购方面处于更有利的地位。因此，随着市场和行业的重组，我们肯定会非常机会主义。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这很有趣，Bolt On 的想法与在同一空间内的想法不同。由于化学反应，由于文化问题，金融收购的历史由来已久，但效果并不理想。</p><p>查布兰：没错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：但是你之前说的话真的让我印象深刻。你想创造，而不是竞争。那么，让我们来谈谈你们在 TIKEHAU 的人如何以不同的方式思考，告诉我们，或者用史蒂夫·乔布斯的话说，思考不同，告诉我们你们如何以不同于许多竞争对手的方式对待世界。</p><p>查布兰：是的。你知道当我们开始的时候，正如我告诉过你的那样，非常谦虚，即使你与私人投资者、高净值人士、家族办公室交谈，也有很多特许经营权，他们在接近他们的方式上可以更灵活一点资产配置，他们需要找到一个理由，为什么他们会选择当时的 TIKE-who，而不是 TIKEHAU。</p><p>里索尔兹：（笑声）</p><p> CHABRAN：并找到他们会在那里分配的原因。</p><p>回到欧洲，回到过去，当我们开始进行私人信贷、直接贷款时，今天是非常主流的。我可以告诉你，那时候不是。当时，他们甚至在欧洲称之为影子银行。</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p> CHABRAN：自从我上次阅读影子银行以来已经有一段时间了，因为它在今天变得如此主流和结构化，以至于它确实是一年中的一部分。</p><p>所以我们一直试图有效地成为一点点，我不知道它是怎么出现的，它不是失败者，而是带来一些不同的东西，这样你就可以 -</p><p> RITHOLTZ：清白？</p><p> CHABRAN：是的，这样你就可以为自己出名，然后利用这些相邻的业务来扩大规模，使它们成为主流。我是说我们几年前在纽约推出的二级私人信贷现在正变得更加主流。</p><p>每天我都会看到其中一家大型膨胀支架银行启动或谈论该计划。我们就像，好吧，也许那是我们的好主意。顺便说一句，竞争是好的。竞争没有错，但至少你已经为自己树立了名声。很明显，你有记录，你可以展示它。</p><p>这是第一步。</p><p>第二件事，巴里，如果可以的话，在我们的行业中，最大的不同应该是经理们在他们的业务中投入的游戏皮肤。</p><p>我想说的是，在我们这个行业，你会遇到很多愿意用别人的钱赚钱的人。你会遇到越来越少的人愿意用他们孩子的钱来赚钱。任何企业家都在通过借入一些资金并投资于他的业务来承担风险，无论业务是什么。</p><p>在我们的行业中，有时我认为我们在游戏中展示皮肤的方式有点讽刺，更不用说虚伪了。我不认为附带利益是一种很好的利益一致性。唯一的利益一致是任何给定的经理或公司投入其基金的资本金额。</p><p>当你读到的时候，好吧，好吧，我们把基金的 1% 作为 GP 的承诺，那是十亿，你知道，我们投入了 1000 万，这是很多钱，是的，但你收取 2%未来10年，所以期权成本不会那么高。</p><p>当您将 10%、20% 的资产负债表资本与您的 LP 并排放置时，您可以做一个基本的 Excel 电子表格，您会看到，您知道，什么是利害攸关的，而且那有效地，是的，您将通过管理费和附带权益的业绩费赚一些钱，但你知道，你与客户并肩面临的风险是完全不同的。</p><p>我认为这是该行业应该走向的方向。而我们的许多同行、竞争对手，他们都有不同的模式。但顺便说一句，巴里，来自 GP、合作伙伴、资产负债表和上市的那个在游戏中有重要皮肤的人是我们加强这个股权基础的好方法，这是合作伙伴自己的和控制和管理自己，有效地创造了迄今为止，在欧洲绝对首屈一指的皮肤游戏模式。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我喜欢这听起来的方式。让我们谈谈欧洲。</p><p>如果我们回顾过去几十年，欧洲在 2000 年代的表现优于美国，当时我们正在经历互联网泡沫和金融危机。在 2010 年代，美国市场刚刚火起来，而且表现非常好。 2020 年代的事情开始有点不稳定。您如何比较过去几十年欧洲与美国的投资环境？</p><p> CHABRAN：很明显，它们都是由利率驱动的，它们使你知道方向相同，但模式不同，当我们几年前在欧元危机的背景下首次在欧洲实行负利率时，你知道这是全球金融危机首先是主权国家，但后来你知道，在 IG 市场和投资大市场的权利下，企业基本上借了 100 美元，并被要求偿还 98 美元。</p><p>今天当你回头看，没有回头交易，你会想，好吧，我们当时在想什么？因为对于我们所做的事情，我的意思是，你知道业务，巴里，就像风险承保一样，是关于有效地扩大风险和回报。我们处在一个非常尴尬的环境中。</p><p>这就是为什么我很惊讶看到这么多人感到惊讶。你知道，一年前，也就是 5 月 22 日，利率开始上升，突然间整个软件都被窃听了。</p><p>我的意思是，我们所做的不是火箭科学。这一切都归结为流动性价值和信贷成本。然后我们可以开始，你知道，做我们应该做的事情，你知道，风险承保。因此，欧洲、美国在下降的过程中进入了不同的模式，在上升的过程中则截然不同。</p><p>我的意思是，在美国这里，很明显，你们在加息方面更加积极，在我看来这是正确的。也许欧洲当时有点落后。他们实际上更快地降低利率，甚至降到负利率。</p><p>但是现在正在发生一些脱钩。对我们来说，这是一个很好的方式，特别是在 TIKEHAU，我们非常容易接触到收益游戏、信贷、基础设施、房地产、定制信贷。因此，所有这些都是风险承保的起点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们谈谈 2010 年代和 2020 年代之间的区别，首先，嘿，很有争议的是，当美联储开始在美国加息时，他们已经落后于曲线。他们 2% 的目标已在一年前达到，CPI 继续走高。</p><p>因此，如果美联储落后于曲线，那么欧洲中央银行在处理通胀问题方面落后了多少？</p><p> CHABRAN：美国和欧洲的中央银行可能有不同的授权。一个可能比其他的更具政治性，有时当你必须有效地为所有赤字融资时，你必须注意你需要能够发行和偿还这笔债务。</p><p>我认为，就目前而言，在不涉及太多政治细节的情况下，我的意思是，相对于他们对 COVID 的反应或 10 年前你知道的欧元危机的反应，欧洲可能不是一个好地方。我的意思是欧洲的政治局势可能间接地对欧洲央行产生了一些影响，正如你所知道的那样，我的意思是克里斯蒂娜拉加德在马里奥德拉吉之后一直做得非常出色，但该机构可能应该在你的方式上更大胆一些&#39;重新解决这个通货膨胀问题。</p><p>因为我们都知道，一段非常低的利率会造成巨大的不平等。获得信贷的人与无法获得信贷的人之间的不平等。当我说人时，它是个人的，是公司的，是国家的。具有讽刺意味的是，你拯救了一个系统，但你让这个系统在人们走出这个时期的方式上变得更加不平等。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这真的很有趣。在利率极低的后金融危机时代，任何以信贷、房地产、股票、债券定价的东西都表现非常好。当然，这有助于美国前 10% 的人。在 COVID 期间，我们看到了大规模的财政反应，而不仅仅是货币反应，这似乎对整个经济阶层，尤其是中产阶级都有帮助。那么，我们在金融危机后和 COVID 后的经历如何告诉我们需要在货币和财政刺激之间取得平衡？</p><p>是的，你完全正确。但出于同样的原因，我们知道现在，我不是经济学家，但在美国，在欧洲，通货膨胀，结构性通货膨胀，人们可能对此有不同的看法，肯定会伤害那些有更少的资源。</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> CHABRAN：显然，食品、能源、住房，甚至不谈学校、医疗保健，显然在欧洲，我们在这个问题上的环境完全不同。</p><p>所以这是一个棘手的情况，我认为资产经理可以发挥作用的地方是确保无论何时有人存钱或投资 10 亿美元，无论是私人投资者还是大型机构投资者，是否有合适的与正在实施的战略相关的风险回报。</p><p>在零利率环境下，这非常复杂，因为每个人都掷骰子，结果是双六，因为只有在有钱的时候你才能做对。</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> CHABRAN：因为当钱是免费的时候，投资就没有价值。既然我们处于金钱具有一定价值的情况下，那么你就可以有所区别了，这应该再次使个人节省一美元或仅投资十亿美元的机构受益。</p><p>而且，在这方面，无论这种宏观形势如何，如果我回到我们作为资产管理者的角色，那就是我们可以发挥作用的地方。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们谈谈与风险和回报相关的估值。可以说，今天的美国，无论是公开市场还是私人市场，都不便宜。它们在互联网上并不昂贵，但肯定不便宜。欧洲和世界其他地区在估值基础上与美国相比如何？</p><p> CHABRAN：也许因为我来自杠杆金融背景，就像我告诉过你的那样，我倾向于总是关注不利因素。但我也在此过程中了解到，作为一家公司，你很少死于损益或资产，但你总是死于负债。</p><p>而且我认为，实际上这种非常便宜的资金过剩，这种杠杆过剩，这种认为你可以无限期地无限期获得廉价到免费资本的过度想法可能在某些地方造成了一些错误的资产配置模式.</p><p>所以我认为我们现在已经进入了一个时期，我们必须吞下所有定价错误、过度杠杆化的资产。公司信贷是其中之一，显然是债券，我指的是主权债券市场，我们记得 SVB 的故事，它是关于国库券的。</p><p>然后你，显然是房地产，许多领域以错误的成本过度杠杆化。这可能是痛苦的，因为必须有人承受痛苦，即使与 2008 年不同，风险集中在银行的资产负债表上，如今风险更多地分散在资产管理公司身上。但你必须找到一种方法来耗尽所有这些过剩的流动性，一方面这是必要的，但另一方面可能定价错误。</p><p>所以今天，我认为 IG 固定利率公司债券市场的一部分，显然是房地产的一部分，我们一直在详细讨论这一点，我们必须以某种方式承受一些痛苦或损失，或者形式。</p><p>一如既往，在这种交易的另一边，这将为那些流动性强、灵活的人创造巨大的机会，他们不必携带陈旧的库存，如果我可以说的话。</p><p>我的印象是，美国的做法会更加现实，即承受压力、承受痛苦并重新开始。在欧洲，也许有一点预转和延长游戏，但总比最终必须完成的事情立即完成要好。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：撕掉创可贴，别等了。</p><p> CHABRAN：没错，这就是我们在金融风险和金融定价方面应该做的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你提到过剩的流动性正在导致过度和混乱。美联储利率和世界其他地区的利率更高，利率更高，将其中的一些从系统中移除，并且结合起来，已经倒闭的区域银行的影响是什么，其中一些，但它肯定已经对上帝的恐惧进入了很多，你们这些小银行商店，这对那里所有的过剩流动性有什么影响？</p><p> CHABRAN：你知道，关于区域性银行，我不想发表评论，我不是专家，令人惊讶的是大型、非常大型的机构会如此迅速地陷入流动性压力。再次回到我的评论，这是你的责任方。那里有很多评论。</p><p>我看到的是，对于资产管理者来说，这是一个非常有趣的结构性机会，因为它在市场方面创造了一些空白，我们可以通过某种方式、形状或形式来填补。所以我认为从积极的方面来说，投资者、分配者。</p><p>如今，他们可以有效地将资本分配到战略中，从而对其投资组合产生复合效应。因为我不知道，两年前在某些策略中是 3、4%，现在可以是 8 到 10。</p><p>因此，当你开始将你的新配置复合到这些类型的策略中时，这可以弥补你的投资组合中由于利率上升而本身可能有点低的部分。再次，信贷，房地产，你有什么。所以这是积极的。你必须能够做到这一点，对吗？那么你是怎么做到的呢？我的意思是，如果你实际上有人们一直在谈论的分母效应，或者更多的流动性限制，因为现金没有像你预期的那样迅速返回，因为你的经理不能出售他们的投资组合。</p><p>例如，二级市场在私募股权方面一直在疯狂发展。正如我所说，私人信贷是另一回事。考虑到那里的资金量，房地产将是一个显而易见的问题。</p><p>所以这是准备说，好吧，我已经在这个策略上赚了百分之五、六、七，也许我会退出这个策略，尽管打折，尽可能低，但收益将能够是再投资于将产生更高回报的策略，在中短期内可以弥补我对我的养老金领取者或你有什么的现金流需求。</p><p>所以我实际上非常乐观，所有资产所有者、资产配置者都可以变得灵活。这是一个非常激动人心的时刻。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：让我们谈谈 TIKEHAU 拥护者如何影响投资。显然，目标是实现某种可持续发展的未来。你的投资主题是什么？</p><p>查布兰：是的。我认为我们在已经成为非常主流的战略方面相对较早，你知道，这是正确的，这确实是许多因素的结合。我们在 2017-2018 年推出了我们的第一个增长型私募股权战略，正如我所说，远早于它成为许多经理人和许多配置者的必备战略。</p><p>我们开始这样做是因为在欧洲，我们一直在与企业家、家族一起投资，正如我所说，我们不是一家收购商店，我们不控制，我们不杠杆化公司，我们正努力，作为资产所有者和公司之间的中间人，在我们看到金融游戏的地方进行分配，但这是一个有影响力的金融游戏。因此，当我们在 1718 年开始实施这一战略，并开始分配资本，投资于有解决方案的企业家时，必须大规模实施。因为当你想在减少二氧化碳排放的气候方面实现这些目标时，投资于到 2050 年将发生变化的东西是很好的，但更重要的是找到今天有效的东西并将其大规模化。</p><p>放大。我们正在投资盈利为 2000 万、2500 万、5000 万的 EBITDA 和所需资金的中型市场公司。这些人不打算出售他们的公司，他们需要资金来扩大规模。我们开始在低碳交通、建筑物的能源效率方面这样做。如您所知，它占绿色气体排放量的 40%。所以我们开始这样做，我自然会说，五年后，我们现在可以有效地代表案例研究。显然，业绩记录很重要，但当我们谈论这种影响力投资时，人们想了解我们在谈论什么。</p><p>这是关于气候的。</p><p>然后我们启动了再生农业战略，因为关键目标之一是如何捕获碳，而没有什么比土壤和地面更能帮助做到这一点了。那是在股权方面。</p><p>然后我们开始进行一些私人信贷影响融资。这意味着什么？你是借款人，我们以 5% 的利率借给你一些钱，你是 EBITDA 的三倍，我们采用财务分析的所有传统信用指标，然后我们添加第三个维度。如果你达到了某些目标、某些目标、额外的财务目标，那么你将提高你的资金成本。如果你有效地证明你减少了 X 或 Y 或者改变了这个生产过程，你的 5% 的优惠券将下降到 4。</p><p>突然间，您意识到，如果您的资金成本下降，那么由于实现了一些额外的财务目标，您的股本回报率就会上升。</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> CHABRAN：所以你可以证明这不是慈善事业。这是关于确保我们使用可用资金将其发送到有意义的地方，然后所有利益相关者都能从中受益。就在五年前，很高兴再次创造而不是竞争，我们正在努力推动这一点。</p><p>今天，这是没有商量余地的。与我们的 LP 没有商量余地。与我们的客户、我们的合作伙伴、我们的银行、我们的客户、我们的员工巴里没有商量余地。我的意思是，当我们与一些 20 多岁、30 多岁的同事、专业人士交谈时，这是他们对公司承诺的一部分。</p><p>因为你知道的一个大问题，当涉及到这种影响和 ESG 时，让我们从更广泛的意义上说，充其量你会遇到非常机会主义，最坏的情况你会遇到假的。在这两种情况下，都不好。</p><p>因此，我们、我们的同事、我们的员工、员工和所有利益相关者，我的意思是，他们是监护人，他们是我们在这里真实存在的管家。再说一次，现在它不再是可有可无，而是必须拥有，而且只有一种方法。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以 ESG 似乎在欧洲找到了很多支持。您对这在美国如何变得政治化感到有点惊讶吗？他们似乎是一群反对影响力投资和可持续投资的人，不是因为回报，而是他们不喜欢其中的政治色彩。</p><p>查布兰：是的。我并不感到惊讶，因为我再次成为这里的外星人，但我试图成为美国政治动态的观察者。我们甚至亲身经历过。我们的一些 LP 通常由不同的董事会组成，有些是教师、消防员、警察，还有雇员、公务员雇员。当我们与同一个交易对手打交道时，同一个养老基金，他们的一些选民，一些基础董事会，不同意采取的方法。</p><p>所以我们亲身经历过，在一个给定的投资者或资产所有者内部，可能存在一些分歧。现在我经常可以说，因为对我们正在尝试做的事情和其他人正在尝试做的事情存在一些误解。</p><p>所以我希望通过一些教育和基于科学的方法，人们会意识到这不应该是一场政治游戏。我明白为什么。我并不天真。我明白为什么。但我认为大多数人应该明白，今天的资产所有者，可以帮助他们部署资本的资产管理者，肩负着历史使命，因为我们将在 50 年后接受审判。</p><p>我的意思是，人们回过头来看会说，您当时如何利用可用的资金有效地将这笔资金用于重要的地方？所以我试图采用这种观点，因为实际上我们从来没有处于一个可以有目的地使用如此多廉价流动性的环境中。</p><p>所以你谈到了 ESG 棘轮，如果人们达到某些指标，他们会获得更好的利率。你谈到了农业，再生农业。向我们这些不熟悉的人解释一下，什么是再生农业？重点是什么？你想用它完成什么？它只是碳捕获还是更多？</p><p> CHABRAN：这是整个链条。我的意思是，这是不言而喻的事实，土壤是一种稀缺资源，需要以一种能够继续生产的方式进行维护，这样对于下一代来说，你不会回头看，你会留下一片棕色满是肥料或其他肥料的土壤，在你必须养活更多人的时候，无法为后代生产同样质量的产品。</p><p>所以这里的技术，与我们五年前采用的气候方法非常相似，实际上是关于寻找企业家和公司，他们有土壤解决方案，比方说，有效的肥力或某种技术。你知道，这并不是真正的农业技术，正如你可能习惯的那样，但有些技术已经得到证实，需要这笔资金才能扩大规模，否则这笔资金将无法获得，因为这与购买土地、英亩或森林无关.这与有效吸引大量资本的农业技术无关。</p><p>但是这些企业家，这些具有成熟概念和盈利能力的小型企业，他们需要这笔资金来扩大规模。所以你会投资 20%、30%，占公司 23% 的股份，投资这些资本以有效地帮助扩大业务规模，然后你可以获得更多的银行融资，资本市场，这不是那么开放。</p><p>所以这是整个乐队，所以在欧洲肯定是这种情况，我们在美国越来越多地看到这个小型中型股市场没有，更不用说，回到你对区域性银行，金融市场结构的一部分正在消失，因此您需要替代资金来源，这就是我们可以成为非常相关工具的地方。</p><p>那是给公司的，投资者也想在那里配置。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你在这方面与一些非常有趣的公司合作，大型保险公司 AXA 和消费品公司联合利华，他们对这种可持续投资有何兴趣？</p><p> CHABRAN：顺便说一句，在 TIKEHAU，我们一直与企业合作，或者我们尽可能多地尝试与企业合作，以带来额外的技能组合。我们在能源转型中做到了这一点，例如，在 17 年和 18 年很早的时候就使用 Total Energies。我们在航空航天领域做到了这一点，与一群著名的欧洲和全球参与者合作，如空中客车、达索、赛峰、泰雷兹，显然带来了一些资本，但更重要的是一些技能、一些知识和一些影响力，所以回到我的创造不竞争，我们可以与投资者讲述不同的故事。</p><p>正如你刚才提到的，与联合利华的最后一个，是相同的，完全相同的方法，它带来了额外的专业知识和资产经理，我们，金融投资者，而且正如我们所说，那里并不缺乏资本.</p><p>在那种情况下，欧洲最大的保险公司之一，如果不是全球性的，并且有一个不同的提案，完全一致，对交易流程有一些补充采购。再次在这里，一开始，人们可能会像这样看着我们，为什么你需要带一个公司？这里是否涉及利益冲突？然后，几年后，他们就像，好吧，这是一个非常不同的提议，我们可能从年长的经理那里听到过，而且那里有很多。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：如果您引入消费品并尝试以更高效、可持续的方式制作食物，那么利益冲突是什么？</p><p> CHABRAN：这就是我的观点，他们应该为人所知，他们也为人所知，但你知道，你知道人们有时有点不情愿或抗拒改变……</p><p> RITHOLTZ：现状，它真的很强大，不是吗？</p><p>查布兰：瞧。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我喜欢你的这句话我不得不问你这个问题。欢乐时光越长，宿醉就越难熬。</p><p>解释。非常法国。</p><p> CHABRAN：那是你知道的，我认为那是 5 月 22 日在米尔肯研究所，那是利率开始上升的时候，我想我早些时候告诉过你，我很惊讶地看到很多人感到惊讶，因为实际上，酒吧已经开放了很长时间，流动性非常便宜，如果我可以说的话。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：回到金融危机，接下来的整个时期都是免费的。</p><p> CHABRAN：没错，那是 10 年，如果不是更多的话。我认为，我们中的一些人实际上已经忘记了流动性应该有价格，信贷也有一定价值。如此有效，我发表的评论是，是的，由于这种自由流动性，人们可能会对他们可能购买、投资的这种定价错误、过度杠杆化的资产产生宿醉。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以让我们来谈谈，或许，一种依赖于自由流动性的错误定价的资产类别，正如我们正在记录的那样，华尔街日报最近的头条新闻是“公司内部人士在 SPAC 破产前赚了数百万美元。”您对特殊目的投资工具 SPAC 有何看法？你怎么看那些？</p><p> CHABRAN：所以我们在两年前进入 SPAC，希望不要随波逐流，但因为我们看到了一种非常有用的技术，可以帮助我们的一些私营公司，这就是我们所做的，我们所做的大部分工作是投资与私营企业家一起，在经验丰富的经理人、运营伙伴的支持下，在经验丰富的金融机构的支持下进入公开市场。</p><p>实际上，我们非常成功地“取消了”一些。我们在阿姆斯特丹泛欧交易所上市，这是一家电视内容制作行业的伟大公司，营业额 30 亿，EBITDA 6 亿。它叫做 FL Entertainment，伟大的企业家 Stéphane Courbit。这是一家真正的公司。我猜我们的 SPAC 交易价格在 10 美元左右。一个真正的公司。因此，问题不在于 SPAC 作为一项技术。问题在于，在向 SPAC 的发起人和经理提供一些资金之前，试图以机会主义和正确的方式进入这个市场的公司类型。</p><p>请记住，利率是负的。</p><p>因此，SPAC 被一些投资者用作保险库。这是一些现金。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：获得 5%。</p><p>查布兰：没错。我会弥补利息不足，我可以选择退出。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以这是有保证的高收益，我不会说高收益，而是高收益债券，最后有股权选择权，如果你喜欢股权公司，你可以留下来。 Saba Capital 就是其中之一，其他几家也在做同样的事情。</p><p> CHABRAN：技术本身就是现金过剩，利率为零，我得到负现金，我的现金账户上的利息为负，所以这是现金，我可能会选择退出。</p><p>我们在所做的事情和一些工作中尝试做的事情，虽然我们决定归还资本，因为在游戏方法中回到我的皮肤，我们决定在上个月归还资本，我们有 1.5 亿多我们自己的资本投入其中。</p><p>因此，与其追逐便宜的期权，希望通过期权获得回报，我们首先要耗尽我们的资本。机会不存在。我们不会为了它而部署我们的资本。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这又回到了游戏中的皮肤。当你是有限合伙人的共同投资者时，你不会做出愚蠢的决定，因为，嘿，我们有现金。我们不妨花掉它。</p><p>查布兰：我想是的。所以这只是我认为一些投资者滥用了一种有趣的技术，以及错误的公司滥用了有趣的技术。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我最近读了一篇文章，一篇研究文章说，英国退欧可能使英国的 GDP 总额减少了 5%。你在伦敦工作，现在在纽约，最初来自巴黎。这听起来现实吗？英国脱欧对英国有何影响？谁填补了英国脱欧造成的空白？</p><p>所以首先，这是英国人民做出的决定，我不会评论除此之外的理由。我读了你提到的同样的研究，每天我都会和一些欧洲的朋友、企业家交谈，告诉我将货物和东西运到英国并与英国进行贸易是多么具有挑战性。</p><p>我可以评论的一个部分是围绕伦敦金融城未来作为卓越金融中心的整个辩论，全球但显然是欧洲的。</p><p>我可以告诉你的是，巴里，自从世界重新开放，你又可以旅行了，实际上我现在回伦敦的次数比回巴黎的次数要多，巴黎是我公司的总部。为什么？因为伦敦仍然是金融服务的重要商业中心。</p><p>在您必须进行交易的方式以及为什么人们和银行必须在非洲大陆开设或出口一些分支机构方面，存在一些与某些监管相关的挑战。我明白为什么和技术细节。但说到伦敦的国际化性质，吸引全球人才，而且，我是法国人，巴黎在吸引人才和公司方面做得非常出色，但规模如此之大，我不敢打赌反对伦敦作为金融中心。所以我们必须应对技术方面、监管、如果你没有规模的话，对一些人来说，做生意的成本已经变得非常惩罚性。</p><p>这就是为什么如果我在方法上有点自私的话，我们在非洲大陆已经准备好了。我们现在更积极地回到伦敦，因为当很多人都在做相反的事情时，我们的曝光度降低了。</p><p>人们正试图减少对英国的投资分配，减少他们在英国的劳动力。所以我们试图有点逆势并利用这一点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以人们在一个方向上反应过度，创造了机会。</p><p>查布兰：也许吧。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：欧洲正在应对其东部边界的一场战争。就能源供应以及欧洲与俄罗斯的整个关系而言，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰做了什么？</p><p> CHABRAN：好吧，这是一个复杂的，非常可悲的，因为，巴里，我可以告诉你，坐在美国这里，当我和那边的朋友、家人交谈时，我对战争的看法非常不同从一侧到另一侧，因为它距离许多西欧首都有两个小时的现实和感知，与人口的感觉非常不同。</p><p>所以话虽如此，请记住一年前战争开始时，显然对能源、独立性和可持续性的关注是首要和中心的。我认为，这是形势的一线希望，可以放更多的光并专注于加速过渡的一部分，这本身就是一个令人鼓舞的步骤。</p><p>回顾一年或 18 个月后的这种情况，在能源方面“没有那么糟糕”，这是个好消息。但整个情况，我认为我们在相对较长的一段时间内不幸陷入困境，因为在该地区及其他地区造成了很多不确定性，但出于同样的原因，也产生了很多加快行动的政治意愿。如果你还记得，欧洲政府在战后做出的回应，他们在几周内取得的进展比我们几年来取得的进展还要多。因此，有时当关键时刻受到威胁时，人们才能做出建设性的反应。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：因此，除了入侵的所有人道主义悲剧之外，人们担心的是油价会飙升，最终会导致欧洲经济衰退。但很多欧洲国家似乎都避免了这一点。</p><p>您对大欧洲陷入衰退有何看法？由于成本增加和应对战争，欧洲部分地区的发展速度明显放缓。你觉得欧洲的环境怎么样？</p><p>因此，与我们在美国这里所经历的以及产能的重新进入没有什么不同，我们在欧洲的许多国家都看到了这一点。再工业化可能是近来最受政治家欢迎的话题，这不仅是因为你需要表现出对外部市场的更少依赖。整个去全球化主题，我认为整个情况正在加速。</p><p>因此，对于政客来说，这是向民众指明方向的一种方式。这是一种新范例，一种新软件。回到我们的谋生工作，资产经理，这是一个很好的框架，可以找到分配、重新分配、与全球投资者合作的方法，以在某些国家、某些行业吸引更多资本。这不是一夜之间发生的，但你可以让它很快发生，很快就是几个月的事情。</p><p>如果你让所有这些明星从政治方向到人口粘附，然后是资本分配。我满怀希望并且乐观地认为，这可能是整个局势的一线希望，尽管局势可能很戏剧化。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你在亚洲设有办事处，如果我们在某种程度上去全球化，而中国一直是世界大部分地区的主要工业驱动力，这对投资亚洲总体而言意味着什么，更具体地说是中国？</p><p> CHABRAN：所以我们在亚洲一直在做的事情，首先是在新加坡，我们八九年前在新加坡开始，然后是韩国和日本。事实上，我们在中国没有任何存在。我们在当地与这些投资者进行的对话实际上是为了吸引他们参与我们在欧洲或美国的一些现有战略。</p><p>亚洲是，我有机会不时回到那里，每次我在那里，我都发现当地经济已经发生了变化。如果你看看新加坡，当我们第一次搬到那里时，八年后，它是一个全球中心。就像一个全球枢纽，您每天都在阅读所有的后果。彭博新闻、房地产价格以及从香港、中东部分地区迁往那里开设的家族办公室的数量，其原因与您创建了一个非常适合商业的人才中心的原因相同环境。你拥有世界上最成熟的主权财富基金。我们很幸运，早在 2016 年就有淡马锡支持我们。从那以后，他们一直是我们的好合作伙伴。伟大的市场。</p><p>我们今天看待新加坡业务的方式，我们有一个总部，巴黎，我们有三个全球中心，纽约、伦敦和新加坡。在这些中心之外，你可以在全球范围内接触到第一批投资者，并在我们认为有有趣的投资建议的地方有效地吸引他们，并在出现这种供需失衡时创造投资机会。</p><p>同样，这一切都归结为供需关系以及我们如何才能最好地利用它。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的很有趣。那么让我们跳到我们问所有客人的我们最喜欢的问题，从这些天你在直播什么开始？播客、Netflix 或其他什么让您了解最新情况并从中获得乐趣？</p><p> CHABRAN：我喜欢并推荐的一部影片是“Peaky Blinders”，因为它是由我们支持的这家公司制作的，我们在几个月前帮助上市。不仅因为我喜欢这个关于反派和歹徒的整个故事，更重要的是因为内容很棒。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是 Netflix 还是亚马逊？</p><p> CHABRAN：这是 Netflix 的。这是一个 Netflix 的。我强烈推荐并由我们在 FL Entertainment 的朋友制作。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的很有趣。那么谁是你的导师？谁帮助塑造了你的职业生涯？</p><p> CHABRAN：当我还是一名年轻的分析师和助理时，他们中很少有人是我工作过的资深人士，因为他们中的每个人都以自己不同的方式帮助我挑战了这样一个事实，即我们在相对年轻的时候就靠自己了商业。他们中的一些人告诉我们，“好吧，无论出于好事还是坏事，现在要么太晚要么太早。”相反，人们说，欧洲的情况比美国的情况要少，永远没有好时机，你应该试一试。</p><p>他们中的很多人都是金融专业人士，大部分时间都在投资银行工作，现在仍然是朋友。顺便说一下，他们中的一些人在 TIKEHAU 的路上加入了我们。当你创办自己的风险投资公司时，这显然是非常有价值的一件事。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你最喜欢的书有哪些？你正在阅读什么？</p><p> CHABRAN：所以我开始写两本书，非常不同。第一个，我很幸运再次参加了 Mike Milken 的活动，你知道，最近在洛杉矶和后来，正如你所知，他非常关注医疗保健。整个重点都放在他的研究所和周围的所有慈善事业上。</p><p>这本书被迈克·米尔肯称为“更快的治疗，加速健康的未来”。这是一件很有趣的事情，因为在我们的日常工作中，它确实是短期的。当你退后一步，看看这些人口问题时，我们会触及其中一些问题、能源和所有这些问题，但人口可能是最具挑战性的问题。</p><p>即使是 50、75 年后，我认为我们也应该在今天的决定中开始考虑其中的许多因素。</p><p>在最近的另一本书中，我有幸在波士顿遇到一位法国教授，他是 HBS 和 HKS 的老师。她在那里已经20年了。她的名字叫朱莉·巴蒂拉娜。最后一本书叫做“人人享有权力”，它是关于与——我什至不会说权力的关系，但如果有效的权力是关于影响他人改变行为，那么它不仅是自上而下的，而且我们可能学习它的方式，以及我们应该如何与新一代，在新的周期中，以及对我来说至关重要的事物的观点，即民主，还有资本主义，这是其中的许多助推器。</p><p>你如何调和这一切，这是一本值得一读的书。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：听起来很有趣。我们的最后两个问题，您会给对私募股权或投资事业感兴趣的应届大学毕业生提供什么样的建议？</p><p> CHABRAN：好吧，我会给他发一些您在 TIKEHAU Capital 每天都能看到的格言。保持好奇，跳出框框思考，有条不紊，大胆思考。我会与他们分享这一点，因为这是不会改变的一件事。技术可能会改变，但人际交往能力和渴望，我认为这才是最重要的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：很有趣，也是我们的最后一个问题。您对当今的投资世界了解多少？您希望在大约 25 年前刚开始时就知道。</p><p> CHABRAN：永远不要认为任何事情都是理所当然的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：非常感谢你如此慷慨地抽出时间，Mathieu。我们一直在与 TIKEHAU Capital 的联合创始人 Mathieu Chabran 交谈。</p><p>如果您喜欢这次谈话，那么请务必查看我们在过去八年左右的时间里进行的其他 500 次左右的讨论。您可以在 iTunes、Spotify、YouTube 上找到它们，只要您能找到您最喜欢的播客。</p><p>在 ritholtz.com 上注册我的每日阅读清单。在推特上关注我@ritholtz。在 Twitter @podcast

id="more-314436"></span></p><p></p><p>我们有一个了不起的小组来讨论在当前环境下推出对冲基金的感觉以及成为新兴经理人需要了解的一些事情。让我从左到右介绍面板。</p><p>迈克·洛克菲勒 (Mike Rockefeller) 是价值 60 亿美元的多头空头股票基金 Woodline Capital 的联合创始人。此前，他是 Citadel 的成功下午； Woodline 于 2019 年推出。是对的吗？有二十亿美元。</p><p>伊拉娜·温斯坦 (Ilana Weinstein) 是 IDW 集团的创始人。它是对冲基金领域的顶级猎头公司之一。她刚刚在公司庆祝了她的 20 周年纪念日。如果你读到被聘用的基金之间的重大变动，他们经常跳槽，Iaw 就是幕后的推动者和摇动者。</p><p> Tom Wagner 是 100 亿美元信贷和事件驱动基金的联合创始人。骑士头资本最近。他获得了英国伯明翰足球联赛和体育场，并有兴趣与汤姆布拉迪一起组建 Pickle Ball 球队。我误读了阵容，所以我要说。</p><p> Brennan Diaz 是市值 10 亿美元的 FirmBridge Capital Firm 的创始人。他来自以前的公司，Viking 他在 2020 年底推出了 Firm Bridge。好，好时机。采用对冲基金的方法进行多头投资。我们有大约 50 分钟的时间。如果最后有时间，我们会看看听众是否有任何问题。但是，让我们从谈论当前环境开始吧。</p><p>从大流行到新的加息制度，这几年是疯狂的。构想当今环境中正在发生的事情，以及在这种情况下管理基金是什么感觉？</p><p>那么让我们从你开始吧，迈克。</p><p>当然。因此，我认为一个主题是，分配者对他们收到的回报质量和他们愿意支付的回报越来越敏感。他们想要的是不相关的 alpha，你采用了这个概念，但是你看看传统的多头、空头对冲基金，他们运行的 Indio 投资组合不到 30%，这意味着这些回报高度依赖于宏观因素，<br />您将受到非常不可预测的因素。<br />我认为越来越多的人认为，投资组合的高区域可以预测不相关的 alpha 流。<br />这就是为什么你看到多经理资产大幅增加的原因<br />这些资产自 2017 年以来翻了一番以上。如果您查看 2023 年推出的一些顶级产品，ILX 和<br />免费的石头。这种趋势看起来还在继续。原因是多经理为客户提供一站式服务<br />分配器，您可以获得高无线电、低音量持久返回流和<br />你可以在一次投资中做到这一点，在那里你可以扩大规模并消除复杂性，从中内置的多样化<br />开始吧。这是正确的。很多让我们谈谈当前的环境。你从人才的角度来看。<br />告诉我们告诉我们你看到了什么。我要缩小范围，因为如果你们都想创办一家对冲基金，我认为我们需要从高层开始<br />我要给你宏，然后我们就快点走。逐个策略。巴里，你和我谈过这个<br />最近。对我来说，至少几个月前英国《金融时报》发表了一篇令人惊叹的文章，其中说这是新闻<br />我。我知道有很多对冲基金，但显然对冲基金比汉堡王多。<br />好的。没错，三万对冲基金。<br />您应该记住的另一件事是对冲的平均寿命<br />基金三年。所以，如果你们想成立一个基金，并且不希望它只是另一个倒闭的汉堡王，<br />您需要了解每种策略中的情况。迈克谈了一点关于长，<br />做空股票。不是像死神那样，而是<br />现实情况是，如果你不是一个多头经理并且你没有积极进取<br />管理市场风险，那么你就属于做多、做空的范畴<br />可能承担集中的、更集中的定向风险的单一经理人。如果你看看这些基金如何<br />在过去的整整两年中，二十一和二十二年的平均表现<br />这些基金的累计回报下降了 40%。好吧，有些基金跌幅高达 60%。<br />比如老虎环球。因此，如果您考虑损失给 LP 的美元，理解这一点很重要，因为 40% 的对冲<br />基金宇宙做多，做空股票。所以我敢打赌，你们中有相当一部分人正在考虑开始做多、做空股票<br />基金。有大量的，嗯，丢失了。所以 Tiger Global 2021 年之前是 10000<br />十亿。特立独行140亿。 1300亿。然后非老虎幼崽喜欢藻类 30<br />十亿。感知100亿。当你平均下降 40% 时，这对行业来说是一个巨大的损失。<br /> 2022 年，超过 50% 的总亏损来自股票多头空头<br />基金和对冲基金清算的一半来自多头空头股票基金。所以你真的需要考虑一下，如果你<br />不要像 Mike 那样属于全 alpha 非相关类别。<br />你提供的价值是什么？宏非常不稳定的返回流。<br />对大多数宏观基金来说，2021 年是糟糕的一年。二二十二年伟大的一年。又是二十三。<br />不是那么好的一年。你又看到 Roe Coast、Castle、Hook Element Element 等品牌基金收取 40% 的费用，能够上涨<br />到 2020 年，收缩并试图阻止信贷负回报造成的损失。一个亮点，但我想我确定汤姆<br />将更多地讨论这个。你真的需要规模才能竞争。然后是多个经理，这将是你最大的问题，因为<br />一个新出现的经理。您将如何在从分析师到 PM 都可以提供一切的范例中竞争人才。<br />他们有规模，有资本，有资源。他们有成为 APM 的途径。他们有积极的回报。<br />他们有经济学。他们就像，就像我的脚趾姐姐。<br />你知道，我们曾经有过小虎崽。现在我们有了多经理幼崽。迈克就是其中之一。<br />他说我喜欢。我希望没事。我同意这种观点。他现在提供战略<br />对多管理人基金的投资。我喜欢 Sit It Out 的两个人<br />Mike 和他的团队投入了资金，他们将推出 20 亿 Brad Stone Grove 和其他 Citadel 人将推出许多<br />数十亿。从 GE Shore 出来的安德鲁·小森 (Andrew Komori) 正以 30 亿美元启动。所以投入战斗。<br />这就是你要进入的环境。而我作为一直在招聘的人<br />在过去的 20 年里，我和我的团队在这个行业工作，我们正在与世界上最大、最成功的基金合作，这很艰难。<br />人才稀缺。他们有很多选择。<br />而且我认为多经理动态只会让它变得更加激烈。所以。所以让我看看布伦丹要说什么<br />对这个。你是小组中唯一孤独的人。做长有那么难吗？<br />只有你如何从你的投资中找到这个环境<br />风格？好吧，我的意思是，我认为迈克向她提出的所有观点都是正确的。我认为整个理由<br />仅从多头、空头背景出发的背后是意识到市场结构正在发生变化。<br />获得短期 alpha 和短期 alpha 曲线的能力正在发生变化，因此以相同的投资风格维持短期总敞口的能力正在发生变化<br />并产生那个水平的 alpha 并没有那么多。所以我有点感觉到投资组合的空头压力<br />空头净值更高，这是绝对回报产品的两个糟糕选择，但与分类账一起看<br />仍然非常强烈地感觉到我们正在访问的 alpha 池，他们看起来基本上是 18 到 18 到 36 个月。<br />所以不是着眼于 5 到 10 年，而是 18 到 36 个月。期待基础业务将获得什么收益和<br />考虑绝对值。内在价值，并在真正有吸引力的机会上集中押注。<br />但是那个窗口不仅像以往一样有吸引力，而且在某些方面它变得更有吸引力。某种程度上是由潜在的空头驱动的<br />市场的长期波动。因此，从长远来看，我不认为只管理是更难管理的。<br />我认为这实际上是物质上的。李智惠比较轻松。这就是我们走那条路的原因。<br />我也认为有物质需求。我认为 Mike 的观点是 100% 正确的。分配者想要为价值买单。正确的。<br />你知道，从历史上看，投资者投资对冲基金并不是为了支付贝塔费用。他们一直愿意支付费用<br />beta 因为潜在的假设是你会向他们提供足够的 alpha 来支付 beta 成本。然而，有大量的<br />世界上想要数据曝光的资本，非常非常大的资本池，总是会有糟糕的曝光。<br />因此，我认为向人们传达的信息是，我将承担赌注风险，我个人希望自己的资本能够获得这一点风险。<br />随着时间的推移，我想要 beta，因为收集风险溢价的 beta 应该是正的。你只在我产生时付钱给我<br />对你有价值。价值被定义为相对于标准普尔指数的超额回报。我认为这与<br />有很多资本提供者。我认为这对像我这样投资的人来说是一个机会，他们认为<br />如果他们愿意，就像我一样出去并继续执行。<br />但是，您知道，您必须拥有正确的模型。你必须有一个真正一致的费用结构，你必须有点<br />愿意走那条路。所以你知道，我认为它在很多方面都是一样的。它正在响应同样的趋势<br />迈克正在谈论并朝着不同的方向发展。所以澄清一下，有些人所谓的活动费用，即利润<br />参与仅在 SPF 通常的回报之上。<br />所以我想说，这实际上更有优势，而且我们的管理费经常是未来的预付款。所以我们必须在我们之前生成Alpha<br />获得任何类型的奖励。正确的。所以这个想法是随着时间的推移<br />基金，这将是一个很长的生命。当你当我们当我们结束时，<br />我们会回头看看。已经产生的 alpha 经济效益的 70% 将流向投资者，30% 将流向投资者<br />计入经理。我们努力使它尽可能干净和透明。这给我们带来了更大的波动<br />在我们相对于其他模型的整体激励费用收入中。但我认为从人才的角度来看这是非常容易解决的<br />谈谈那个。但这是基础模型。十分有趣。汤姆，你如何看待这股潮流<br />环境以及您如何在内部找到信用世界<br />耳机领域？好吧，首先，我要感谢 Barry 让我来到这里并感谢大家参加。<br />欣赏它。你知道，信贷与我们今天看到的和我们投资的所有其他资产类别有关。<br />我们有 100 亿中的一个，其中 6 个是永久资本。所以我们做的不仅仅是信贷。我们基本上可以在任何地方做任何事情<br />世界。我们今天需要信贷，尤其是私人结构性信贷。所以救助融资，过桥贷款，<br />融资是提供增长资本，所有结构都像信贷提供的<br />相对于我在 25 年中见过的风险而言，阿尔法值最大<br />一直在做这个这是非凡的超额回报。那是因为它不是液体。<br />我认为你们所有人或在座的那些正在考虑启动对冲基金的人的一件事是，目前存在极端的推拉效应<br />对于流动性，明显的回报。投资者或分配者没有流动性<br />他们需要产生回报，尤其是在利率更高的情况下，他们的门槛都提高了，而且他们陷入了更老的困境<br />投资，尤其是私募股权。他们可能需要一段时间才能恢复到他们过去产生的阿尔法生成回报。<br />所以他们希望你流动并产生回报。这在今天是不可能的。所以你必须找到适合的利基市场<br />你。我认为我能给那些考虑发布的人最好的建议就是忘记所有的噪音，忘记什么<br />市场想要。忘记 LP ISE 想要什么。做你会擅长的事情。你的策略是什么并不重要。<br />不管你的结构是什么。不管你的费用是多少。如果你相对于发布的任何基准都很好，你就会<br />做得很好。您的业​​务将会增长。你会赚很多钱。你会快乐地退休，你的孩子。<br />如果他们不想，您永远不必工作。你会做的很好。但如果你试图硬塞进<br />不合适的东西，它会变得非常错误。我认为我能给你的第二个最有价值的建议是<br />与您听到的所有这些价值数十亿美元的发射的所有例子不同。这不正常，对吧？<br />这不正常。你可能认为你将以 10 亿美元启动。很多帮助我们开始。我们认为我们将在 2008 年 3 月 16 日推出十亿五。<br />我们刚从新兴经理人会议上走出来，人是完美的。我当时想，这太容易了。<br />然后八周，我们筹集了 15 亿。我们将以 30 亿美元启动，Ken Griffin 支持我们。<br />这就像有史以来最伟大的事情。第二天，贝尔斯登破产了。到我们 6 月 3 日推出时，<br /> 2008年，我们拥有4.13亿元的资金。世界刚刚改变。我们什么也没发生。我们追求的所有投资都是<br />好的。我们的头几年非常壮观。就像一切都很顺利，结果还不错。但第二条建议是你<br />不能指望成为数十亿美元的发射。那么这是什么意思呢？这意味着您必须做所有事情。<br />您最好了解如何设置计算机和电话。你最好不要调试你的电脑。你最好知道如何接听电话<br />礼貌地。你不应该为你的老人煮好咖啡。你停下来。你会做所有这一切。但不要自欺欺人。<br />而且，如果您不将数十亿美元的资金锁定多年，那么您将面临很大的风险。<br /> You create a cost structure that&#39;s incompatible with where your capital could be, not where it is today. So I would advise that you do what<br /> you&#39;re good at and learn how to do everything well and work really, really hard and stick to it for a period of time.<br /> And if you love it, it&#39;ll work out.所以。 So let&#39;s address the issue. You just touched on that sub scale<br />操作。 How do you compete for talent in the most competitive market in the world when you can&#39;t write giant checks and<br /> you&#39;re running subscale? Let&#39;s start with you.当然。 He never ran something. That&#39;s fair. But on a relative basis.<br />是的。 It was only to build only. Well, you know, there&#39;s a great movie that came out in 1989.<br /> So you might not have known it, but feel the dreams and if you haven&#39;t seen it.<br /> The main character, Ray Kinsella, who&#39;s played by Kevin Costner.<br /> He&#39;s out in the middle of his cornfield and he hears a voice. If you build it, he will come. And he doesn&#39;t know what build it is.<br /> But he decides to build a baseball field in his cornfield. And lo and behold, a bunch of dead baseball<br /> players show up at his house and start playing baseball. And you should have the mindset of what that movie tells you, which is if you<br /> build it, they will come. If you have a differentiated value proposition. People will invest and you know, this<br /> this panel is a great representation because it&#39;s all different strategies. We&#39;re all but we what we have and what people forget is what we&#39;re offering is<br /> a product. And so you have to ask yourself, OK, why am I here? What is the product that I&#39;m offering<br /> and what customer base is going to want this product? And if you invest early in your infrastructure, if you hire before you<br /> have capital, not after, then I think that you will get that capital. You know, my my good friend, Brandon<br /> Haley, who launched Holocene, he in 2017 had over two dozen employees without a<br /> zero with zero dollars. And he ended up being a gigantic a<br /> gigantic launch because he sold that story to investors. So that&#39;s the mindset I would take a lot of.<br /> I think the difference, though, Mike, is you&#39;re. You were coming from Citadel. Brandon was coming from said it all.<br /> People were willing to come before you built it because they knew would each of you represented I ISE a we as a firm are very loath.<br /> I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll be candid with you. To do work with emerging managers, because the truth is, most of you are not launching with billions of dollars.<br /> You&#39;re probably not even launching with hundreds of millions of dollars. And given how competitive the talent market is, it&#39;s very hard for really<br /> talented people to get behind you. With no proof of concept because they&#39;re making two bets on you that that are beyond the scope of what they&#39;re the<br /> bets they&#39;re normally making. They&#39;re making a bet on you as a new founder. You&#39;ve never done this before.<br /> And they&#39;re making a bet that you can scale that you are worth getting in the trenches with and grin and that you can grow.<br /> And I guess the good news, bad news about my unfortunately, it&#39;s just it&#39;s on a prediction is just a fact of life. Very few of you will launch with scale<br /> is if you&#39;re under two hundred and fifty million. I actually don&#39;t think you need to worry about this.<br /> You guys may disagree with me, but if you&#39;re a really small fund and many of you may start with 25 million or 50 million or 100 million, you can hire<br /> junior people. You can hire people out of the sell side. You can hire people out of banking and<br /> they&#39;re multiple. And we&#39;ll be thrilled to have a seat at the table. And I also think it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult<br /> unless people know you and have worked with you before, you know, the whole other side of things is. Are you a good mentor?<br /> Can you develop them? Are you going to pay them fairly? Are they joining something special with a great culture?<br /> Is there a runway? These are all the sets of things we deal with in helping people cross the divide to go from where they are to a large<br /> established manager and get them comfortable on all those points. And so that&#39;s also there. And if they haven&#39;t worked with you, you<br /> know, they don&#39;t really know what the odds are that it&#39;s going to be a good fit. And you, in turn, also don&#39;t want to<br /> bring on board senior people that you don&#39;t really know and have to give them substantial points in the fund. And then it may not work out if you end<br /> up with a high class problem of achieving scale. Then we get into the<br /> setting up an economic structure which is going to be attractive to your<br /> investment staff. And I&#39;d say the one guiding principle on that is and it&#39;s a good thing as a newer fund.<br /> The value creation for everyone working there should come at a massively different pace than sitting at a large established player where much of that<br /> value has already been created. So what do I mean by that? If let&#39;s call it 25 to 30 percent gets paid out to the investment and<br /> leadership team. This is on average and this is a back of the envelope thought. But I think directionally it&#39;s true<br />这里。 You should be talking about 30 percent going to 50 percent to the extent that the people you hire.<br /> And again, this is further on down the road. Once you have scale and can attract more senior credible people to the<br /> extent that they put up great performance, they can hire and develop people, then you&#39;re able to take on more capital and you&#39;re creating more value.<br /> But at the end of the day, everyone is going to reference you within an inch of your life and the same way. L P&#39;s are going to want to get a point<br /> of view on you. Talent will too. And there&#39;s what you&#39;re telling them upfront, which hopefully is attractive.<br /> But even more attractive is the path forward. And you don&#39;t want them discounting any of the promises or vision that you&#39;re<br /> giving them because of what they&#39;re hearing in the market. So that&#39;s something to bear in mind and I think really critical as you add both<br /> in the meeting, less so maybe in the immediate term, but certainly as you progress and are trying to reach out to really talented, established people.<br /> Brendan, you finding the same sort of circumstances when you&#39;re competing for talent? Watch what your journey been like.<br /> Well, I think it&#39;s a little bit focused on the type of talent you&#39;re recruiting, where it&#39;s like come from a world in a lineage of funds where we don&#39;t hire<br /> experience people, where there&#39;s a kind of fundamental viewpoint in the firms I&#39;ve worked at that we hire people that are less experienced and we train and<br /> develop them. And that obviously aligns easier when you&#39;re subscale, but that that&#39;s not to make the decision because of scale.<br /> That&#39;s just how the world I come from does things. I think, though, to a honest point, you have to be realistic about what the<br /> envelope of what you can spend is, what that looks like and what the talent you can get with that in line against that. So you have to be really kind of<br /> thoughtful about Tom Quinn earlier. What is what am I what do I want to do? What is my strategy look like? What is that business plan look like?<br /> What am I capable of of doing from a development in a mentoring and a leadership perspective? And then how does that work from an<br /> economic perspective, both in terms of day one, but also do a honest point. What does it look like over time? What is that economic trajectory look<br /> like with success? With success as you go and I think you want to be transparent with people around what day one looks like, what<br /> that can evolve to over time, and what are the parameters that that trigger that evolution. And I would say the other thing that&#39;s<br /> fundamentally different is that the analysts I would guess that all of our firms are probably doing you know, they&#39;re all being analyst with probably<br /> slightly different things, that the job is not the same at every firm. And I think that you want to be clear in terms of the way you&#39;re going to invest<br /> the types of things that the analysts will be expected to do. And that will there&#39;ll be some natural self selection of firms that individuals<br /> that that want to have that they think they can be more or less successful in different environments. And let me follow up.<br /> When you talk about hiring people and mentoring them and shaping them. Is it just analysts or is it traders and PMS and others within within the funds?<br /> I would say my general point of view is that it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much true across<br /> the entirety of the firm that when I think about the firms that I&#39;ve worked with and work with in the past that have been successful and you look at the<br /> people that have been highly successful there. None of them were really senior hires coming in.<br /> They were they were hired pretty junior, and they were trained and developed with. Firms and in a lot of those firms, some<br /> of the biggest hiring mistakes they&#39;ve ever made were more senior than that. That&#39;s true for our process. That&#39;s not true for everyone else&#39;s<br /> process. And so I think that there&#39;s always been a natural pull towards you going younger and less experienced in training and<br /> developing those people. And that just makes it easier for me in the current environment because I&#39;m not competing against, you know, the type of<br /> people that a lot. But you&#39;re also not injecting a fully formed human, so to speak, in our business, into the ecosystem.<br /> And you don&#39;t use tissue is going to reject the organism. It almost certainly will on.<br /> One other thing now is as a new manager without much capital. Just bear in mind, LP P&#39;s are making a bet on you.<br /> Making a bet on you as a manager. Not on the bench yet. If you&#39;re launching with just a small amount of capital.<br /> Interesting point, Tom. You&#39;ve been doing this for a while. What&#39;s your experience been of competing for talent in either hiring or building<br /> at all? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s really challenging. It&#39;s always the toughest part of the business, I think, while second raising<br /> the money. That&#39;s that&#39;s probably, you know, parting dollars from people. We have long lockups and a lot of it&#39;s<br /> really long. So that&#39;s that&#39;s always the longest process. But, you know, I think it&#39;s a you know,<br /> it&#39;s a unique challenge today because there&#39;s been a shift over the last 15<br /> years that we&#39;ve run night. We&#39;re a new generation of professionals are coming into the industry or have come into the industry that expect a lot<br /> more sooner. And I think this is you know, this is pretty common across, you know, a generation of folks that are, say, 25<br /> to late 30s, years old. And that&#39;s difficult because if you<br /> think about the last 15 years, we&#39;ve gone 15 years without a recession.真的吗？ And that means you really don&#39;t know<br /> what you&#39;re doing, because if you have. Yes, you invested in one year with a rate rise. OK, but you still haven&#39;t invested in a<br /> recession. So it&#39;s really hard to get people that have experience, that are relatively junior, that have a perspective of how<br /> bad things can be.正确的。 And we&#39;ve learned what happens with higher rates or we&#39;re beginning to learn<br /> what happens with higher rates, which not even I or people substantially more experienced than I am have contended with.<br /> It hasn&#39;t happened since the late 70s. And so, you know, we&#39;re seeing new things. Well, that means that if you have folks<br /> that haven&#39;t experienced those things, even if they can imagine them, it&#39;s different, actually experience them. And so managing people that haven&#39;t yet<br /> had the experience, the challenge, and for you as emerging managers, you need to do that in a way that controls risk and keeps people motivated.<br /> That&#39;s challenging, right? When they when they believe that they deserve more, they have a genuine view that they share more responsibility,<br /> more seniority, more economics. But they haven&#39;t yet been battle tested. That&#39;s a tough dynamic. And it&#39;s one that you really need to be<br /> very thoughtful about and how you manage. I would say don&#39;t cave to the pressure, you know, find the right people that<br /> understand that it&#39;s a process. They&#39;ve got to be committed to building the business alongside you or it&#39;s going to come crumbling in upon itself.<br /> I think the other thing that&#39;s notable that we&#39;ve seen recently is there&#39;s some really high cost structures in the hedge fund world.<br /> You know, 8 percent, the 8 percent fixed costs like that&#39;s insane, insane that<br /> that is not the way to start and run a business. If you&#39;re if you have your fixed costs meaningfully above your guaranteed fees<br /> and then you adjust for loss of capital.正确的。 If you can&#39;t build that cushion and you&#39;re at risk, like just look at<br /> yourself like a business, would you invest in that business because you&#39;re LP, you&#39;re going to look at it the same way and say, what happens if I allocate<br /> this business? Like I don&#39;t want to be like everybody running for the door. And if I&#39;m the, you know, the ant and<br /> the elephants behind me, it&#39;s not going to be a good day. So you have to think about the cost structure, which aligns with how you<br /> manage the people, which aligns with what type of people to hire. So it&#39;s a it&#39;s a multi variable analysis, which I&#39;m definitely not smart<br /> enough to solve. But it&#39;s you know, for me, it&#39;s a feel, you know, the types of folks that you can hire that you think will be a good<br /> fit. And I think it&#39;s incumbent on new managers to think about, OK, who. Who do I want to have effectively in the<br /> trenches with you? Because I think the reason a lot of firms fail in that first three to five year period is because they build<br /> themselves or they expect stratospheric growth. And the reality is it can be really lumpy.<br />正确的。你只是不知道。 You are experienced a good one. We launched we thought we&#39;re going have tons of capital. We had last the market&#39;s fall off a<br /> cliff and I mean, like felt like really, really off a cliff. And no one. We didn&#39;t expect that.<br /> But we built the business to be able to withstand that. And then we grew.真的。 Rapidly after that, because we set up for, you know what, if everything goes<br /> wrong. So I threw a lot into the mix there. But I think all of these things are important considerations when you&#39;re<br /> hiring. It can go great. You can build your huge success and have it. And that&#39;s fantastic. But the odds are that that won&#39;t happen.<br /> The markets won&#39;t give it to you. The personnel won&#39;t be there, know the capital won&#39;t come in the way you expect.<br /> So if you build a sense of conservatism, when you build a buffer around your business, you&#39;ll get to escape velocity. Really interesting.<br /> I&#39;m intrigued by anyone who&#39;s working for you who was born after before.<br /> If they were born after 1987, they&#39;ve never experienced a recession in their professional career. It&#39;s pretty, pretty, pretty amazing.<br />所以。 So let&#39;s talk a little bit about you mentioned your piece. How do each of you differentiate<br /> yourself? What&#39;s your selling point when you&#39;re either trying to bring in capital or hire somebody or in any other way, make<br /> yourself differentiated from the masses that are out there? Let&#39;s start with you, Mike.当然。<br />所以。 So our view is and was that the successful funds in the next decade are those that will be doubly built<br /> businesses. As Tom mentioned, you know, you have to think about this as a business. And those that can attract, retain and<br /> develop talent with a competitive advantage. And, you know, this past weekend, there was a Formula One race in Monaco.<br /> So I&#39;ll use that as an example, because a durable, successful hedge fund is a<br /> lot like an F1 racing team.正确的。 You have the racers, you have your investment team. That&#39;s the DNA of your business. But without a great car, you can&#39;t win<br /> races. And behind those cars, OK, you have<br /> mechanics, engineers, strategists, teams of people that are helping.<br /> And similarly, the hedge fund of today and for the next decade will be a hedge<br /> fund that has an infrastructure that can support their investment team, allow<br /> them to operate at peak performance, and then run the business of a fund. And that&#39;s a different job than what all of us here as investment managers do.<br /> That&#39;s not our expertise. So you have to have that infrastructure and those experts in-house to help you do that.<br /> And that I think that has been a big selling point for our LP was in the<br /> beginning. But also the talent that we bring in knowing that we&#39;ve built this to last. What I&#39;m hearing from you, Mike, is that<br /> generating alpha, that&#39;s table stakes. That&#39;s just what you need to sit down.<br /> Everything beyond that seems to be where you separate yourself from the crowd.<br />绝对地。 LP want to know that they can put capital in. They know it&#39;s going to be an illiquid<br /> investment and know that they are putting capital into a stable, durable business and that&#39;s what you have to provide them.<br /> When you launch, a lot of you have a unique perspective on differentiators<br /> and hedge funds. Tell us what you see from your vantage point. Well, people come in and they meet with<br /> us and they talk about what they&#39;re going to do. And I will tell you, having seen a gazillion presentations, investor<br /> materials, letters, it&#39;s great to have that stuff on.<br /> Done in a way which obviously you&#39;re gonna put time into it.<br /> You want to feel proud of it, but at the end of the day, my feeling is this industry is for the most part, very commodity.<br /> And the reason I went through the different strategies is to let you know<br /> that to the extent you&#39;re launching a strategy that has not performed well in<br /> the last couple of years, L PS are not going to give you the benefit of the doubt. It doesn&#39;t matter what your presentation<br /> materials look like. It just doesn&#39;t. You&#39;re going to have to put up performance. And the biggest piece of advice I can give you is maybe, you know, you can say<br /> you&#39;re differentiated all of this stuff. You&#39;ve got to start investing as quickly<br /> as possible. You bang the tin cup for capital for the first three to six months. You do what you can and then stop,<br /> literally stop. As counterintuitive as that sounds, what<br /> you want to do is start to prove and show some proof of concept, because unless you are coming from a fund that is a top multi manager or you&#39;re coming<br /> from on ie a great fund that is pedigreed and L PS want more of that<br /> DNA. Like I&#39;ll give you another example. Last year Broadwell launched. That was a fund started by Alex Carnell.<br /> A CAC came out of Deerfield and had a huge reputation in health care and he launched with over 3 billion dollars. So unless there&#39;s something that peace<br /> can seek sink their teeth into in terms of the DNA that you carry, you&#39;re going<br /> to have to show them what you can do. And then, yes, it becomes a question of how do you beg, borrow and steal to fund the enterprise while you&#39;re putting out<br /> performance so that you can then go back to LP is raise capital and also get that talent, because now this Field of Dreams has some skin on the bones.<br /> Brennan, what do you think? What what is the differentiator for you as a long only fund manager? I mean, I think the easy answer is that<br /> we&#39;re a long only had a manager that&#39;s doing concentrated hedge fund like investing and there&#39;s people that do that.<br /> So I would like but the field there is a lot smaller<br /> and the pools of capital allocated against long only there are pretty large as a lot of money can pass. There&#39;s a lot of money in long other<br /> long only strategies. So it&#39;s different than launching, you know, a higher fee product like a long shore product where you&#39;re competing<br /> against, you know, the likes of the world where they&#39;re making those tradeoffs. It&#39;s a little bit different.<br /> I would also echo the idea that my experience and not every allocator is the same allocators want to invest in what they perceive as institutional<br /> scale managers. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you need to have 30 employees, but they want to. They may want to look at as a real<br /> business. They want to understand the plan. They want to understand how you think about the growth of the business, the<br /> contingencies of the business, what your strategy is, how you&#39;re building the culture. Because to be perfectly frank, that I<br /> think that&#39;s the that&#39;s the easiest thing to kind of underwrite from an outside perspective. Always harder to underwrite stock pitches. I find it hard to underwrite stock<br /> pitches if I don&#39;t know the stock really, really well. And so I think you want to you want to invest in that part of the business.<br /> And what that investment looks like is going to be specific to your strategy.正确的？ It looks very different for a motel<br /> manager than it than it does for a smaller organization. But you can still get to that level of institutional scale as a smaller manager<br /> if you if you make it a priority and you&#39;re thoughtful around how that looks<br /> both day one and what your communication looks like for what it should be over time. Tom, what&#39;s your big differentiator?<br /> I don&#39;t think we really have one. No, I think I was a great quote pit bull<br /> that not picking know where random sports investments. Seth Klarman. I read a great quote by him.<br /> I think it two weeks ago and he said, we&#39;re fortunate to be unconstrained by a<br /> specific investment strategy from the group directly. That&#39;s so beautiful, right? Because what are you paying outposts<br /> for? You&#39;re paying them to go out and find great investments where there&#39;s downside protection.<br /> So the way that we present what we do is that we can invest anywhere in the world, really in anything but everything we do.<br /> We take a credit approach, too, which is we have an extreme focus on capital preservation and we try to structure for the best possible return.<br /> Sometimes it&#39;s an equity return or linked return or convertible or warrants so we can gain an equity return. But that&#39;s really the approach.<br /> So every investment that we pursue, we take that approach with the investment that we made in the in the football team in the UK was structured as a as a<br /> secured loan with, you know, the ability to eventually, you know, gain full<br /> control. You know, a lot of the investing that we&#39;ve pursued. Has been structured in that way, and I<br /> think that&#39;s a differentiator because it&#39;s it&#39;s a little different than investing in somebody that&#39;s going to go trade high yield bonds or do public<br /> distrust. And I think the second thing is, at least from my core business, which we started as a distressed debt fund.<br /> The distress that funds just went off the rails. The last 15 years that the way that they operate is they they look at it a<br /> business as a carcass and then approach it to fight over the carcass.正确的。 We look at a business that might be a<br /> carcass and say, can we revive that thing?正确的。 Because if you can, the the pie that<br /> you&#39;re fighting over grows. And that&#39;s a lost art for a lot of investors in turnarounds like different many real turnaround experts anymore.<br /> And that is how you make tons of money, at least in my subsector.<br /> And so I think we&#39;ve done that pretty well. We&#39;ve invested in a few businesses the last few years where we had control that<br /> we&#39;ve turned around. Our biggest short going into the Covid was Hertz. It&#39;s now our largest long we&#39;ve ever had in the history of the firm and it was a turnaround play centered around<br /> electrification. So I think you&#39;ve got again, it goes back to, I said, the very beginning. You&#39;ve got to find what you&#39;re good at<br /> and what you love and then apply it to your strategy and do that. Like just do that. Forget all the noise.<br /> Just do what you love and what you&#39;re good at. And the rest of it should should be OK. And also having a structure that<br /> supports what you do is very advantageous. I mean, I don&#39;t want this to be lost on you. Of that, 10 billion or billion is in an insurance company.<br />是的。 And the up and you have one another for two and a half that&#39;s in drawdown, right?<br />当然。 So there&#39;s no timeline to returning capital. You some of our capital is literally insurance companies. Permanent, permanent.<br /> And then one of the drawdown funds the investor. It&#39;s really like uber wealthy family. When we draw the capital, we never have<br /> to give it back. Now, we don&#39;t get paid until we give it back. But we don&#39;t actually have to give it<br /> back in. Our fee is a sliding. Don&#39;t steal this, by the way, so we can really good idea. Took a long time to come up with this. The fee is a sliding scale based on the<br /> IRR. So there&#39;s this weird push pull because you know, sometimes you do a great investment. You compound at 40 or 35 or 30 for the first 18 months and then, you know,<br /> you&#39;re not going to continue compounding at that rate. You&#39;re probably going to slide to a lower level. Well, we have to decide, do we want to capture the higher incentive fee or we<br /> want to hold it and make a larger point. I always go for the larger, more.正确的。 But the worst thing you can do is try to<br /> live off of IRR. It&#39;s not possible you can&#39;t eat those make is what you want. So that duration of capital is hard, but<br /> the dumbest decision I ever made was pursuing long duration capital. We would be three times larger, four times larger if I had just built the<br /> Cielo business and listened to a lot of em like hired people to do right, do direct lending and do his all the things I tell you to do.<br /> No, but you were like you always had good ideas, like this is what your peers are doing. And you had very, very good advice over<br /> time that I listened to none of. And I&#39;m much poorer for it. Well, but friends at 10 million dollar fund.<br /> So there you go. No, but it&#39;s why I said you&#39;re going way back. I want permanent capital because I just<br /> said we have permanent capital. We can do whatever we want like we could by English soccer teams. Now, what I said we can do. We can make investments that really compound for a long period of time.<br /> And so we focused on doing that. Maybe it was a good decision that maybe it wasn&#39;t.时间会证明一切。<br /> But again, it went back to. That&#39;s what we love. That&#39;s what we wanted to do. But my point being, it&#39;s not just the<br /> strategy, it&#39;s also the structure. You get out for sure created a structure which is like I mean, it&#39;s almost a mini Apollo.<br />这是。 You created a structure where you just charge on Alpha Keys can get behind that. It may be long only, but you&#39;re just charging on Alpha and you&#39;re all alpha.<br /> So and you have all of the DNA from one of the greatest hedge funds in the world. You know, these are things that make<br /> each of these guys differentiated to your question and unique. And the reality is there are very few individuals that come to market with<br /> that skill set and that foresight. So so since I wrote us back that that&#39;s true. Since we brought up L P&#39;s and<br /> Allocators, I want to skip ahead to this question. What&#39;s what&#39;s the hardest question that you get asked by your limited partners<br /> or allocators? What&#39;s the most challenging question they throw at you will start with you again. Yeah, I think there are two hard questions.<br /> One is on the topic of exiting people and you know, that is mostly an<br /> objective decision, but there&#39;s a lot of subjectivity to it as well. And I think, you know, LAPD wanted to be objective and it&#39;s sometimes hard to<br /> explain. Explain some of the background to why we might keep somebody versus versus exit to them.<br /> I think the second question that they ask and we have a tough time with there&#39;s just on adapting any strategy that we have at, you know, LP is<br /> don&#39;t want you to adapt and change the business model that you promised and that and that. And I think that&#39;s. Completely fair. But there are times that are critical in<br /> a fund&#39;s life that you need to adapt or you&#39;ll die and sound money, too. For example.正确的。<br /> So, you know, whatever it may be, that that is a hard question to answer<br /> because, you know, most of the time what they want to hear is don&#39;t change your your path at all. You want to know why?<br /> I do want to. But I also want to comment on what Mike said.我愿意。这是真的。 But when you have however many years of<br /> putting up great performance and delivering exactly what you promised O PS, there is a higher receptivity I think to then whatever you see the pivot<br /> points as I&#39;ve seen this with other clients as well, that maybe started as one thing and as long as they didn&#39;t stray too far from their core DNA, I one<br /> client that is now 50 billion. He was 30 billion two years ago and he&#39;s done it through us thinking through quick other strategies and other<br /> products that are tangential but still related. And he&#39;s got credibility with his piece because of what he&#39;s delivered on<br /> turnover. OK, I just have to comment on this because, you know, like it&#39;s such a it&#39;s the bane of my existence.<br /> And I think it&#39;s one of the biggest problems in our industry. People are terrified, LPC are terrified to fire people, they think somehow it&#39;s<br /> going to reflect poorly on their ability to retain a team, their culture.<br /> Something bad&#39;s going on at the fund. You mean he&#39;s terrified of people?<br />是的。 But. But they&#39;re they&#39;re terrified.哦。 Oh, he&#39;s will think.对不起。我正是这个意思。 Mm hmm.<br /> You have to be. You have to give people room to fail or to succeed, rather give them runway, give them tools, help them develop.<br /> But at a certain point, you need to graciously exit them. If they&#39;re not cutting it because the majority of you will not have a pass<br /> through model.好的。 I mean, that&#39;s just the truth. And you&#39;re gonna have a little problem called network, which is Peter over here.<br /> I&#39;m going to use just simple illustration. His ideas put up 100 hundred million of piano, piano.<br /> And Paul over here. Lost 100 million and you&#39;re zero. And what you don&#39;t want to do was Peter and Paul.<br /> You want to pay from you want to take from this guy to pay that guy. It&#39;s hard to take from this guy to pay that guy because you&#39;re going to end up<br /> losing your best people. And you also don&#39;t want your aides to feel like they&#39;re surrounded by a bunch of BS or worse yet, CS.<br /> So you need to manage people who are not cutting it and give them time to succeed. You need to manage them out.<br /> And don&#39;t worry about about your L PS because at the end of the day you&#39;re going to have a much bigger problem if your stars leave the door.<br /> They appreciate you cutting your losses. If I just want to manage talent the way you manage a portfolio, you. That&#39;s how you have to approach it.<br /> You have to be. You have to be rigorous. You have to be you know, you have to make tough decisions. You can&#39;t worry about anything else. This is the biggest problem.<br /> It&#39;s not just emerging managers, but in general that I see in our industry. And the best founders, OK, are the ones who do this really, really well.<br /> And sometimes, you know, people sort of they get a bad rap for it, but they&#39;re also the best at developing people and giving people the most runway.<br /> It&#39;s about creating an environment which attracts rock stars. On your question. Toughest question.<br /> One of the things you mentioned, Tom mentioned is I how you&#39;re going to pay<br /> for resources. So if you have a 2 percent management fee and you&#39;re in a 100 million dollar fund and you come from a fund, we&#39;re<br /> used to having tens of millions of dollars spent on research and software and data and corporate access. You have to answer the question to<br /> appease as to how you&#39;re going to fund that. You can&#39;t have you touched on this? You can&#39;t have 100 million dollar fund<br /> to meet a 2 percent management fee. And then one million dollars spent on<br /> fund expenses because that&#39;s a 3 percent drag on returns out of the gate. And it&#39;s even higher if you&#39;re if you&#39;re less.<br /> And the answer to that question really has to come back to how are you special?好的。 You don&#39;t need all these data sources.<br /> I&#39;m going to do X. I&#39;m going to do really well. And here&#39;s what I need. And be very precise about what you&#39;re<br /> bringing to the table and the resources you need to support that. The reality is you&#39;re not competing head on with these funds that spend tens of<br /> millions of dollars or even hundreds of millions of dollars on research. Brendan, what&#39;s the toughest question you get asked by potential employees?<br /> Let&#39;s say during the fundraising process, for me, the toughest is always what what your target that you&#39;re going to raise, to which my answer is I have<br /> no idea. You tell me.我们拭目以待。 I&#39;m going to launch it and we&#39;re gonna see what it is and it&#39;ll be what it is. Now, I would say that you&#39;re the hardest<br />问题。 I always it&#39;s a little bit like last question. How do you how do you differentiate yourself versus other funds? Because I always inherent in that<br /> question is you have to know what that other fund is doing. And like I am a strong believer that unless you&#39;re in the walls and you&#39;re<br /> left, you understand exactly how the investment process works. It&#39;s really hard to compare yourself to another fund. And so I try to turn it back to this. Know, this is how we invest.<br /> This is how we do things. You compare that to the other people you kind of see in the market. But during the fundraising process,<br /> we&#39;re going to everyone in this room that&#39;s about to go through it. You know, the how what you what what what your target for raising.<br /> I always found somewhat amusing because I don&#39;t think anybody really knows until the last minute. Tom, how about you?<br /> I&#39;m looking for a doozy for it. I love the question. What do you see as the great opportunities over the next six months?<br /> You&#39;re literally like, really the answer to that question. I wouldn&#39;t need you as an LP to be retired, like managing my own money to<br /> someone else to be a manager in one office. I&#39;d be a professional fly fisherman, you know, like March know, 60, 20, 0 8.<br /> No one knew that. We&#39;re about to embark on the greatest run in distressed financials we&#39;ve ever seen.正确的。 September 10, 2001, no one knew there&#39;d<br /> be a huge opportunity in airlines. You know, just kind of go through history like you just don&#39;t know. So I think my answer to this question.<br />真的吗？ And playing off a little bit of the other comments is. Don&#39;t worry about what the LPC think.<br />好的。 Just say what you do, what you believe is right for generating returns. Because I&#39;ll tell you, particularly as a<br /> distressed investor. The fees are always wrong. Always like very, very rarely do we make a new investment and make people go,<br /> wow, that&#39;s great. Usually the like, oh, my God, really? Like, you really think that&#39;s a good investment?是的。 Like this.<br /> What&#39;s going to happen? Like, oh, my God, he&#39;s lost his mind. So I think you have to balance the fact that your the asset manager, you&#39;re the<br /> business builder. Just be honest.正确的。 And stick to your your strategy.<br /> But don&#39;t get swayed by what the crowd thinks. That&#39;s that&#39;s a surefire way to fail. Let&#39;s stay on that ends of the panel for<br /> this question. Tell us the biggest surprise or lesson learned over the years. What really sticks with you?<br /> I&#39;m still doing it now. I think the fact that I like it so much.是的。<br /> I came from you know, I was on a sell side trading floor with a thousand people. And it was sort of like, you know, very<br /> collegial. Lots of interpersonal reaction, interaction. Very loud, boisterous.<br /> I loved that and thrived in it. I know it&#39;s super surprising. And the you know, when you go to run your own firm and you start kicking,<br /> you&#39;re small. It&#39;s just totally different. And I wasn&#39;t sure that it would give me the same level of satisfaction that<br /> we&#39;ve that I get energized every day. It&#39;s been way better. You know, afros gone. I lost all my hair, which probably is a<br /> stress levels up, but it definitely has been a pleasure and far exceeding what I ever anticipated.<br /> Brendan, what&#39;s the biggest lesson or biggest surprise that you learned over the past few years? I think the biggest surprise and I think<br /> it&#39;s not intellectually a surprise, but it&#39;s a little bit like having kids. You don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like until you&#39;ve got them.<br /> If you&#39;ve worked, if your background is working in other funds, working with other people, you have peers, you work with other people who appear as if<br /> something&#39;s going wrong. Complain to those peers when it&#39;s yours, it&#39;s you and the way you behave, the way you act and who you<br /> talk to in all matters because you&#39;re setting the culture of the entire organization. And that&#39;s you know, the thing Jim<br /> Parsons, who who I worked with before told me before I started with the highs are higher and lows are lower and you kind of feel it more internally<br /> in the ability to socialize it out is less there. And so it&#39;s one of those things. It&#39;s not obviously I&#39;d say that I think<br /> I run the room. But again, the. Of course it is. But until you go through it, you don&#39;t<br /> know what it&#39;s like. And again, highs or higher lows are lower. I think it nets out to being awesome.<br /> But prepare yourself for that and prepare yourself that it&#39;s different and how you behave matters. Alina, you&#39;ve seen you&#39;ve seen so much<br /> from your vantage point. Tell us, what would the biggest surprise was for you? Well, we&#39;ll save the biggest lesson for<br /> the last question. But now what what really was like, I just want to answer it this way. I mean, it nets out that it&#39;s awesome<br /> when you&#39;re successful. But the the common the most common thing I hear. I mean, I get this literally at least<br /> once a week from real managers. These aren&#39;t guys who couldn&#39;t cut it. These are guys who got to at least two, three, four hundred million.<br /> They had actually good returns even with the volatility of the last couple of<br />年。 And they are they&#39;re closing shop. And you just need to be aware of this or they&#39;re just not having fun anymore.<br /> You talked about having fun and loving it. You go into this business for you go into the idea of starting a fund.<br /> You&#39;re all emerging managers for two reasons. You believe in your strategy and you want to put it out into the<br /> world with your own imprimatur. And what you don&#39;t really realize or maybe you realize it, but yes, like the cabin having kids analogy, it&#39;s not<br /> until you&#39;re in the seat that it&#39;s really tangible. These two things, investor and entrepreneur.<br /> These two hats you need to wear are actually in conflict with each other and<br /> every moment you spend, particularly as a new manager, not investing and many of<br /> you will not be able to afford out of the gate the same infrastructure that these guys could see you&#39;re gonna get pulled into.<br /> Each are issues and legal issues and administration issues. And God, you&#39;re gonna be dealing with LP sometimes 100 percent of your time and<br /> you&#39;re going to be trying to put up great performance. And that&#39;s exhausting and it&#39;s sad, but there are many.<br /> I just have to tell the truth. There are many examples of individuals<br /> who got to a point where one might call them successful. They&#39;re running hundred million five hundred million.<br /> I have one guy who&#39;s running a billion and a half. His returns have suffered because of the distraction or they&#39;re just not having<br /> fun anymore because the thing that got them into this in the first place was a love of investing. And they find themselves actually<br /> focused on a whole host of other issues, which really are not how they want to spend their time. So if this is what you really want to do<br /> and it&#39;s an itch you want to scratch, you should go do it. But to the extent what you really want to do is have autonomy, invest, had<br /> scale out of the gate, have great resources and not that fast necessarily about all the rest of it. We should have that conversation.<br /> And if you do launch and you launch successfully, we&#39;ll have that conversation, too. Mike, what was the biggest lesson,<br /> biggest surprise to you? Yeah, you know, and Bear, you asked this question when I was on another panel with you a couple of years ago.<br /> An interesting article. Interestingly, it&#39;s the same answer. And, you know, this is a talent driven business.<br /> And what&#39;s been most surprising is the compounding effect of great talent. You always think about it in financial terms, but people who hire great people<br /> and keep the bar high, it&#39;s amazing what it does to your business. And so that&#39;s been the biggest surprise continues to be.<br /> So we&#39;re just about out of time. We don&#39;t have time for audience questions. But let me just throw one last question.<br /> Ten second response from each of you, and we&#39;ll start with Tom.<br /> One piece of advice for someone about to launch a new fund. Just as I said earlier, do you love surround yourself with people that you<br /> that you really want to work with and stay true to your initial objectives,<br /> one of which has to be to work as hard as you possibly can?正确的。 Yeah, I would. That kind of a corollary that I don&#39;t don&#39;t try to sell people on what you<br /> think that you want to hear. You have to come to market with a perspective. You have to have a strong point of view.<br /> And that either works or it doesn&#39;t. And that&#39;s the bet you have to kind of underlying make. But it won&#39;t work if you try to go if<br /> you try to shoehorn it into something that it&#39;s not. Alana, take your time. With respect to hiring people, build<br /> this on the right way. LP is would rather see a longer and slower ramp and off with respect to optimizing your investment team and your<br /> non investment team and performance.

Ramit Sethi is a fascinating guy with really an amazing and fascinating career, starting out studying psychology and a little bit of finance at Stanford. He started a blog, which eventually became a podcast and a book, and is now a Netflix series. Depending on the platform, it&#39;s either “I Will Teach You to Be Rich,” the book, or the Netflix show “How to Get Rich.”</p><p> And it&#39;s not rich in terms of how to pile up money, but rather how to live a rich life by treating money as a tool to do the things that you want to do. That&#39;s one part financial freedom, one part prioritization of your life, and one part less stress and worries about financial matters. It&#39;s really a very thoughtful and intelligent approach to thinking about spending. And I found the conversation to be really interesting.</p><p> I&#39;ve chatted with Ramit before. I think he&#39;s really a fascinating guy, and I&#39;m glad we finally managed to get him in to the studio for a podcast. The show on Netflix is really quite interesting, and his just whole approach is intelligent and joyful and really very pleasant as opposed to the usual spending scolds who make money like a drudgery in a bore. He&#39;s not like that at all, which probably accounts for a lot of his success. He makes what is otherwise a potentially challenging subject very interesting.</p><p> I found this conversation to be delightful, and I think you will also.</p><p> So, with no further ado, my sit-down with Ramit Sethi teaching you how to live a rich life.</p><p> Ramit Sethi, Founder and CEO, I Will Teach You to Be Rich: Thanks for having me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, good seeing you again. Good to have you. So, before we get into the Netflix series and the book, let&#39;s talk a little bit about your background. You get a scholarship in high school, you put it in the stock market, and immediately lose half. How do you lose half of your money that quickly?</p><p> SETHI: Well, everybody thought they were a genius including me in 1999, 2000. Kind of sounds familiar to all of our crypto friends from the last few years. So, I was sitting there reading Industry Standard, remember that magazine?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> SETHI: And all these this media about how the stock market was going up 15 percent a week. So…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Forever.</p><p> SETHI: Trees grow to the sky.</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p> SETHI: Always, and so I said, cool, I&#39;m going to get in on this, and I took the first scholarship check which they sent to me, that&#39;s usually not how it works, they usually send it to the school.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: And you know, for a 17-year-old kid, that&#39;s a lot of money I put in the stock market, and I lost half of it within weeks. And in retrospect, that was probably one of the best lessons I ever got.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You know, if you step into a casino and the bells and lights go off and you win money, you&#39;re screwed the rest of your life.</p><p> SETHI: Cause you think you&#39;re a genius.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, how hard is it?</p><p> SETHI: So, then I end up going to college. I had other scholarships that paid my way through, which was very fortunate. And I was learning about money, reading all the books, all the magazines, watching the shows, and I was also studying social psychology. So, I was studying human behavior, persuasion, and I was really, it reminded me of that book “The Emperor Has No Clothes” because the advice that we all get about money, for the last 30 plus years, makes no sense if you understand psychology. And that&#39;s when I started to develop my own philosophy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And let&#39;s talk a little bit about that academic study. Stanford BA Information and Society with a minor in psychology, a master&#39;s in social psychology and interpersonal processes. It sounds like you knew exactly what you wanted to do from a fairly early period in your life.</p><p> SETHI: No, I&#39;m not so sure. I think, you remember that famous Steve Jobs commencement address?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The speech, sure.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Absolutely.</p><p> SETHI: That was my graduation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Get out.</p><p> SETHI: Yes. So, he said, you often can&#39;t tell where you&#39;re going until you look backwards, and you connect the dots.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Makes sense.</p><p> SETHI: And I found that to be profoundly true for me when I was in college, I was super interested in why we do the things we do.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: For example, why do we all talk about, you know, I should probably go to the gym a little bit more, but we don&#39;t. I find that profoundly interesting because we sometimes will say it&#39;s about money, it&#39;s about time, but deep down there are deeper reasons and so being at Stanford and being able to study a science technology and society and psychology and sociology, that really allowed me to understand more of why we do what we do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really interesting. I&#39;m trying to remember the date. I think it&#39;s January 19th is when the average New Year&#39;s resolution has been broken.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, there&#39;s some — you know it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s some nuance, I think, to New Year&#39;s resolutions, I used to be kind of like scornful. Ah, you know, the gym piles up and then it empties out. Now I think I&#39;ll take any opportunity where people are motivated to change. And if it is a 20-year high school reunion, if it&#39;s January 1st, doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> SETHI: Will most people flush out?大概。 But there&#39;s a few who will make it meaningful for them and commit to it. And for me that&#39;s a win.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, I&#39;m skipping ahead a little bit, but you write a lot about instead of focusing on goals focusing on processes, clearly psychology helps there too it&#39;s easy to make a small change in how you do things as opposed to this immense, hey I really want to be jacked for my 20th reunion.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, one of the most interesting emails I got from my newsletter subscribers was a woman who wrote me and said, you know, you talk about going for a run or going to the gym, and she goes, I have told myself that I want to go for a run five times a week for years, and I never do it, and I just wrote back to her and I said …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Go for a walk.</p><p> SETHI: … why don&#39;t you go once a week? And her response was so fascinating. She said, why would I do that, that will make no difference. I find that extremely fascinating, she would rather — yes, she would rather dream about going five times a week then actually go once a week, and so many of us do this with our money. We&#39;d rather dream about having 10 million then start investing $100 a week.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Perfect is the enemy of the good, isn&#39;t it?</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really fascinating. So, you start the blog in 2004, more or less.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, while I&#39;m in college.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You were an early adopter, as was I. How did that evolve into a book?</p><p> SETHI: The blog was not some master genius stroke. It was my frustration because–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Come on, tell the truth. You&#39;re like, I&#39;m going to blog for 20 years and then Netflix is going to come along.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Netflix, which didn&#39;t even exist.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: By then it was just DVD by mail.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, so okay, I was trying to teach my friends in college about personal finance. We&#39;d be sitting around the dining halls, someone would be complaining about their fourth overdraft fee, and I would go, hey, you should just come. I have this one-hour presentation I do on money. And they were like…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wait, this is in college you would do this? No kidding.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and so they would go, yes, that sounds really cool. And they would never show up.</p><p> Another fascinating peculiarity of human behavior, when it comes to money events, most people hate them because when they physically go they feel bad, and the older you get, the worse you feel, because you feel, I should have learned this earlier, my friends were 20 years old, and they already felt like they were behind imagine a 45, 55 year old at a 401k seminar, they don&#39;t want to go. So I did this for a year and a half nobody virtually nobody came like 10 people, and I finally said, I was a cocky college kid, I go, you know what the world needs to hear what I know. But they were certainly not listening. So, I started a blog.</p><p> I said, maybe these lazy college kids will read it from their dorm. And that actually turned out to be exactly right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, was there ever an actual job out of Stanford or did the blog lead to?</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Tell us about your first gig.</p><p> SETHI: So, I had some internships in college and then when I graduated, I accepted an offer from Google actually. And they said, you should take some time. You know, you&#39;ve been in school for a long time.</p><p> I said, yes, I plan to. I&#39;ll be talking to you guys in three months. So, I took the summer off. One of my buddies said, “Hey, I&#39;m starting this thing. Why don&#39;t you start it with me?” So, I started this little collaboration company with my friend. We were co-founders. And it sort of blew up that summer. And I ended up saying to Google, “I really appreciate you guys, but I think I&#39;m going to stick with this.” And I was at that company, which was an online collaboration company, for several years, till about &#39;09.</p><p> Meanwhile, I was doing my blog on the side, and it was just getting bigger and bigger.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Whatever happened with the collab company?</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s still around, it&#39;s still around.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There was no big exit, you didn&#39;t ring the bell and say?</p><p> SETHI: No, there was no exit, we were not here at Bloomberg. It was sort of earlier than Google Docs, and it was a Wiki, now it&#39;s sort of pivoted into B2B.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Kind of interesting, so you&#39;re working on the blog since &#39;04, somewhere along the lines there&#39;s a self-published eBook or something like that?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, around 06, 07 I said I want to see if anybody on the internet will actually pay for anything, I had not made a cent from the blog. It was just me doing it as a hobby. So, I created this eBook and I decided to sell it for $4.95 cents, and I was very terrified, it&#39;s like any artist who&#39;s ever sold something.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure. It&#39;s validation.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and like what is the world going to think? I had such low confidence that I didn&#39;t even set up a distribution system I just said when the receipt comes in through PayPal, I&#39;ll manually attach it to an email because I thought 50 people would buy it, two interesting things happened first I was terrified of people calling me a sellout because back then to me selling something was sort of the antithesis of creating value and I actually did get called a sellout, I had people who had been reading me for free for years who turned and they said “Oh so it&#39;s I will teach Ramit to be rich.”</p><p> And that really hurt. When I think back to some of the most painful moments over a 20-year career, that is definitely one.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Because everything in the world is free. You should work for free. Media subscription should be free. Nobody should ever pay for anything.</p><p> SETHI: Correct. And if you do, you&#39;re trying to get one over me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re a sellout. I&#39;ll tell you something funny and people you know, we never quite had that accusation, but for the better part of 15 years before I started accepting capital, it was, “Hey, everybody&#39;s telling you how to manage your assets the wrong way. Here, you could do it yourself. Here&#39;s the right way to do it. You could do it. It takes a little discipline, a little time, and very little money. Manage it yourself.” And to my chagrin, people started saying, “Hey, I like the way you think, but I don&#39;t have time for this. You take my money.” “No, no, don&#39;t you understand? This is all about you can do it yourself.” “I&#39;m busy. You do it.” All right, and that&#39;s how a business was born, but I don&#39;t look at that as selling out. I don&#39;t look at what you did as selling out. $5 is not going to kill anybody.</p><p> SETHI: Exactly, and you know if they didn&#39;t like it I refunded them. That was what was fascinating.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Money-back guarantee on the, wow.</p><p> SETHI: And then the second thing that was fascinating to me was I had a small cadre of very loud vocal people who were angry. But…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: that&#39;s true on every website.</p><p> SETHI: Exactly, but the people who bought, I could see their statistics. Their open rates on my emails were quadruple the rate of everybody else. They email me saying, hey, this was great. When are you creating the next thing? I sat there looking at the data, looking at the emails, and I go, wait a minute. There&#39;s something qualitatively different about buyers and non-buyers. That led to the next three or four years of learning how to sell, how to create value, and not worry about selling out, but do it in a very ethical way. Do it my way.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And did the eBook eventually lead to “I Will Teach You to be Rich” the book?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, I think I became more comfortable. I think one of the biggest mistakes people make when thinking about writing a book is doing it too early. I waited until I had my philosophy dialed in. I treated my blog like an experimental lab. So, I tested it with different incomes, different industries, different geographies. By the time I wrote it, I knew what I was going to say.</p><p> And so that came out in March &#39;09, which actually happens to be the bottom. I&#39;m the bottom. But I remember going around, here we are in Manhattan, I remember going on book tour, and this book came out and a few months before my publishers had sort of sent me a note, are you sure that this information is still relevant because of what&#39;s going on? I go, good information has nothing to do with time. If anything, it&#39;s even more relevant because now low cost, long term investing makes sense, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p> So, I go on book tour to 13 cities and in every city, I&#39;m sitting in the green room waiting for a news director to come out and they go, we&#39;re not going to talk about investing today. I go, what? And they go, there&#39;s 10 percent unemployment. People just want to know how to get by. And I looked at them and I thought to myself, we&#39;ll talk about that. There&#39;s definitely some ways to save money.</p><p> But that also means the majority of people are employed and everybody knows that at some point the market will come back and they want to position themselves.</p><p> So, they just looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at them like, I don&#39;t really care what you say. I&#39;m going on air, I&#39;m going to say what I want. And I think that has been true since 2009 until now. Every time I do media, the predominant question is, times are tough, things are crazy, how do we get by?</p><p> And I go, I simply don&#39;t accept the premise anymore.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: I go, wait a minute, first of all, in certain areas, things are better than ever. Second, regardless of what we&#39;re talking about here, there are ways to get ahead and actually make money fun.</p><p> So, I&#39;m just not going to indulge the idea that money has to be purely a nuisance, purely an annoyance. No, let&#39;s start off by talking about how money can be amazing and joyful and create a rich life.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really love that. And I have to start out with a confession. When this book first came out, I hated the title.</p><p> （笑声）</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I thought it was just another get rich quick scheme, some sort of nonsense, and it was one of the guys I worked with that said, no, no, that&#39;s not what this book is about. You got to read it. So I started thumbing through it and I&#39;m like oh this is not about getting rich, this is about figuring out what money as a tool can do for you and how to use it properly, it&#39;s a very different headspace than most of the here&#39;s how to invest and get rich.</p><p> What led you to that sort of approach and that title?</p><p> SETHI: Well, I was sober when I chose that title, okay? I want to — I was a college kid, and I named my website I will teach you to be rich. I always have loved provocative names. I do love being ultra-clear about what I&#39;m going to promise. I have these digital programs. One of them is find your dream job. It&#39;s very clear what you&#39;re going to get.我喜欢。</p><p> But I will say that I&#39;m not offended by what you said because if you go and read it, there are people who talk about the book. I feel very fortunate that people spread the word a lot and they will almost always introduce it in the exact same way.</p><p> They&#39;ll go listen …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Ignore the title.</p><p> SETHI: They go, this book, it sounds like a scam, but “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” is actually really good and that&#39;s fine with me when you hear that title, I love a big promise, but what I love even more is over delivering on it.</p><p> So, it&#39;s not just about getting rich. It&#39;s actually about being rich, and being rich means not it means how to earn money, it means how to talk about money and even how to spend money all of those things including managing money are part of a rich life.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, let&#39;s delve deeper into the concept of a rich life. I love this quote. a rich life is lived outside the spreadsheet. explain that.</p><p> SETHI: Well, there&#39;s too many nerds probably half the people listening to this who love their spreadsheets, hey guys, do you want to do an amortization table? You want to do a Monte Carlo analysis? And they do that for 35 years tweaking numbers I go you won, you won the game. It&#39;s fine, turn the page on your life and go to the next chapter.</p><p> Once you have your asset allocation dialed in, your automatic contributions dialed in, all the basics, then you can move on. And part of that involves designing your rich life. Let&#39;s talk about that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes, I really want to get into that because when we talk about the show, that really is a focus and you really kind of rocked some people back on their heels and make them address things they don&#39;t want to address. I&#39;m assuming that the blog and the podcast led to a lot of those interactions that ended up in the book.</p><p> SETHI: 100 percent. Yes, the blog gave me a lot of raw material because I had a chance to talk to people at different incomes, et cetera. You know, a rich life, most people expect a money book to start with a chapter on budgets. That&#39;s virtually every money book. And that is, in my opinion, a total turn off.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Buzzkill.</p><p> SETHI: Okay, some average person opens up a book. They&#39;re already feeling nervous judge. They open up the first chapter that author says, okay here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. We&#39;re going to get a budget. Everybody hates the word budget. I hate budgets myself. I don&#39;t keep one and now you&#39;re going to go through the last 12 months of spending which are not conveniently found anywhere, you know, you did it wrong, but I want you to go and spend the next 20 hours writing this stuff down just so you can be judged.</p><p> It&#39;s like, no thanks, I&#39;m going to put this right back on the shelf.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: So that is a lack of understanding psychology.</p><p> What I did with the book was to understand where do people want to start? Let&#39;s get them a quick win. Number one, everybody has credit cards, everybody misunderstands how to use them, and there are actually some secret perks that people have no idea about. Let&#39;s get you a quick win. You got a late fee? Read these words off the page. In fact, here&#39;s the phone number you call, and you will get your $37 fee waived. People do that, they don&#39;t believe it. And they do it, they go, oh my god it worked. And like that they realize they&#39;re on board, I can take control of my money, not let every financial company control me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes, I was genuinely shocked and again the Netflix series is in my head. People have 18 credit cards, 20 — who has 20 bank accounts, it&#39;s you&#39;re just what you&#39;re paying in fees seems to be exorbitant.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, a lot of people who watched that show “How to Get Rich” on Netflix they told me like, I had no idea how little people know about money, but to me, I&#39;ve been talking to everyday people for the last 20 years, so it doesn&#39;t faze me to have 20 savings accounts to not know how much you&#39;re spending on fees.</p><p> Of course, you don&#39;t, that&#39;s like asking me, Ramit, do you have a carburetor in your car? I go, what the hell&#39;s a carburetor? I don&#39;t know, I turn the key it works, that&#39;s my understanding.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, let&#39;s talk about the money dial, where did the concept of that come and how do people actually use your money dial?</p><p> SETHI: When I talk about a rich life people like the term they go, rich life. What is that? So, you know first let&#39;s just start with that, a rich life can be traveling two months a year, a rich life can be wearing a beautiful cashmere coat, it could be picking up your kids from school every afternoon. Your rich life is yours.</p><p> And so, people they buy into that they go. Oh wow.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not just materialism. It&#39;s not just shiny things. It sounds like it&#39;s choices and freedom and much less worry.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, but it&#39;s being very, very specific about it so freedom is when I ask people, what is your rich life? 90 percent of people say the same answer to me across the world. They go I want to do what I want when I want. They really think that they&#39;re clever.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: I go wow that&#39;s so interesting, I never heard that before.</p><p> （笑声）</p><p> SETHI: And then I go so what do you want, and they just stare at me because that is how far most of us have thought. And they&#39;ll say something like travel. I go, okay, where? They go, Europe. I go, where? I want to know what airline seat you&#39;re going to sit in, I want to know where you&#39;re going to stay, what you&#39;re going to eat, I want to know who&#39;s going with you for how long, that&#39;s a vivid and specific vision of a rich life.</p><p> So, an easy way to do this for everybody listening is let&#39;s do this quick exercise together. The first question I have for you, Barry, is what do you love spending money on?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Dining, entertainment, things like that.</p><p> SETHI: Fantastic. Dining is actually the number one response money dial, or it&#39;s what I call a money dial.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, number one is eating out or dining. Number two is travel. Number three is health and wellness. Number four is my money dial, convenience. And then there&#39;s a variety of others.</p><p> So, the second question is, Barry, if you could quadruple the amount you spend on dining, what would it look and feel like for you?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That would be a terrifying number.</p><p> SETHI: Tell me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, my wife and I also really like cooking, so we cook at home, we just redid a kitchen, we have this lovely chef&#39;s kitchen. So, I try and balance having fun and playing some music, cracking a bottle of wine and working on a recipe. That&#39;s a lot of fun. As is, you know, we just had an insane lunch at the Restoration Hardware.</p><p> SETHI: I love that place.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Just exorbitant. But, you know, as an occasion, I&#39;m like, don&#39;t even think about it. Just let&#39;s order what we want and not even think twice.</p><p> SETHI: So, you are in an unusual position because you, I&#39;m guessing, you&#39;re not really price sensitive about eating out.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, you and I have previously discussed pain points in spending. Like for me it&#39;s clothes because everything is an expensive bib eventually.</p><p> （笑声）</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And look I&#39;m wearing nice pants.</p><p> SETHI: I told Barry, my wife&#39;s a personal stylist, I said Barry let&#39;s do this.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> I mean I&#39;m wearing nice clothes today, but I can rationalize dropping a couple hundred bucks on a meal without even thinking twice about it. But you walk into certain stores, 800 bucks for a pair of shoes, 400 bucks for a shirt, it&#39;s a little more challenging because I&#39;m hard on everything. I know that the shirt will eventually have spaghetti stains on it and the sneakers the shoes will be destroyed, but that&#39;s my pain point.</p><p> SETHI: Okay.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not cars. It&#39;s not watches. It&#39;s not food.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s clothes.</p><p> SETHI: So, people listening, they&#39;re saying okay I eat I like to eat out or I like to travel and the second question when I ask, what would it look like if you could quadruple your spending? People smile because they go, wow, they never thought of it, most people when it comes to food. They give me the same answer, they go, wow, I probably have to watch what I eat because I&#39;d be eating up four times a week and I go…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not bigger portions. It&#39;s going to nicer places.</p><p> SETHI: That&#39;s right. So, most of us think linearly, I go, what? Are you going to go to Chipotle four times a week?</p><p> （笑声）</p><p> SETHI: Might you go to a different caliber?</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: And this is where it becomes really fascinating, a rich life is not simply more frequency, a money dial turned all the way up could be eating at a beautiful Michelin-starred restaurant for lunch, it could be going — if you turn it all the way up, you might go to Italy with your loved one, go to a farmers&#39; market with a chef and make the food together.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That sounds like fun.</p><p> SETHI: So, the point of a money dial and the point of a rich life is to really get specific about What it would look like to turn it up then you will understand what I mean when I say I want you to spend extravagantly on the things you love as long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don&#39;t.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And that&#39;s a really fascinating aspect to your writings and to the show because People seem to be somewhat agnostic about their spending habits regardless of whether it&#39;s important or not.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And you know if you get — if you could get people to focus on oh, you want this big expensive trip or this nice car or whatever it happens to be, well to get there you just have to stop throwing money away on junk, you&#39;re about halfway there.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What&#39;s the pushback to that from clients? From people?</p><p> SETHI: Most people have simply been taught that they should cut back a little bit on everything. What a demoralizing philosophy Oh, I should cut back 5 percent on asparagus 5 percent on my car 5 percent on rent 5 percent on cable, it&#39;s like that is so ineffective, that&#39;s why there are so many folks out there who berate people about buying a…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A spending scold.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: if you&#39;re one latte away from your retirement being messed up you got bigger …</p><p> SETHI: Bigger problems.</p><p> And truthfully a coffee a day is not going to change your financial life in any material way but there are certain five or ten big things that make a huge difference so what I encourage you …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s go through those.</p><p> SETHI: All right, what I tell people is stop asking three-dollar questions, start asking $30,000 questions, those would be am I automating my savings and investments? Have I made rules for myself such that if I&#39;m saving 5 percent this year, I&#39;m going to increase it by 1 percent per year, that right there if you do that for your savings and investment is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than all the coffee you&#39;ll ever buy. Am I paid well? Have I learned the skills of negotiating my salary? Have I managed my asset allocation and my investment fees?</p><p> If you do these few things, you&#39;ll be light years ahead of agonizing over the price of broccoli.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。 It&#39;s whenever I read the spending scolds, they always have half the story. Never buy a sports car, never buy a sailboat, never buy a…</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s always no, no, no.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But the right way to say that is never buy a sports car if you can&#39;t afford a sports car.</p><p> SETHI: Correct.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But if you can afford it, go buy whatever the hell you want. And that focusing on the spending but ignoring the hey, is this a rational expenditure for someone who is earning enough to pay for that vacation, that house, that car, why not?</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s a very simple puritanical view that people in personal finance espouse, which is it&#39;s really easy to tell people no to everything. A blanket no, but it&#39;s much harder.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s lazy.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, it&#39;s intellectually lazy, but I think it&#39;s much more fascinating and nuanced to show people you can actually spend more on the things you love. For example, I just posted a picture of my car. I&#39;m not into cars, not at this phase of life, and I know you are super into it, so this is interesting. I posted my car, it&#39;s an old, of course it&#39;s a Honda Accord, all right?</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s a very reasonable —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We had a Honda Accord Cross Tour, probably the best car I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s fantastic.</p><p> So, I could go buy any car, but to me, it&#39;s great. I hardly drive, I have it, it&#39;s fine. One day, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get a much nicer car. And so, I posted this just to show people, look, this isn&#39;t my thing, it&#39;s where I cut costs mercilessly but when I travel, I love hotels, I love clothes those are the things that are important to me and so I want people to actually have this highly dichotomous way of spending, you spend extravagantly on certain things…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A barbell.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, a barbell and then you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don&#39;t.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I really like that concept. So, speaking of staying within your spending limits, if you&#39;re making 70 grand a year, maybe a $4,000 handbag isn&#39;t the best use of your money.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s very likely although if they tell me, hey I pay 18 percent of gross for my rent. I would go, cool, what are you doing with the rest? They go, I love a bag. I go, how long is it going to take you to save? They go, I know my numbers, 14 months. Fantastic, but I will say you know we want to be reasonable the fact of the matter is 90 plus percent of people do not know their basic numbers.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What are your thoughts on the early retirement fire movement?</p><p> SETHI: I like any movement that gets Americans to think about increasing their savings rate. I love that. I love a movement that gets people to be goal oriented. I love that.</p><p> However, it quickly crosses over into obsession over pure metrics and truthfully accumulating money is never the goal. That is living in the spreadsheet.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m glad, I&#39;m glad you said that, I remember reading a blog post by someone who was in that space, and they were stressing because they had a houseguest who was taking a long hot shower.</p><p> SETHI: Come on.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I swear this is true, and the long hot shower was going to be expensive and it&#39;s like again if a hot shower, the cost of that is too much, what are you going to do when you&#39;re old if you&#39;re retired in your prime living earning spending years, it just makes no sense.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s — that&#39;s when you&#39;ve gone too far, imagine you have a pair of eyeglasses. The primary money lens that we use in this country is cost we go to the store. We look at the cost.我得到它。</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The wrong measure.</p><p> SETHI: There are so many other lenses, so for something like black pepper, which I don&#39;t really care about I&#39;ll use cost fine, but for other things like a pair of shoes which I am going to keep for seven years or taking my parents out to a really nice restaurant, I&#39;m going to use different lenses, so there are lenses like security and safety, delight, results. That&#39;s why somebody might hire a personal trainer instead of doing it on YouTube. Even just luxury. So, what I want is for people like a symphony, you got to be able to have different instruments, not only the instrument of cost. And that&#39;s where I think people go wrong.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really fascinating.</p><p> I&#39;ve always thought of you as like a financial advisor, but on the show, It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re a therapist/counselor. Each of these vignettes are like interventions.</p><p> （笑声）</p><p> RITHOLTZ: How do you think of this? Am I mis-describing you? How do you think of your own work? What&#39;s your job title?</p><p> SETHI: Well, you can call me what you want. I mean, I get judged by the results of the people I work with, which I love. I think that money is so much more than just what&#39;s on the page. And ultimately, through the show and through my podcast, I&#39;ve become much more interested in the interpersonal dynamics. Couples, even individuals, they know that they should probably save more. They know that they should probably pay off debt. Why aren&#39;t they? And that to me is where we begin to peel the onion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s more counseling than it is financial advice. And on the show, I&#39;ve seen some themes come up over and over again. So first, none of these people, they don&#39;t track their spending, there&#39;s no budget, there&#39;s not even the mental buckets of, I&#39;m going to spend this much on entertainment and this much on rent. It just is a fire hose coming in and a fire hose going out.</p><p> SETHI: That&#39;s very astute. I think that the way most people think about money is purely reactive and purely transactional. So, it goes like this. Our printer broke down. Let&#39;s buy a new printer. Our kids need soccer cleats. Let&#39;s go buy soccer cleats. Oh my gosh, we got our credit card bill. I guess we spent that much on sprinklers at Home Depot. That&#39;s basically the next 40 years of life and that&#39;s true.这是真的。 And so, I have a lot of compassion because we&#39;ve all done that in some way. It could be fitness. It could be relationships It could be anything.</p><p> You and I understand that you should probably have certain mental buckets and you should probably go on offense instead of defense and we get that after you understand this stuff, it&#39;s not that hard. If you don&#39;t even know, for example, how to decide if you can afford your car, then that is really where we&#39;re starting.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Or your house people were living in houses with HOA fees and repair costs that they seemingly never thought of.</p><p> SETHI: Well, this is the number one thing You know when I when I talk to folks the number one and number two area, they overspend on number one is their house because they have no sense of, they don&#39;t even know that 28 percent rule, they don&#39;t know 28 36. That&#39;s very technical and the second area they overspend on is their car. Now why, what is in common with both of those? First, they&#39;ve gotten more expensive recently yes, but two, there are gigantic phantom costs with each of those.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: When I show people for example that if you take a mortgage, you might as well just add on 50 percent to that mortgage to account for taxes, interest, maintenance, opportunity costs they are shocked they can&#39;t believe it. In fact, when I go further and tell them that it&#39;s actually been a better decision for me to rent than to own, It&#39;s like somebody&#39;s telling them the sky is green.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, the American dream has been you know, you find your little place, you buy it you own it. No one could raise your rent. You can paint the walls any color.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and you&#39;re not throwing money away on rent, funny you never say that when you go out to a restaurant, you&#39;re throwing money away in a restaurant and then they go, oh, you&#39;re paying your landlord&#39;s mortgage. I go, are you concerned about paying your sushi restaurant owner&#39;s mortgage? No, it&#39;s a bunch of almost religious aphorisms, they lack any substance and so we simply meaninglessly repeat these phrases. I don&#39;t want to throw rent away. Easier than teaching opportunity cost and doing a buy versus rent calculation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, let&#39;s talk about a couple of other things on the show that I was fascinated by.</p><p> Reckless spending is kind of a theme. We mentioned the $4,000 handbag for somebody who really…</p><p> SETHI: Who could not afford it.正确的？</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Or the guy who was spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars each month on video games. I mean one video game should keep you busy for a month not dozens, that was sort of a …</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: An obsession.</p><p> SETHI: So that that&#39;s really interesting, when I heard that, I really want everyone watching “How to Get Rich” to notice my reaction. When people — first of all, it is extremely intimate for people to admit all their financials to anyone, and I had all of their financials.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I saw this — by the way you walk through, here&#39;s their credit card spending, here&#39;s what&#39;s in their savings account, one of the people who&#39;s spending a ton of money literally had five dollars and change in their savings account.</p><p> SETHI: Until now you&#39;ve never been able to actually see inside people&#39;s …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s pretty horrifying.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s fascinating to me. It&#39;s like a microscope You know, they see a spreadsheet to me when I look at someone&#39;s money, I see a family trip to Disneyland or I see a beautiful outfit or I see early retirement, and that&#39;s what I wanted to shift into.</p><p> So, when people invite me into their homes and they open up their finances to me. They are very brittle, they&#39;re expecting me to come down like a pile of bricks and say you&#39;re doing it all wrong and a lot of times I just go, that&#39;s really interesting. Why&#39;d you do that? What do you love about video games, and you can see them visibly loosen up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re very genteel with these people, there&#39;s no finger wagging, there&#39;s no scolding, and you very gently nudge them to that you give them I forgot which woman it was, Maybe it was the gymnast, you gave her three choices choice a, do nothing.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Choice B, do something little.</p><p> Choice C, do something large. And nobody wants to do nothing.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, well …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: They have agency they&#39;re saying well, I&#39;m not going to do A, so now it&#39;s their decision.</p><p> SETHI: Correct? So, there&#39;s a lot of psychology into play.</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p> SETHI: And if you&#39;re listening and for example, you&#39;ve had a spouse maybe who&#39;s just seemingly not interested in money or your kids or anyone around you where you&#39;re or you can even bring yourself sometimes to figure out how to spend money more meaningfully, a lot of us think that the solution is found in a spreadsheet and it&#39;s not.</p><p> For every single person on the show and on my podcast, there is something much deeper going on and it&#39;s easy. In fact, it&#39;s lazy to throw a bunch of numbers, here&#39;s a compound interest chart. That&#39;s not going to change anybody&#39;s life.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: We&#39;ve all seen it; we all know what it says. But to understand, for example, what did your parents say around the dinner table? And you will always hear people repeating phrases like, we can&#39;t afford it, money doesn&#39;t grow on trees. Now imagine hearing that 10,000 times growing up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You left the door open again, must I pay to heat Eva Lane?</p><p> SETHI: Exactly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I heard that growing up constantly.</p><p> SETHI: Bingo. And so, a lot of the folks, whether it be on the show or on my podcast, they&#39;ll do very well. They may get a great job, accumulate money, and they can afford any lunch, they can afford a trip, but some of them agonize over it.为什么？</p><p> They think, oh, I&#39;m bad, I feel guilty buying this business class trip, but really it often traces back to what they heard from their parents.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. Let&#39;s talk about married couples that don&#39;t have a joint checking account. Two different couples with, that&#39;s unfathomable.</p><p> SETHI: Really? That surprises you?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Shocking, shocking. Because I remember when I first got married, I&#39;m married 30 years already, we had separate checking accounts and my wife is like, why do you need to hide your money from me?</p><p> I&#39;m not hiding, first of all, she was making more than me and second, I&#39;m not hiding, I have this account, you have that account, we merged everything and never looked back.</p><p> By the way, she takes care of the bills because when we were younger, when the lights went out, that&#39;s how I knew it was time to pay the electric bill.</p><p> （笑声）</p><p> SETHI: First of all, congratulations on 30 years, that&#39;s amazing. That&#39;s the ultimate part of a rich life. I&#39;m not surprised that so many couples don&#39;t have joint accounts, but I&#39;ll tell you something that might surprise you. I actually don&#39;t have a problem if couples have separate accounts, here&#39;s what&#39;s really going on the people that get into financial trouble in relationships tend to have separate accounts, but it&#39;s not the separate accounts that cause the problem, it&#39;s the fact that they simply slid into this relationship as individuals and never sat down and discussed, how do we want our money to go?</p><p> So, if they sit down and they go, you know what? I think we prefer to have separate accounts. We can combine as necessary. I say fantastic, but most people with separate accounts never had that conversation and that is the plan.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not just the separate accounts, It&#39;s the separate spending and separate priorities where how are we going to save if you&#39;re buying X or Y or Z?</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We&#39;ll never get out of debt. We&#39;ll never buy that house, which was one of the couples&#39; motivation.</p><p> SETHI: This is very common.</p><p> So, you know, on the podcast, I only speak to couples. And you&#39;ll get these patterns. One is an over spender; one is an under spender. I had a particularly fascinating couple; I think it was around episode 20. He wrote me in all caps, he said, Ramit, please help. My wife of 21 years is about to divorce me because I&#39;m too cheap.</p><p> I was like, click, so I immediately click and respond to him. I brought him on the show with his wife. I had reviewed all their finances and she was angry, in fact almost checked out. And she said, I don&#39;t understand why after 20 years of marriage, he doesn&#39;t trust me, our yard is the only unlandscaped yard. She said, he asked me to find mattresses for our two girls, I spent a week creating a spreadsheet. And he said, that&#39;s too expensive, the mattresses were something like 500 bucks. Their net worth, Barry, can you guess?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Five million dollars.</p><p> SETHI: It was around 13 million dollars.</p><p> And so, when you hear that —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, 500 bucks for a mattress is just irrelevant.</p><p> SETHI: It&#39;s meaningless. It would be easy to simply say, this guy&#39;s nuts, why don&#39;t you loosen up?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: He&#39;s got issues for sure.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and that&#39;s where I start. That&#39;s where I go, let&#39;s talk about it. Non-judgmentally, but let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s going on. Remember, she was about to divorce him. And so, you can listen to the episode, episode 20, and you can hear how that conversation evolves. It&#39;s much deeper than math.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, this raises a really interesting question, people reveal very embarrassing challenging financial habits, how did you get these folks to come clean on them?</p><p> SETHI: On the show…</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p> SETHI: We have casting so casting went out and found particularly interesting situations and I gave a lot of guidance as to what type of people are especially interesting, on my podcast that was the hardest thing of all is to get people to open up all of their financials.</p><p> Not only have we been able to do that, now we have them on video just like on the show. That&#39;s very intimate. I&#39;m not sure I would go on a show like that.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: What I&#39;ve learned about the psychology of people appearing on this is you have to understand that most people feel truly lost when it comes to money. They don&#39;t know who to trust. They don&#39;t even know the difference between the word financial advisor and 401k like those two, they&#39;re in different universes to us but to somebody walking on the street, those words are all jumbled up into the personal finance or confusing money cloud, and so when they hear somebody who comes and says like, hey, I&#39;m not going to judge you if you like a purse, I&#39;m not going to judge you if you like to eat out, fine, I like a couple nice things myself, that&#39;s cool, let&#39;s talk about what your rich life is and how we can use your money to get there.</p><p> They are willing to open up anything if they know that they can trust me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really intriguing. So, let&#39;s — we were talking earlier about budgeting and you know credit scores and things like that.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk a little bit about people who have more money than they know what to do with because they&#39;ve spent their whole life working and saving and investing and suddenly, they have a hard time pivoting to, hey I could take that trip, I could buy that sailboat, I could do what I want. what sort of advice do you give to these folks to allow them to be more comfortable to make that transition?</p><p> SETHI: This is my favorite topic, Barry, because nobody really talks about it and it&#39;s very politically incorrect.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We talk about this in the office all the time it comes up constantly partly because we have a lot of wealthy clients, but also partly because we&#39;re big believers in as you suggest, you have to use money as a tool to live your richest life, what advice do you give these folks?</p><p> SETHI: One way to think about it is you really have your prime spending years between the ages of 40 to 60, so think about that before 40 most people don&#39;t really have money after 60 there may be health issues whether it be with yourself or somebody in your family that you have to take care of, whatever, things happen.</p><p> So, if you accept the idea that your prime spending years are between 40 to 60, what does that mean for you? And suddenly, traveling to certain places becomes an urgency. Eating at a certain restaurant you&#39;ve always wanted to becomes an urgency. This requires a change. One, the idea of shifting from accumulation to de-accumulation is really hard. That&#39;s why, you know, when people retire, they start freaking out because they&#39;re not getting the income even though the interest pays more than they would have ever made.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, they&#39;re not getting the income and they have a lot more hours in the day to go out and spend money.</p><p> SETHI: Exactly. The second thing is people often make this jump they go, well, if I go eat at that restaurant, I don&#39;t want to have to become that rich guy who&#39;s eating there. I go, you think you&#39;re going to trip and fall and eat at a Michelin starred restaurant every single night? It&#39;s like, get real, I trust myself enough to know that I can drive a car twice and not have to buy ten of them. I trust myself enough to know Barry&#39;s going, well, I don&#39;t know about that. He goes, have you been in my Porsche?</p><p> （笑声）</p><p> SETHI: Okay, maybe not. I trust myself enough to know that I can eat at a nice restaurant for an anniversary and say wow I really love that or that wasn&#39;t my thing, but it was cool and not have to do it every night.</p><p> Many of us have simply never built the skill and it is a skill of spending money, so we&#39;ve earned it, we&#39;ve managed it, but we never actually built a skill of spending it meaningfully and that&#39;s why we have to start almost like we&#39;re building a new muscle.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: How do you address the guilt that some people feel when they say I&#39;m spending my kids&#39; inheritance?</p><p> SETHI: I don&#39;t — first of all, it&#39;s lazy for people when I ask them, what&#39;s your rich life? They go, you know what? I&#39;m so simple. I&#39;m just a simple person. I really want to just provide for my kids.</p><p> I go, that sucks, that&#39;s a boring answer, and that&#39;s intellectually lazy.</p><p>里索尔兹：（笑声）</p><p> SETHI: So you worked your entire life. Oh and you never modeled building good spending habits.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: You literally accumulated it like Scrooge McDuck and you&#39;re handing it over to your kids without any modeling? No, that&#39;s actually unacceptable to me. I told my parents, my parents had very modest incomes growing up and we told my mom and dad I sat down with them because they were nervous about spending money because they had gone through the same thing.</p><p> And I said, let&#39;s look at the numbers I mean it very simple for them and I said, mom and dad, what are you going to do with this money if you don&#39;t start spending it? And they&#39;d never really thought about they go, we&#39;ll give it to the kids. I go, we don&#39;t want one cent, you taught us how to be educated you taught us good values, we want you to spend every last cent and maybe even more. And so, I put them on a travel budget, and I said you have to spend this much every single month, in fact they&#39;re abroad right now, which I&#39;m so happy about.</p><p> The guilt of not leaving money for your kids really is a deeply emotional response. You want to leave them money? Please do, leave them some, but more importantly leave them a model of your spending money on the things that matter to you.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do you get the kids involved? Do you get the whole family involved when you&#39;re talking with a wealthy family that&#39;s having some issues with figuring out how to live their rich life?</p><p> SETHI: The first thing I do is work with the parents. Parents are obsessed with the question about should I give them an allowance? Should I not?</p><p> I go, listen, that&#39;s like someone saying I want to meet the person of my dreams. What kind of shoelaces should I wear? I go it&#39;s irrelevant, an allowance is not the primary issue. What I ask him is how do you talk about money at home, and they go, we don&#39;t talk about it. I go, why not? They go, because our parents never talked about it. I go, okay, we&#39;re going to start talking about it.</p><p> Second, do you ever get excited about it? Most people have never conceived that they can get excited about money, they see it as something negative something to protect their children from and so I suggest some gentle things, if their kid is very young. I say you know bring them over on your lap and say, you know mommy&#39;s going to log into the credit card, this is what allows us to buy the food that we eat can you help me push the button and then as they get older, empower them to make decisions about a vacation or a dinner out.</p><p> It&#39;s not about an allowance, you can give them an allowance or not that&#39;s not the point, the point is to model healthy relationship with money.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really, really interesting, we in the office we set up so we&#39;ve had a robo advisor internally for six seven years already and we advise parents to set up small accounts for their kids, so they start investing at eight, twelve …</p><p> SETHI: Love it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Fourteen years old, it doesn&#39;t have to be a lot of money but they get to watch it grow.</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And it&#39;s really like oh this is something that I could continue to do on my own.</p><p> SETHI: And they talk about it.</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p> SETHI: I had another fascinating couple they&#39;d been dating for a year, they&#39;re in their late 30s he had started a business and he was paying himself $2,000 a month. She was making $200,000 per month.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A month?</p><p> SETHI: She was making 100 times what he makes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, she&#39;s making $2.5 million. That&#39;s a nice income.</p><p> SETHI: Very nice in her late 30s. She had more money than she would ever need and they struggled. The reason they came to me was it was about who&#39;s going to pay the check for dinner. So, believe it or not, this is a real deal. So, I took the call and what became very clear was I asked her, when did you first learn about investing? And you know what she said, Barry? She said, age five. Her parents started talking about compound interest. Age five, which is what wealthy families tend to do. Then I asked him, when did you learn about investing? He goes, I started reading your book about two weeks ago.</p><p> So, imagine a guy who has a 30-year deficit on learning about a concept as important as compound interest. We can&#39;t expect everybody to have the same knowledge. We all start at different parts in life. For me, physical fitness, I wish I learned how to deadlift when I was 16, I didn&#39;t. But if you can give your kids an advantage, and certainly your partner, it is to talk about money regularly and positively.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, before we get to our favorite questions, a quick curve ball question. Got to ask, how did the Netflix deal come about? Did they reach out to you? Did you reach out to them? Was there a third-party intermediary? How do you suddenly get a Netflix series?</p><p> SETHI: They reached out to me. I remember where I was, they emailed me and it said, would you be interested in sitting down for a meeting and also should we communicate through you, or do you have representation?</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: Two things happened to me. First off, I didn&#39;t believe it was from them so I went up to the “from” and it said “@netflix.com.” I was like, wait a second.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, you can fake that though, that&#39;s easy enough.</p><p> SETHI: So, I was like, this is crazy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: If you hit reply, that&#39;s when you know it&#39;s real.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, that&#39;s a good tip. Well, I&#39;m glad it worked out. The second thing that occurred to me was, I don&#39;t even know what they meant by representation. I&#39;m not a Hollywood guy.</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;ve been running my business for 20 years on the internet.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re New York based, right?</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and then LA now.</p><p> But I didn&#39;t even know, so I had to learn, how do you find an entertainment lawyer? I literally went on Google and searched entertainment lawyer, and I had to learn the entire business, which I&#39;m just, just, just starting to grasp. It was a totally fascinating journey and they had been wanting to do a money show. In fact, every network has been wanting to…</p><p>里索尔兹：对。</p><p> SETHI: But money&#39;s really hard on TV. It&#39;s boring, it&#39;s often very depressing. And so, I told them point blank, I said, “Look, I&#39;m interested, but I want to do it my way. “I do not want to berate some couple, for how much they spend on Reese&#39;s Pieces cups. And they said, no, no, no, we want you to do it your way. They gave me broad creative control.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s great.</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;m very thankful.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is there going to be a second season?</p><p> SETHI: We will see.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I mean, given that it&#39;s top 10 trending, you got to think it&#39;s interesting. What was the experience like putting this together? It&#39;s obviously, it&#39;s not writing, it&#39;s not podcasting, it&#39;s very different. You&#39;re pretty telegenic. Did you did you find the transition to video challenging at all?</p><p> SETHI: Definitely Well, you know, I got a lot of nice comments from people around the world and I thought to myself, wow so all it takes for me to look good is to throw up a multi-million-dollar crew with the best cameras in the world and makeup and I said, wow. Okay, I&#39;ll take it I&#39;ll take whatever it takes, you know, what was challenging most of all was the intimacy of going into people&#39;s houses.</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p> SETHI: like in the first scene you see me visiting Matt and Amani. I meet their family their children, that is as intimate as it gets to be in someone&#39;s living room talking about money.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Looking at their — looking literally at their…</p><p> SETHI: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Their statements, their credit card spending.</p><p> SETHI: And watching fights happen in front of me, which I do love a good fight I mean, I love reality TV myself, but you have to remember …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh no, it gets uncomfortable.</p><p> SETHI: Yes, and it should, right? Money is uncomfortable.</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p> SETHI: And that&#39;s okay, but all this time there&#39;s a tight camera on my face and I&#39;m thinking oh my — like is this really happening so to me that&#39;s what is the magic of the show is, I don&#39;t know anything about them all I know is their name and their financials, same as you and together we go and discover what&#39;s going on.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, it&#39;s definitely entertaining, we&#39;ll blow through five questions really quickly starting with other than “How to Get Rich” what else are you streaming on Netflix or anything else.</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;m watching “Indian Matchmaking” just because I love it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Come on.</p><p> SETHI: My parents had an arranged marriage you know I have to watch this. It&#39;s you know, it hits home. And on the podcast side there&#39;s a couple, one is there&#39;s an interesting podcast about Rolls-Royce and it&#39;s called “Ghost Stories” it&#39;s about their Ghost and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a little bit like markety but I just love craftsmanship, I love design, so I get to hear from the designers.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And you&#39;re not sporting a watch, I&#39;m surprised, I figure that you&#39;re a clothes guy.</p><p> SETHI: I&#39;m a hotel guy and clothes and convenience, like personal training, things like that. Watches.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Doesn&#39;t do anything for you.</p><p> SETHI: Nah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;ll tell you a funny story about that later.</p><p> Second question, who are your mentors? Who helped shape your career?</p><p> SETHI: BJ Fogg, one of my professors at Stanford. I learned from him at the Persuasive Technology Lab. He&#39;s still a close friend of mine. Jay Abraham taught me a lot about putting my customers and clients at the center of my world. Those two were very influential and continue to be.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now?</p><p> SETHI: One of my favorites is “The Color of Law.” That&#39;s a book about redlining. It&#39;s about race and real estate in this country. Most people have no idea that real estate is deeply, deeply built around race. It&#39;s racist. It&#39;s a racist institution in our country.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And has been for a long, long time.</p><p> SETHI: For decades. It is built that way.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do you think people really don&#39;t know that?</p><p> SETHI: They do not know.不。</p><p> No, no like 100 percent …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The inner cities and slums and the highways that will cleave the lower-income part of the town right in half.</p><p> SETHI: No, Barry, they have no idea.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right your face.</p><p> SETHI: No, you can&#39;t miss it unless you&#39;ve been radicalized to ignore it so no they do not know and they don&#39;t want to know, and that&#39;s why every time I talk about books I talk about this book “The Color Of Law” it is staggering to learn what happened in our country.</p><p> And then I&#39;m reading a book right now called “Unreasonable Hospitality” the manager of 11 Madison Park. Wow, really interesting how they took that restaurant to be …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Top-rated Michelin star-rated.</p><p> SETHI: I just love a good hospitality story.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Last two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in either financial counseling or investing?</p><p> SETHI: Gosh, I would say first off talk to people who are in the industry and were in the industry and left, talk to at least 15 people and find out what&#39;s their lifestyle like, do they get to travel do they enjoy it what do they like what are they not like? Find out if it&#39;s for you and then the second thing I would say is if you are interested in financial counseling, therapy, et cetera, you&#39;re going to learn the technical skills but the skill that I think is underrepresented when it comes to money is understanding people. So psychology is absolutely critical and that will set you apart.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Our final question, what do you know about the world of advice and financial planning and counseling that you wish you knew 20 years or so ago when you were first getting started?</p><p> SETHI: Education alone is not the answer.</p><p> I often get people saying, “Ramit, we should teach your book in high school.” and I actually disagree. Education alone doesn&#39;t solve the problems we have, it helps, but there are structural changes that need to be made such as building more housing, there are also ways of communicating about money which is why I did this Netflix show and my podcast to show people that money can actually be fun and joyful and not simply something that you need to do like flossing your teeth.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It doesn&#39;t have to be a drag.</p><p> Tell people where they can find you, your website the name of the show and the book and everything else.</p><p> SETHI: The name of the show on Netflix is “How to Get Rich” My suggestion is watch the first three minutes and notice the differences in how we talk about money.</p><p> My podcast where I speak to couples from all over the economic spectrum is “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” and my book is also called “I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Ramit, thank you so much for coming in today.
