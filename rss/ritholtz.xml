href="https://behaviorgap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">行为差距</a>”。 Vanguard 的<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2019/10/mib-vanguards-fran-kinniry-on-investors-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fran Kinnery</a>将这种治疗方法描述为“ <a href="https://advisors.vanguard.com/advisors-alpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advisors Alpha</a> ”。无论你选择什么措辞，投资者的业绩与他们持有的资产之间持续存在的差距都会严重拖累回报。</p><p>我提到这一点是为了防止您错过晨星报告“<em><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/lp/mind-the-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">注意差距：美国投资者回报报告</a></em>”的主题；它在三伏天悄悄溜过。我之所以注意到它是因为<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47b49fd1-48fb-4855-9c34-d32348c6df37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">罗宾·威格尔斯沃思</a>上周强调了它。 <sup>1</sup></p><p>执行摘要让您了解了时间问题：</p><blockquote><p> “投资者实际体验到的回报与报告的总回报之间持续存在的差距，使得现金流时机与投资成本和税收效率一起成为可能影响投资者最终结果的最重要因素之一。</p><p>在本报告中，我们深入研究了这些细微差别，并探讨了现金流时间、回报顺序和资产规模的差异如何影响这一差距。此外，我们的研究还提供了一些关于投资者如何避免这些差距并获得更多基金持有总回报的经验教训。”</p></blockquote><p>晨星公司的主要观察结果是：在最近10年期间（2013-22年），基金投资者每年落后于他们所拥有的基金1.7%。考虑到这些基金的平均年回报率为 7.7%，年度缺口为 22%。</p><p>更糟糕的是，这种滞后随着时间的推移而加剧。考虑<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/08/mind-the-gap/#more-319085">下面的图表</a>（来自摩根大通的<a class="gtrackexternal" href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/">市场季度指南）</a> ； 10年或20年的影响是巨大的，而且研究的时间段越长，差距就越大。 <sup>2</sup></p><p>不同的研究将这种滞后归咎于不同的来源。晨星指出时机不佳； Vanguard 认为这是缺乏专业规划；卡尔·理查兹说这都是行为。神经学家兼投资者比尔·伯恩斯坦 (Bill Bernstein) 更进一步，在我们的<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2021/03/transcript-william-j-bernstein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">边缘系统</a>中找到了进化认知的根源：</p><blockquote><p> “只要你在金融领域取得成功，你就能在金融领域取得成功，只要你能够抑制边缘系统，即你的系统一，这是我们拥有的快速变化的情感系统。如果你不能抑制住这一点，你可能会穷死……”</p></blockquote><p>就像生活中的许多事情一样，更令人满意的答案是，原因是微妙而复杂的，许多相互关联的因素结合在一起导致了不良结果。</p><p>在长周末花一些时间来阅读。您的作品集将会感谢您...</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>来源</em>：<br

万亿美元，真是个懒鬼。</p><p>我发现这次谈话绝对是一堂大师课，讲述了如何思考投资风险，如何思考回报从何而来，什么样的行为问题会导致不良结果，以及我们在这次谈话中学到的所有常见知识距离先锋集团的成功已经有好几年了。</p><p>很少有人比先锋首席信息官更能了解投资领域的动态，无论是机构投资还是零售投资。格雷格·戴维斯做得非常出色。我认为这是一次非常有趣的谈话。我想你也会的。</p><p>话不多说，下面是我对 Vanguard 首席信息官 Greg Davis 的采访。</p><p>格雷格·戴维斯，欢迎来到彭博社。</p><p>格雷格·戴维斯，先锋集团首席投资官：谢谢，巴里。很高兴和你在一起。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：很高兴有你。</p><p>那么让我们来谈谈你的背景吧，这很有趣。本科生，您将获得宾夕法尼亚州立大学的保险学士学位。是什么引发了对保险的兴趣？</p><p>戴维斯：说来话长，但我最初是学工程学的。到了学校，我意识到我不太擅长机械制图，而机械制图是航空航天工程课程的重要组成部分。所以我开始寻找其他机会，主要是商业领域的机会。</p><p>因此，开始研究金融、房地产和保险领域的机会。宾夕法尼亚州立大学是少数几所真正设有保险专业的学校之一。为了在大学毕业后真正获得有酬就业的目标，我想，嘿，拥有一些独特的背景会有所帮助。</p><p>结果很成功，并获得了来自多家不同保险公司的多份工作机会。在我决定回到学校攻读 MBA 之前，我有机会担任几年的承销商。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：您是如何在 20 世纪 90 年代加入美林证券的？</p><p>戴维斯：所以我最终完成了沃顿商学院的课程。夏天我在花旗银行证券公司实习，负责固定收益销售和交易。在街对面有几个不同的工作机会。但我去美林的原因是因为他们有独特的全球债务轮换计划，允许你在固定收益、销售和交易等几个不同的业务部门之间轮换。我知道我想从事交易。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你当时在市中心吗？世界……</p><p>戴维斯：世界金融中心。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：顺便说一句，这可能是最令人惊奇的交易台。我去过那里几次。在 20 世纪 90 年代，当你走进股票市场时，你会被一堵声音和能量墙击中。我在其他地方从未见过或经历过类似的事情。</p><p>戴维斯：固定收益楼层的规模相同，只是位于不同的楼层，但环境类型也相似。但这是研究生毕业后开始职业生涯的一个非常有趣的地方。但这段经历被缩短了，因为就在我上课的时候，正值亚洲金融危机的尾声，俄罗斯卢布贬值</p><p>里索兹：97 还是 98？</p><p>戴维斯：98年。我从98年9月开始，那发生在97年。但亚洲金融危机、俄罗斯卢布贬值，以及长期资本管理的失败。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>戴维斯：因此，街对面发生了很多裁员方面的变化，我们的计划被缩短，最终被安排在非贸易职位，并决定寻找外面的其他机会，并遇到了这个伟大的机会24 年前有机会在先锋集团从事交易。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么我们来谈谈这个吧。您的简历解释了您是如何被招募到先锋集团的。我认为这是一个非常有趣的故事。告诉我们一些是什么让您来到先锋集团的。</p><p>戴维斯：所以这很有趣，因为我非常热衷于留在纽约。我建立了很多关系，并在纽约市找到了另一份工作。但和我一起长大的最好的朋友之一实际上在先锋集团的人力资源部门工作。她说，“你应该下来和先锋集团的一些人谈谈。”</p><p>起初我有点不以为然，但她非常坚持。所以我下来，会见了我们的投资组合审查部门的负责人，该部门负责监督我们的外部经理，会见了我们的经纪业务负责人，然后会见了绑定索引的负责人，他当时是肯·沃尔珀特。我和他立刻就产生了联系。所以肯是我来到先锋集团的主要原因。 Vanguard 已经享有很高的声誉，当时我们的规模要小得多，但 Ken 拥有将新人引入团队、培养他们并随着时间的推移看到他们从事更大工作的记录。</p><p>作为这个行业相对较新的人，这就是我正在寻找的导师和老板。所以，肯最终成为我职业生涯中遇到过的最好的老板之一。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：稍后我们将讨论领导力和团队发展。这确实是一个令人着迷的话题，但您最终担任了 Vanguard 澳大利亚和亚太地区的总监以及该地区的首席信息官。请告诉我们一些 2000 年代的经历。我的意思是，90 年代是它自己独特的动物，但 2000 年代当然并不无聊。</p><p>戴维斯：不，所以我和我的家人搬到了澳大利亚墨尔本，我们的办公室就在那里。</p><p>无论是在职业还是个人方面，这都是一次美妙的经历，只是有机会在不同的国家工作，拥抱澳大利亚文化，但作为亚太地区的一部分，因为当时我们在香港设有办事处我们就是在那里开始我们的 ETF 业务的。</p><p>但这是一次巨大的经历，因为我从债券交易开始，进入投资组合管理并管理债券指数团队多年，然后我被要求承担这一职责，范围要广泛得多。</p><p>因此，我对债券指数的主题很深入，但现在我有机会领导一个股票指数小组、整个固定收益团队、我们的投资策略团队，该团队为我们的客户围绕投资组合构建进行研究，这些类型的事物。</p><p>但另一个重要部分是有机会加入实际经营该业务的澳大利亚高管团队。因此，从更广泛的角度来看，我是一名投资人，但这是一个真正了解业务的机会，了解先锋澳大利亚如何在生态系统中运作，我们如何尝试营销我们的产品和服务，我们如何参与与监管机构、媒体、整个九个院子一起工作，然后也是董事会的一部分，所以从更广泛的角度来看，这种经历令人难以置信。</p><p>所以我珍惜​​在那里的每一分钟，不幸的是，或者幸运的是，这取决于你如何看待它，三到四年的任务最终只有 13 个月。但正如你提到的，我有一个很好的机会回来管理固定收益部门，但在澳大利亚的时光对我自己、我的妻子和孩子们来说都是美妙的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你知道，真正有趣的是每个人都倾向于从投资方面来考虑华尔街以及投资和金融。但商业方面确实很有趣。商业模式有无数种，看看人们如何运作它，这确实是一种教育，我认为很多刚从学校出来的人都没有考虑过这种教育，因为你会考虑性感的事情。 “嘿，我想做风险投资。我想做这个，我想做那个。”商业方面确实非常令人着迷，但有些被忽视了。</p><p>戴维斯：这是非常非常正确的。但这也是你在从事某项工作一段时间之前不一定会欣赏的事情之一。所以，如果你对我说，你知道，当我第一次从研究生院毕业时，你对我说，嘿，我希望你去商业领域，你知道，我会说，不，谢谢，我真的很想做交易和投资组合管理。但当你在职业生涯中达到某个阶段时，你会觉得，嘿，你学到了很多东西，你已经组建了一个团队，你正在寻找新的挑战和机会来拓展自己、成长和学习。这正是这个机会所提供的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以现在你最终得到了，你进入固定收益，然后你被提升为整个 Van 集团的首席投资官。带我们了解先锋首席信息官一天或一周的生活。</p><p>戴维斯：嗯，很多。我的意思是，有大量的会议，按照我的描述，巴里，这是一个混合体。它与客户相关，就像我们今天所做的那样。它也是管理 Vanguard、Vanguard 业务的高级团队的一部分，对吗？因此，从客户策略、营销角度，然后监督投资团队。所以各种风险会议，各种经济会议。因此，任何一天都可能略有不同，但随着时间的推移，它通常会捕获这些类别。因此，市场和业务中总是有很多事情发生，让我们非常忙碌。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：您在 Vanguard 工作已近 25 年了。</p><p>戴维斯：11 月 24 日。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以距离一个重要的里程碑还有一年的时间。</p><p>那个时期很大程度上涵盖了先锋集团从一个公认的成功但不是巨大的实体，直到我认为 2000 年代，尤其是金融危机，改变了人们对管理资产、指数、咨询与交易的看法，先锋集团和贝莱德一起，改变了人们对管理资产、指数、咨询与交易的看法。是其中最大的受益者之一。告诉我们一些你在这 24 年里经历过的事情，当公司发展壮大时，你确实在场，然后他们发现了另一个齿轮，然后爆炸了。</p><p>戴维斯：是的，你说得完全正确，巴里。我的意思是，市场对投资者投资方式的看法发生了很大变化，对吧？你是对的。所以你回想一下30年前，有很多人专注于个人证券选择，挑选个股。</p><p>现实情况是，我们知道这很难做到，也很难跑赢大盘。因此，人们大力推动以高度多元化、低成本的方式获得适当水平的资产配置。 ETF，即 ETF 包装器，允许人们以低廉的价格获得该风险敞口，并将其保存在经纪账户中。</p><p>因此，它确实为索引领域提供这些产品的人们提供了良好的推动力。从个股选择转向广泛的指数投资，先锋集团是最大的受益者之一。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：至少可以这么说。</p><p>因此，让我们讨论一下领导力以及如何培养船员以及识别和培养其他人的领导技能。</p><p>戴维斯：是的，巴里，这是一个很好的问题。我们试图关注的事情之一是，作为面试过程的一部分，始终尝试评估和衡量人们除了技术能力之外发展领导能力的意愿和兴趣。因此，当我们想到我们的投资专业人士时，显然他们必须拥有敏锐的技术。他们必须学习这些技能才能完成日常工作。</p><p>但如果他们也想成为交易部门的负责人并领导我们集团或更广泛的先锋集团内的主要职能，他们还必须真正善于识别人才、培养人才、维持真正牢固的关系、成为战略思想家，并且那种性质的东西。因此，我们有很多项目来帮助我们评估人们在领导力之旅中的进展情况。我们帮助人们一路走上领导力之旅，但评估过程也让我们能够找出人们可能存在的差距，以及需要有机会回去复习的地方。</p><p>因此，我们一直非常积极地参与我们的投资专业人士的整个过程。它得到了回报，它确实得到了回报，它帮助我们确保我们正在招聘合适的人才，它帮助我们留住人才。因为当你为一位伟大的老板工作时，你就会有动力留在那家公司。因为我们知道有时很难与老板建立牢固的联系，而且先锋集团拥有出色的领导者，我们感觉，嘿，我们有一些最酷的工作可供人们选择，你加上出色的领导力，我的意思是，这是我们组织长期成功的双赢公式。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这真的很有趣。</p><p>许多金融界人士表示，在这种环境下很难找到人才。先锋集团正在采取哪些措施来保持席位充足，并确保有源源不断的人才来到宾夕法尼亚州？</p><p>戴维斯：是的，所以我们非常积极地参与其中。具体来说，在我们的团队中，我们有投资管理发展计划，每年我们都会有一批暑期实习生以及刚刚完成本科学习的全职人员，他们通过轮换计划来到我们这里，让他们有机会接触对于股票、固定收益和风险的各个点以及我们的投资组合审查部门来说，这是人们探索和了解他们真正想做的事情的一个很好的切入点。</p><p>因此，我们刚刚有一名干部在本周早些时候开始了他们的最终安置。因此，有七个人涉足从风险到高收益交易再到投资级研究的各个领域。这是一个很好的人才管道。最棒的是，我们今天看到的人才比 20 年前吸引的人才要多得多。</p><p>因此，这些人今天所带来的意识水平、对市场的理解以及从 IT 和数据科学角度来看的技术技能都是相当惊人的。这确实是我们的管道。然后，如果出现人员流动，而我们的替补席上没有人准备好进入更大的席位，或者如果我们正在尝试建立新的能力，例如我们过去做过。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的令人印象深刻。</p><p>我们来谈谈先锋总市场指数。这已成为世界上最大的基金。管理如此规模且对先锋集团如此重要的基金需要什么？</p><p>戴维斯：我的意思是，这实际上是从人开始的。只是确保我们拥有令人难以置信的才华横溢的专业人士，他们真正致力于日常管理这些指数基金。从我们的角度来看，我们的项目经理同时也是交易员，因此他们日复一日地密切合作，确保总股票市场指数基金和我们所有其他股票指数基金最大限度地减少跟踪误差。</p><p>我们还努力确保在市场上进行交易时最大限度地降低交易成本。还要认识到贸易活动的税务影响。然后还寻求通过机会主义想法以及通过再平衡、公司行动、新问题和类似性质的事情来增加边际价值，试图蚕食边际费用率。但同样，是以高度、高度风险控制的方式。</p><p>最棒的是，我们拥有一支几十年来一直从事这方面工作的团队，他们在行业中是无与伦比的，因为他们致力于索引编制。你会发现很多公司的员工都是从索引开始，然后转向其他领域。在先锋集团，这是许多人的职业目的地，他们热爱自己工作的每一分钟。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以很多索引器都会跟踪其他人的索引。 Vanguard总市场指数是Vanguard自己创建的。有一个单独的索引组，并且设置了一大堆技术方法。股票会员资格的变更涉及哪些内容？告诉我们一些关于这个过程是什么样的。</p><p>戴维斯：对于整个股票市场指数基金来说，这是一个由芝加哥大学运营的 CRSP 基金。他们创造了基准。我们帮助他们识别和创建围绕如何构建索引的参数。最重要的事情主要是当有公司行动时，就会有首次公开募股。这些通常是推动变革的因素，因为这又代表了整个市场。所以你有小盘股、中盘股、大盘股。你在那里有成长、价值和融入。因此，营业额主要由公司行为和首次公开募股驱动。然后团队花费大量时间来确保他们确实非常好地处理这些问题，以最大限度地降低成本，并确保跟踪误差保持相对较小。</p><p>该团队所做的另一件事是，我们有一个证券借贷团队，他们也花了很多时间来确保我们从所需的证券中获得价值。证券借贷收入的收益在扣除运营该集团的成本后将直接返回该基金。</p><p>因此，只要对我们拥有的某些证券有大量需求，我们的股东就会受益。因此，这也是影响这些基金业绩的另一个因素。</p><p>里索兹：对。这是一个性能增强器。</p><p>戴维斯：没错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：最终导致能够降低该基金的成本。</p><p>戴维斯：嗯，它降低了交易成本带来的最终阻力。确切地。</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。那么 Vanguard 多久创建一个新索引呢？那么这个过程是怎样的呢？</p><p>戴维斯：我们倾向于不创建索引。这是一个外包流程。所以这真的取决于我们的阵容是否有空缺？因此，我们从各个业务部门获取意见，无论是我们的零售部门、我们的机构部门还是我们的财务顾问服务部门，是否存在我们认为的差距，嘿，我们没有提供所需的相关产品我们的客户？</p><p>然后我们发现，我们进行研究，投资组合审查部门进行研究，以确定谁将是此类任务的最佳和装备最齐全的指数提供商。然后我们的团队在尽职调查过程中与他们密切合作，并确保该指数以我们满意的方式构建，并采取适当的控制水平。</p><p>然后，您知道，一旦设置完毕，团队就准备好开始根据新定义的索引进行管理。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：当你说你的阵容中存在差距时，你并不是在谈论流行的东西，比如“嘿，我们没有虚拟宇宙索引。”或者，“看，我们没有人工智能指数。”它总是更广泛、更持久，如果这是我正在寻找的正确的词，或者是持久的。</p><p>戴维斯：是的，同样，这些需要具有持久的长期投资价值。这是我们推出基金之前的关键定义原则之一。这种投资策略有真正的长期价值吗？你是完全正确的。 Vanguard 不是那种会推出专注于主题的产品的公司，无论是人工智能、水还是其他什么。这不是先锋集团所做的。我们正在寻找长期持久的投资解决方案和产品，为我们的投资者提供真正为他们服务的长期机会。</p><p>因此，几年前，我写了一篇专栏，介绍 Vanguard 的这个令人震惊的小方面，我认为没有人理解，这就是 Vanguard 在管理共同基金税收的方式上拥有的专利，这使得您的共同基金的行为更像 ETF ，并且通常没有税收转嫁。</p><p>这让我想到了一个问题。当你达到先锋集团的规模时，你如何平衡一方面的纪律与创造力的需要以及偶尔的跳出框框的思考？你可能会认为他们可能会发生争执。那是什么样子的？</p><p>戴维斯：是的，最重要的是，巴里，这是一个很好的问题。最重要的是，持久的理念是什么以及我们试图为客户实现什么？归根结底，他们来找我们是为了尝试长期接触某一细分市场。我们希望以尽可能最好的方式做到这一点，确保他们获得市场回报，减去费用比率，我们将再次尝试用证券借贷收入和深思熟虑的再平衡策略来抵消这一点。</p><p>但归根结底，这实际上归结为我们的客户以低成本、多元化的方式进行广泛的投资，我们认为这最终将在他们构建投资组合时为他们服务。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：大多数人首先认为先锋集团是被动的。告诉我们一些关于首席投资官在投资业务的被动方面所做的事情。</p><p>戴维斯：其中很大一部分实际上是在发生更复杂的企业行为并带来一定程度的风险时。我们与风险管理部门进行了对话，以确保我们对基金中产生的风险敞口感到满意。</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And when you say corporate actions, we&#39;re talking about M&amp;A, IPOs, bankruptcies, anytime somebody outside of your decision-making process either exits or enters a market.</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, exactly. So when there&#39;s a major turnover like that that happens, you always have the option, “Hey, can you do it exactly on the time that it enters the benchmark? Do you need to do some of it ahead of time? Do you need to do some of it afterwards to try to smooth out the process?” And that&#39;s a risk decision that you have to make. How much liquidity is going to be there when there&#39;s a major activity that happens? is the pricing more attractive right away versus waiting until it starts trading in the secondary market? Those are the considerations and the conversations that we have with our risk team and our senior investment professionals on the equity side.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So it&#39;s pretty well established amongst the academic research that passive on the equity side beats active over the long haul, but that&#39;s not true on the fixed income side. Active on the fixed income tends to be passive because the choices amongst fixed income are just so much greater than what you have in equity. Tell us a little bit about what you as CIO do on the bond side.</p><p> DAVIS: So on the bond side, we have both. So we do bond indexing in a highly diversified way, cutting across segments, including treasuries, including governments, corporates, mortgages, and things of that nature, global portfolios that give you a tremendous amount of diversification that&#39;s hedged back to the US dollar, which in a highly diversified way is a great way to get bond exposure.</p><p> To your point in terms of active fixed income, we do have a very large active fixed income team where that team has been very successful in terms of being able to add value over the long term. And so when you look at some of the results, and a big chunk of that comes from our credit research capabilities within the team, both investment grade, emerging market as well as high yield, but 92% of our active bond funds have done better than the average fund over their Lippert Group averages over a five year period. And 87% of our active fixed income funds have outperformed their benchmarks on a three year basis against their benchmarks.</p><p> And then, if you look at a five year time horizon, it&#39;s 77%.</p><p> So, our active team has been successful outperforming their benchmarks. And a big part of it is, do you have the credit team that can do the due diligence? Because credit is where we think we can add the most value by credit research. And we see that on the municipal bond side as well, where we have a very active municipal bond franchise. And the credit research allows that team to consistently add value relative to their benchmarks, providing better outcomes for our clients long-term.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s really quite fascinating on the equity side, two or 3% of the stocks are where all the value is created. On the fixed income side, it seems like eliminating the worst 10, 20, 30% of stocks in terms of either risk or duration is where all the alpha gets generated.</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, I mean, in fixed income, because again, it tends to be a defensive asset class, which you want to do is you want to try to avoid the losers, right? Where, you know, what&#39;s the upside when you invest in a bond?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Hey, you get your money back.</p><p> DAVIS: You get your money back. You get your coupon payments and your principal, you know, at maturity on time. The downside is you get zero because the company files for bankruptcy and there&#39;s no recovery value. So, you know, again, for a defensive asset class, we&#39;ve always thought that you want to limit the amount of risk that you take in what&#39;s supposed to be balance in the portfolio. And the way we&#39;re able to accomplish that is that, because we have so much scale and ability, to keep costs low at Vanguard, at the end of the day, our active fixed income managers don&#39;t need to take the same level of risk as some of our competitors, simply because they don&#39;t have the same level of headwind. Our expense ratios are lower.</p><p> So when things don&#39;t look attractively priced in the marketplace, You don&#39;t need to sit there and try to overcome a heavy expense ratio all the time. We can be patient. We can wait. We can wait till the market&#39;s a bit more attractive and when we feel we&#39;re being rewarded for risk-taking.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There&#39;s a little multiplier effect from the low-cost side of Vanguard in that you don&#39;t have to swing at every pitch. The ability to say, “No, no, we&#39;re good with this. “We&#39;ll wait till opportunities look a lot more attractive.” I don&#39;t get that sense from a lot of people in finance. They&#39;re judged every month, they&#39;re judged every quarter, and they feel like, what&#39;s the old joke? Never mistake activity for progress?</p><p> DAVIS: That&#39;s right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That seems to be really common in Wall Street.</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, I mean, for our teams, our active teams, their performance is evaluated on a three-year basis. So, you know–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Three years?</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, so —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s amazing.</p><p> DAVIS: So when we think about how those teams are evaluated, it&#39;s a three-year number. So how did you perform? Because in any given quarter, any given year, you know, you could have winners and losers in terms of strategies, but what you&#39;re trying to do is you&#39;re trying to string good periods together and over a three-year period, we feel like there&#39;s enough opportunities for teams if they&#39;re good at what they do to add value. And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been able to demonstrate over time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s so fascinating because I would assume that intellectually, everybody understands that&#39;s true, but emotionally, two bad quarters, and it&#39;s like, we know we told you three years, but we&#39;re getting pressure from investors and we have to make a change. Like to stay with that is really challenging.</p><p> DAVIS: Well, you know, it&#39;s a great point, Barry, but the reality is like when you&#39;re running portfolios in a highly risk-controlled way, you&#39;re trying to manage the downside, right? So when you have three years, you have three years, again, because you&#39;re trying to make sure people have an opportunity for their strategies to play out over time, but you&#39;re also making sure that you&#39;re constraining the risk, that even if you do have a bad year, it&#39;s not going to be so bad that investors start running for the hills.</p><p> Again, we want investors to stay in each product long-term because we think they provide good, long-term, enduring value for our clients.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And Vanguard famously during the financial crisis, not only did you not see outflows, you actually saw inflows. I got to imagine a year like 2022 wasn&#39;t horrible for Vanguard&#39;s asset growth.</p><p> DAVIS: It&#39;s interesting. I mean, there&#39;s certain segments of markets that did quite well, certain segments of the business, but you also have a period of time when there&#39;s repricing that happens in the fixed income space, like we saw, and it was pretty rapid last year.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p> DAVIS: And you had-</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Hey, 500 basis points of rate increases, we&#39;ll do that.</p><p> DAVIS: That&#39;s exactly it. And when you saw the US Ag down 13% last year, for folks, again, who are investing for retirement and in their 529 plans, they&#39;re not concerned about it. But when you translate that to folks who might have a heavy municipal bond portfolio, and those folks who are in retirement, and they don&#39;t like principal losses. They like tax-free income, but they also don&#39;t like principal losses. So when you have a big backup like that, you tend to see outflows in that segment of the market more than you would see in a taxable market, which tends to be, in our case, more long-term, retirement-oriented, and things of that nature. So you will see some pressure on munis in those types of interest rate environments.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk a little bit about last year, where all I heard was the 60 portfolio is dead. Discuss.</p><p> DAVIS: It&#39;s interesting. I mean, we&#39;ve heard that over and over again. It was a tough year for investors in terms of both stocks and bonds being down where stocks were down about 20%, the US AG was down 13%.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: When was the last time we saw stocks and bonds down double digits, like 81, something like that?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Somewhere in that type of horizon, yes, exactly. So it&#39;s not something that many investors have been accustomed to or have seen in their lifetimes, but the reality is, the reality is, when you think about the components in the terms of long-term investing, the bond portion of the equation provides that balance and diversification. Now again, in any one given year, you will have a 60, you can have a 60/40 portfolio that underperforms and both sides of the equation go down, but for a long-term investor who&#39;s saving for retirement, that balance and diversification has proved and delivered really good long-term returns.</p><p> So when you go back to 1926, if you were an investor since then, a 60/40 portfolio has returned 8.8% on average over that time horizon…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> DAVIS: Which is impressive.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> DAVIS: Because again, it provides you diversification, it reduces some of the volatility, but there will be periods of time where, again, that type of portfolio when, we were in an environment where interest rates were held down to historically low levels.</p><p> So when they reprice, it&#39;s not surprising that you see losses on the bond side of the equation. But if you go back to the period before 2022, from 2019 to 2021, a 60/40 portfolio actually produced 14% returns over that time horizon, which is above the long-term average.</p><p> So, in the grand scheme of things, it&#39;s not surprising that there&#39;s periods of outperformance and that ultimately will lead to periods of underperformance.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s right. And I&#39;m glad you mentioned the period before that. Go to the decade before 2022, the equity side was something like 13%. And then whatever you got from bonds was just a bonus on top of that.</p><p> DAVIS: That&#39;s exactly right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: People forget that when they see a single year like 2022, and they really forget that in a year like 2023, where everything is going up, I mean, other than gold, what hasn&#39;t been going up this year? How do you deal with the opposite of last year with the first half like this year?</p><p> DAVIS: Well, look, clearly the equity market has been on a tremendous tear so far this year, up 18%, 19% year to date. But the key thing there is, again, investors have to keep in mind that that&#39;s probably not sustainable long term. And so again, the importance of having a diversified portfolio is critically important. And just think about fixed income and money markets as an asset class.</p><p> You know, for a decade, you weren&#39;t earning anything in a money market fund because interest rates by the Federal Reserve were pegged at zero. And you had to take on significant duration risk and credit risk just to earn a couple percentage points. And now, you&#39;re in an environment where money market funds are yielding 5-1/4%. You have the US Ag that&#39;s yielding somewhere close to 5%, so 4.5%, 5%. So in the grand scheme of things, investors are actually being rewarded for having exposure to money markets and bond funds.</p><p> And so if people are truly concerned about a 60/40 portfolio, they should have been concerned about it for 10 years. Now&#39;s not the time when you&#39;re back to an environment where you&#39;re actually getting a real yield when it comes to the bond market.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m glad you brought up money markets because it&#39;s this overlooked area that when you have rates at ultra-low levels, it kind of gets forgotten about. But is it fair to say that this year and perhaps last year, you saw a big shift of client cash assets into money markets?</p><p> DAVIS: We definitely saw a number of clients who started embracing money markets. And the reality is for a lot of investors, it truly is free money, right? So when you think about what people are earning in their deposit accounts at their banks, and banks have historically been very slow to raise, very slow in terms of raising deposit rates because those deposits tend to be very sticky.</p><p> And I&#39;ve had people stop me, even at Vanguard, in the hallway and say, “Wow, I didn&#39;t realize that I&#39;ve been leaving this much money on the table by keeping a sizable amount of deposits at my bank.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> DAVIS: “I moved it to a money market, now I&#39;m getting a five and a quarter percent type yield, which is amazing when some folks are still getting less than half a percent” in many cases, in the bank.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s shocking that this has gone on, how much inertia there is in finance that even if you&#39;re just getting your December bonus that you&#39;re going to pay Uncle Sam in April, leaving that money in a savings account for a third of the year, you&#39;re leaving a chunk of change on the table.</p><p> DAVIS: It&#39;s free money.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Free money, right.</p><p> DAVIS: It&#39;s free money.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Quite interesting.</p><p> So at what point do you think high yields become a headwind for stocks, or is it just overall part of the 60/40 portfolio? And hey, we&#39;ll either take it on the equity half or the bond half, we don&#39;t care.</p><p> DAVIS: Well, I think if you look at what our return expectations are for the global balance portfolio, we&#39;re expecting that over the next decade or so, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 5.5% for a global balance portfolio. So combination of equities, bonds, US and international stocks. And the reality is, our return expectations for the US equity market is a bit more muted. We&#39;re expecting US equity market returns to hover somewhere around 5% or so…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> DAVIS: Where international equities, because of valuations, probably 7% to 7.5%.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk about that, because that gap in valuation has persisted for a long time. Certainly for a few years after the financial crisis, it seemed like US stocks were pricey, forward return expectations were low and the opposite was true overseas, but the US seemed to be the only place to be.</p><p> How durable is that shift, given how large that gap has gotten in valuation between US stocks and the rest of the developed world?</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, so I mean, if you were to take a look at what&#39;s happened over the last 10 years, looking at the S&amp;P 500 index versus, you know, like the FTSE Global All Cap ex-US, there was a seven percentage point difference per year by being–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: 700 basis.</p><p> DAVIS: 700 basis points–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s monstrous.</p><p> DAVIS: Of outperformance by the US market relative to the international markets. But, you know, so if you were to take a look at where PE ratios are today, between ES and P, which has an earning yield of about 5%, and you look at the FTSE Global All Cap ex-US, it has an earning yield of 8.3%, right? And so–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Not insubstantial–</p><p> DAVIS: There&#39;s a substantial difference. Now, there are sector differences. So, you know, and we could talk about that to some degree as well, but the reality, even if you adjust for sector differences, there&#39;s still a big gap. There&#39;s still a big gap in terms of the PE ratios across the US market relative to the rest of the world.</p><p> And so, unless we expect earnings for US companies to vastly outpace what&#39;s happening in the international markets, and it might, but there&#39;s a lot of great news already priced into the marketplace. And when you think about translating the S&amp;P 500 PE to an implied equity risk premium by looking at the 10 year treasury yield, you&#39;re 200 basis points below what it&#39;s been for the last 10 years.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s do a little comparison because I&#39;m always skeptical when people focus on a single metric like price to earnings. I want to make that more three-dimensional. So if Europe is at an 8.3 earnings yield and we&#39;re at about a 5%, what&#39;s the growth rate difference between the two, meaning are people willing to give up a little bit of earnings in order to accept a faster growth rate that certainly we&#39;ve seen on the tech side, I can&#39;t speak across every sector.</p><p> DAVIS: Well, I think there&#39;s a couple of things there, Barry. I mean, one of it is, do you expect the earnings growth to live up to the expectations that are already priced into the US market? And if so, that&#39;s fine for where we are, but that&#39;s not necessarily going to lead to multiple expansion, right? And a big driver of the outperformance over the last decade of US stocks relative to the international valuation expansion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. And that&#39;s all sentiment.</p><p> DAVIS: That&#39;s exactly it. And a lot of, we would say a lot of that&#39;s probably already baked into the marketplace and has run its course. Could it go further? Of course it could. But at some point, there is a tipping point where people start saying, “Well, in the US, I have alternatives. I have alternatives because I can go out and buy a money market fund at five and a quarter percent and I don&#39;t have to take a lot of risk.” And if, again, based on our forecast for US equity markets, they&#39;re somewhat muted because valuations are stretched in our view relative to our fair value model.</p><p> And so I think a lot of investors have alternatives. They can buy money markets, they can buy bond funds where there was no alternative for the last 10 years because we didn&#39;t get any real yield when it came to the fixed income or the money market space. But there&#39;s really alternatives today for investors, either in fixed income money markets, or international stocks.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. The 2010s were certainly the TINA decade. It&#39;s funny you mentioned multiple expansion. When you look at the 82 to 2000 bull market, something like 75% of those gains came not from earnings growth, but from multiple expansion.</p><p> I&#39;m curious if that&#39;s kind of repeating now and the 2020 pandemic fiscal stimulus, which was massive under two presidents. What does that do in terms of resetting the cycle? And can we stay pricey, forget higher for longer, can we stay pricey for longer given all the stimulus that&#39;s coursing through the system?</p><p> DAVIS: Well, I think there&#39;s a couple of things. One, it becomes a factor. Yes, the economy can clearly keep roaring along, which we&#39;ve seen. The fiscal stimulus that we&#39;ve seen, there&#39;s over $2 trillion that was saved. Our reports show, and some of the data out in the marketplace shows that about a trillion dollars of that has already been spent down. So investors and savers are definitely eating into that safety net, which over time as that continues to decline should slow the economy down to some degree. So I think that&#39;s going to be a big factor.</p><p> But then when you think about the broader equity markets, again, the biggest thing that would be concerning if you start seeing a continued rise in interest rates and that has to put pressure on equity valuations. I mean equities are a ultra-long duration asset.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> DAVIS: And if you&#39;re discounting those future cash flows at higher interest rates, that means you get a lower present value. And at some point that will bite. Who knows when that&#39;s going to be? Nobody knows when you could see that kind of return to normal. But you would definitely expect that higher interest rates will put continued pressure on the equity market and get valuations back to something that&#39;s more normalized over time. Because you do expect, if you&#39;re investing in equities, to earn an equity risk premium.</p><p> And the fact that it&#39;s so much lower than what we&#39;ve seen historically, it starts to beg the question, how much exposure, if I&#39;m a shorter term investor, how much exposure do I want in that space? For long term investors, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s stay with interest rates for a moment. Interest rates are much higher than they&#39;ve been over the past decade. But let&#39;s look at the past 50 or 75 years, interest rates today are clearly above where they were, but they&#39;re not especially high by historical standards. I think a lot of people confuse those two.</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, I think a lot of investors end up succumbing to recency bias, right? So the fact that we&#39;ve been in an environment where interest rates …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Hey, it ain&#39;t zero anymore.</p><p> DAVIS: That&#39;s exactly it. So people think that that&#39;s the end. I think what you have to look at, and our team has done work on this, you have to look at what do you think is the appropriate level for Fed funds in the neutral state where it&#39;s not stimulative or contracting the marketplace. And so some of the research our team has done, it says that, look, long-term Fed funds could be higher than what the market is pricing in.</p><p> The market and the Fed have said, probably in the neighborhood, R-star is 50 basis points or half a percent. You add 2% inflation on top of that, that gives you a long-term Fed funds of 2.5%.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> DAVIS: You know, our investment strategy group, through their analysis, they estimate that R-star is probably closer to 1.5%. So that brings you to a longer term Fed funds target of closer to 3.5% if they&#39;re successful at bringing rates back down to 2%, inflation back down to 2%, I should say. And then if you build a normal term structure on top of that, between three month treasury bills and 10 year bonds of about 100 basis points, that brings you to a 10 year that&#39;s probably fair around 4.5%.</p><p> And so — but it all depends on what happens from an inflation perspective, economic growth perspective, and how aggressive the Fed will have to be going down the path here but again, we think that there is some risk that rates will have to go a bit higher here, just given everything that&#39;s going on in the economy and the marketplace.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And the 10-year is not all that far away from four and a half percent.</p><p> DAVIS: It is not.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s something that end of year is not unthinkable.</p><p> DAVIS: That&#39;s right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting.</p><p> So everybody seems kind of shocked by what&#39;s taking place in 2023, although to be fair, everybody seemed shocked at what took place in 2022. What are your thoughts about how Wall Street plays this forecasting game where everybody&#39;s thrown a dart, someone randomly gets it right, but it just seems like it&#39;s a weird game to be playing with people&#39;s serious money?</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, we try not to be in the short-term forecasting game. Forecasting&#39;s really hard, and it&#39;s even harder to the extent you&#39;re doing it for the short-term. And so, when we think about the Vanguard Capital Markets model, which drives a lot of our advice engines and the recommendations that we provide the client, the truly not point forecast in the narrow sense of how people tend to do forecast, it&#39;s really the median results of a large simulation that shows a probabilistic determination of results.</p><p> And it runs a scale. And the median is just basically that midpoint of all those observations. And so we have a distribution around that. And so again, there&#39;s going to be periods of time when you&#39;re in the tail, both positively and negatively. But again, what we try to say to our clients, you have no control about how volatile the market&#39;s going to be. What you can control at the end of the day is how diversified you are, how cognizant you are to the cost that you&#39;re paying for the funds that you&#39;re investing in. And doing that in a highly diversified, low-cost way, we think is going to provide investors the best chance for their investment success long-term versus focusing on daily news announcements, what&#39;s happening.</p><p> Those are the types of things that create trading activity, but don&#39;t tend to add value for long-term investors.</p><p> So you recently came out and criticized some of the market timing that&#39;s been going on. What I found shocking about that was we really have to warn people about the dangers of market timing and overtrading. Isn&#39;t that an issue that the academics have long ago resolved? Yes, but it is, it is, Barry. I mean, the data will show that it is not fruitful. It is not helpful to long-term investors to engage in that type of activity, but we don&#39;t have to look too far past with the meme stocks and things of that nature where for a variety of reasons, things pop on the headline and there&#39;s a lot of momentum and folks get involved and people get caught up and believe it&#39;s easy money and it&#39;s free money.</p><p> And the reality is that&#39;s speculation and not investing. And so speculating is, that&#39;s a very risky strategy. And when we think about investing, that&#39;s not the way you construct an investment portfolio. If you want to do that from a speculative standpoint, that&#39;s fine. Do that with a very small portion of your portfolio, but the majority of it should be investing in long-term strategies that will add value and are enduring.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: My favorite part of TikTok were the TikTok speculative traders. “Hey, investing is easy. Just buy stocks that are going up. And when they stop going up, you sell them. What could be an easier way to support your lifestyle?”</p><p> And as that was happening in real time during 2020, I&#39;m sure you felt the same thing I felt like I&#39;ve seen this movie, I know exactly how this is going to end.</p><p> DAVIS: That&#39;s exactly right, Barry. I mean, I&#39;ve been in this industry long enough. I started my career in finance in 1998 and very familiar with the dot-com era and what happened there. And it was very, very reminiscent of that period of time where during that period, anything with a dot com behind it, ran to the moon, and you couldn&#39;t go wrong. Well, that works until it doesn&#39;t.</p><p> And then one day you realize that these companies actually, they have to be real companies that make money, produce earnings, and are viable businesses. And in a speculative fever, people lose sight that having cash flow, having earnings matters in the long run, and sometimes people have to learn a hard, hard lesson that, again, that&#39;s not investing, and that&#39;s really speculative.</p><p> And it&#39;s a lesson to learn earlier on in your career when you don&#39;t have a lot of money versus later on in your career where you start to accumulate some assets. You definitely want to be more of an investor versus a speculator.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, make your mistakes early. You know, there&#39;s a chapter in, I want to say it&#39;s Adam Smith&#39;s “The Money Game” from the 1960s, where he talks about a fund manager running a bunch of young run-and-gun managers. “Why do you have these young kids working for you?” “Oh, because they&#39;ll buy all the stuff that I won&#39;t buy and we&#39;ll make money in it. And when it blows up, I&#39;ll sell early and fire them all and go on to the next group.” I was reminded of that last time.</p><p> But it seems shocking, I guess like the market timing argument. We&#39;re still in a debate between meme stock pickers and indexers. It&#39;s fascinating that every new generation has to learn the hard lessons over and over again.</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, I mean, you just have to look at history, but some people have to learn the hard way using real money to do that. But eventually, most people find religion and start thinking about, “Hey, how do I actually construct a portfolio that&#39;s durable, that will provide the type of economic return that&#39;s required to meet their retirement needs, college saving needs, or buying that new house, or whatever the case may be.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. So let&#39;s talk about some adult decision-making around a durable portfolio. Internally, we&#39;ve been having discussions about extending duration. If you tightened up duration in &#39;21 or even &#39;22, you did better than the index. At what point do you say, “Hey, I&#39;m not getting paid to take risk short-term because of the possibility of those rates dropping, whether it&#39;s &#39;24 or &#39;25.”</p><p> Where do you start thinking about going back out on the duration curve for fixed income?</p><p> DAVIS: I think you have to get to a place where you feel like the Fed is done and inflation is starting to be — you&#39;re convinced that inflation is under control and path towards the Fed&#39;s 2% target. So we think there&#39;s still some ways for that to go. And again, if you go back to what I was saying earlier about R-star and the neutral Fed funds rate, if we believe that&#39;s 3.5% with a normal shape yield curve of 4.5%, we&#39;re not far from that, but it&#39;s also, that&#39;s far from neutral, right?</p><p> If we think 4.5% is fair value, we&#39;re not at fair value yet. So that means it also means that, hey, it&#39;s not cheap. So you don&#39;t want to dive in with both feet. When you&#39;re approaching fair value, you want things to actually be cheap before you do that. So the risk is that rates back up more. And so I think you still want to be somewhat conservative when it comes to duration positioning in a portfolio.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I always have a question about that 2% inflation target. Not to be flippant, but it seems like a made up number. I hunted for some academic research that said, here&#39;s why. And I came up with something, the former Fed vice chair wrote a paper that said, oh, it&#39;s a thing from New Zealand in 1980s.</p><p> It&#39;s kind of a made up round number and everybody adopted it. Can it be that simple? We&#39;re using a Fed inflation target that&#39;s just a made up number?</p><p> DAVIS: Well, that&#39;s what the market is gravitating towards. That is what the Fed is operating off of. And until they decide to communicate a different message, that&#39;s what the market is going to continue to follow. And their behavior says that, hey, they want to see inflation coming down. It&#39;s also difficult to be changing the strategy when you&#39;re falling behind your current strategy. Because if you say, “Hey, I&#39;m going from a 2% target to 3%, well, you&#39;re at 3% because you couldn&#39;t hit 2%. Well, is 3% the right number?”</p><p> And so…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, if you&#39;re going to make up a number, make up one you can reach as opposed to one you can&#39;t.</p><p> DAVIS: But we have to be realistic too, right, Barry? I mean, the reality is for 10 years, we couldn&#39;t hit 2% inflation. We were on the other side.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We were on the downside.</p><p> DAVIS: We were underneath that 2%. They were working really hard to try to get to 2% and they couldn&#39;t achieve it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So in an era of low monetary policy and almost non-existent fiscal stimulus, upside target of 2% doesn&#39;t seem to make a lot of sense. Fast forward to the 2020s, now we&#39;re in an era of massive fiscal stimulus, not nearly as much monetary stimulus. Does it make sense to have the same target when you&#39;re coming from 5% above it as opposed to 0% under it?</p><p> DAVIS: Well, the thing is, it&#39;s supposed to be a long-term target and it&#39;s supposed to be an average target over time. So, I haven&#39;t heard anything that would say that they&#39;re in the process of deciding to switch it to a higher number. I think that&#39;s something that&#39;d be debated once you get back to close to your target. And that gives you greater credibility over time.</p><p> What you don&#39;t want to do is you don&#39;t want to change, you don&#39;t want to change the mile post while the car is still in motion and you&#39;re running the race. You want to basically say, “Hey, we&#39;re anchored to this. We believe in this. And ultimately we think this is going to allow us to pursue a level of economic growth that continues to give us full employment, moderate price increases.”</p><p> Again, it&#39;s debatable whether or not 2% is the right number or 3%. All I would say is that it took us a long time to get north of 2%. We finally got it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It took $6 trillion in fiscal stimulus, but that raises the question, “Hey, you know, when it gets icy out, you got to slow down.”</p><p> DAVIS: You do have to slow down, but the reality is that stimulus is starting to wear off. Those savings are starting to be consumed. You&#39;re starting to see the Fed reduce its balance sheet slowly, but it&#39;s starting to happen. And you&#39;ve seen the Federal Reserve clearly raise interest rates dramatically, 525 basis points in 15 months. They&#39;re definitely trying to slow the economy down.</p><p> And so we&#39;ll have to wait and see if that&#39;s enough. But again, we have to remember, we can&#39;t be blindsided by the fact that inflation has been well above their target because of all this stimulus. This stimulus was slowly ebbing out of the system and we&#39;re gradually going back to, we&#39;re going in the right direction. The question is how long will it take for us to get there?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. I&#39;m going to throw you a curve ball question which I did not disclose in advance because I wanted to surprise you. You&#39;re born in Germany, raised in a military family, and you speak fluent German with your mom and English with your dad. Tell us a little bit about your experience growing up overseas as a military brat?</p><p> DAVIS: It was a phenomenal, phenomenal experience. I mean, I had the privilege of growing up in a bilingual household. And my maternal grandmother was also home, and she spoke primarily German to me. So what was challenging for me was like, actually, when we moved to the US when I was seven years old, I was always good with math, but my English was below average. And my wife is an English, as she taught English at the college level, she said, “You dummy, English was a second language for you.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> DAVIS: And it really was. I didn&#39;t know it even, I went to a US Department of Defense school in Germany, but my primary language that was spoken by my grandmother, who I spent most of my time with, was German. So, that was interesting.</p><p> And I loved the experience of living over in Germany, and I had the benefit as a kid, during my teenage years, going back to visit family members and friends over the years going back to Germany, which is also a very rewarding and memorable part of my childhood.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting.</p><p> So I only have you for a few more minutes. Let&#39;s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests that are a little bit revealing of who they are.</p><p> Tell us a little bit about what you&#39;ve been streaming, what&#39;s been keeping you entertained these days.</p><p> DAVIS: So from a streaming standpoint, there was a series, went through the first season that ended, they&#39;re going to start a new one in 2024, it was called “Night Agent.” Which was really interesting. There was an FBI agent who was manning a telephone in the basement of the White House.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I saw the first episode of that.</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, it&#39;s actually a really good series and the good news is it got picked up and I think they&#39;re coming out with new episodes in 2024. But it was a really, really interesting…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: He kind of gets the crap beat out of him in the first episode.</p><p> DAVIS: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I saw that, it was very fun.</p><p> DAVIS: It was a really interesting show. So that&#39;s one. And then because of my kids also been, big fans of All American and Bel Air, which are also really cool series that we&#39;ve been watching. So those were a couple.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Tell us a little bit about your early mentors who helped to shape your career.</p><p> DAVIS: I had a number and I&#39;ll go back to the first two I had when I started in this industry. Darrell Thomas was leading investment grade capital market at Citibank. He actually helped me get my internship. I met him at a career fair. He helped me get my first internship on Wall Street with somebody I kept in contact with over the years. And he helped me, you know, him and there was another individual Carmine Urciuoli, who also worked at Citi at the time.</p><p> Those two individuals gave me a lot of perspective when I was thinking about moving from Wall Street to the buy side. And thanks to some of the words of wisdom from Carmine, he said to me when I was thinking about making a change, he said, “If you could join a well-regarded, well-respected asset manager, you&#39;re going to have a much longer and more fruitful career than if you stay on the sell side.”</p><p> And that was advice he gave me back in 1999.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Good advice and good timing.</p><p> DAVIS: I send Carmine chats every once in a few years saying thank you for the advice and I appreciated it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting.</p><p> DAVIS: And then along the way, Ken Volpert who hired me, huge, huge mentor. He hired me to trade treasuries and mortgages on the team, big mentor, advocate, sponsor and friend, and of course Tim Buckley who gave me the opportunity to go to Australia and then ultimately lead the fixed income group and then put me in the seat that I&#39;m in today. I&#39;ve only had two bosses at Vanguard in 24 years and they&#39;ve both been phenomenal.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow, really, really interesting.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk about books. What are some of your favorites and what are you reading right now?</p><p> DAVIS: Right now I&#39;m reading “Plunder” by Brendan Ballou. It talks about the private equity world. I have a daughter who wants to do private equity investing, so I&#39;m doing some due diligence. And the book is actually an interesting read, but it talks a bit about the dark side of private equity versus some of the favorable things that come out of that space as well.</p><p> And then there was another book that I read previously that I thought was really interesting. It&#39;s not market related, but it talks a lot about history in the US, it is called “From Here to Equality” by William Darity and Kirsten Mullen. And it really examines a lot of American history that isn&#39;t covered in school.</p><p> You know, it&#39;s a deep look at some of the, you know, really pivotal points in the nation&#39;s history that, you know, where we had a number of opportunities to create a more and equal and just society where we chose to go left instead of right. And, you know, we&#39;re still dealing with some of those ramifications in today&#39;s modern age. So I thought it was a really, really interesting book about American history.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. What sort of advice would you give a recent college grad who is interested in a career in either asset management or finance?</p><p> DAVIS: I would say a couple of things. One is be a continual learner. Master your craft. So spend the time and energy and the effort to learn and become an expert. And the key thing is continuous learning. And there&#39;s opportunities to learn from everybody that you interact from and interact with.</p><p> And so the other thing I would say is, for young people, you have to remember a career is a marathon and not a sprint. The problem that people face is that they&#39;re constantly comparing themselves with somebody else who started at the same time or one of their peers who is working at a different firm. And what I always say to the younger joiners to our firm is run your own race. Judge your success by how you&#39;re doing. Are you getting better than where you were a year before? Are you continuing to learn? Are you being developed? And if you focus on yourself about getting better every day, you&#39;re going to have a much more fruitful and long living career than somebody who&#39;s constantly comparing themselves to somebody else.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really good advice.</p><p> And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today you wish you knew 30 or so years ago when you were really first getting started?</p><p> DAVIS: I would say the power of compounding is such a beautiful thing. I just, I wish I would have learned that lesson earlier on. And you know, what we were speaking about before, the idea of investing versus speculating.</p><p> As a youngster, it&#39;s always interesting to, you think about an industry or a company and you&#39;re like, oh, it&#39;d be a great investment, but what you&#39;re doing is speculating and you should be investing and let that investment compound over 30, 40, 50 years, and you can see that even small amounts of money will grow into a rather large sum if you do it on a consistent basis.</p><p> So I wish I would&#39;ve learned those lessons earlier and earlier in my lifetime.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really great stuff.</p><p> We have been speaking with Greg Davis.

Tim Buckley, who became CEO of Vanguard Group in 2018, eventually elevated Davis to CIO.</p><p> Davis explains why Vanguard doesn&#39;t play the forecasting game, noting the “forecasting game is really hard and even harder for the short-term.” Instead, the Vanguard capital markets model “runs large simulations that show a probabilistic set of results, and so we tend to aim at the median, the midpoint of the distribution of those observations.” As to the tail, both positively and negatively, that is going to happen on occasion, but most of the time you are in the middle of the distribution.</p><p> Davis adds “ <em>Instead of forecasting events you have no control over, you can control your diversification and costs</em> .”</p><p> A list of his favorite books <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/08/mib-greg-davis/#more-318919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is here</a> ; A transcript of our conversation is <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/08/transcript-greg-davis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a> Tuesday.</p><p> You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/greg-davis-on-vanguard-portfolio-management/id730188152?i=1000625684276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Podcasts</a> , <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2bo96GOdIjlVEodoCm7zvn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> , <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/masters-in-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stitcher</a> , <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzRlNGNkOTEwLTQwYTEtNDYxOS1hNWYzLWFlMmIwMDEyZmZmZi81ODczYTNjYi0yOThmLTQwYmMtYjcxZi1hZTJiMDAxMzAwMGQvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe4PRejZgr0PzN7r8NikAnOqP70DHhoJ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> , and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-08-25/greg-davis-on-vanguard-portfolio-management-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> .

He is also a long-time market analyst, commentator, and expert on behavioral economics principles as they apply to investing. In this insightful interview, Barry discusses the perils of paying too much attention to “hair on fire” headlines like recent ones about China&#39;s credit issues, rising interest rates, and the risk of recession. He notes that “The clickbait stuff is entertaining, but it&#39;s not how we manage assets and it&#39;s not how individuals should manage their own assets.” Barry also discusses how humans are wired to make quick judgments, use pattern recognition, and overreact to certain stimuli because that aided in our evolution and survival as a species. The problem? “Things that worked great on the savannah, they don&#39;t really work well in capital markets.” Our talk then pivots to Barry&#39;s outlook for Federal Reserve policy, why he thinks a higher inflation target than 2% makes sense, how the 60/40 portfolio didn&#39;t really “fail” last year, and what investors can do now to adapt to a higher-rate, higher-stimulus market environment.”</p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/08/lessons-for-investors-from-mini-panics/">Lessons for Investors from Mini-Panics</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com">The Big Picture</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
