上的一个热门视频声称，穷人的贫困程度远低于官方统计数据显示的水平，因为这些统计数据忽略了政府福利计划，如食品券和对受抚养儿童的援助以及许多其他安全网计划。如果这是真的，那就意味着我们一直在错误地衡量收入不平等（也许财富不平等也是如此）。</p><p><em>这是不真实的。</em></p><p>自 2008 年以来，人口普查局已将政府转移支付纳入其<a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2021/demo/poverty_measure-how.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">补充贫困措施</a>中。只需 0.77 秒，就可以在 Google 上找到 253,000,000 条结果，准确显示政府是如何衡量这一情况的。</p><p>称之为“<em>美国巨大的数学错误”。</em> ”</p><p>这是无知吗？完全失实陈述？纯粹是愚蠢吗？或者，菲尔·格拉姆触及的任何经济问题都注定会成为充满谎言、愚蠢和无能的垃圾箱之火吗？</p><p>你可能还记得菲尔·格拉姆。 （值得庆幸的是）他是前美国参议员，他说美国人是一个“抱怨者的国家”，患有“ <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2008/12/quote-of-the-day-phil-gramm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">精神衰退</a>”。</p><p><em>在2008。</em></p><p>当时该国正陷入大萧条以来最严重的衰退。</p><p>格拉姆去年出版了一本书，《 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1538167387/thebigpictu09-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>美国不平等的神话：政府如何偏见政策辩论</em></a>》。菲尔和他的合著者做了很多花招来让你相信，<em>嘿，收入和财富不平等并不像你想象的那么糟糕</em>。你会相信谁，是我，还是你的谎言，还是我们的统计数据？</p><p>不管怎样，格拉姆的书显然是<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/07/gramm-strikes-again/#more-316810">下面视频的</a>基础——加上<a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/the-national-study-of-millionaires-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">戴夫·拉姆齐</a>和<a href="https://www.theboxisthereforareason.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cj-v35n3-1_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">卡托</a>的一些令人费解的不合逻辑：</p><p>视频的实质是这样的：</p><p>美国的贫困并不像人口普查让你想象的那么糟糕，因为人口普查关注的是货币收入，穷人得到了很多非现金福利，例如“<em>许多福利不是用现金支付的</em>”，当你把这些非现金福利考虑进去时，穷人就不再是穷人了。瞧！</p><p>我必须提到的是里索尔兹让我意识到了这个视频，他是一个善于操纵的混蛋，他非常清楚这会触发我，让我掉进兔子洞。 （欠你一个，巴里）。但我离题了。</p><p>想象一下。这些年来，人口普查局的那些愚蠢、铅笔脖子的极客们一直没有意识到他们工作中的这一明显缺陷。感谢上帝，菲尔·格拉姆的出现澄清了事实。当然，除了人口普查局意识到这里引用的确切限制这一事实之外，很久以前——在格拉姆的书和上面荒谬的视频之前——构建了其<a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2022/comm/supplemental-poverty-measure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">补充贫困衡量标准</a>（ <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2022/comm/supplemental-poverty-measure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPM</a> ），上图简洁地总结了这一点。你看一下吗？格拉姆抱怨被排除在“官方”措施之外的所有项目都记录在 SPM 中。这几乎就像格拉姆浪费了他的时间写一本书，而读者则浪费了他们的时间来阅读它。根据记录，人口普查局于 1982 年发布了<a href="https://www2.census.gov/prod2/popscan/TP-50.pdf">第一份关于所谓“实物转移福利”估值的研究</a>。</p><p>蒂莫西·诺亚（Timothy Noah）对格拉姆的书进行了很好的揭穿，可以在这里找到：<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/167811/texas-senator-phil-gramm-inequality-myth">菲尔·格拉姆认为穷人过得太容易了</a>。</p><p>我完全准备好深入研究并弄清楚格拉姆到底是如何操纵数据来表达他的观点的，但显然他根本不知道或不关心人口普查局很久以前就解决了他提到的缺陷。简而言之，SPM 使格拉姆的书变得更加无关紧要。</p><p>仅仅关注贫困本身就有点像稻草人，因为更大的问题是无可争议的中产阶级空心化，而这个问题完全没有得到解决。</p><p>特别感谢人口普查局的 Liana Fox 分享了政府转移支付作为贫困措施一部分的 40 年历史。</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>另请参阅</em>：<br /><a

年，而且迄今为止就业或更广泛的经济并未出现下滑，情况再次发生转变 — — 令人鼓舞的是，央行严厉的紧缩政策可能也只是昙花一现。随着“软着陆”现在再次成为大多数人的想法，诸如“完美通货紧缩”之类的短语比比皆是，并引发了人们的疑问：即使地缘政治和供应链地图被重新绘制，潜在的价格动态是否已经发生了很大变化。 （ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-undershoot-narrative-shifts-again-2023-07-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">路透社</a>）</p><p> •<strong>这一统计数据可能会扭曲我们对通货膨胀的看法</strong>：一旦您了解了统计香肠是如何制作的，单位劳动力成本与通货膨胀之间的明显因果关系就会弱得多。这是诚实但粗鲁的。计算的两个输入之一是通货膨胀本身。因此，如果通胀上升而其他因素没有变化，单位劳动力成本就会上升。根据定义（ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/opinion/inflation-unit-labor-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">《纽约时报</a>》） <em>，另请参阅</em><strong>单位劳动力成本实际上是使用价格构建的</strong>：不幸的是，一些知名经济学家也同样将高单位劳动力成本视为美国通货膨胀的一个因素，认为每小时薪酬的增长相对于劳动生产率的增长过高，无法看到通货膨胀回到低水平。然而，当人们仔细研究这一统计数据的构建方式时，就会发现“单位劳动力成本”只不过是劳动力份额和价格指数的乘积。因此，这种“解释”通货膨胀的观点近乎同义反复。将 CPI 乘以相对稳定的指标（例如我的平均静息心率）也会产生类似的结果。 （ <a href="https://www.employamerica.org/blog/unit-labor-costs-do-not-drive-inflation-they-are-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">雇佣美国</a>）</p><p>

rel="noopener">华尔街日报</a>）</p><p> •<strong>市场弹性还是投资者否认？</strong> 2023年年中评估！我不是市场预测者，原因很简单。我只是不擅长，2023 年前六个月说明了为什么市场时机往往是不可能实现的梦想，每个投资者都渴望成功，但很少有人能始终如一地取得成功。今年年初，市场专家一致认为，鉴于对通胀和即将到来的经济衰退的宏观担忧，加上对美联储加息的担忧，这对市场来说将是艰难的一年，这使得看涨情绪成为华尔街的罕见商品。市场一如往常，总是充满惊喜，2023 年前六个月再次让专家措手不及。 （ <a

•<strong>人工智能如何让电影明星起死回生</strong>：借助人工智能的力量，詹姆斯·迪恩等名人可以作为数字克隆人起死回生，但这引发了令人不安的问题：我们死后拥有哪些权利。 （ <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230718-how-ai-is-bringing-film-stars-back-from-the-dead"

•<strong>拯救美国人道路生命的最佳方式</strong>：法国与美国不同，但与地球上几乎所有其他富裕国家一样，已经找到了如何使其道路更安全的方法。他们降低了小路的速度限制，并安装了数千个测速摄像头，以确保人们遵守交通规则。但他们也确实重建了道路，以使其更难发生车祸。他们这样做的方法之一是安装环形交叉路口。 （《 <a

href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/etf-that-offers-100-downside-protection-during-selloffs-is-making-its-debut">彭博社</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p>让我们先解决这个问题：<em>我不喜欢任何用部分潜在收益来换取下行保护的产品</em>。</p><p>我们来讨论一下原因。</p><p>首先，像这样的产品是完全没有必要的。至少，如果你是一个做正确事情的聪明投资者：制定财务计划，管理自己的行为，进行长期思考，并避免对市场和媒体产生的无休止的日常噪音做出反应。</p><p>其次，遵循查理·芒格的建议，颠倒销售说辞：70% 的收益（两年内每年放弃 16.62%），而没有任何缺点听起来很有吸引力——除非你考虑一下你真正放弃并换取的是什么。</p><p>您是否会接受一项交易，其中约 32% 的收益让您无需管理自己的行为？这听起来相当昂贵，因为 a) 如果您自己做，则无需花费任何费用，或者 2) 如果您与顾问合作，则需要 50-100 bps。</p><p>对我来说，这听起来像是一笔糟糕的交易。</p><p>第三，当你持有广泛的股票指数时，从长远来看，上涨会复合，而下跌只是暂时的。放弃永久的收益来避免无常的下降似乎是一个可怕的交换。</p><p>我明显的偏见是<a href="https://ritholtzwealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">我的咨询公司</a>向客户收取制定财务计划和管理资产的费用。但只要计算一下：您愿意放弃 67 个基点（RWM 的美元加权平均费用约为 0.67%），还是愿意放弃 30% 的收益并为 TJUL ETF 支付 0.79% 的年费？顾问的职责是防止客户进行因提款而导致的不良投资行为；我看不出以超过 30% 的涨幅进行交易有什么意义。</p><p> TJUL 背后的公司 Innovator 管理着“50 多个缓冲基金，自 2018 年以来总共提取了超过 120 亿美元的资产。” 。最大的投资工具包括 Innovator S&amp;P 500 Power Buffer ETF (PAPR)，资产总额约为 6.87 亿美元，以及 Innovator S&amp;P 500 Power Buffer ETF (PJUL)，资产总额约为 8.34

日</strong></p><p>有人问我：像这样的产品（2 年重置）的合适用例是什么。显而易见的答案是：在特定的近期日期为特定目的预留的现金，其中损失（即使是暂时的提取）是不可接受的：</p><blockquote><p> – 存钱买房子的首付。<br /> – 为孩子的需要而持有的现金，例如支付大学费用或婚礼费用<br />-年终奖金将于4月15日交给国税局；</p></blockquote><p>在所有这些情况下，如果您无法承受损失，并且其他选择也没有吸引力（例如，每年 4% 的货币市场账户），我可以考虑这样做。您的风险不是市场，而是 ETF 经理管理期权展期的能力。这不是零，但其波动性可能比市场小。</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><em>另请参阅</em>：<br /><a

RITHOLTZ，商科硕士主持人：本周的播客中，我有一位特别的嘉宾，Tom Wagner，Knighthead Capital 的联合创始人兼投资组合经理。他们在各种真正令人着迷的投资领域投入了大约 100 亿美元。他们不仅进行不良投资和深度价值投资，而且还拥有保险业务和体育业务。他们真的无处不在。谈论一个不受约束的基金，它可以通过各种方式寻找机会。</p><p>他们不仅购买运动队，并在诸如购买英国足球俱乐部、投资美国匹克球、投资世界各地的耐力赛等方面真正挑战极限，而且还经营多空基金，并在赫兹（Hertz）等公司寻找机会，这是一项高价值的破产投资，或者是加利福尼亚州营火后存在各种监管和诉讼风险的PG&amp;E。这是理解价值投资、了解如何分配资本和承担风险的一种有趣的方法。</p><p>我认为这是一次有趣的谈话，我想你也会的。</p><p>话不多说，下面是我与 Knighthead Capital 的 Tom Wagner 的讨论。</p><p>汤姆·瓦格纳，欢迎来到彭博社。</p><p> KNIGHTHEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC 联席董事长兼联合创始人托马斯·瓦格纳： 谢谢巴里。我很高兴来到这里。</p><p>里索兹：我很高兴有你。你的背景非常迷人，我只是按时间顺序来做这件事，否则我会透露我所有的个人偏见。你开始在安永会计师事务所工作五年，从事对冲基金会计工作。就像我什至不知道安永有这样的事情一样。请告诉我们一些关于您是如何开始的。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，我最初是一名注册会计师，我负责的早期工作之一是资产管理领域，我记得在杰弗里·维尼克（Jeffrey Vinik）担任对冲基金经理的第一年进行了审计。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：后保真、后麦哲伦基金。</p><p>瓦格纳：没错。</p><p>他管理着大量资金，并严格关闭了自己的车辆，如果我没记错的话，在他的前 14 个月里，他的总回报率为 120%。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：还不错。</p><p>瓦格纳：还不错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那是二又二十，对吧？所以这有一些好处。</p><p>瓦格纳：确实如此。我说：“这位先生从事的是什么行业？我该如何参与？”</p><p> RITHOLTZ：（笑声）我作为一名会计师正在浪费生命。我看到了一个不同的……为这个人工作是没有好处的。</p><p>瓦格纳：不。我的意思是，你知道，这很棒——你知道做会计和成为注册会计师有它的好处。您学习商业语言，并学习如何在商业环境中运作。那次经历有很多很棒的收获，但我想我意识到当时有其他东西在吸引我。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我想，市场上有 11,000 只对冲基金，虽然不是很多，但它们的经营者都花了很多时间真正了解对冲基金会计的来龙去脉。我的意思是你是一种非常稀有的鸟。</p><p>瓦格纳：我认为这可能是对的。大多数从事对冲基金工作的人，不管你知道创立和经营对冲基金，你我认为有一个非常典型的轨迹，他们是顶尖学校的金融​​专业，他们在投资银行或咨询银行工作，有时在律师事务所工作，然后他们进入投资领域。</p><p>我的，你知道，我一开始的职位要无聊得多，但由于各种原因我最终进入了公共会计行业。我的大学生涯始于工程学专业。</p><p>里索兹：对。我也是。这真的很有趣。</p><p>瓦格纳：我进入了大三，但我真的不喜欢它。我们度过了职业生涯的一天，每个进来的人都在工作中感到痛苦。我当时想，我为什么要折磨自己？我的朋友们在大学里过得很开心。我一直在学习。我突然顿悟，如果我不喜欢它，也许还有更好的路。</p><p>所以我转向会计，因为我直接认识的最成功的人是我的叔叔，他是一家公共会计师事务所的合伙人。我看着他说：“有一个人在这方面做得很好。我会尝试一下。”</p><p> RITHOLTZ：您提到了商学院。你最终会去哥伦比亚 B 学校。我知道这些是两年制课程，但请向我解释一下，在哥伦比亚大学的第二年，您如何在瑞士信贷第一波士顿全职工作。你如何兼顾这两者？</p><p>瓦格纳：你知道，我认为在生活中很多时候你都会面临这样的情况：如果你试图实现你的目标，你必须找到一条道路，无论你必须做出什么样的牺牲才能实现这个目标。你知道，97 年到 99 年我在商学院读书时，98 年秋天我们的市场出现了一些小问题……</p><p> RITHOLTZ：长期资本管理和俄罗斯违约。</p><p>瓦格纳：没错。这确实是——你知道，当我在瑞士信贷银行实习时。这是一个高度不稳定的环境，我们预计秋季会收到报价，但在我想工作的领域（销售和交易部门的高收益部门）却没有真正提供报价。</p><p>所以我的办公桌上有一位导师，他比我早几年，他说你为什么不开始进来为我做研究，你知道，我们会付给你一些名义上的钱，我的意思是，我不知道，这不是最低工资，但也没有多多少。一旦我进了门，不上课的时候我就在那里。所以我每周花 30、40 个小时在办公桌上做研究。</p><p>第一，我需要钱，因为我无法依靠外部来源获得收入。第二，这是直接体验。我是一个职业改变者。我回到商学院继续我从公共会计转向资本市场的道路。所以我需要学位，我需要过渡期。这让我能够直接获得大量经验，我觉得我需要站出来并最终找到一份工作，幸运的是我做到了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那是在瑞士信贷第一波士顿吗？你在那里呆了多久？</p><p>瓦格纳：所以我在瑞士信贷，我想你可以说我实习结束后就开始工作了，直到 2000 年秋天，我接到了高盛办公桌上的一个人的电话，他们是我认识的，并哄骗我去面试，以获得不良债务交易部门的一个职位。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：您之前没有处理过不良债务吗？</p><p>瓦格纳：不，我是一名常规高收益交易员，我在瑞士信贷银行很开心。我以为我有自己的交易书。我很兴奋。我喜欢我在那里工作的团队。我的意思是，直到今天，我仍然与其中很多人保持着非常友好的关系。我觉得自己很幸运能加入那个团队，但发生了两件事。</p><p>一、瑞士信贷收购了DLJ……</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>瓦格纳：我必须通过面试才能保住工作，值得庆幸的是我做到了。第二，我有机会与高盛的工作人员会面，高盛的不良债务交易部门有着特别丰富多彩的血统。有一群人从事过这份工作并取得了巨大的成功。我的意思是，像大卫·泰珀（David Tepper）、乔恩·科拉奇（Jon Kolatch）和乔恩·萨维茨（Jon Savitz）那样的人在那里，他们雇用了我。事情就是这样，在我到达之前，有一群令人印象深刻的人在管理那个办公桌。想想那些正面临最糟糕时刻的公司的交易是非常有吸引力的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我一直认为高收益是不良债务的前兆。我不知道这是否过于简单化了，但看起来很多我们称之为高收益、过去称之为垃圾的东西，其中一些最终进入了垃圾抽屉，其中相当一部分最终进入了垃圾抽屉。告诉我们一些你如何看待那里的转变。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，大多数最终陷入困境的公司一开始的杠杆率就很高，因此它们的投资等级为次投资等级、垃圾级或高收益评级，具体取决于你想使用什么术语。这些公司最有可能面临严重的财务压力，因为它们的债务存量最大。他们的财务灵活性最低。</p><p>但有些公司——在我职业生涯的早期尤其如此——从投资级直接陷入困境。 2000 年代初出现这种情况的原因有多种。但对我来说，这是一个我接触到真正大牌公司的领域，这些公司的定价就好像它们即将倒闭或将要清算一样。众所周知，大多数破产的公司不会清算，也不会消失。他们只是重组资产负债表，如果他们聪明的话，他们也会重组运营，以解决最终导致他们破产的问题。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你提到那个时代是 2000 年代初。互联网泡沫破裂带来了什么后果？这是否创造了一个目标丰富的环境，或者只是让事情变得更具挑战性？</p><p>瓦格纳：嗯，这就是不良投资的现实。每当市场出现一段时期的动荡时，就会创造机会。对我来说，我并不是在经济条件优越的环境中长大的人。因此，我认为我被那些遇到困难的公司所吸引。</p><p>还有一个现实是，当市场真正受到干扰时，在银行担任卖方工作时，银行通常会裁员，但不会裁员。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那是你的辉煌岁月，对吧？经济最差的时候。</p><p>瓦格纳：当一切进展顺利时，没有人会被解雇。所以我有很多工作保障。因此，在我早期，这是一种规避风险的资本市场方式。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这非常有趣。您在高盛的办公桌上呆了多久？</p><p>瓦格纳：不到八年。所以我在 2008 年初离开了。我在那里的经历，与我在瑞士信贷的经历类似，真的非常棒。这是由我周围的人推动的。当我们回顾 2000 年代初在高盛陷入困境的交易部门组建的团队时，我们发现其中有相当多的人后来成为非常成功的价值数十亿美元的资产管理公司的合伙人和创始人。</p><p>对于一群曾经在一起的专业人士来说，这是一项无与伦比的记录。对我来说，这非常有价值。我周围的人比我更有经验，在我看来比我更聪明，而且也同样有动力。这是成为特定行业专家的绝佳环境。我非常非常幸运能够在这样的环境中与那些非常有才华的人一起工作。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你在那里已经八年了。哪些交易是真正有趣的交易，哪些是令人苦恼的机会？高盛不良债务交易柜台上有哪些难忘的时刻？</p><p>瓦格纳：嗯，我将从我的第一印象开始。我明白了，瑞士信贷是一个勤奋、但也是一群有合作精神、热爱玩乐的人。我到了高盛，当时我是一名订阅者，当你是办公桌上的初级人员或你是第一个进入的机构时。所以我通常会在早上 6:45 坐在办公桌前。</p><p>我记得我到达那里的第一天，外面很黑，因为已经很晚了，现在是仲秋。我想，哇，这里真的很吵。我环顾四周，晚上 6:30 90% 的人还在办公桌前。我心想，天哪，我处在一个不同的环境中。</p><p>而人们，他们工作很努力，而且工作到很晚。在你不常看到的位置上，这意味着交易台上的很多人在市场收盘后 30 分钟、60 分钟起床并离开。这是一群坚持不懈并继续工作的人。这确实引起了我的共鸣。我当时想，天哪，这将是一次完全不同的体验。我要去兜风。</p><p>果然，确实如此。我们度过了很多个深夜。同样，我也试图结识我的客户，他们是共同基金、保险公司、对冲基金、私募股权公司的资产管理者，他们都是我们的交易对手。所以我花了很多时间出去。有一位负责销售的绅士将我介绍给了业内的每个人。</p><p>每周有四个晚上，我们出去吃饭，招待客户，了解他们，谈论市场，这对我来说是一次难以置信的教育。</p><p>因此，除了周围都是整天工作的优秀人士之外，我现在还和一些后来成为信贷市场巨头的人一起出去，他们在企业创立的早期或中期谈论市场。这对我来说是非常宝贵的经历。所以这些事情肯定很突出。但我认为，当我思考当时的市场时，肯定有一些事情非常引人注目。显然，最大的一次是 9/11。当时我们在交易大厅，我清楚地记得看到布罗德街 85 号的窗户飘浮着一些纸片，然后转向我的同事说：“其中一些纸页被烧焦了。”然后我们都知道此后发生的事情。</p><p>遗憾的是，我们对第一架飞机起飞后发生的一切都处于前排。随后的市场显然受到了严重干扰。我们的国家受到严重干扰。但我记得市场重新开放的第一天我就接到了电话，第一个电话是来自富达的。他们说，只有今天才有买家。</p><p>里索兹：真的吗？</p><p>瓦格纳：是的。这是整个市场的一个主题，即使在今天，对我来说仍然很突出，第一天，没有人真正——除非他们不得不这样做，没有人在出售。这对我来说真的非常突出。因为那天我们都失去了很多朋友。</p><p>所以那是一个令人难以置信的难忘时刻。</p><p>我想说的另一件事也非常引人注目，那就是世通公司因竞争对手网络上发布的一份报告而倒闭的那一天。那天早上我很早就上班了，我们一直交易到正常时间，收盘后新闻就传来了，我最后一直交易到午夜。回到家，睡了几个小时，凌晨 3:30 或 4 点左右我回到座位，第二天晚上我就交易到晚上 8.30。这是我交易过的最赚钱的一天。</p><p>里索兹：不是开玩笑。</p><p>瓦格纳：这是我度过的最忙碌的一天。这实际上是一个交易大厅，我不知道有多少人。而因为发生了这件事，这名冒名顶替者也成为了众人关注的焦点。所以每个人都在关注那些世通债券的价格是上涨还是下跌，或者谁在买入，谁在卖出，交易规模有多大。那是一段极其紧张的时期，但这可能是我职业生涯中最愉快的 36 小时，因为它是如此令人兴奋。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你处于战斗机飞行员模式。<br />您甚至没有思考，您只是在响应 360 度输入。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，我的副手，如果你愿意的话，在交易台上，现在是一位非常成功的对冲基金经理，他和我至今还拿这件事开玩笑，说那一天是多么疯狂。因此，这一点之所以引人注目，只是因为市场上单个名字的巨大惊喜。你知道，该公司的债券会立即下跌 50、60、70 点，具体取决于其债券类型，即债券的久期。你知道你正在谈论消灭数十亿美元的资本，这对市场来说是一个巨大的冲击。</p><p>所以你知道，这是我脑海中最难忘的两天。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：还有世通公司，也许与安然公司或类似的公司不同。显然，有价值的资产只是我认为这是一个会计问题，伯尼·埃伯斯和杰克·所罗门以及发生的所有疯狂的事情。所以你最终会发现——所罗门公司的杰克·格鲁曼（Jack Grubman），对吧？我认为是对该股票的行为。所以你会看到这句话，嘿，你知道，1 美元 100 美分，这些都是灾难，但 1 美元 30 美分，有一些真正的……</p><p>瓦格纳：10 美分。</p><p>里索兹：10 美分。</p><p>瓦格纳：1 美元 10 美分非常值钱。 MCI 债券非常有价值。如果我记得的话，他们的价格低至 20 多岁或 30 多岁。而且回收率相当高。你知道，人们说这是会计欺诈。从某种意义上说，他们歪曲了事实，但信息就在那里。与许多此类情况一样，如果您挖掘得足够深，您可以相对较快地弄清楚发生了什么。</p><p>但有很多公司杠杆过高，甚至可能过度促销，但它们确实存在潜在价值。安然公司是另一个很好的例子，它在当时是另一个巨大的机会，但对于一些电信公司来说，机会就不那么大了。所以 -</p><p>里索兹：真的吗？</p><p>瓦格纳：嗯，你有很多企业，其中一个很突出，哦，我要在名字上留空。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：随着年龄的增长，情况会变得更糟。</p><p>瓦格纳：我知道，我完全清楚。现在，我这小小的大脑里，已经有数百个名字在嗡嗡作响。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：一旦硬盘填满，缓冲区就会溢出。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，已经满了。是的，有些东西必须让路。但当时的许多公司都在建设不需要的产能。技术正在进步到我们不再需要铺设那么多光纤的地步。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你还记得 Metromedia Fiber 和 Global Crossing，它们每英里铺设数千美元，然后以几美分的价格出售。</p><p>瓦格纳：便士。你知道，Metromedia，就是一个很好的例子，他们在城市拥有宝贵的资产。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>瓦格纳：但它们的价值不如安装成本。这就是为什么我认为在困境投资中，你可能犯的最严重的错误之一就是在你可能在困境中收购的资产上花了多少钱。没关系，花多少钱也没关系。</p><p>里索兹：对。它在市场上真正的价值是多少？</p><p>瓦格纳：唯一重要的是未来能产生多少现金流，仅此而已。任何投资，这才是最重要的。我们可以，我相信我们会参与其他一些正在做的事情。但归根结底，你要思考这项业务的内在价值是什么，即这项业务能够产生多少现金流。</p><p>评估不同企业的价值有不同的方法。例如，豪华资产的估值与基础设施资产或采矿业的无聊资产非常不同，比如说，风险也非常不同。但归根结底，它们产生的现金量是有一定依据的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：丹·格罗斯（Dan Gross）几年前写了一本书，名为《流行！为什么泡沫对经济有好处”，他的论点是，是的，让风投把所有的钱都花在铺设这条光纤上。当这种情况爆发时，我们花几分钱购买，在过去的几十年里，你会得到像 YouTube 或 Facebook 或任何需要所有带宽的东西，没有人愿意支付原始的钱，但以千分之一的价格，嘿，我们会采取一些带宽。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，随着时间的推移，这样的例子有很多。我认为有一件事与不良投资有关，与早期相比，不良投资在我们现在所做的事情中所占的比例较小。但这一直引起我的共鸣。瑞士信贷有一个高收益指数，他们有一个投资级贷款指数。他们拥有的一项没人真正谈论过的指数是不良债务指数。不良债务指数的长期回报率为负。</p><p>里索兹：有趣。这意味着倒闭的企业损失的资本比恢复的企业更多。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，或者稍微不同地说，当一家公司陷入困境时，假设这是分界线，假设债务的美元价值为 70 美分，从该日期开始，平均而言，该证券的最终价值会降低。</p><p>里索兹：这是有道理的。</p><p>瓦格纳：它告诉你的是，当公司开始遇到问题时，这并不一定是最低点。有两种类型的企业陷入困境。有些企业在某个时间点杠杆过高或管理不善，有些企业的商业模式有缺陷，或者在长期变革中处于错误的一边。最后两类非常危险，非常危险。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：在交易台工作的人告诉我，耐心是进行这些投资的关键属性，这已经不是第一次了。如果你过早进入第一共和银行，那么你的过早就等于错误。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，百分之一百，你知道，你知道，你的总回报才是最重要的，最终你知道购买正确是游戏的一半。没有人谈论的一半是正确的销售，这就是为什么我总是告诉人们来找我，说你知道你现在的好主意是什么吗？我好像没有给出想法，他们认为我隐瞒了一些事情。我不会隐瞒任何事情，但我必须记得在出售时给你回电话。这才是最困难的事情。</p><p>因此，每当你从某人那里得到提示时，这不仅仅是购买的提示，你还需要关于何时出售的提示，特别是如果这不是你的想法，所以我认为这是非专业投资公众经常丢失的事情之一，即购买是一半，你可以买对吗？</p><p>但我见过很多很多这样的例子：在一段时间内看起来不错的地方买进，但最终因为卖得不对而失败？</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我完全同意。</p><p>确实如此，鸡尾酒会上的闲聊，只是双输。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，有一些资产会在很长一段时间内持续升值，你知道，非常非常好的公司，如果你购买它们，你知道，持续地，你知道，你知道，你的退休帐户的整个想法，对，你每个月都在哪里购买，那太好了。这对你有用。您将获得非常可观的回报，因为您可能要等到年纪大了才会出售，但对于一个想法，请在您知道何时出售的时刻进行交易。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以，你在高盛不良资产部门与这些未来的传奇人物一起工作，接受了一流的教育，经历了烈火的洗礼，然后是什么让你产生了这样的想法：嘿，也许是时候从高盛毕业并推出我自己的基金了。你是怎么走到这一步的？</p><p>瓦格纳：你知道发生了很多事情。我想说我还有另一个独特的优势，那就是我的妻子也在这个行业，并且拥有非常成功的职业生涯。所以我总是开玩笑说我在家里有一个非常有价值的后盾，这意味着我有能力在个人破产的可能性较小的情况下承担一些风险。</p><p>所以这是一个巨大的优势，不容低估。在你的角落里有一个非常支持你的人，无论是配偶、重要的人、朋友、父母，无论是谁，这是在任何新事业中取得成功的重要因素。但我认为有几件事对我来说确实很突出。一，我正在管理或共同管理，我在高盛经营的上一家公司有一位联席主管，这是一个由 21 人组成的团队，我们在所有非投资级评级的资产中拥有大约 40 亿美元的资本，因此除银行贷款外的所有垃圾评级工具。</p><p>因此，每一种债券、CDS 合约、优先可转换债券、股票等等全部都放在我们的一张桌子上。我们跨越了股票和固定收益，这意味着我向两个部门的人员汇报，这至少可以说是具有挑战性的。但有一天我坐下来意识到，好吧，如果我自己做这件事，我有这么多人，我有这么多资本，我的薪资水平将会非常不同。</p><p>里索兹：（笑声）是的。</p><p>瓦格纳：所以这是一个非常重要的动力。我觉得我有能力做到这一点。这是重要的原因之一。其次，我想我一直想成为一名企业家。我一直对企业家有点着迷。我对他们着迷。当今世界上有很多伟大的企业家正在做着令人惊叹的事情。我总是着迷于他们如何取得成功，尤其是那些我认为真正改变世界的成功。</p><p>所以我认为这些是推动我到达那里的因素。我和父亲的一次谈话让我印象深刻。我就像和他谈论基金经济学是如何运作的以及它的好处是什么。我想，如果我们筹集 x 美元的资本并提供 y 回报，那么支付就是 z。这是所有可以顺利进行的事情。他说：“好吧，如果事情不这样怎么办？”</p><p>我说：“好吧，我（脏话被删除）了。”我想，“你什么意思？”就像，“这就是将要发生的事情。”他说：“好吧，如果没有怎么办？”</p><p>我说：“好吧，那么一切都会失败，我会损失一些钱，我将不得不出去寻找工作，你知道，但这没关系。”我想，“天哪，爸爸，你不认为我能做到吗？”他对我说，“我不会问你，因为我认为你做不到。我请你确保如果没有的话你也会没事的。”</p><p>在那个令人震惊的时刻，我想，哇，我是多么幸运，有一个不是在这个行业长大的父亲，当然也不是这方面的专家，但绝对是你必须考虑的事情的专家。那时我已婚，有两个孩子，我冒着很大的风险。他只是想确定，如果进展不顺利，我不会有事。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：如果最坏的情况是，“嘿，我得去其他公司找一份工作。”这并不是一个可怕的缺点。</p><p>瓦格纳：这就是我认为最坏的情况。然后我们到了 2008 年 10 月中旬——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：哦，你刚刚陷入了金融危机。</p><p>瓦格纳：我们立即陷入了灾难。 08 年 6 月 2 日，我们刚刚度过了 15 周年纪念日。所以我们推出了，几个月后世界几乎就结束了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：如果你在 08 年后投资不良资产就好了，对吧？</p><p>瓦格纳：我知道，你能想象吗？事实上，如果我有一点运气的话。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>瓦格纳：从这方面来说，这很棒，但有一个非常可怕的一天，就是高盛股票在首次公开募股后创下历史新低的那一天。我们是一个新基金。我们当时并没有那么大。我认为我们启动时的资本为 4.13 亿美元。所以这是一次很好的发射。几个月前，在贝尔斯登解约之前，我们已经承诺了 10 亿美元，而且承诺发生了变化。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>瓦格纳：当它改变了世界时，我们推出的产品远远低于我们预想的产品。作为新人，你知道，你没有多个主要经纪人，你没有多种关系。所以我们唯一的巅峰就是高盛。</p><p>我仍然持有高盛股票。我的妻子是高盛董事总经理，她拥有高盛股票。我们的现金都在高盛。我的资金现金在高盛。我突然意识到，如果高盛重蹈雷曼兄弟的覆辙，我可能会被消灭。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我必须关注一下这个。我已经准备好进入下一个对话了，但是对于那些在 08 年至 09 年期间还没有达到活跃交易年龄的听众来说，这是很难想象的。高盛重蹈雷曼兄弟的覆辙，在今天听起来很荒谬，但在 08 年秋天，这确实不是不可想象的。</p><p>瓦格纳：不，是的，这并不是因为高盛或任何其他银行出了问题。只是，如果信心丧失，高盛或几乎任何其他银行都将很难生存。</p><p>我们现在已经采取措施来帮助防范这种情况，但最终，没有一家银行能够真正免受信心下降的影响。我们只是在他们周围设置了障碍，以确保他们保持高度信心。最终，这就是我们的部分银行体系和最终资本主义的基础。我对此深信不疑。但对于那些正在倾听和思考这个问题的人来说，如果你认为走出去创办对冲基金是一个零风险的主张，那你就错了。它不是。</p><p>如果你想取得巨大的成功，无论是在投资界、对冲基金界还是在任何风险投资领域，最终，如果不付出一切，就很难取得巨大的成功。我真的没想到我会把这一切都赌上，但最终我还是这么做了。我会告诉你，这真的很激励人心。相对而言，我们 2008 年的表现非常好，2009 年的表现尤其出色。</p><p>因此，我认为我们有责任认识到我们所面临的时刻并愿意承担如此大的风险。这有点像，今天的人们在看到巨额财富时会感到沮丧，好吗？但你必须停下来想想为实现这一目标而冒的风险。也许今天最好的例子是埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)，他实现了几代人的财富，并出售了他的第一笔大笔胜利。</p><p>里索兹：贝宝。</p><p>瓦格纳：在 PayPal，然后冒着每一分钱的风险最终建立了三个不同的公司，无论你给他全部功劳还是部分功劳都无关紧要，他承担了最大的风险。</p><p>里索兹：他掷骰子，在某一时刻，如果特斯拉没有成功，他就会彻底破产。</p><p>瓦格纳：完全被消灭了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：想到某人取得了如此巨大的成功，然后说：“不，不，让我们把一切都放在红色上，然后转动方向盘，看看会发生什么，这真是令人震惊。”</p><p>瓦格纳：巨大的信念。我不得不说，通过投资赫兹直接与埃隆开展业务，我对他作为商人的信念深表敬意。我认为这可能概括了他的一些观点。最终，我只是相信这种性格在社会中很重要。重要的是，尤其是在资本主义社会中，要有敢于冒险的人，要有敢于冒险的人。</p><p>因为如果你不承担风险，你就不会获得回报。没有两种方法可以解决这个问题。你需要建立激励结构，让人们愿意承担这些风险。</p><p>有趣的是，埃隆中有一个人除了他的公司之外并没有真正拥有任何东西。他不是事物的获取者。他是企业的建设者。这就是他的全部重点。而且，对于整个市场来说，这样的人是好的。他们部署资本。他们发展业务。他们创造就业机会。最终，如果你退一步想想他对他的三大公司所做的事情，你会发现这是相当令人震惊的。</p><p>你知道，在特斯拉，它正在引领电动汽车革命，我们非常相信电动汽车的价值，不仅仅是因为它们对环境有益，尽管我认为关于它们对环境的益处存在着很好的争论。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：嗯，整个矿物、稀土以及这些物质的提取都是有问题的。</p><p>瓦格纳：是的，在电池寿命结束时如何处理电池并确保回收它们，这些事情都非常重要。我们如何发电为车辆充电，所有这些事情都需要考虑。但最终，长期运行电动汽车的成本明显低于内燃机汽车（即内燃机汽车）。</p><p>里索兹：毫无疑问。作为一个汽车人，如果我不说这是一个卓越的推进系统，那么当你踩高油门时，我就是在撒谎——踩油门，看看我是如何坚持术语的，当你在电动汽车中猛踩油门时，内燃机发动机无法与之匹敌，而且成本只是其中的一小部分。以前需要花费 100 万美元购买 1000 马力的产品，现在只需 20% 就能买到，这是一个令人震惊的变化。我不仅对埃隆给予了很大的赞扬，而且我非常相信杰夫·贝佐斯也应该得到一些赞扬，因为在亚马逊摧毁了如此多的零售业之后，是的，美国在其他谈话中也出现了过度零售的情况。我感觉到整个传统汽车制造商世界都在看着埃隆，并说嘿，我们不能让这个家伙对我们做贝索斯对零售业所做的事情，我们必须加紧努力。</p><p>瓦格纳：当然。我认为，看起来，还有其他一些出色的高管，你知道，玛丽·巴拉（Mary Barra）在通用汽车所做的事情以及他们推出的一些产品。是的，他们是，他们落后于特斯拉。我认为我没有说任何有争议的话。它们是令人惊叹的产品。我认为福特是世界上最大的商用车制造商，将会在电动汽车领域站稳脚跟，并推出一些相当引人注目的产品。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：当你不仅看到 Mustang Mach-E，还看到 F-150 Lightning 时，他们已经碾压了它。</p><p>瓦格纳：哦，是的。 ..</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你开过那辆皮卡吗？</p><p>瓦格纳：太棒了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：没有那么大的车辆可以那么快。太令人震惊了。</p><p>瓦格纳：这令人震惊，你知道，我法利是一位赛车运动大佬，所以我对此有一个你知道的、软弱的地方，显然玛丽，你知道与凯迪拉克一起进入耐力赛是非常有趣的。因此，有很多令人兴奋的事情正在发生，但我认为，当你看看你所知道的事情时，埃隆所做的事情并启动了这场革命，这对市场来说是一件好事，最终对社会来说也是一件好事。我们有一些与发电相关的事情需要做对，但这很好。</p><p> SpaceX 以及它将做什么……</p><p>里索兹：太棒了。</p><p>瓦格纳：……因为升力成本是由这种新的、最大的火箭决定的，我对这个名字不感兴趣，但这将是升力成本的令人难以置信的降低。我认为它比阿波罗计划便宜90%，这是令人震惊的。</p><p>最后，对于卫星业务以及我们可以为电信做些什么，如果不陷入某种深渊，就很难评估拥有数千颗真正能够抵御战略攻击、能够为整个地球服务并提供快速通信和数据的卫星有多么有价值，这对人类来说是令人难以置信的资源。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，特别是对于那些跳过固定电话和将铜线连接到死树上并直接使用移动​​电话的非工业化国家。</p><p>瓦格纳：对。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：无论您在地球的哪个地方，这都是数据、语音、通信。</p><p>瓦格纳：这太神奇了，那些事情将对人类产生非凡的影响。当我们为人们提供机会时，我坚信人性的力量。我认为在所有条件相同的情况下，他们往往会做出很好的反应。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我们在六月底记录了这一点，最近有消息传出，特斯拉与通用汽车和福特达成协议，为通用汽车和福特电动汽车提供他们庞大的充电器网络，这可能会改变游戏规则，也可能成为特斯拉未来几年的收入来源。</p><p>瓦格纳：当然，它的作用是开始减少人们最终感受到的里程焦虑。你知道，我们在赫兹和我身上看到的一件事，我必须归功于我们的首席执行官斯蒂芬·谢尔（Stephen Scherr），他在追求让更多车队电气化的目标方面确实令人难以置信，但他的团队关注的事情之一是超过 200 英里和 90 英里的行程百分比......</p><p> RITHOLTZ：个位数？类似的事情？</p><p>瓦格纳：这个比例非常低。大多数租赁天数少于 200 英里。大多数租赁，多日期间的总租赁体验少于 200 英里。因此，这种里程焦虑的想法只占人们最终出行的很小一部分。 And as we have access to more charging, and particularly charging in places where cars reside at rest, so restaurants, hotels, office buildings, homes, that&#39;s critically important.</p><p> And I think one of the big initiatives that I love that Stephen&#39;s pursuing at Hertz is to bring charging infrastructure into underserved communities. And that&#39;s something that he&#39;s working on with British Petroleum and Uber and state and city municipalities and kind of bringing that opportunity to areas where it&#39;s a little tougher, you know, to have charging infrastructure in the home.</p><p> So that&#39;s, you know, all of this is spurned by, you know, the initial foray of Tesla and EVs and then ultimately these other great companies following.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite fascinating. Let&#39;s talk a little bit about investing in sports. Tom Brady?</p><p> Tom Brady? How does this happen?</p><p> WAGNER: Well, Tom and I have known each other for a long time and we met through some mutual friends and our boys actually, his eldest son and my son were classmates for a number of years together at the school here in New York City. And so we get to know each other and then became friendly and then opportunities arose where we saw some pretty interesting things to do in sport. And if you&#39;re going to invest in sport, why not do it with somebody who has had unparalleled success in sport, not simply in so far as winning or winning percentages or statistics, but in the persistent performance at the highest level over an incredibly long period of time in a sport that is absolutely not known for longevity.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah to say that what&#39;s the average NFL career, three years? Although I think quarterbacks do a little better than that but he played at New England for decades.</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah a 23 year career and you know set just about every record that could possibly be set and I think did it in a way that you know left his legacy unlikely to be paralleled and what I mean by that is you know he brought others up. If you look at the performance of his teammates when they were with him vis-a-vis their performance elsewhere or the teams when he was with them versus when he wasn&#39;t, it&#39;s pretty clear that you know he is a key component of success.</p><p> So you know we wanted to understand that and tap into it and I think a lot of it has to do with nutrition and recovery and that&#39;s a big area of Tom&#39;s focus and so you know we&#39;ve looked at investments where we can partner together and bring some of that to bear.</p><p> Also where we can use his fame as a springboard to bring attention to a sport or an opportunity. So we&#39;ve done a handful of things together and I think there&#39;ll be more to come.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I love the concept of those rare players who make everyone around them better, whether it&#39;s Tom Brady or Michael Jordan or Derek Jeter or going down the list, there&#39;s something really interesting about it. I also love this headline, this Bloomberg headline, “Why a Hedge Fund Manager is Betting on Pickleball with Tom Brady and Former Number One Ranked World Tennis Player Kim Clijsters.”</p><p> Tell us about pickleball. I&#39;m a tennis player and I&#39;m terrified of pickleball because I don&#39;t want to affect my swing. Well I don&#39;t think that pickleball would damage in any way your swing. I think what we found interesting about pickleball is the enormous explosion of popularity in the US.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Fastest growing sport in the US.</p><p> WAGNER: Fastest growing sport. We liked the idea of a league with teams that are based in or connected to cities. You bring in a tribalism element to it which has proven very successful in sport over the years. We liked, you know, the idea that this would be something that would continue to grow. It&#39;s an early, early stage investment. It was not a particularly large investment, but it was something that we were excited about. And Tom and I have played pickleball and enjoy playing pickleball.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is he any good?</p><p> WAGNER: He&#39;s very good. People forget, by the way, his athleticism. He was a guy that was drafted in two different sports.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: And he&#39;s a super competitive human being.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s the thing I was thinking of. It&#39;s like Michael Jordan in golf. It doesn&#39;t matter what his skill level is, he is not going to back down.</p><p> WAGNER: No, I think there&#39;s a level of, you know, when you run into anybody who&#39;s incredibly successful in a given profession, they tend to be hyper-competitive. And so, you know, I think we saw the demographics and we&#39;re attracted to it and are quite excited about that opportunity. I think there&#39;s a long way to go to get the league to the point where it&#39;s, you know, really connecting on a commercial level. But I, you know, we think that there&#39;s a great tailwind there.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s discuss another sports investment. recording this at the end of June by the time this broadcasts you will have closed the deal to purchase Birmingham City FC in the English Football League. Why a soccer club? What motivates this and why the UK? That seems to be a little off the beaten path.</p><p> WAGNER: Well, we were really, really excited about the prospect of investing in Birmingham. There were a few things that drew us to that particular opportunity that were unique to Birmingham. So first it&#39;s England&#39;s second city. We understand it to be the youngest city in Europe. It&#39;s one of the fastest growing cities in in Europe, youngest professional population in Europe, very, very diverse population, and a city that is going through what I would characterize as sort of urban renewal where a lot of investment is coming in alongside you know a lot of new folks that are moving into the city.</p><p> And so all of those demographics were really, really interesting to us.</p><p> Then you have the named team in the city that had been under-invested in and had gotten a lot of things wrong, in our opinion, in the preceding years.</p><p> The fan experience was really subpar and candidly not fair relative to the incredibly passionate fan base that Birmingham City has. We just — you go there and you spend time with these folks and you talk to them, they are just amazing people. And we felt that one, there was an opportunity where we could turn the team around, we can talk a little bit about that, and two, where we could connect with the folks that are so passionate about this and effectively partner with them to make this a much better experience and hopefully a much more successful team.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk a little bit about that. What are you guys doing to turn around the team and also to kind of bring the stadium up to speed? It seemed to be a little neglected prior to your investment.</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, for recent past, almost a third of the seats in the stadium were not fit for use because of some structural issues in the stadium. That&#39;s being remediated. The pitch was in disrepair. The concessions, the quality of the seats, the overall look of the stadium, the electronics, Wi-Fi, everything was either not there, not working, or in a state of disrepair.</p><p> And so I think improving all of those things and more will really improve the fan experience. And that&#39;s important, right? It&#39;s not simply what&#39;s going on in the pitch, it&#39;s the overall experience, particularly if you&#39;re going with friends or family or what have you.</p><p> We need to make that experience commensurate with the legacy of the team.</p><p> The second thing is obviously the competitiveness on the field. That is something that is constrained by the English Football League rules, which require that you not spend more than the revenue that you make.</p><p> So you can&#39;t just go out and say, “I&#39;m going to spend an ungodly sum of money.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So wait a sec. So let me get up to speed on this because I don&#39;t know those rules. This isn&#39;t like a salary cap like Major League Baseball has with the penalty if you go over. It&#39;s hey whatever you generate is how much you can spend. You would think people would do whatever they could to get more butts in the seats to generate more revenue.</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah you have to have, that&#39;s why I say it has to be a partnership with the fans. You have to create an experience where people want to support the team and then ultimately you have to be prudent in allocating those pounds to the players that will perform in the field. And that&#39;s obviously incumbent on our team to get that right. But it&#39;s not one thing, Barry, it&#39;s everything. We have to work on every element of this and turn around every element of the team. It&#39;s different sponsors, it&#39;s different partners, it&#39;s different oversight, it&#39;s different management, it&#39;s different talent acquisition. All of it has to be changed. And certainly we won&#39;t be able to do that overnight, but we&#39;re going to start the process immediately and get to a place where our hope is to field an immediately competitive team and then ultimately do all of the things that we need to do to make it permanently competitive.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So is this a fun investment or is this, “Hey, we&#39;re looking for this sort of ROI and this sort of return over time.” How do you — because I think of Steve Cohen&#39;s acquisition of New York Mets, which, by the way, you go to Citi Field, the whole experience is next level compared to what it was like in the — I grew up with Shea Stadium and it was a little bit of a sad compared to Yankee Stadium. Now, I don&#39;t know if this has blasted me, City Fields is nicer than the new Yankee Stadium. It&#39;s amazing.</p><p> So tell us a little bit about the thought process on this.</p><p> WAGNER: Well, I think you&#39;ve touched on something. I grew up outside of Boston and I was a Red Sox supporter and I go to Fenway and that experience in the seventies is very …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Pretty unique.</p><p> WAGNER: … different than what you have today.</p><p>里索兹：对。<br /> WAGNER: It&#39;s much better, same stadium, but a much better, much different experience, more engaging for the fans, particularly on the weekends when you have a lot of family activities. And so I think the whole fan engagement needs to change. Some of what we&#39;re doing in Birmingham is bringing in different sponsors that bring an element of cool, for lack of a better word, to the team.</p><p> Right? This is a team that should be viewed differently than it has been, we&#39;re trying to demonstrate by way of drawing sponsors in that have never been associated with being attached to a particular sports franchise into the realm to raise the profile.</p><p> All of those things matter in the context of helping to improve the overall performance of the team because it helps to improve your overall revenue. So those are all things that we&#39;re working on.</p><p> But when you ask the question about prospective returns, look, sports franchises have proven to be pretty consistently appreciating assets over time. There&#39;s a variety of reasons for that. We don&#39;t think that that changes in the near or intermediate term. So from that perspective, we believe there&#39;s a tailwind there.</p><p> However, what we see in Birmingham is a unique opportunity to fix some things that have been done incorrectly, to invest appropriately in the infrastructure, and to position the team to achieve the level of success that it had had looking back a couple of decades ago.</p><p> If we get all those things right, obviously we&#39;ve created a lot of value for our investors and I think we have the right team of people to help us do that, both internally and externally. So I think our focus in Birmingham is let&#39;s not worry about how much money we make, let&#39;s worry about getting it right, making the right decisions, the success will follow.</p><p> And I think that&#39;s the case in any turnaround investment. Don&#39;t say I need to do X so I can make Y in return. Focus on making the changes you need to make to allow the business to be more successful, the returns will follow.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m fascinated by the idea of the revenue cap. Does that apply to the team or the stadium? Like if Taylor Swift comes in and does a show and you capture some revenue for hosting that, can you apply that to the team or is that the stadium a separate revenue — its venue?</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s all part of the calculation. If the two are owned, in the same entity, which ours will be, our stake in the team and our ownership of the stadium, will all be in the same entity. So we&#39;re focused on doing all kinds of things that will lead to additional revenue generation. But taking a step back from that for a moment, it&#39;s about creating a culture of success around that organization. And that goes beyond the bottom line, if you will.</p><p> It&#39;s about creating the right types of events that draw the community in. So this becomes a focal point for the community. –</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Cultural center.</p><p> WAGNER: Cultural center.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> WAGNER: And if you think about English football, It is, in many respects, for a substantial part of the population, the cultural hub of the community. And if you can make that a better experience, not just on match day, but beyond that, and bring the community into the organization, now you&#39;ve really started to achieve success.</p><p> And one of the things that we love about Birmingham is it sits in the middle of the country. It&#39;ll be the hub of the new high-speed rail system in the sense that 80% of the English population will be within a one hour train ride of Birmingham.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> WAGNER: When HS2 or high speed rail two is completed, looking out eight, 10 years from now, that&#39;s an extraordinary thing. Birmingham could end up being a location that folks visit for football matches, concerts, other sporting events, whether it&#39;s football or rugby or what have you, motorsport, There could be a whole series of things that could occur in Birmingham and quite frankly, if not Birmingham, then why anywhere else?</p><p> It will be so accessible to so many people, such a huge percentage of the population, that why not make it a center for sport?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: How many seats does the stadium hold and how far can that be expanded?</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s about 29,000.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, so that&#39;s a substantial stadium.</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s a good size. I think we&#39;ve got to look at the infrastructure there and decide what&#39;s best for the long-term needs of the team and the community. And so, you know, we&#39;re early days and so all those things will be looked at. I think for us, the immediate focus is let&#39;s make this more fun for the fans.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You mentioned motorsports. Again, relatively new breaking news. Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhaney just bought 25% stake in the Alpine F1 team. Tell us about motorsports, any aspirations in that area?</p><p> WAGNER: Well, we have an investment in motorsport. We own a World Endurance Championship racing team. So endurance racing is, I think, 24 hours of Le Mans, 24 hours of Daytona. We have the only private team in the WEC, or World Endurance Championship race this season. That is a series that is run, one race in the US and a series throughout Europe, Middle East and Asia and we&#39;re quite excited about it.</p><p> You know, world endurance racing used to be more popular than F1 if you go back into the 60s and 70s and has re-emerged with a new class of hypercars that were introduced and you&#39;ve got all these luxury brands getting into it. So Porsche, which manufactures the car that we&#39;re racing and we&#39;re thrilled to do that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Dakar 911? Is that the car?</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s actually a 963 so it&#39;s a purpose-built car for endurance racing. It looks like an F1 car with an enclosure over the driver, because they&#39;re in some cases driving, the team of drivers is driving for 24 hours in any weather condition.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: And so Porsche&#39;s involved, we&#39;ve got Ferrari, Lamborghini&#39;s entering next year, BMW is entering next year, Alpines coming in, Cadillac has a very competitive team, Peugeot. So there&#39;s, if you look at all these great manufacturers are getting back into endurance racing, it&#39;s really exciting. And we are tickled to be involved with it. And so we&#39;ve brought in some of our partners. Brady Brand, not surprisingly, is involved with the team. A couple of other companies that we&#39;re invested in, one being Singer Vehicle Design, was responsible for putting together the livery or the paint scheme on the car is a sponsor as well.</p><p> So we&#39;re really excited about that. We&#39;re looking at other opportunities in motorsport or expanding our existing investment and trying to think about how it fits within the ecosystem of investments we have in the portfolio. Anything that we do in sport, we try to think about how does it fit within other investments in our longer term thesis around a given industry or sector.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s interesting you mentioned the older days of endurance racing. It really was launched as a way for companies to show, look how solidly built and reliable our vehicles are. We can run them flat out. I was just watching something on the Mille Miglia in Italy and I think it was Sterling, I&#39;m trying to remember who set the record over a thousand miles, he averaged a hundred miles per hour, which is insane because you&#39;re just going through towns and that record has never been beat.</p><p> But when you do that, and I think that was in a Mercedes back in the 50s or 60s, when you do that, hey, the brand&#39;s reputation for reliability, hard to top. I know Porsche put out this, what was it, it was a Dakar racer, which is based on their actual racing vehicle. And then Lamborghini just took, I think it&#39;s a Huracan that they turned into an off-road vehicle, which looks ridiculous. And of course everything Singer touches is just gorgeous.</p><p> So having them do the paint and the interior is, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s going to be spectacular.</p><p> WAGNER: No, it&#39;s an area where there&#39;s a distinct business case for the manufacturers to be involved in endurance racing. It does showcase exactly the things that you&#39;re speaking to. Each of these manufacturers is going to develop a motor and a drivetrain. They&#39;re all hybrid cars, which we love. But if you look at the endurance series, you&#39;ve always had GT cars in there, although I think for next year, because of the number of hypercars that will be in the class, races like Le Mans won&#39;t have a GT race at the same time. And it could just be too many of these supercars on the track to do that.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: But nonetheless, the expansion to include other luxury brands is really interesting. And I have to say, having attended Le Mans this year, it is an unbelievable event. To have a 24-hour long race, there&#39;s all kinds of things that happen. You&#39;re always going to experience problems. It&#39;s a fascinating thing to watch.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite fascinating.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk a little bit about distressed investing. Your firm runs private credit, commercial real estate, long-short real estate, and insurance, as well as an asset management shop, and some of the sports investing we&#39;ve talked about previously. How do all these separate businesses and approaches, do they work together or are they all separately siloed? What&#39;s the, to use a dirty word, synergy between all these different divisions?</p><p> WAGNER: I think at our core, we&#39;re value investors. So we&#39;re looking for situations where we believe in virtually any scenario, we have no or a very, very low risk of impairment. Meaning we won&#39;t lose money, that&#39;s the goal.</p><p> And whether it&#39;s a turnaround situation or a private loan, or even a private equity situation, or growth capital for a smaller company. In each of those situations, we&#39;re trying to structure the investment where we believe that if our thesis is wrong, that we won&#39;t lose money.</p><p> And the way that these all fit together is that the duration of capital that we manage is quite long. So most of our capital is either permanent capital, meaning we are the manager of it forever, or it&#39;s very long dated in the case of a closed end fund, where we have five, seven, or 10 years to invest the capital.</p><p> And that affords us an advantage versus a number of other firms in that we can take a long term view, or we can make a commitment that requires a long term time horizon. And there&#39;s a lot of extra return to be had if you&#39;re willing to take a longer view. There&#39;s still a huge premium on liquidity in the market today. There has been since the global financial crisis, I think the premium for illiquidity today is as high as I&#39;ve ever seen in my career.</p><p> So I think in those investments, the common thread is value. In our real estate lending business, that&#39;s a function of what we do on behalf of the insurance company that we manage assets for, which is a related entity. And in real estate lending, that&#39;s all about avoiding loss. It&#39;s just super conservative.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about taking a long-term view in the middle of 2021. We&#39;re right in the middle of the pandemic, COVID lockdown, travel and tourism just collapsed. You guys say, “Hey, I know what we should do. Let&#39;s launch a billion and a half dollar fund, a distressed travel and tourism fund with people at Certares Management.” Tell us a little bit about the CK Opportunities Fund.</p><p> WAGNER: Well the thought process there on that that fund which is you know closed now was to raise money to pursue opportunities in travel, leisure, and hospitality.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: All of which by the way have come back gangbusters.</p><p> WAGNER: Most, yes most of it has. Business travel still lagging pretty significantly but certainly personal travel is up dramatically you know even vis-a-vis 2019 and the thesis was you know this isn&#39;t a permanent thing that we were experiencing in 2020, it would be temporary. The challenge was going out and raising capital with two asset managers that hadn&#39;t worked together before and doing that capital raise entirely over Zoom. That was new, but we did. I don&#39;t think we had more than one or two in-person meetings for that capital raise so it was a very interesting time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Did people say “Tom, what the hell are you doing? You&#39;re nuts, these businesses are …” or did people get it right away?</p><p> WAGNER: No, they said you know how do you know it won&#39;t get worse and if it does get worse, you know, we lose money. I think everyone sort of acknowledged that if travel was dead forever, we had much bigger problems.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah.</p><p> WAGNER: Right and so the general view was if I&#39;m going to take risk I may as well take it in an area that is more likely than not to rebound and so what was incumbent on us is finding the opportunities where we could say with a straight face we don&#39;t think we can lose money, we think we have lot of upside.</p><p> And so that&#39;s what we endeavored to pursue.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So it&#39;s only been two years, is this a seven-year fund or a five-year fund?</p><p> WAGNER: Well the goal is to is to have you know begin returning capital in kind of years two and three and ultimately have the average duration of that fund between three and five years.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So to…</p><p> WAGNER: Some investments will ultimately go a bit longer, some will hopefully pay out more quickly but with the average sort of in that you know mid-single-digit zip code or less.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So two years post launch, how&#39;s it going?</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s gone very well. Our returns have been well above what we had, you know, what we had targeted when we spoke with our LPs about it. And so we&#39;re excited. We love the portfolio. We love the forward on the portfolio. Very, very constructive on each of the names in the portfolio. I don&#39;t really regret, you know, any of the investments. I think we&#39;ll have some that are better than others but you know we&#39;re quite excited about it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about another sort of contrarian distressed investing play. We had this horrific and infamous California fire called the Camp Fire. Soon after PG&amp;E, the giant power provider there, ends up filing for bankruptcy. They were blamed as one of the possible causes of the wildfire. Who looks at that and says, “Hey, this is an amazing opportunity. One of the biggest power producers in the country has gone belly-up. How do I get me some of that?</p><p> And did you look at that from the bonds pre-bankruptcy or equity post-bankruptcy?</p><p> WAGNER: We looked at it as the equity, a little bit pre-bankruptcy, and then grew our position following the bankruptcy.</p><p> And the thesis was that there would be a way to ensure that the victims received fair compensation but still allowed for the equity to have some upside.</p><p> And the thesis was let&#39;s strike deals with the victims&#39; attorneys and let&#39;s strike deals with the regulators and the government and strike deals with the bondholders and move the company through bankruptcy. It&#39;s a very, very contentious negotiation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I can imagine.</p><p> WAGNER: And particularly given that it moved into the spring of 2020. So we were, you know, we were trying to get that restructuring done in the depths of COVID. It ultimately worked. It was a, it was a good investment for us where, you know, we monetized that and redeploy the capital elsewhere.</p><p> You know, our goal was, in that case, to sort of fix what we could fix and then and then move on.</p><p> And so I think, you know, we&#39;re quite proud of, of the work that went into that and ultimately think that each of the stakeholder groups came away satisfied, or at least that&#39;s what they represented to us.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s talk about another investment that you referenced earlier.</p><p> Hertz, a former Fortune 500 company, files for bankruptcy pretty early in the pandemic, May 2020. Subsequently they sell off their fleet of cars because we&#39;re just not getting new cars. What made you think, “Oh, this dumpster fire is a great opportunity?”</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, that one was really predicated on three key tenets. One was that there was an opportunity to electrify a big chunk of the fleet, which required us cutting deals with major OEMs to get access to that supply. The second was in pursuing a new, if you will, line of business for the company in providing cars to ride hail drivers. Then the third would be a more effective way of disposing of the vehicles when you come to the end of their life and that required cutting a deal with Carvana. All of those initiatives are well underway. We&#39;re really happy with all of them.</p><p> Our partners, you know, in Carvana and Uber, Tesla, GM, Polestar are all going really, really well. And we have a great leadership team that Stephen Scherr is running that&#39;s doing an exceptional job in prosecuting that business plan.</p><p> And so, you know, that was really predicated on those three core tenets.</p><p> Now, what happened was a bit of luck. And the luck was that we had a massive chip shortage. And so the price, the new cars became unavailable, used cars rocketed up in value. So we over earned for a period of a couple of years, really were able to de-risk the investment. So, you know, this is all public, our ownership of the company immediately following the IPO was about 37%. We announced a large buyback and today our ownership stands in the high 50s percent, if I remember correctly.</p><p> So that&#39;s an ability where we didn&#39;t have to put new dollars to work. We were simply reinvesting the cash flow of the company and all shareholders that held have benefited by owning a larger percentage of the company without having to put any more capital to work.</p><p> So, you know, I think, you know, we&#39;re really pleased about the forward on that one. We&#39;re excited about the prospects of the business to continue growing in these new lines of business. And, ultimately I think it will pay enormous dividends.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let me talk about a space that is a little off the beaten path for you guys. Long, short evergreen fund that just seems so separate and different from what you guys have done with distressed assets?</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, you know, our legacy hedge fund is a long short vehicle. It&#39;s hedged. The rationale there is that not every investor wants a long only set of assets that has more volatility in down markets. So the hedge fund has less volatility but obviously you have a cost of hedging associated with it. And there are certain investors for whom that is exactly the right product.</p><p> And so it&#39;s a part of the business that we will always pursue because we can still do some of the same things in the event and long side that we do in our closed-end funds and our permanent capital vehicles but on a more hedged basis.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite fascinating.</p><p> So first, you know, we talked a little bit about you being a CPA at Ernst &amp; Young in Massachusetts but I, but I also noticed you were a CPA at one of my favorite places in the world, the Cayman Islands. Was that just to service offshore hedge funds or how did that come about?</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s a kind of a funny story. I was based out of the Boston office working for Ernst &amp; Young and I came to New York. I shouldn&#39;t say came to New York. I was “asked” quote unquote, meaning I was told …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Got to New York.</p><p> WAGNER: Go to New York, work on a project there. that project was at an investment bank and taking a look at their internal controls around derivative products and …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What year was this around?</p><p> WAGNER: This would have been 94, 95, in that zip code.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Also derivative products. There still were exits in it back …</p><p> WAGNER: Exactly, early, early days and I had had some experience in valuing derivative contracts on an earlier project I worked on so I was sort of a unique individual in the sense that I was a CPA who had some of that experience back then.</p><p> And so I came to New York and it was my first exposure to investment banks and trading floor and I walked on to the trading floor and I was like I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on here but I have to do this. And I remember walking back down to the room where all the consultants and accountants were and I said what exactly are you doing up there? And the guy explained, you know, sales, trading and I said I need to be a trader that&#39;s what I got to do. And the guy literally burst out laughing.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: He&#39;s like, “You&#39;re never going to be a trader on Wall Street.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s hilarious.</p><p> WAGNER: “Your background&#39;s all wrong, you&#39;re a CPA. You didn&#39;t go to the right Ivy League school. You didn&#39;t go to an Ivy League school.” And so I met up with a friend and said, “How do I become a trader?” And this person was doing recruiting at one of the big banks and she&#39;s like, “Well, you need some interesting experience. You got to get into a top business school and then you got to do an internship and then you can be a trader.”</p><p> And so I&#39;m like, “Oh my gosh, that&#39;s going to take like five years. Okay, I&#39;m going to do that.” So I endeavor to find the right opportunity. So I&#39;m looking around, I can&#39;t really find anything. But I meet a guy in this project who is from our Cayman Islands office. So I go back to Boston, I&#39;m working in the office, and I&#39;ll never forget this. I&#39;m at my parents&#39; house with their closest friends on a Sunday afternoon and I&#39;m kind of bummed out. And my dad&#39;s best friend looks at me and he goes, “What&#39;s the problem?” And I said, “Well, I&#39;m unhappy with everything in my life right now. Everything sucks.” And he&#39;s like, “Well, what do you want?” I&#39;m like, “Ah, it can&#39;t happen.” He&#39;s like, “No, you have to be able to say it. What do you want?” I said, “Okay, you want to know what I want? I want to make this much money, X dollars. I want to live on the beach, I want to own a boat, and I want to be able to drive a Jeep to work every day. That&#39;s what I want, okay?”</p><p> And I was like being the smart ass and young man, and I thought like, you know, there, I kind of told him. And so he just looked at me, he didn&#39;t say anything, and he goes, “Well,” he goes, “That door will be open, or will be presented to you.” He goes, “The question is, do you have the guts to open it?”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wow.</p><p> WAGNER: And so I was like, what is he talking about, right? And so six months later, the opportunity arose to go to work in the Cayman Islands. And this is pre-internet days.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: So I had to go down to the local travel agent and pick up brochures at Cayman Islands just so I have some idea of where it was, what it looked like. Sight unseen, I grabbed my bags, and I literally moved there. And within a month of getting there, I had bought a Jeep to drive to work, I bought a little boat to go around.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No top, right?</p><p> WAGNER: No top, yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Just open air.</p><p> WAGNER: Except in the summer, it rained all the time.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: And I lived on the beach and I had a job that was paying me what I felt was my target pay back when I was a kid. And had I not done that, it wouldn&#39;t have led to me getting the unique experience that ultimately allowed me to get into Columbia Business School. And so it was a life-changing moment. But my dad&#39;s friend was exactly right. That was not an easy door to open because I had to take a leap of faith that was pretty extraordinary back in that time. I literally had no idea. There was no ability to go on and look at TripAdvisor and see, you know, where the restaurants were. I had to go down their site on scene. I had a couple of phone calls with folks that work down there and so it was a life-changing set of experiences for many reasons.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I got so many questions for you. So first, if you didn&#39;t have that conversation with your dad&#39;s friends, when the opportunity came along, might it have passed you by or did his words resonate in your head and you just jumped at it because of that?</p><p> WAGNER: They resonated. I mean, you know, I think in life, you know, when you, when I, when I look at those key experiences, like, you know, we spoke earlier about my dad and the question he asked me when I started my hedge fund or my dad&#39;s friend when he challenged me to take the opportunity when it presented himself. And he had no idea what would be presented to me, nor did I at that time. Or looking at my uncle and his success in accounting. You know, those are all small but incredibly important things in the sense that they position you for success.</p><p> Now, the question that every young person or person starting out has to ask is, “Are you willing to do what it takes then when you set the path in motion?” The easy part is taking the first step. The hard part is taking the steps in the middle of the night when you&#39;re up late working, you haven&#39;t slept in two days and you&#39;re working on a big project because you&#39;re trying to make a name for yourself, or the things that no one likes to talk about, the missed golf trips with friends, the forgiven vacations, the canceled trips, the missed birthday party for a kid. You know, those are all the little sacrifices we make to achieve some level of success. I think the goal is to minimize those things or to focus your sacrifices in areas that aren&#39;t really that important.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let me push back a little bit on your characterization of your father&#39;s friend as a small thing. That was a giant attitude shift. That was a philosophical, “Hey, there are opportunities in life that come along and you have to grab the ring when it presents itself and not sort of sit back and say, &#39;I&#39;ll wait for the next train to come along.&#39;” That&#39;s a huge philosophical change.</p><p> WAGNER: It was a small moment in time and a huge shift in the course of my life.</p><p> And you know, I think I was always very motivated to work. I was not always very motivated to study or do homework. But I really liked to work. And I worked a lot in high school. I worked a lot in college. I worked a lot after college and business school. I liked, you know, working. I liked making money, because it afforded me freedoms that I didn&#39;t otherwise have. And so what that question did was cause me to think to myself about what risks I would have to take to get to where I wanted to be. And it was a very important lesson that ultimately resonated when it was time for me to think about starting my own business.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you were in the Caymans in the mid-90s? For how long were you there?</p><p> WAGNER: Two years. And I would say that it sounds better and more exciting in theory than it is in practice.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Come on, is there a better burger in the world than the Sunshine Grill?</p><p> WAGNER: No, there were some pretty spectacular places to go there.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: And it was enormous fun. You know, you have to kind of settle into whatever routine is best for you. I was, you know, you can only kind of go out every night of the week for so long. And some people, I guess, can do that forever. I was not one of them.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Nobody can do it forever. Eventually it takes a toll, right?</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, but I got really into scuba diving. I got really into martial arts. and those were things that helped me create some balance in my life at that time. Those are things that I don&#39;t still participate in today for a variety of reasons. Showing up to work with cracked ribs is not super comfortable, but I think the ability to branch out and experience and try new things in any, doesn&#39;t matter where you live, those are great things to do.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: And living in a place that is very culturally different than what you experience. I was definitively a minority in every way. There were very few Americans there.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A lot of Canadians.</p><p> WAGNER: Tons of Canadians, lots of Brits, right? So you, meaning if Brits and colonies —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I mean, it&#39;s a British territory. I think it&#39;s independent, but there were photos of the queen the last time was there.</p><p> WAGNER: There&#39;s still a governor there that&#39;s appointed by now the king. And it&#39;s a very interesting, very close ties to the UK. And so it was a really fascinating place, not only to work and to recreate, but also to be part of society. I learned a lot, some incredible lessons taken from my time there. So it was a great two years, and a truly life-changing period for me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I have a bunch of friends who were in finance and banking from Canada, and they go down there for a spell, and they never leave. So not only is the Grand Caymans the first place I&#39;ve ever had poutine, but hold that aside, over the past 20 years, the island has just completely transformed. You have the Dart family that flip over a styrofoam cup, it says Dart. It&#39;s that family that have just invested literally billions and billions of dollars. The island is practically South Florida. I mean, it&#39;s very modern, very contemporary, and beautiful. And every time I think about buying something down there, it&#39;s an island. It&#39;s the only problem.</p><p> So getting anything there, do they still have like a 50% or 100% tax on bringing even like an old clunker jeep, you&#39;re going to pay double the price.</p><p> WAGNER: Yes, big, big tax on vehicles there. No income tax though. So for US citizens you have a limit, but in most other countries they&#39;re not taxed in their worldwide income. So if you&#39;re a UK citizen or Australian or South African or Canadian, which constituted a lot of the employees there, you&#39;re earning tax-free income forever.</p><p> Now you pay effectively your taxes through consumption taxes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Plus the stamp tax to purchase property is another thing. Turks and Caicos has a very similar sort of financial setup. By the way, two of the most beautiful areas when you look at whether it&#39;s sailing or snorkeling or scuba diving, second to none, and maybe the Great Barrier Reef is the closest thing.</p><p> WAGNER: Cayman&#39;s amazing in that regard. Now what they&#39;ve also done is they&#39;ve worked really hard to build a real financial services sector there. So our insurance company is actually based there. Our employees are there. We have a prime, it&#39;s not a reinsurance subsidiary, it&#39;s a real primary insurer that&#39;s located in the Cayman Island. And we ultimately became comfortable with that jurisdiction because I had contacts there, and we were able to, people I maintained contact with from my time there that gave us great comfort in what they were doing in building out the insurance industry and it&#39;s been a fantastic jurisdiction.</p><p> And I always say, when people ask you, your insurance company&#39;s based in the Cayman Islands, I said, listen, if I put a blindfold on you and I take you there and I remove the blindfold outside our office, you will swear you&#39;re on coconut grove.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: Like you won&#39;t, for a second, think that you&#39;re not in South Florida and it&#39;s become very much a first world financial hub. And I would not be surprised to see its growth continue unabated for the next couple decades.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: First World Healthcare, First World Internet, First World Financials Network. Hard to beat. Since you mentioned the insurance company, I got to ask, you&#39;re running a hedge fund, why an insurance business? Is it the float to play with the way Buffett does with Geico, or how does this interrelate with the rest of the business?</p><p> WAGNER: So it&#39;s an annuity business. So unlike property and casualty, where the key is making money by underwriting your risk very, very efficiently and earning a profit on your underwriting. In an annuity business it&#39;s a spread business. So we&#39;re taking capital in, we&#39;re investing it, we owe our annuity holders a fixed return so we have to manage to make a higher return on our diversified pool of assets than what we are required to pay out to the annuity holder. That&#39;s the whole game and that that comports very well with our strategy of deep value investing and looking for opportunities where we can preserve capital, not lose money.</p><p> Again, it comes back to that same core thesis. So the draw initially was the duration of the capital. You start an insurance company so long as you maintain control of the assets. They&#39;re effectively permanent assets.</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p> WAGNER: And again, going back to that point about the excess return that you can earn by having long dated capital, it&#39;s really an extraordinary pickup in total yield. And so we, this is the most exciting thing we do that we&#39;re thrilled about it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I would never have guessed that. I have to ask the obvious question. Since we&#39;ve seen a 500 basis point bump in rates, what do higher rates do for running an insurance book?</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, for the annuity business, it&#39;s the spread between the assets that we&#39;re buying and the annuity rates. So while the annuity rates have gone up by quite a bit, the yield on the assets we&#39;re buying has gone up by slightly more.</p><p> So our total return to the equity has increased. So I would say that this environment is just about perfect for the insurance business.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: All right, so let&#39;s talk about a different business line that I&#39;m kind of fascinated by. Ever since the pandemic ends, it looks like commercial real estate has been poised on the brink of disaster, especially offices. How do you look at CRE and what sort of opportunities are there in the world of real estate?</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, we will definitely be heavily involved there if the sector or if individual opportunities become distressed. I think we are taking a wait and see and very patient approach right now. We&#39;re trying to sort out what work from home means for demand for office space. It&#39;s just challenging, right? It&#39;s not as if, if people are working three days a week, you still need the same amount of office if they&#39;re all there at the same time.</p><p> So what it means is utilization has shifted. We may need to change the way that we use offices. We&#39;re spending a lot of time thinking about that. We need to change the places where we have offices. So we have more people working outside of New York now than ever before. And we&#39;re perfectly comfortable with that. We provide greater flexibility in where people work from. But I think as it relates to CRE, the two big components are answering that first question around aggregate demand.</p><p> And then the second is answering questions around, you know, are some cities and jurisdictions poised for more success than others? Will some be more permanently challenged? Those are the big unknowns. You know, we need some real restructuring in some of our major cities to make them attractive for business again.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, San Francisco and St. Louis stand out as two real basket cases. New York seems to be coming back raises the question of those that if you&#39;re there three days a week can you do the sort of hot desk that allows you to use half the space, “Hey you&#39;re Monday Wednesday Friday, this person is Tuesday Thursday and everybody is in pick a day, Wednesday.”</p><p> WAGNER: Right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do you really need you know a thousand desks for a thousand employees or can you get away with 600 desks/</p><p> WAGNER: Well if you have everybody in that one day a week you need the thousand desks the question is do you need as many offices do you miss as many conference rooms, that&#39;s an unknown and I think we&#39;re all, every business, it&#39;s not just the commercial real estate companies that are thinking about it, we&#39;re all thinking about it because either you&#39;re a provider of that capacity or a user of that capacity and both sides of the equation have to make a determination as to what the appropriate level of space is and we&#39;re in that boat with everybody else.</p><p> So I think for us in commercial real estate, we haven&#39;t seen any opportunities that have really caught our eye yet, but it&#39;s definitely an area to watch.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes, no doubt about it. I&#39;m kind of fascinated that return to office, at least in the metropolitan areas, are 55-60% in the US, but Europe is running 90-95%, whether that&#39;s better mass transit, shorter commutes, or smaller houses where you can&#39;t just set up a home office as easily as we do here.</p><p> WAGNER: Well, that&#39;s a good point. I think it&#39;s probably a combination of those factors. Also some societal differences as it relates to what&#39;s accepted. I mean if you if you go to London, there are a few things that really stand out. One, that this casual dress is not something that&#39;s been as fully adopted.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh really?</p><p> WAGNER: No it&#39;s …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I mean just for the record you and I are both in whitish shirts, darker blue blazers, I&#39;m wearing jeans, you&#39;re wearing khakis, but would either of us really ever wear a tie unless we&#39;re presenting at some event where it says “suit and tie”?</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, no, and if you go to London and you&#39;re in the center of London City, you&#39;ll see a lot of people in suits, more than you see in New York. There&#39;s a level of formality perhaps that exists there. It&#39;s also an incredibly vibrant place. The city centers in the UK are, you know, fully back relative to pre-pandemic.</p><p> So, you know, we&#39;ve got to think about whether or not we&#39;re doing our broader community a favor or a disservice by not being in our city centers as much as we were pre-pandemic. And that goes beyond simply what&#39;s best for work.</p><p> And, you know, can you get the work done? No, it&#39;s can you develop the young talent, right? Are you supporting your metropolitan area, meaning all of those businesses that rely on the people coming in and out. All of these things are really important and you can&#39;t just flip a light switch and make it all change instantaneously. If you&#39;re going to shift the way those things happen you have to plan for it. You have to think about how you&#39;re going to train your young people. You have to think about how businesses can move from city centers out to the local communities where people will spend an increasing period of time.</p><p> So I believe that we will see some level of de-urbanization over time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: De-urbanization.</p><p> WAGNER: De-urbanization. And I think it&#39;s, there&#39;s a variety of reasons for it. A lot of it&#39;s based on our views on mobility. I think that, you know, as we see greater levels of automation, as we see greater levels of electrification, which are tied hand-in-hand, it&#39;ll become easier to travel. It&#39;s not as much of a burden. People will be able to live and commute more, particularly if they&#39;re not commuting five days a week. So there&#39;s a lot of big changes that I think will occur over the next 10 or 15 years.</p><p> The worst thing we can do is try to force those changes in 12 or 24 months too fast.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Professor Scott Galloway at NYU Stern talks about the disservice we do to the youngest employees who need to come in, learn the ropes, be mentored, actually have some face time. You know, if you&#39;re old folks like us and you&#39;ve been doing this for a number of decades, you don&#39;t have to be in the office five days a week. Two or three days is plenty.</p><p> But if you&#39;re early in your career and you talked about what it was like at Credit Suisse and at Goldman, that&#39;s a loss for people who are not there every day.</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s a massive loss. If you&#39;re learning from your more experienced coworkers and you&#39;re only there three days a week, there&#39;s some, 40% of your time is without the direct contact and so there&#39;s going to be some diminution in your ability to ramp up.</p><p> I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s a 40% or whether it&#39;s a fraction of 40%, but it&#39;s not zero.</p><p> It&#39;s a real chunk. It&#39;s a real chunk.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: All right, so before we get to our favorite questions, I got to throw you one curve ball. You sit on a number of different boards, including the Board of Trustees at Villanova, but you&#39;re also a board member of the Navy SEAL Foundation. How does this come about? Tell us a little bit about that experience.</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, the last person that I hired at Goldman was a seven-year veteran of the SEAL teams and was one of the early board members at the SEAL Foundation and introduced me to the organization. And so for the last 10, 12 years, I&#39;ve been involved as a supporter and host of their New York City Gala.</p><p> And then earlier this year, I was asked to join the board, which is an unbelievable honor. For me, it&#39;s a way to support folks that I have a great deal of respect for, for a whole variety of reasons.</p><p> But it was at its core a way for me to get involved with a community that took action following 9/11, which had, as we mentioned earlier, a profound impact on me. And folks that frankly, as I got to know, I came to really like. They&#39;re not what I think the average person views them to be. These are very much the guy next door, that young person that you knew growing up that was kind of always doing the right thing and was very steadfast in their views and unwavering in their commitment.</p><p> That seems to be a common thread that I found with some of these men in the teams.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Professionals.</p><p> WAGNER: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So when I was on the trading desk, the head trader was a former Marine jungle combat instructor. The guy on my left was a SEAL, the guy next to him was a Ranger. So we would go out for drinks afterwards and I could be a wise-ass at a bar because people would look at us and they&#39;d look at me like, “That guy&#39;s a wise-ass, I should slap him.” And then they&#39;d look at either side of me, “Maybe best to not get involved over there.” Yeah, I got away with a lot of stuff, but the word that always stood out is these were just consummate professionals. They had a task to do, they knew how to go about doing it, and there are some fascinating parallels between those services and trading about going in prepared, thinking about plan Bs, being able to make decisions under pressure. It&#39;s really quite fascinating. That must be an amazing experience working with them.</p><p> WAGNER: It is, and you know, it&#39;s, it just, that&#39;s the community that I became connected to. There are lots of service members across our different branches that are equally worthy of our respect, and you know, I think it was my way, as I said, of doing something to serve people who so selflessly serve all of us.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really great stuff. So I know I only have you for a finite amount of time. Let&#39;s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests, starting with, tell us what you&#39;ve been watching or listening to lately. What kept you entertained since the pandemic on either Netflix or Amazon or whatever the fam is enjoying?</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, you know, it&#39;s funny. Of course, a lot of the very popular shows we&#39;ve watched and I think shows like “Ted Lasso” are funny, you know, some good lessons in there. That one&#39;s been very enjoyable. The ones that I&#39;ve watched more recently that I think are great are the prequels to “Yellowstone.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: 1863, is that what it is?</p><p> WAGNER: “1883” and —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Early is the same as wrong.</p><p> WAGNER: Yes, “1923” I think is the other one. And, you know, I&#39;m a big fan of the American West, the Mountain West, I spend a lot of time in Montana, and so those really resonated with me. And what I liked about the prequels is, while a story told in a Hollywood sense, they give some insight into just how difficult and different time was then, particularly in that part of our country, how hard it was. And I just think the stories are fascinating.</p><p> So I&#39;ve really enjoyed those programs and look forward to the next installments coming out.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sounds like one we should put on our list.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk about your early mentors who helped shape your career.</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, you know, I never really had official mentors. It wasn&#39;t really the way the businesses that I operated in worked. But there were people that I was able to observe that had, you know, just had to achieve such incredible success. And we&#39;re so good. And one that really stands out, I think, is David Tepper, who, of all the individuals with whom I interacted over the years, is absolutely the best investor of the bunch.</p><p> And two things stand out. One is incredible conviction. And two is ability to take a very complicated situation and distill it down to very simple terms, which is a mark of true genius. And I think his prosecution of his commitment and his strategy, starting in distressed corporate and then a lot of macro type investing in addition to what he does at his core, is incredibly impressive.</p><p> And so I think looking at the way that he approached being committed to a position and unwavering in many cases, despite others maybe having a different view is something that I&#39;ve always really respected.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Tepper&#39;s fund is Appaloosa Capital, is that right?</p><p> WAGNER: That&#39;s right, yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: He&#39;s put up pretty amazing numbers.</p><p> WAGNER: It&#39;s unbelievable. Unbelievable.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk about everybody&#39;s favorite question. Books, what are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now?</p><p> WAGNER: So I don&#39;t know how I get into this but right now I&#39;m reading this book called “One Second After” which is about life in the United States, you know, immediately following an EMP or Electromagnetic Pulse Attack. It is a rather disturbing book, but it&#39;s really pretty fascinating. It goes to, you know, some of the risks that we face as a modern society and how quickly things can change if the right set of kind of really negative and horrible circumstances arise.</p><p> And I&#39;ve always been sort of fascinated by the risks that we as a modern society face that aren&#39;t often thought about and the ways that we can protect against them. That&#39;s a big one. That and our electoral grid. I think, you know, particularly in our urban areas, we are uniquely exposed to a loss of power.</p><p> And so, you know, I think the Koppel book “Lights Out” that was written a while ago is another sort of must read. It&#39;s something that we really should be paying much more attention to. I, you know, there&#39;s a lot of great initiatives that as a country we&#39;re pursuing for noble reasons but my personal view is that the making our electric grid more robust should really be at the top of our list.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There&#39;s some funds in the infrastructure bill that go to hardening the electric grid. I don&#39;t know what your experience was during Sandy in the New York area. We had no electricity for 13 days and when we subsequently moved to a new house that was this close to getting nat gas, as soon as it became available, first thing I did was put in a giant generator and say, “I don&#39;t care what happens. I am never going through that nonsense again.”</p><p> WAGNER: Right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And it&#39;s really quite astonishing how frequently a modern society like the US, there&#39;s some website that shows you all of the outages for the electrical grid. It&#39;s kind of creaking and outdated and very vulnerable, not just to hacking, but silly things like trees falling, takes out a whole neighborhood for a week. It&#39;s kind of shocking.</p><p> WAGNER: There&#39;s no question that we need to be modernizing our electric distribution system. It&#39;s not just at the industrial scale level, but also right down to the home. So greater levels of battery backup and solar power, but things that are protected against you know small-scale EMP results, which would be like a lightning strike, and large-scale if we ever were attacked, you know it&#39;s a real risk to society.</p><p> So I think you know those are those are things that I&#39;ve always been fascinated about, you know big giant problems. You know this is exactly the kind of thing you want to be reading before bed at night. You know but how do we how do we think about those and how should that be worked into our national priorities?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: My sister lived in a town that was one of the few rare towns that have underground electrical. What originally started as how do we avoid the visual blight of copper wires strung between dead trees and instead they put it all on the ground and Sandy, I have a vivid recollection of her saying, “It was really inconvenient. The cable went out for a couple hours.” And that was her entire experience. Could be the greatest shower I ever took in my life was the fifth day of, “Gee, this, we&#39;re not getting electricity back anytime soon.”</p><p> So, and to move everything on the ground would cost billions, but at the very least to make things a little more resilient and a little more hardened, got to be a top priority.</p><p> WAGNER: Yeah, we&#39;re micro generation that&#39;s, you know, smaller scale. It could work as well.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So if you have solar or winds and the ability to store for a couple of days you&#39;re okay even if you lose a…</p><p> WAGNER: That&#39;s right yeah it depends on your location so but that you know it&#39;s a big giant investment that we should really take seriously across our country you know, hardening the grid and distributing the power generation you know more solar more renewable all of it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: To circle back to the Caymans or the way I love the way the locals pronounce it, Cayman, is they had this setup where between the local power company, the local government, and the UK government, you could get pretty much 100% funding for solar or they were really big on geothermal that you would drop, sink a geothermal line and you have heat and air conditioning year round at essentially no cost.</p><p> WAGNER: That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve always done geo. Solar&#39;s tough in certain jurisdictions, but I think the combination, if you can do combo of solar and geo, you&#39;re really, you&#39;ve got a lot of energy independence and much cleaner. It&#39;s well worth the investment in most places. And particularly in an island where you can put geo in, you&#39;re really just getting down below the coral.</p><p> It&#39;s an incredibly efficient way of managing your electric costs.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, it drops everything in half, and because it&#39;s so expensive to import everything.</p><p> WAGNER: Oh, it&#39;s massively expensive.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But they seem to have plenty of sunshine down there.</p><p> WAGNER: They do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I think that&#39;s the big one. So let&#39;s jump to our last two questions that we ask all of our guests, starting with what sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either investing or distressed assets?</p><p> WAGNER: I think irrespective of what you&#39;re looking to do, the advice is the same, which is that make sure you find something that you love. And it sounds so trite, you hear it from everyone, but it really is a critical piece of advice. Investing in distress is not for everyone. It&#39;s not an easy way to make money. There are definitely better ways of doing it. I think if I could tell my kids to go into a type of investing, I&#39;d probably tell them to do VC or something else.</p><p> But I do think that you have to ensure that the career you&#39;re pursuing is something that you can be committed to for a long time so that you&#39;re in it long enough to become an expert. I think that&#39;s perhaps the crucial element. If you want to achieve great success, make sure you stay committed to something long enough that you can become an expert in it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today you wish you knew back in the early 90s when you were first getting started?</p><p> WAGNER: Everything. I mean, I wish I knew– gosh, I wish I knew everything. I guess the one– if I could say one big giant lesson that I&#39;ve learned over the years is watch out for secular change. It&#39;s the killer. You can&#39;t be on the wrong side of secular change. So being on the wrong side of secular change is a killer.</p><p> One example would be the long-term decline of commodity prices. Over a long period of time, generally speaking, commodity prices are trending down, particularly after adjusting for inflation. And so it&#39;s one of many.</p><p> The wrong set of technological change or adoption of new technologies, you&#39;ve got to be really careful about that. And you have to have a thesis that looks out if you&#39;re making a long-term investment. So I think that that&#39;s probably the most important lesson that I learned in my last 30 years or so that wasn&#39;t entirely self-evident when I started.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really very fascinating stuff.</p><p> Tom, thank you for being so generous with your time.</p><p> We have been speaking with Tom Wagner, co-portfolio manager and co-founder of Knighthead Capital.</p><p> If you enjoy this conversation, well, check out any of the previous 500 or so we&#39;ve held over the past eight years.

Still, others take shortcuts, which can lead to profit disgorgement, lifetime bannings – even jail.</p><p> If you want to get rich in the markets, there are a few things that are crucial to understand. These are not secrets, they are just <em>Truths</em> that very few people will divulge to you. But I&#39;m going to share the ten ways I know where you can score big — <em>really big</em> ! — in the markets.</p><p> The twist? They are ranked here based on three factors:</p><blockquote><p> 1) Degree of difficulty;<br /> 2) Likelihood of success;和<br />3) Time needed to amass a fortune.</p></blockquote><p> I present them from hardest/least likely to succeed to easiest/most likely ways to accumulate a fortune:</p><p> Let&#39;s get wealthy:</p><p> 1. <strong><u>Find the Next Apple or Nvidia or whatever</u></strong> : What could be easier? Find a small company that&#39;s unloved, undiscovered, and undervalued and <em>Buy buy buy</em> ! There are lots of innovators around, and all you need is to discover them! Then, convince lots of other people to do so also (after you already own them).</p><p> Oh, and then the hard part: Hold them until the rest of the world figures out what you already know. Eventually, these undiscovered gems will enjoy enormous growth and profits and their stock prices will soar!</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 10/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 1/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> : 5-20 years</p><p> 2. <strong><u>Innovate</u></strong> : Over the past few decades, there has been enormous innovation in markets. Whether it&#39;s ETFs, Direct Indexing, free trading apps, private credit, cryptocurrencies, or any manner of FinTech ideas, the world of investing has become rife with clever new ways to do it faster/cheaper/better than ever before.</p><p> All you need to do is invent one of these, build a company around your innovation, monetize it, and then sell out to a bigger firm. What&#39;s so hard about that?</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 9/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 2/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> : 2-7 years</p><p> 3. <strong><u>Jump on the next bubble (but jump off before it pops)</u></strong> : There are bubbles everywhere, and to profit from them, you only need to do four things: 1. Identify these bubbles as they ramp up; 2. Buy into them (even if pricey); 3. Figure out when they are about to peak; 4. Sell your holdings before the collapse. ( <em>See also</em> : Trade options)</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 8/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 3/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> : 1-5 years</p><p> 4. <strong><u>Short Stocks/Markets</u></strong> : The flip side of bubble trading is to identify wildly overvalued companies or markets, and then bet against them. Sure, the crowd is right most of the time, but when they are wrong, it&#39;s spectacular.</p><p> You will need a steel gut to deal with the short squeezes and vitriol that come your way, but surely it&#39;s worth it. You can also score bonus points for identifying the frauds the regulators miss.</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 7/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 4/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> :   6 months to 3 years</p><p> 5. <strong><u>Time the market</u></strong> : Markets go up, markets go down, how hard can it be to be on the right side of the trend?</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 6/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 5/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> :  Whenever the next major reversal occurs</p><p> 6. <strong><u>Provide a valuable service</u></strong> : Now we&#39;re getting into some heavy lifting. Figure out a way to provide some sort of service, be it research or execution or asset management or even simply identifying those things everybody else has missed. Then all you have to do is monetize that service.</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 8/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 7/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> :  7-12 years</p><p> 7. <strong><u>Become a great salesman</u></strong> : If you can get people to purchase whatever you are selling, and charge a substantial markup and/or Commission or fee on that product, you can make a killing in this business. You don&#39;t even have to be right you just need to be confident and earn the trust of your clients. I was never a good salesman, but I was always in awe of those who are.</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 5/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 9/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> :  However long it takes you to start closing</p><p> 8. <strong><u>Index</u></strong> : Buy the entire market; hold it for years; enjoy your retirement.</p><p> The challenge is that your own instincts and behavior will work against you the whole time.</p><p> While this should be a 1 out of 10 in terms of degree of difficulty, unfortunately, your own wetware makes it harder than it should be.</p><p> – <em>Degree of difficulty</em> : 5/10<br /> – <em>Likelihood of success</em> : 10/10<br /> – <em>Time Required</em> :   20-50 years</p><p> 9. <strong><u>Dollar Cost Average</u></strong> : DCA is yet another way to all but guarantee to accumulate a fortune, but only if you stick to it over time.

Better Check Men&#39;s Underwear Sales</strong> . Champagne flows, lipstick sales, Dining out trends, library activity, Lipstick sales and Men&#39;s underwear, and French fry sales each provide a little insight. ( <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/is-a-recession-coming-quirk-indicators-9da217fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barron&#39;s</a> )</p><p> • <strong>Goodbye to the Prophets of Doom</strong> : The conventional wisdom about the global economy is that the rich have been getting richer and the poor have been getting poorer.

I suspect this is the result of a massive build-up of private sector debt. Sometimes these build-ups are accompanied by very high rates of credit growth, giving rise to a credit bubble. On other occasions, these build-ups sit simmering in the background, largely unnoticed until the proverbial s**t hits the fan, when they suddenly act as an amplifier causing a much steeper decline than would otherwise have been the case. I call these systemic vulnerabilities “slow burn Minsky moments.” Sadly, most markets appear to carry the fingerprints of these moments today.

Which are perfectly good reasons for voting for someone. In this case, however, his enthusiastic supporters are willing to send a vengeance-driven, delusional autocrat into the White House to get what they want. A man who will know much better than he did in 2016 how to wield the vast powers of the presidency to corrupt and ultimately destroy America&#39;s democracy. And in so doing put the other democracies in the world on quaking ground.
