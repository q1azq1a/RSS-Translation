32%。</p><p>一年的变化有多大：指数距离历史高点仅一步之遥。进入新年整整七个月，六月低点过后十三个月，十月触底九个月后，我们已经一路回到了起点。</p><p>鉴于这次往返旅行，现在是思考发生了什么以及我们可以从中得到什么的好时机。</p><blockquote><p> <strong><u>The Crowd</u></strong> ：大家对YOLO的热情有没有感染到你的上升之路？您是 2021 年迟到的 FOMO 买家吗？ 2022 年 6 月/10 月明显的恐慌是否导致了不明智的抛售？</p><p>群众的智慧是有效市场在大多数时候发挥作用的原因，但当群众变成一群不加思考的流氓时，保持警惕确实很有帮助。</p><p><strong><u>框架和背景很重要</u></strong>：主要指数在过去十年中经历了巨大的上涨。当 100% (SPX) 和 200% (NDX) 上涨之后，将 20% 或 30% 的回撤纳入适当的背景中是有用的。</p><p>市场有涨有跌；当你意识到回馈只占先前收益的一小部分时，你就更容易度过亏损期。</p><p><strong><u>愚蠢的预测</u></strong>：你是否陷入了无休止的<a href="https://twitter.com/stevenkelly49/status/1680998348558331904">厄运和悲观</a>预测之中？那些<em>预见到经济衰退即将到来</em>的人是否说服了您？永远不要忘记<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2015/01/forecasting-is-marketing/">预测就是营销</a>。</p><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-economists-rode-maths-to-become-our-era-s-astrologers">回想一下</a>约翰·肯尼思·加尔布雷思 (John Kenneth Galbraith) 的观察：“经济预测的唯一功能就是让占星学看起来受人尊敬。”</p><p><strong><u>科技股集中度</u></strong>：是的，少数大型科技股正在推动市场上涨。但这些并不是互联网时代无利可图的想法，苹果、微软、谷歌、亚马逊等公司是现代经济中快速增长、高利润的关键参与者。</p><p>以苹果为例：营收近4000亿美元，利润950亿美元，5年营收增长11.5%，5年利润增长超过20%。</p><p>我一直想知道为什么科技只占标准普尔 500 指数的 29%……</p><p><strong><u>昂贵的市场</u></strong>：有一种幻想认为市场应该始终恢复到公允价值。事实上，这是从廉价市场到昂贵市场的一个点，当它们向任一方向吹过时，它会挥手致意和告别。</p><p>在牛市周期的大部分时间里，估值过高的市场可能会保持估值过高的状态。</p><p><strong><u>私人信贷</u></strong>：一位不愿透露姓名的对冲基金行业人士指出，在 2022 年 6 月的低点附近，配置者进行了大量赎回，将资金从对冲基金转移出来。原因？他们纷纷涌入私人信贷。</p><p>这是一项拥挤的交易，自那以后，它的表现一直逊于股票。但直到 2024 年初我们看到更新的估值时，我们才会知道亏损交易的规模有多大。有些人比我建议的更熟悉这些数字，但结果并不美好。</p><p><strong><u>收益率曲线倒挂</u></strong>：这一衰退指标的创造者Cam Harvey <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pro-take-yield-curve-pioneer-says-this-inversion-warning-is-real-ac0b606">指出</a>，就衰退预测而言，这是8比8。这是一个良好的记录，但也是一个非常小的样本集。而且十多年来，它从未在利率为零或接近于零的时代运作。</p><p>一些人<a href="https://disciplinefunds.com/2023/07/18/what-does-an-inverted-yield-curve-tell-us/">认为</a>，收益率曲线倒挂实际上不是预测经济衰退，而是预测联邦公开市场委员会对通胀下降的反应，这可能（但并不总是）与经济收缩有关。</p><p>没有圣杯，也没有完全可靠的指标。</p><p><strong><u>叙述和持有期：</u></strong>交易者的持有期非常短，并且担心短期内推动价格的催化剂。投资者持有资产类别，以从长期价值创造和复利中受益。</p><p>当交易者的叙述被用来为投资者的行为辩护时，就会造成损害，反之亦然。</p><p>了解您的投资期限，无论是几分钟还是几十年。永远不要用别人的叙述来证明你的投资行为的合理性。</p></blockquote><p>

•<strong>随着一些消费者利好因素消退，新的利好因素出现</strong>：在过去两年的大部分时间里，消费者信心指标一直处于低迷状态——很大程度上是由于通货膨胀。然而，消费者支出持续增长。解释：由于过度储蓄和相对较低的债务水平，消费者财务状况一直非常良好。与此同时，更多的消费者找到了工作，这意味着更多的消费者赚钱了。如果人们有钱，他们就会花它。 （<a

~~~</p><p>播音员：这是彭博电台巴里·里索尔茨 (Barry Ritholtz) 主持的商业硕士节目。</p><p>巴里·里索兹（BARRY RITHOLTZ），商科硕士主持人：本周，莉兹·霍夫曼（Liz Hoffman）在播客中向我们讲述了《迫降》的写作过程，我发现这是一本引人入胜的书，讲述了我们刚刚经历过的大流行的故事。经济混乱，健康风险，只是发生了混乱，但从许多公司首席执行官的角度来看，潘兴广场资本（Pershing Square Capital）的比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman）是基于此进行了几笔惊人交易的对冲基金。达美航空、希尔顿、福特、高盛、摩根士丹利、Airbnb 的首席执行官。从我认为您可能不熟悉的角度来看，这确实是一次有趣的讨论。</p><p>你知道，感觉我们都或多或少经历过同样的事情。事实证明这不一定是真的。其中一些人承受着过度的压力和巨大的风险，担心他们的企业和公司（其中一些已经在美国存在了一个世纪或更长时间）将要倒闭。这确实是一个从非常有趣的角度讲述的引人入胜的故事。</p><p>我真的很喜欢它，我想你会发现它是令人愉快的夏季阅读。</p><p>言归正传，我与 Semafor 的 Liz Hoffman 的对话讨论了“迫降”。时间</p><p>SEMAFOR 商业与财经编辑 LIZ HOFFMAN： 谢谢巴里。很高兴来到这里。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我必须告诉你，我并不总是这么说，我真的很喜欢这本书。我发现这是对我们所有人都拥有的经历的一次有趣的观察，并认为我们一起分享，但事实证明很多人都有非常非常不同的经历。</p><p>我们稍后会讨论这个问题。</p><p>让我们从你的背景开始吧。您拥有西北新闻学院的硕士学位。该计划总是涵盖财务吗？是什么促使您进入这个领域？</p><p>霍夫曼：不，一点也不。我在大学时开始担任体育记者。</p><p>里索兹：真的吗？</p><p>霍夫曼：第三级田径运动，如果你喜欢的话。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这就是我的大学，三级橄榄球队。不完全是技能和才华的温床。</p><p>霍夫曼：不是一个强者，不是。但我想我想报道体育。事实上，我从小就参加体育运动，我真的很喜欢这种报道，从最基本的角度来看，这确实是一种击败报道，对吧？</p><p>然后，你知道，在某个时候，我去读了研究生，因为我 2008 年大学毕业，令人震惊的是，是的，我很难找到一份新闻编辑室的工作。我说，我会去攻读硕士学位，2009 年情况会更好，因为这些都是一年制课程。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>霍夫曼：很明显，我从一开始就很注重经济。但不，我真的想成为一名体育记者。然后在某个时刻我突然想到，即使你做到了这一点并且达到了职业生涯的顶峰，你的回报也是住在康涅狄格州的布里斯托尔。</p><p>里索兹：对，没错。</p><p>霍夫曼：为 ESPN 工作。坦率地说，这真的就像乞丐不能挑剔一样。我是09年毕业的。我的第一份工作是在芝加哥郊外的一家家族媒体公司，位于芝加哥西郊。</p><p>里索兹：嗯，《华尔街日报》是一家家族媒体公司的一部分。</p><p>霍夫曼：是的，我找到了回来的路，是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么你在哪里，第一名是什么？</p><p>霍夫曼：它被称为“星期三日报”，他们经营一堆周报和一本名为“芝加哥家长”的育儿月刊，那是我的，确实是我的第一份工作，我是他们的网络编辑。我的意思是，09 年的情况确实很严峻。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你是怎么找到这本杂志的？</p><p>霍夫曼：我2010年搬到纽约，在一家合法贸易酒吧工作，这是《彭博法律》、《360法律》的竞争对手，我就是在那里受聘的，你知道，你的职业生涯只是一系列的幸运突破。我认为，我被聘用是为了报道证券诉讼或保险监管，这些事情确实技术性很强，而且很糟糕。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：听起来枯燥乏味，但是。</p><p>霍夫曼：无论如何，我的回忆是，这是我要创造的神话，是我第一天他们说，实际上我们正在考虑启动公司法垂直领域，你想涵盖并购吗？我说，我不知道那是什么，但是，是的，这听起来更好。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我很熟悉 M，但 A 非常灵活，对吗？</p><p>霍夫曼：不知道，但你知道，在贸易酒吧工作是一个很好的训练场，对吧？因为你必须快速变得聪明，你必须知道你不知道什么并找出答案，你知道，因为读者非常老练。所以无论如何，我为他们报道了大约两年的并购。然后我不知道上帝对我微笑了什么，但我在 2013 年被《华尔街日报》录用了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你从 2013 年开始，然后你继续收到一些你亲密报道或爆料的重大新闻报道。汉堡王收购Tim Hortons、贝克休斯和哈里伯顿合并、戴尔和EMC，哪个时代脱颖而出？您经常是最先报道这一消息的记者之一，这对您来说是怎样的幸运呢？</p><p>霍夫曼：嗯，《华尔街日报》是实现这一目标的绝佳场所。你每天都会在工作中享受到很多制度上的特权。</p><p>你知道，当我 2013 年受聘时，并购已经死了。事实上，我认为我被录用的部分原因是我正在报道一种混乱、不稳定、法律复杂的并购，这些并购已经偏离轨道，你知道，最终上了法庭，这就是当时该杂志的想法对他们来说是一个盲点，他们很擅长破坏交易，但出来后却没有完全理解或忽视了它们。</p><p>然后，事实证明，2014 年市场的转变创下了纪录，2015 年也创下了纪录。他们都还没有站起来，对吗？他们在 16 岁、17 岁的时候黯然失色，然后在 21 岁的时候又黯然失色。但是有一些大交易从天而降，我不知道，我总是说幸运比好更好，尽管如果你能两者兼而有之，这很有帮助。但是，是的，其中一些很有趣。</p><p>汉堡王蒂姆霍顿斯，我记得很清楚，因为它正处于避税浪潮和倒置交易的中间。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>但你知道，这是两大合法的特许经营权。</p><p>霍夫曼：完全可以，但他们正在加拿大重新注册公司，这方面存在很多敏感性。我记得，如果我记得的话，其中一个很快就聚集在一起了，这很不寻常，但就像周五或周四到周日的独家新闻一样。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么新冠肺炎疫情又如何呢？你是如何找到通往那个空间的路的？您是否经常报道流行病，或者显然有一个企业故事。你是怎么陷入这样的境地的？</p><p>霍夫曼：你知道，回到 2020 年初，我的意思是，每次心跳也很快，对吧？正如你所提到的，那时我已经在高盛投资银行工作了几年。再说一次，我可能很幸运。我当时有一种感觉，也许这个故事至少是其中的那一章已经结束了。你知道，二月、三月的市场开始走高，我的意思是，这开始是一个金融故事，我想，这就是我参与其中的方式，市场很快就意识到了这一点，事情变得非常快。基本上，当时《华尔街日报》的每位记者都成为了新冠记者。</p><p>里索兹：这很有趣。所以你什么时候意识到，嘿，这次新冠肺炎不仅仅是另一场流感，还有比通常的背景故事更重要的东西，美国每年有 40,000 人死于流感。不管怎样，作为一名记者，你什么时候清楚这不是普通的流感？</p><p>霍夫曼：我不会说从健康角度来看我很清楚，我不是健康专家，但你会看到这些头条新闻……</p><p> RITHOLTZ：嗯，即使从商业角度来看也是如此。</p><p>霍夫曼：是的，所以我认为真正发生的事情是，我尝试过，我们稍后会讨论这本书，但我试图重新创造那种慢慢地然后突然发生的感觉，对吗？如果你记得-</p><p>里索兹：海明威式的。</p><p>霍夫曼：是的，但是市场达到顶峰，我认为最终会在 2 月 18 日或 19 日达到顶峰。事情是这样的，你开始在回购市场上看到一点，你开始看到商业票据信贷变得有点摇摇欲坠，利差扩大，股票仍然坚挺。然后，你知道，在二月的最后几天和三月的第一周，我的意思是，事情变得疯狂了。</p><p>我记得，你知道，为了让你感觉到，你知道，我尽量不在周一早上对这些事情进行四分卫，3 月 8 日我在海湾度假回来，坐在那里，而不是一个人。面具在眼前。我记得我的嫂子从福来鸡那里偷了一些额外的小睡，比如擦拭飞机座位，感觉这样做有点愚蠢。于是我在周一回到了办公室。</p><p>星期三，我们被告知，你知道吗？周四我们将尝试在家工作。今天是 3 月 12 日，星期四。再也没有回去过。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：哇，这太令人难以置信了。</p><p>霍夫曼：所以我的意思是，这件事发生得有多快。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我对我姐姐在城里的生活有着清晰的记忆，我住在郊区，她二月底出去拜访，我们去了塔吉特。嘿，只要你还在这儿，我们就去塔吉特百货看看吧。大流行后我从来没有真正去过塔吉特，所有的东西都是送货的，但当时，我们走过塔吉特，没有卫生纸，没有漂白剂，没有——这是二月，这不是三月，而且这是我的第一个，嘿，有些事情正在发生，但事实证明，在书中，很多公司都在更早的时候就导致了一些不好的事情，一些邪恶的事情就以这种方式出现了，而且这不是通常的情况。请告诉我们一些相关情况。</p><p>霍夫曼：你知道，我在 2020 年达沃斯论坛上认真地开始写这本书，对我来说，这就像历史上最荒谬的人类聚会一样。这场私人晚宴实际上是由我当时的雇主《华尔街日报》主办的，尽管我没有受到邀请。他们不让记者参与有趣的事情，但这是一群首席执行官和财政部长史蒂文·姆努钦(Steven Mnuchin)，他们都在谈论这个，那一年的大主题，从那以后一直如此，是环境、ESG，他们都在谈论你听到的企业对这些事情的喋喋不休。</p><p>财政部长史蒂文·姆努钦 (Steven Mnuchin) 站起来说：“你们看错了。中国有一座1100万人口的城市处于封锁状态。”这是 2020 年 1 月底。我从这里开始是因为，你知道，在我的报道中，这些人应该拥有世界上最好的视线。他们经营全球业务，他们有快速拨号的监管机构和政府官员。他们有时是监管者和政府官员。他们完全措手不及。</p><p>而且，你知道，有两种方法可以看待这个问题。一是名人就像我们一样，对吧？他们就像，这些家伙在黑暗中颠簸前行，就像我们其他人一样。另一个是，我不知道，我觉得有点不安。这些人确实应该能够看到角落。他们付了很多钱去看看街角。但他们中的大多数人没有。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：他们中的大多数人没有，但也有少数人这样做了。</p><p>我对这本书很着迷，我们将深入了解不同行业的一些公司如何能够看到一些转角的情况，从航空公司开始。</p><p>早在所有人都关门之前，他们就收到了取消订单。他们有一种感觉，嘿，这里有点不同。你谈论酒店、爱彼迎，然后银行在事情真正变得糟糕之前几周就让人们提取信贷额度。这就是问题所在。谁最早读过？谁对正在发生的事情最时髦？他们的反应是什么？</p><p>霍夫曼：实际上，在我的报道中，我认为你没有提到的一个人最早读过这篇文章，那就是比尔·阿克曼。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：从字面上看，下一个问题是潘兴广场资本（Pershing Square Capital）提出的，他很早就变得非常紧张。</p><p>霍夫曼：是的，所以比尔，有点细菌恐惧症，但是他，你知道，在二月中旬，他一直在阅读，他是一个贪婪的消费者，一切对他来说都是一个漏斗，并将其内化在这些投资论文中。一月底、二月中旬，他开始变得非常害怕。他去了伦敦经济学院，并于二月中旬发表了这次演讲，并被问及有关冠状病毒的问题。当他准备回答这个问题时，前排的孩子，就像非常天真的咳嗽什么的，比尔有点向后靠。</p><p>里索兹：跳跃。</p><p>霍夫曼：是的，跳跃。这是我们都会做的那些愚蠢的小事之一，后来你回头看时会说，哦，这就是为我做的。他回来说，好吧，我认为我们大大低估了这一点。所以任何投资的关键组成部分都是论文、表达和时机，对吗？所以他说，“我认为市场没有意识到这里的风险。”好吧，我该怎么表达呢？ And most people think of Bill, his bread and butter business is activist, very concentrated stock investing, but he has a bit of a background in macro too, back from &#39;07, &#39;08, and he actually decides to do this in the credit markets, where spreads are incredibly tight.</p><p> Investors are assigning basically no risk premiums to corporates over governments, or junk over investment grade, and he said, “All right, when things get bad, that&#39;s where it&#39;s going to blow out.” And he shorts the entire credit market, and it only takes about two and a half weeks for people to realize that he is right, and he&#39;s holding an incredibly valuable piece of paper. Ends up turning about $27 million of swap premiums into 2 billion plus in profit.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I really like the way you tell this tale from multiple perspectives, multiple storylines, lots of different leading characters. What led to that approach?</p><p> HOFFMAN: I mean, at heart, I&#39;m a narrative journalist. I like to tell stories and collect facts and present them in ways that people can understand and grab onto. But really the origin story of the book was I&#39;d done a story for the Wall Street Journal that published the first Saturday in April. And it was a TikTok day by day of the month of March. And I&#39;d worked with lots of colleagues around the newsroom. And it was day by day from the seat of, it was the month that the economy shut down. We&#39;d never seen it before. We thought that was an important story to tell.</p><p> And it&#39;s two dozen CEOs, investors, policy makers from like all across the economy. And it was just incredibly clear coming out of that, that we just barely scratched the surface, right? That this was fundamentally just like the kind of yarn that reporters dream up, which is it&#39;s narrative, it&#39;s tense, there&#39;s a lot of drama, there&#39;s high stakes, things really mattered.</p><p> And so that&#39;s I think where the germ sort of got planted. Spent a couple weeks, you know, talking to publishers and agents as one does and tried to write a proposal and see if anyone would buy it and then they did. thing I knew I was, you know, summer or fall of 2020 and I was at a book deal.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really interesting. So, so you choose a number of specific industries or did you choose them? Did they self-selected? It&#39;s kind of apparent some of these industries are going to be the first to really succumb to an economy shutting down. How did you decide who were the key players to focus on? What, what sectors to really delve into?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, this is, you know, most reporters who write a book, they have a beat and a huge thing happens on their beat and they crush it and then they write a book about it, right? Think about whatever your —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “Bad Blood” is a perfect example.</p><p> HOFFMAN: “Bad Blood” perfect example. John Carreyrou at “The Journal” crushes the Theranos story and says, “Of course I should write a book.” This was a little different, right? This is nobody&#39;s beat at “The Journal” or elsewhere is every company on the planet, the entire economy. So, and in part I think the reason that I thought I was maybe in a good position to do it was I thought it would be more of a financial story.</p><p> You remember early on, right? The markets are going crazy. There&#39;s, you know, people are always kind of solving the next crisis by looking at the last one and there&#39;s this concern that it&#39;s going to be 2008 all over again. And I thought the banks would be a bigger piece of it, honestly, than they it turned out really to be a story about a crisis in the real economy.</p><p> So then, you know, that summer, you&#39;re looking around, you&#39;re thinking, okay, like, some combination of what is important. So some obvious ones there, airlines, obviously important, right? Travel, obviously important, finance important, it was a little unclear then how that would it all shake out. I know I wanted a big sort of multinational industrial.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Manufacturing, Ford as an example, sure.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And I wanted, people have asked me, why is Airbnb in the book if you have Hilton? And did you want a tech company? And the truth is at that point, I really didn&#39;t think, and I think it ultimately was the right call. I&#39;m not sure that tech had a uniquely interesting pandemic.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Not at all.</p><p> HOFFMAN: No, despite being the reason that we kind of all got through it, I&#39;m not sure Apple had like an incredibly compelling story.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, if anything, of any sector that was able to sort of, all right, everybody go work from home, you all have laptops and high speed connections, do what you have to do, they seem to almost take it in stride.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Tech was the scaffolding on which the pandemic story hung, I think, but not to me anyway, at the time, an important part of it. But I did want a company that was, in addition to kind of making sure that you&#39;re checking boxes on sectors and really getting a picture, at the end of the day, books are character driven, these kind anyway. And so you&#39;re going to end up sort of essentializing these CEOs into archetypes that are carrying a narrative that&#39;s sort of buzzing underneath the story that they&#39;re telling.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You have a lot of great characters as CEOs and great storylines. David Solomon, Ed Goldman, you have the CEO of Hilton, Delta, American Airlines, like work your way, and Airbnb, Brian Chesky.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Brian Chesky, I wanted a CEO who was younger. I wanted a company that was in a different place in their life cycle…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And Airbnb was on the verge of going public, which is just such a naturally high stakes thing. And we can talk about the Airbnb story, but I fully thought they were left for dead, which is why I&#39;m a journalist and not an investor.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So when you&#39;re selecting these storylines, when you&#39;re choosing these characters, how obvious are some of these? Because these are all big personalities, big egos, not, there&#39;s no shrinking violets amongst any of the people you&#39;re writing about, was that part of the reason you selected them? Tell us a little bit about the thought process.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know, you never know why some, I mean, this is true at a daily journalism job or a book, you never really know why anyone is talking to you.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And, you know, again, because of the way this book came together, I had to kind of go out and say, here&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do. I think you have a good story to tell. And by the way, you shouldn&#39;t assume that any of the people in the book spoke to me, their stories are the ones that I tell. But it&#39;s a little bit of a kind of layer, all right, what are the important stories? Where can I get people to talk to me? And then you kind of throw things overboard where like one or both of those isn&#39;t quite working.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I have to interrupt you here. I assumed you spoke to all of these people. It looks like you have amazing access. People, there&#39;s a lot of details that are very, very specific that someone would say, and it keeps coming up to food, oh, they&#39;re out in Montauk and they have a lobster roll, or he&#39;s stuck in a hotel and he&#39;s eating the same sort of food that comes in every day, because it&#39;s him and a bunch of Saudis stuck in a DC hotel. Those sort of things, it looks like these are very specific recollections from individuals who appear to have spoken to you.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, look, I mean, I think readers can draw their own conclusions. I think what I had said when I approached people was, you know, here&#39;s how I want to tell this story, which is very voice of God, very fly on the wall. I think just from a reader, that&#39;s really what you want. You don&#39;t want to be jumping back and forth between live quotes and old things, and you&#39;re trying to tell a story. And I think that gives people the safest space to speak.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But you did speak to most of these people.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Certainly, everyone in the book had ample opportunity to talk to me, and many of them took it.<br /> RITHOLTZ: All right, that makes a lot of sense.</p><p> Were there any narratives that you wanted to cover but didn&#39;t like any companies or sectors or space that you thought, oh, this could be a great thread and for whatever reason, it never came together?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, there&#39;s two buckets of those, I would say. Like you will notice, and I think it&#39;s better to just address it straight on. There&#39;s not a cruise company in the book. There&#39;s not a meat packing. There&#39;s not like a, what we would consider to be like bad or at least slightly dubious actors.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What a shock.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And like, look, I never covered those industries and a challenge of a project like this is you just, you can&#39;t source up at 20 places in six months. It&#39;s not how journalism works. It took me years to get the relationships that I have now. And so, yeah, there is a little bit of self-selection there, which is like a totally fair criticism of the project if you&#39;re making one.</p><p> And then there were some that I pursued that ultimately just, I didn&#39;t think were additive. So Macy&#39;s is a good example.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Kind of thought they would have a more interesting pandemic than they did. I got to the end and we sort of, my editor and I kind of looked at the storylines, like, what are we doing here? And we threw one or two overboard.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Retail just is nothing at all. hey, there&#39;s no retail, order online.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know what it was? Honestly, it was yes, and I think that story is going to take a couple years to play out. And I couldn&#39;t say at the time, and that&#39;s a hard thing about writing a book, particularly when you come from the world of journalism, particularly if you come from a place like the “Wall Street Journal” which is that you&#39;re supposed to have a point of view on this stuff, and you&#39;re supposed to be able to say something definitive, and it felt too early to me at the time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Squishy?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, it felt too squishy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. So let&#39;s talk a little bit about Bill Ackman. He not only was early in seeing the crisis, but that bet he made ended up netting Pershing Square $2 billion. That&#39;s a hell of a trade. I don&#39;t know why we haven&#39;t heard more about that.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Look, say what you want about Bill. I mean, he&#39;s a controversial figure and he doesn&#39;t always get it right. And that is one of the best trades of all time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, that&#39;s great.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And you know, it&#39;s a pure trade. He saw something that people didn&#39;t. He was right on the thesis. He found a place to express it efficiently.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And he absolutely nailed the timing. I mean, you&#39;re talking about, I don&#39;t, I could do the math, it&#39;s like a 10,000% return in like three weeks. I mean, it&#39;s, I mean, really crazy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Wild number. So I love that he reaches out to different people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. Anybody ever get back to him?</p><p> HOFFMAN: I don&#39;t think so. I mean, that&#39;s the other thing about Bill, which is, you know, I can say straight face, like very impressive piece of financial footwork there, but also like, is like, is a little, is flailing a little bit, is a little vulnerable, the thing about Bill Ackman, and I write about this in the book, is he has this tendency to take what are investment theses and turn them into holy wars. You&#39;ll remember years ago, he had a proxy fight at Target, and I think it was invoking JFK in his speech to shareholders.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s really Target. At least the battle with Carl Icahn over what he describes as a pyramid scheme, you could say that&#39;s a holy war.</p><p> HOFFMAN: But also even that, you know, tears in his eyes, talking about taking the battle to the ends of the earth.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And you know, they are genuinely felt.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: These are theses that become, he wraps himself in the flag of them. And he totally did it here, right? He takes to Twitter for the first time in a year or two and says, “Mr. President, we can solve this,” right? Injects himself right in the middle of this thing. Ends up parlaying that into a CNBC interview where he —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Brownlee excoriated for, even though he had already covered his short and moved to the long side.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Exactly right. Now, in fairness, live television is not a place that is super comfortable with a lot of nuance, right? But what he did was he went on television and said, “Hell is coming.” And the stock market went down and I think Mike Novogratz was like, “Get him off the air.” I mean, it was, but you&#39;re right. He, I think ultimately, and I spent a lot of time on this because I didn&#39;t want to carry anyone&#39;s water into anything wrong.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, no, he really was fascinating.</p><p> HOFFMAN: He was bullish at that point. He had gone long stocks.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, he had pocketed the two billion and said, “We&#39;re going to go the other way because I think eventually the Fed and the White House will do the right thing here.”</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yes. And that&#39;s the way he thinks, right? The answer to him was so obvious that someone was going to do it and arbor away the trade that he saw.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. So he covers the short, goes long, and yet there&#39;s a ton of criticism that he&#39;s talking down the market because he&#39;s short. He was no longer short.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, he just wasn&#39;t. That&#39;s just not true.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So in the book, and my recollection of the period is, the criticism seemed to be not just unfair, but very personal. How did he respond to the sort of public flaying that he got on Twitter?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Actually, he responded pretty responsibly, put out, I think, two shareholder letters about a week apart in late March, and actually did what no portfolio manager usually loves doing, which is he deconstructed the trade.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: He said, “Here&#39;s what we bought, here&#39;s what we bought, here&#39;s what we paid, here was my positioning more or less when I went on the air. I got handled with the right way. Got a little lost in all the noise.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sure. I mean at that point the world is going to hell and who cares about a letter from a hedge fund manager explaining why he wasn&#39;t jawboning the market down, but still a great trade that he never really got full credit for other than the two and 20, which is not a terrible thing.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know, most of the money is his though.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, at this point it&#39;s practically a family office.</p><p> HOFFMAN: … outside money anymore, so yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, right. with a lot of hedge funds and so even better than the 20 is the 2 billion. It&#39;s not a bad week&#39;s work or bad month&#39;s work, right?</p><p> HOFFMAN: The other thing about Bill, I don&#39;t know if you want to get to this later.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, no, no, tell me more.</p><p> HOFFMAN: But you know, he called this thing coming and going, right? We&#39;ve talked about the coming.</p><p> On the way out, back before inflation was really a thing, he does what any sort of freshman economic student could do. He says, I don&#39;t know, oh man, like a lot of pent up demand here, a lot of money. Most people by and large, and this is true at kind of every income level, came out of the pandemic wealthier than they went into it. And just a total show on the supply side. We are going to have massive inflation here. And he put on a trade, he was a little earlier on that one. His actual IRR is not quite as good, but feels like another $2 billion trade.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There really weren&#39;t a lot of people who were correct about that. Jeremy Siegel was one for the same reasons. And Ackman was one, so kudos.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Called it coming and going. I will note that when he went back to doing what he is ostensibly paid to do, which is to take deeply researched positions in single name stocks, he lost a ton of money on Netflix.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which is kind of funny because, did he lose it on the way up or did he lose it on the way down?</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know, I&#39;d have to go back and look. My recollection is that he came out publicly, not in activist position, so we think this is a great company, and literally did it right at peak streaming. The next quarter Netflix announced it&#39;s like first subscriber, either slowing growth or loss, I don&#39;t remember, and sort of kicked off this now two year kind of slow bleed of peak streaming.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Happens.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Happens.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Hey, you can&#39;t bet a thousand in this business, right? You make $2 billion on the pandemic, you make $2 billion on the inflation call.</p><p> HOFFMAN: At a cost of about 200 million, if I remember right, maybe a little more.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, and so then you lose a couple of bucks on Netflix, you know, this too shall pass.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk a little bit about YOLO. You only live once, that means go out and buy the crappiest meme-based companies there are.讨论。</p><p> HOFFMAN: I mean, no, it&#39;s such an important part of the pandemic story because I think, I mean, it&#39;s just so fueled by it, right? Like all of the very normal human behaviors came to an end and there&#39;s that A, a lot of money as we&#39;ve discussed, these stimmies, stimulus checks, and just this, like you can&#39;t go to a sports game, bet on sports.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, no betting, no casinos, no bars, no anything.</p><p> The stock market becomes a casino. Most stock markets are largely momentum driven, which is weird if you think about it. A stock goes up, it&#39;s presumably a little more overvalued than it was before it did, you should sell it, right? Same if it goes down. And instead, you end up having these waves that fuel themselves. And you&#39;re a professional wealth manager, you talk to investors, they will say that underpinning it is some basic fundamentals of corporate analysis and management. Not really.</p><p> And actually, the meme stock stuff just didn&#39;t even pretend, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It was so nakedly goofy. And as Spencer wrote this great book, certainly some people made some money, but ultimately a giant cell phone by that entire community.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, right. No doubt about it. And it all started with GameStop and Reddit and Wall Street Bets. And that became like a self-fulfilling prophecy of a small company with a huge excess short position in it, which meant it was primed for a squeeze. And then these people discovered gamma trades. Hey, we can buy out-of-the-money call options and force these people to cover their shorts and to take a — let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s a junk company, right? Wait, you&#39;re selling video games in retail shops in malls? Who cares? To take that from single digits to multi triple digits, that&#39;s a hell of an orchestrated short squeeze.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And it was interesting too, because retail had just been getting less and less relevant as a market force. Forever.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. Buy an ETF, go passive.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally. You&#39;ll remember IPOs back in the day, investment banks used to win them by saying, “We&#39;ve got retail, give us that allocation, it doesn&#39;t matter at all anymore.” And trying to see retail reassert themselves. And I think it also, I don&#39;t know whether they were both just riding the same wave or one fueled the other, but had that the same sort of populist political establishment, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Sort of putting your thumb in the eye of the political establishment, same thing in the financial establishment. And like, to some degree they kind of won.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Ironically, right. It&#39;s like, wait, you&#39;re going to, all this Robinhood is a public company. The way they make money with their free trades is they sell it, payment for order flow is what it&#39;s called. So if you don&#39;t like the big hedge funds like Citadel or Millennial, you&#39;re putting money in their pocket.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, what&#39;s funny about, and I&#39;m not an expert on payment for order flow, but the way that I think people commonly look at it is like your trades are being sold and people are trading ahead of you. That&#39;s not really why people buy order flow. They do it because it&#39;s random and actually uninformed. The sense is that retail doesn&#39;t know anything that Citadel doesn&#39;t, so they want that flow to kind of balance stuff out and just provide liquidity.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Plus it&#39;s volume. Right, it&#39;s volume.</p><p> If you&#39;re getting a cent, a share on billions of shares, that adds up.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally, I mean, which isn&#39;t to say that the deck isn&#39;t in many ways stacked against retail, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s some kind of like all consuming conspiracy that Ken Griffin is directing from Miami Beach or whatever.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, if you discovered that the deck is stacked against the individual investor in 2020, you&#39;re a century late to the party.</p><p> HOFFMAN: But in some ways actually, it&#39;s never been friendlier to retail. You&#39;re talking about, you know, if you want to have a basic, If you want access to basic investment products, it&#39;s never been friendlier, cheaper, easier.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Free to trade, you could buy the S&amp;P 500 for four basis points.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And so the best way to beat people at their game is don&#39;t play their game, play a different game.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And they made up this insane game and then somehow won it and then lost at it. Everyone seemed to lose here. But no, but I think it was, I mean, it wasn&#39;t strictly a pandemic story, except that if you were sitting in March of 2020 and you&#39;re watching the Dow go from 30 to 22, in the course of a couple of weeks. The idea that it would be hitting fresh highs again, like by the end of the year, seemed insane. And it was just such a good reminder that like, there was no ability to forecast this.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I thought this was totally a pandemic story.</p><p> People are stuck at home, they don&#39;t have their usual outlets, a lot of pent up energy, a lot of pent up cash, and suddenly this comes along. I loved Investor TikTok, because there was not a bigger collection of people that you could see the train crash coming, like, “Get out of the way,” and they didn&#39;t want to hear. People literally said to them, “You guys don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re doing and you&#39;re going to get hurt.” And your old school was the pushback, and then all of those people, with very few exceptions, got demolished.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Well, I think it&#39;s a pandemic story in two ways, right? To your point, people are bored, they have a lot of cash sitting around, but they could have bought the Fortune 50 with it. They didn&#39;t.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Not exciting. Not thrilling.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, but even more than that, they were angry and there was a lot of angst and they wanted, they were fed up with authority. I mean, a huge story coming out of the pandemic is, I think, fueled by it, is this declining trust in institutions, right? Like why buy the S&amp;P 50 when you can resurrect some dead retail store from your youth? I mean, there was a real political edge to it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I think that traces back decades, or certainly at least to the financial crisis, and institutions have been seeing a decline. And in fact, we&#39;ll talk a little bit about the Trump administration later, but they very much captivated on the, the hell with the man, I&#39;m anti-establishment, vote for me, no doubt about it, but let&#39;s talk about something else that was very related, the great resignation.</p><p> I have a pet theory, people stuck at home with cash, CARES Act cash, in industries they weren&#39;t happy about, took the opportunity to upskill, to look for new jobs, to start their own businesses. New business formation in 2020 and &#39;21 were huge. What happened during the great resignation?</p><p> HOFFMAN: I think it&#39;s two things. Like to your point, yes, people had all this cash. They also like, frankly, because they were spending more time with family in part because a lot of people died. You start to kind of reassess what you care about in life. And if you can afford it, given the stimulus payments, then you might do that.</p><p> But that&#39;s not the whole story because like those stimulus payments, a lot of estimates out there, it seems like probably two, two and a half trillion dollars of excess savings during the pandemic. Half of that, maybe two thirds has been spent down. So like, if that&#39;s the whole story, then we&#39;ll see people go back to work very soon.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know, which ultimately wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing for the economy given where the labor market is. But I think it&#39;s actually just like a little more complicated than that, which is, and this is an economic book, I&#39;m not a psychologist, but the pandemic was so weird, and it was just such a reset for a lot of people.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s a great word, I&#39;ve used that phrase. It was a great reset where people, they rethought their jobs, they rethought their relationship between their work-life balance, they rethought their commute. Let&#39;s talk about hybrid working and the return to office.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I think that&#39;s the most lasting change to come out of this. I mean, people have talked about, you know, the digitization of the economy. Actually, a lot of that, to me, is overblown. Like, if you look at, for example–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It was years old.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally, and I think the pandemic pulled forward stuff more than anything else. If you look at, like, retail, e-commerce as a percent of retail, like, it soared during the pandemic, but now is basically back on the trend line that it would have been on.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which was–</p><p> HOFFMAN: Which was 10% a year.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Rising dramatically since the late &#39;90s, but, you know–</p><p> HOFFMAN: But the idea that that was, like, a total, It is stratosphere change, I think is not true. The thing that I think is really lasting is the relationship between capital and labor, right? Between management and their employees.</p><p> You know, I do tell this story in the book, you referenced it early on, we&#39;ve got the CEO of Goldman Sachs, who&#39;s out in the Hamptons on a Friday.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Playing DJ.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I don&#39;t think he was DJing that trip, but I don&#39;t have access to his schedule. But you know, is waiting in line at, I think, is it the Montauk Lobster Club?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, exactly.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, I should remember this.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s always food.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It&#39;s always food.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It cracked me up. I noticed that on a regular basis throughout the book.</p><p> HOFFMAN: That&#39;s funny, I&#39;ll have to check that instinct in myself. But I was waiting for a table and a young woman comes up to him and says, “Mr. Solomon, I work for you. “I&#39;m an analyst at Goldman.” And me and like six of my colleagues points over to some table. We all took the day off and came to the beach. And some of that is true.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Smart, smart thing to say to the CEO of Goldman Sachs. He was infuriated.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I tell that story because I think it like sets the table for this fight that we are somehow now, two years later, still having. I am, I would say, at the risk of being called like a capitalist shill. I&#39;m somewhat sympathetic to CEOs here, who for a lot of the pandemic, especially in places like New York, are walking around the city on the weekends and seeing the bars packed, and then seeing their offices empty on Monday.</p><p> So like, the it&#39;s not safe for us to come in, you are making us risk our lives, like was certainly true in the beginning, and you&#39;ll remember an outbreak on the, I think, equity trading floor.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Morgan Stanley.</p><p> HOFFMAN: JP Morgan.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Where genuinely like there were places that were not safe and I talk in the book a lot about the New York Stock Exchange for that reason. But at some point that just wasn&#39;t true anymore and you talked about flexibility and reassessing your priorities and that&#39;s totally fine to a point but there&#39;s clearly some professional self-indulgence that was baked in.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Here&#39;s my pushback to that, right? The US return to office is 60% except in big metropolitan areas where it&#39;s 50%. In Europe, it&#39;s almost 95%.这是为什么？ Their mass transit is much better. Their cost of housing is much lower. You could live much closer to your work. My big takeaway from the pandemic is that commuting in America sucks and sucks in a way that, oh my God, I&#39;m not going to do this anymore unless I have to. And a lot of people decided, It&#39;s amazing how we get used to something and you just don&#39;t question it. Lots of people have a two hour commute into the office because they can afford a place in Rockland or in Suffolk County or in mid New Jersey coming into New York as an example.</p><p> And suddenly recapturing three, four, five hours a day, “Hey, I don&#39;t care if I have to make 20% less. “I&#39;m not doing that.”</p><p> HOFFMAN: I think that, I totally agree though. I&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s a trade most people are willing to make, right? Morgan Stanley, you mentioned–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I think a lot of people made that trade, right?</p><p> HOFFMAN: You don&#39;t have to be here, but we&#39;re going to pay you for where you live, and people lost their minds about it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know, there was a study a couple months ago, I&#39;d have to go pull it, but I think it found that Americans got like 93 minutes back, or something, from work from home.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A day.</p><p> HOFFMAN: A day. And it, you know, spent it, I think, it was a little bit of a gender split, but like spent it, you know, a third, a third, a third on like work, personal life, and caregiving, and some other things.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And I don&#39;t remember the numbers, you could check me, in Europe they were lower, And then in Asia, they were like 120 minutes. So there is some, I&#39;d be curious to see what happens if you overlay that. But I think there&#39;s this frog boiling thing, which is your commute as your life gets more complicated, you get older, you get wealthier, kind of just expands. And it doesn&#39;t occur to you that that&#39;s weird to spend three hours of your day, because everybody does it. And then you don&#39;t do it anymore and you realize this is great.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The thing that I found so amusing in the first, I don&#39;t know, couple of quarters of the pandemic, the productivity numbers go through the roof. People are working longer hours and they just seem to be doing a better job at first.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yes, but then they start to, and I think it was Jamie Dimon last year who said, you know, as you can imagine, we keep quite close tabs on our employees and we notice that productivity on Fridays is really low.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, that&#39;s right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Which like, maybe we should have a four day work week. That&#39;s a totally fair–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not so far off, right?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally not far off. There&#39;s actually a lot of pilots, mostly in Europe, that are really interesting about this.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I love the stories about the people who didn&#39;t take Fridays off. They took two jobs and were doing two full jobs, time jobs at once and neither company figured it out.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yes, yes.</p><p> No, but I think to your point, journalism is an apprentice business.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I learned how to do it by sitting next to people who are really good at it. Not every job is like that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, but it&#39;s a very fair issue.</p><p> HOFFMAN: A lot of businesses like that, right? Like you hear, I would hear senior reporters on the phone, like learning how to talk to a source, you follow someone to a meeting, you learn how to deal with a client. That stuff is soft and is really hard to do remotely. And I think what young people actually want is, I think they&#39;re mostly okay going in, but they want real value.</p><p> They don&#39;t want taco Tuesday. They want to say, if I&#39;m here, I need to go to that meeting, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Like collaboration, mentorship, training, trailing.</p><p> HOFFMAN: The places that you&#39;re seeing the most turnover, we saw some data on this the other day, are the why am I here jobs, right? Which is the ones where people never left or have to go in. They work on the assembly line, they got to physically be there, they get that. And then the ones where people understand that they can be remote. I&#39;m often remote because I&#39;m out meeting sources or traveling or working at home or whatever. It&#39;s the ones in the middle where they&#39;re like, why am I here? This is a job that I could very much do from home and I&#39;m not getting any additional support or mentorship or encouragement. Those are the people who are quitting.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: My favorite story of that era was in the “Washington Post” about companies making people come into the office to do Zoom calls.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Well, and right, because there&#39;s this sort of equity belief, right, that there&#39;s some, And by the way, I think a lot of this will reset after the first promotion cycle, when people realize that FaceTime–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There&#39;s an advantage to be–</p><p> HOFFMAN: There&#39;s a huge advantage. And it&#39;s actually unfortunate, I think, if you track these cohorts, because the people for whom flexibility is deemed to be the most valuable are, frankly, like women with kids, minorities who have much further commutes and tougher personal situations that they need more time to deal with, but I actually think it&#39;s going to work against them, which is that the people who can afford, for a bunch of reasons, to come in every day and see the boss and slap some backs, are going to get overpromoted. And we&#39;re starting to see it now, we&#39;ll see how it shakes out in the commercial real estate market.</p><p> But companies are upgrading their space, but needing less of it. So trying to figure out how to actually right size your footprint and have an office that people want to be in.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, that&#39;s absolutely true. It&#39;s fascinating.</p><p> So I&#39;m in the office yesterday, and we have this new division that we launched, and we have people in from around the country, And it&#39;s like, wow, I forgot what it was like to have 20, 30 people in an office that normally holds 20 people, but the past year it has been eight, 10, 12 people.</p><p> It&#39;s like, everything&#39;s popping, we bring in lunch, it&#39;s this and that. Wow, this is kind of fun. I forgot how much fun it can be when you have an office full of people. We&#39;re more startup than established entity, so not everybody has that ability. I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;d buy into the, you must be here for culture. I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of that lately, but the FaceTime, the collaboration, the mentorship, just the learning how companies operate, that&#39;s got to be a huge, huge aspect of this whole thing.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I completely agree. And I mean, look, it&#39;s every generation kind of shakes their fists at the next one. So these kids have no respect. They don&#39;t know how anything works. But I do think like losing two years of that, if you were in your 20s, starting out, There&#39;s a lot of just sort of like passive osmosis that happens.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That you miss out on when you&#39;re remote. And, you know, whenever we see like a Zoom call with 20, 30, 40 people on it, it&#39;s usually one person, maybe two people speaking. And it&#39;s, wait, I have to give you my full attention for an hour? That seems like a lot for very little in return in terms of what you&#39;re learning. Like that could be a, if it&#39;s a half a page memo instead of 50 people spending an hour, isn&#39;t it more efficient to say, important, read this, as opposed to–</p><p> HOFFMAN: Well, it&#39;s the old joke, right? This meeting could have been an email, this email could have been a Slack, this Slack could have not existed, like whenever there&#39;s some inflation that happens. And I think it&#39;s good that some of that got dispensed with, but, and look, maybe I&#39;ll be wrong about this, but like AR, VR, it doesn&#39;t seem like a replacement to me.</p><p> Like the replacements seem bad. Like if you don&#39;t want to have a meeting, don&#39;t have a meeting. We don&#39;t have a fake meeting.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. I&#39;m with you on it. By the way, what you said, my colleague Mike Batnick had a hilarious Tweet, which was most books should be magazine articles, most magazine articles should be tweets, and most tweets should be deleted. Which I find to be–</p><p> HOFFMAN: I hope not this one. I hope this one justified the 300 pages.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So just so you know, what I found so interesting about the book is it reads, so we all went through this pandemic together. We all more or less experienced maybe 80% of the same stuff, the concern about what&#39;s going to happen with my job, what&#39;s going to happen with the economy, am I going to get sick? I&#39;ll never forget walking the dog around the block and watching a guy spray a package that was delivered with Lysol. How long did we idiotically wash down our groceries? Like there was a lot of confusion as to what was going on. So most of us had a very similar experience. What I really found entrancing about the book is, oh, there were a lot of people that had an incredibly more stressful, more at risk, higher level, real economic catastrophe experience than I had. And you use their storylines and the characters of the CEO of Delta and American Airline and Airbnb and Ford and Hilton and on and on and Goldman Sachs to tell a story.</p><p> I feel like I got to look behind the curtain of stuff that we all kind of suspected was going on during the pandemic, but most of us had no idea and that&#39;s what made the book so interesting to me. It&#39;s like, oh, there was some serious going down as this all unfolded.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I mean, first of all, thank you.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is that a fair description of the book?</p><p> HOFFMAN: I hope so. I mean, at some point you get so close to these projects, you kind of can&#39;t see them. So it&#39;s always nice to hear it from readers. But I think, well, just high level, one thing that I kind of wasn&#39;t aware of at the time was just how close it came to being really bad.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Worse, right, right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Really, really bad. And in some respects, I just think the economic toll would have been worse if the pandemic itself was not quite as bad, right? There is a sort of a thought experiment that you can do. You&#39;re like, okay, we have a pandemic that&#39;s half as bad.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I&#39;m not sure it generates the same–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Reaction.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Reaction. Same, you don&#39;t get $6 trillion. You get real divergence in outcomes, which ultimately, I&#39;ll tell you a funny story, that at some point, the subtitle of the book, I think was “Failure and Fortune in the Pandemic Economy,” or something like that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And at some point, I don&#39;t know, late, just from 2021, talking to my publisher, I was like, “You know, Paul, not a lot of failure at the end of the day.” I think corporate bankruptcies were at an all-time low in 2020, &#39;21.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You had a handful of retailers, and it was mostly local, local restaurants, and dry cleaners and things like that, but it wasn&#39;t the big companies.</p><p> HOFFMAN: No, right, and I think had the pandemic been just not as bad, you wouldn&#39;t have seen that incredible geyser of financial support.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I have a vivid recollection of early 2020 of a Congress that was so divided that a bill was introduced to rename a library and they couldn&#39;t move it forward.</p><p> And then the pandemic hits and the biggest fiscal stimulus in history, CARES Act 1, passes, it&#39;s 10% of GDP, it&#39;s over $2 trillion. How did this massive fiscal stimulus come together in such a short period of time?</p><p> HOFFMAN: On the economic side, I think the government did quite well. I actually think it&#39;s sort of an undersung hero in all this is Steven Mnuchin. I think he really deserves a lot of credit. And frankly, before the pandemic, when he became Treasury Secretary, he had obviously worked on Wall Street, he&#39;d come out of Goldman Sachs, he&#39;d asked people. I don&#39;t think there was like super high confidence that he was going to make his mark. And a lot of the jobs in Treasury remained unfilled. I mean, the administration was very chaotic.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Very slow to fill across the whole board. Every department.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally. This was like an understaffed financial regulatory apparatus run by someone pretty unknown that I&#39;m not sure the street specifically had a ton of confidence in and I think really nailed it.</p><p> So there&#39;s two pieces to this, right? There&#39;s the fiscal, the stimulus side, which is Congress. And look, nothing brings people together like a crisis. They are, you know, this. That&#39;s the other thing too is that I tried to kind of get back in the book. You got to remember, early pandemic, it became this terrible toxic sludge and groundhog&#39;s day forever, but it didn&#39;t start that way. It started out as kind of a unifying, weirdly earnest moment of like…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Genuine threat, life threatening.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It was obviously important at the moment and I felt that way, which is unusual. And I kind of wanted to try to bring people back to that moment that now sort of seems sort of saccharine and stupid that we bang pots out of windows and you know…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: at the time it didn&#39;t seem that way.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Congress like saying on the steps. I mean, the whole thing was goofy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you have a little bit of criticism, you both compliment and criticize the Trump administration, and you were talking about the key players. On the one hand, you have the Treasury Department, which really seems to be doing its best to hold things together. On the other hand, there&#39;s the White House and the CDC. How did both those groups do?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Look, I don&#39;t think this is a partisan or political statement, but the White House did not cover themselves in glory here, and neither did the CDC, which by, you know, in its nature…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which is kind of surprising.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It was not an overly political organization, right? Just the science was bad. And I don&#39;t think it was certainly not a conspiracy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The communication was bad also. It was very confusing.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Should we wear a mask? Should we not wear a mask?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Don&#39;t wear a mask, wear a mask, right, exactly.</p><p> I always like to tell people, if you don&#39;t think you should wear a mask, whenever you have surgery, tell everybody in the operating room, don&#39;t bother with the mask, they don&#39;t do anything, right?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, yeah, look, I mean, there were plenty of great books written about the Trump White House, and two “Washington Post” reporters wrote a great book about the health response itself, which you should really read. Looking at sort of the world that I know, just to the economic side, I think did a really good job with a couple of important caveats. The first one of which is the spigot was open too wide for too long. That last round of stimulus aid in, was it April of 21? Pretty clearly unnecessary, both from like a household wealth perspective and actually just the other day, I did a story looking back at the airline aid, and very clearly that last round of aid, totally unnecessary.</p><p> The first one, very clearly necessary and well done. You could argue about the second one, which is at the end of 2020.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let me ask you, that leads to an obvious question. The airlines as an industry got this giant package. Most other industries did not see the same, so the hotel industry didn&#39;t get that, the restaurant industry didn&#39;t get that. There were a lot retail. There were a lot of industries that the pandemic really tore a swath through that did not seem to have the same sort of luck in getting Congress to, how do you explain that?</p><p> HOFFMAN: You&#39;re right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Good lobbyists or right place, right time?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Partly good lobbying, but fundamentally airlines and actually banks too, which is why those tend to be the industries that we have to bail out every so often are national resources in private hands.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Planes are national resources. we need to have them and we&#39;ve decided that we&#39;d rather have the private sector manage them than the government. For, I don&#39;t know, customer service reasons, I don&#39;t know. But like, but–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Those big things, bad no matter who does them.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know, it is a, and actually I think the first time we meet an airline CEO in the book, it&#39;s Ed Bastian from Delta and he&#39;s at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January of 2020, giving a keynote, which is a weird place for an airline CEO to be, this is a gadget show, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And he&#39;s talking about, you know, the seat back entertainment should be a streaming platform, right? They&#39;re going to have this bionic software that shows you your itinerary when you look at a screen. I mean, really like next level stuff. And I tell that story as a reminder that like, airlines are an incredibly capital intensive business that involve flying really expensive hunks of metal around. And every like 10 to 15 years, something bad happens. And they had forgotten that. I think that industry had really thought they had escaped that boom and bust cycle. So plenty of arrogance coming into this. Plenty of people have rightly pointed out that they spent something like 96% of their free cashflow on stock buybacks.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Stock buybacks, yeah.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally, but like, had they spent 80%, that wouldn&#39;t have saved them either.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, unless they did no stock buybacks.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Look, you can have a company that is 100% cash, but like, that CEO won&#39;t have a job for very long because some investor&#39;s going to come in saying, “What are you doing?”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: There&#39;s an optimal capital structure, but there&#39;s not an optimal capital structure for a pandemic. And so look, and especially if the government is saying, it&#39;s not just the market telling you we don&#39;t want to fly, it&#39;s the government in a lot of cases saying, you cannot fly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You cannot fly.</p><p> HOFFMAN: We&#39;re shutting down your business, which is a wild thing to do in a capitalist society. And so look, ultimately, like I did an accounting of this recently for Semafor and the bill comes to something like $62 billion out the door of which less than a third is designed to be repaid. And that&#39;s sort of the math. There&#39;s some interest rates, some warrants getting out there that are somehow still underwater three years later should tell you something about the markets. But like–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Even though good luck booking a flight, everything is filled up.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Can you imagine that, so the travel hell that we went through in 2021, &#39;22, can you imagine how much worse that would have been if you had hundreds of thousands of people kicked off of payrolls, they lose their training, right? This is an incredibly regulated industry at the same time that a lot of airlines modernizing their fleets, so having to retrain pilots on new planes. I mean, it just would have been a disaster.</p><p> And by the way, like, you fire them, the government pays for them anyway, unemployment, which is less efficient.</p><p> HOFFMAN: So let&#39;s talk about Ford. You know, we haven&#39;t really brought them up. The CEO of Ford has a big role in here, like they did during World War II, where they built bombers and tanks and things like that. They start making respiratory devices, they start making masks, respirators. Ford really stepped up to the plate. Tell us a little bit about the CEO of Ford.</p><p> HOFFMAN: The CEO of Ford is a guy named Jim Hackett. And he was hired just a couple of years before the pandemic. Kind of an odd choice. And actually he&#39;s a little bit of an odd duck. Like really came, was running one of the biggest office furniture companies in the world before that. Really cerebral, really thoughtful, kind of wonky, a little hard to follow for the kind of like go left, go right crew that are, you know, the engineers that work in a place like Ford.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And so Ford had had a tough couple of years. They&#39;d come into the pandemic incredibly leveraged, huge amounts of debt. They lose their investment grade credit rating pretty early on, they&#39;ve got to cut their dividend. And this is a company that is in mortal trouble because every piece of its supply chain and its business doesn&#39;t work, right? You can&#39;t have people making cars. No one&#39;s going to buy a car. And even if they wanted to, the idea that they would go into a dealership and sit in a car that someone else had just tested.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Breathed in, right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, you got to remember, like it wasn&#39;t going to work. And then they have this whole huge finance business that is just massively at the mercy of credit markets and rates that was really high wire act. And so, I think the story of Ford that I tell is sort of in two pieces. One is that, which is they almost failed. Of all the companies that I looked at, I think they came the closest. And ultimately were saved by a pretty interesting bit of diplomacy, which is that you remember in the spring of 2020, and we talked a little bit earlier about the government&#39;s response, which is that they did in about six weeks when it took them six or nine months to do in &#39;08, just stand up a lot of these backstop facilities, figure out where the pain is, what they should buy, what they should put a floor under.</p><p> And they start to buy corporate bonds, which is a pretty dramatic step to take. I mean, that&#39;s really governments picking winners and losers, which is very un-American.</p><p> And, but you have to be investment grade to have your bonds be eligible for this facility that the Fed is, the Treasury is standing up. And, and Ford had lost it. And Jim Hackett, who spent a lot of time in Washington, I think he was on the board of Fifth Third for a while. So like knows, pretty well connected in finance. Calls Larry Fink at BlackRock and says, who&#39;s doing the bond buying for the government. Says, listen, I don&#39;t want to put you in a weird spot. I&#39;m not trying to be inappropriate, but like Ford is the kind of, we&#39;re acting the way that you guys want companies to act. Like we&#39;re not laying, we got a union contract, we&#39;re trying to be responsible, we&#39;re trying to be thoughtful. But when we come out on the back of this, like do you want a thriving industrial heartland sector or not?</p><p> And very quietly, there&#39;s a change made to that program, which is that if you had been investment grade, I think back in pre-pandemic, your bonds are eligible. And on the back of that, Ford launches the largest junk bond offering in history, massively oversubscribed, ends up at I think eight and a half billion, I don&#39;t remember, which really saves it. So you take away from that anecdote what you want, but–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It helps to know people–</p><p> HOFFMAN: It helps to know people.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: In the right position.</p><p> HOFFMAN: But also I think it was the right move. Like Ford is obviously a strong, important company and was waylaid by this. But the other story that you&#39;re talking about is, it&#39;s a company, and again, like I understand now that people will roll their eyes, but at the time there was a real–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It was a big deal.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It was a big deal, there was a real earnestness.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: When you see surgeons come out wearing garbage bags, because they don&#39;t have gowns, they don&#39;t have gloves, they don&#39;t have masks, hey, something&#39;s gone terribly wrong.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Totally, and the fact that it ended up on the private sector to solve it is insane, but that&#39;s where it was, and Ford is a company that bleeds Americana, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: They made bombers during World War II, they made iron lungs for polio patients, and it&#39;s a little bit of, I think, this sort of faded corporate titan trying to reinsert itself in the national narrative. There&#39;s a little bit of that. But–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But it was also the right thing to do.</p><p> HOFFMAN: But it was the right thing to do, and I think they deserve a lot of credit for it. I mean, ultimately, not a ton of respirators, it turns out that they&#39;re very complicated to make, but they made these, if you remember, one of the real concerns was that healthcare workers themselves were getting sick.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Didn&#39;t have masks.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Didn&#39;t have masks, and so they made these kind of like hoods, like respirators, that actually just clean–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So face shields also.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, exactly. And so, and they, I think they used, it was the fan belt from like a Ford F-150. It was, they called it Project Apollo, because you remember that scene in Apollo 13, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, where they had to fix the–</p><p> HOFFMAN: They dump everything they have on the table and say, “What can we build with this?” And so they used, I think the fan blower from the truck, they used DeWalt&#39;s power tool batteries.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, that&#39;s on the assembly line.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Because again, there&#39;s so much grimness baked into these decisions, because the concern was that we were going to be standing up field hospitals, and you don&#39;t have electricity. So you have to find things that run on battery packs or pneumatic power. I mean, just really dark stuff.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting stuff.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Contingency planning here was brutal.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you talk about Treasury did great, the White House not so much. What about the Federal Reserve? Did they have much of a role here? I mean, rates were cheap anyway. What&#39;s the difference between 1% and 0% at that point?</p><p> HOFFMAN: I mean, there&#39;s two places where you can be fairly critical of the Fed. One was before all of this, which is they had a really hard time turning off the tap in the 2010s.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Getting off the emergency footing.</p><p> HOFFMAN: They could not get interest rates up, which meant that they didn&#39;t have a lot of wiggle room to your point. You know, crisis hits, first thing you do obviously is lower interest rates. And they did, and that&#39;s fine, but it would have been a lot better if they were starting, say where we are today, at four or five and going to one or two.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. And the second thing?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Second thing is they were way behind the curve on inflation on the way out.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No doubt about it.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I really thought it would be temporary and it wasn&#39;t. And by the way, they work.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Transitory just is taking longer than expected. If you go back and look at CPI in March, 2021, that crossed through abruptly, their 2% target. And they sit on their hands for a full year after it goes from 2% and continues to go higher. I can&#39;t explain that. I don&#39;t understand that. other than the fact that historically, they&#39;re always late to the party.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I think that&#39;s right, but I think you saw like a diverging playbook, which is, if anything, on the fiscal side, they overdid it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And on the monetary side, they underdid it. And I don&#39;t know–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Until they panicked and overreacted and raised rates so fast, they began to break things.</p><p> HOFFMAN: 100%. And I would say probably the reason that Congress overdid it is that they are electable. People like getting checks.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Nobody doesn&#39;t get reelected because the fiscal stimulus was too big.</p><p> HOFFMAN: No, and like maybe someone at the Fed doesn&#39;t get reappointed, but that&#39;s such like an arcane, just like a different discussion. There&#39;s less at stake there. Clearly they were late, I would say probably by two meetings, maybe three to six months, depending on how you do it. They should have started in the fall of 2018.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I would say summer of 2021, but we&#39;re just nitpicking at this point.</p><p> All right, so we talk about White House, the CDC, the Fed, Treasury. Let&#39;s talk about a couple of states, because you don&#39;t really get into this very deeply in the book, but you briefly touch upon it. Hold aside his other woes, but there seemed to be a void coming out of the White House, and into that vacuum steps Governor Andrew Cuomo with a daily briefing that felt like, “Oh, someone&#39;s talking to us honestly like we&#39;re adults.” It was a breath of fresh air.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You hit at something that I think is true and I might take in a different direction, which is with this huge vacuum of public sector leadership coming out of Washington at a time that it was badly needed. My takeaway from that is actually that CEOs kind of stepped in. And I think part of the reason that, I think they kind of frankly wish they hadn&#39;t because really put themselves squarely in what I would now kind of call the culture wars, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The anti-woke-ism.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, exactly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: How dare you try and save fellow Americans from dying?你以为你是谁？</p><p> HOFFMAN: How dare you try to do anything doesn&#39;t have to do with running your business day to day, which is what a lot of the sort of pandemic leadership involved.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Before we let you go, we&#39;re going to get to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests. Starting with, tell us what you&#39;re streaming these days. What are you watching, listening to? What&#39;s keeping you entertained? What kept you entertained during the lockdown?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Well, I, about a year ago, quit my job at the “Wall Street Journal” and joined a startup. So I know this sounds terrible. I don&#39;t have that much–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The name of the startup is?</p><p> HOFFMAN: It&#39;s called Semafor. You can sign up at semafor.com.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I actually get your daily flagship.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It&#39;s terrific, yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I get flagship and it&#39;s great.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I will also sign you up for business before we leave. But so I actually tragically have less time for television than I used to. But I&#39;m obviously watching “Succession.” I just watched “The Diplomat” on Netflix.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I love that, we&#39;re on episode seven, it&#39;s great.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It&#39;s very good.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really well written, like almost believable in a strange way.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It&#39;s like if the Americans was a rom-com, that&#39;s why I enjoyed it. But one thing that I did genuinely love about the pandemic and obviously with all the caveats around that that belong there, one thing that I genuinely loved about some of the darkest days of the pandemic were just the way these things would become cultural phenomenons. Like something would just hit. So “Tiger King,” just like all anyone was talking about.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Unwatchable dreck, but —</p><p> HOFFMAN: I loved it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Some people loved it, right.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I&#39;m not a reality television person at all, but got sucked into “Love is Blind” because it was so insane and everyone was talking about it. These things kind of became–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Did you watch John Krakinski&#39;s weekly video he used to do? How delightful was that?</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yes, how delightful, and it&#39;s one of those things that now you look at it and you&#39;re like, God, it feels saccharine and sort of cheesy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No, not really.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Corporate sponsored and it was all, but at the time it was like really genuinely moving.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It was delightful and fun and you loved him already. It&#39;s like, oh, no wonder Emily Blunt married him. He&#39;s delightful and charming.</p><p> HOFFMAN: He was delightful. They were all delightful. No, there was something, there&#39;s some, I&#39;m not a culture reporter, and culture reporter would say it better, but there was something like some weird earnest monoculture that was kind of simmering during a lot of the pandemic that I miss a little bit, actually.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You know, when you go back to World War I and the popular entertainment of the day, it doesn&#39;t look saccharine. And every now and then, even during World War II, some of the Hollywood movies are a little jingoistic and a little, we just saw some movie with Cary Grant and I&#39;m trying to remember who it was where she&#39;s married to a German who turns out to be, an Austrian who turns out to be a Nazi and he&#39;s trying to get her out of Europe and it&#39;s like there&#39;s just a, and she gives her passport to the maid in Poland who&#39;s Jewish, like it wasn&#39;t jingoistic, I can&#39;t remember the name of it. Something honeymoon, something like that.</p><p> HOFFMAN: But I&#39;m actually surprised at how little pandemic media there was. Not a lot of movies have come out. There was one with Anne Hathaway and what&#39;s his name that was kind of interesting. But I actually think we just haven&#39;t really grappled with it as a culture.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Bo Burnham is the closest thing.</p><p> HOFFMAN: You know, that was terrific. “Inside” was great.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s the closest thing to a pandemic popular culture thing that was really quite fascinating.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sorry, next question. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career?</p><p> HOFFMAN:: You know, when I first joined the “Wall Street Journal” I sat right behind Dana Cimilluca, who was then the deputy M&amp;A editor, has now been the M&amp;A editor for a long time. And he was the first person who really taught me about kind of the dark art of some kinds of journalism and was just really learned how to, M&amp;A is a funny beat because most stories are basically one fact, but that fact absolutely has to be right.</p><p> And it&#39;s sort of unique in that way, I think. And learned a lot from him about how to handle really sensitive stuff and a little bit of black magic that goes on in certain beats. So I really, I learned a lot from him. And my boss after that was Marie Beaudette, who&#39;s totally different kind of editor, never really was a beat reporter in the traditional sense, but had incredibly good instincts about stories and really great judgment and encouraged me to be more authoritative and ambitious in the stories that I was telling. And I&#39;ve only been working for him for less than a year, but I&#39;ve learned a lot from Ben Smith, who&#39;s our editor-in-chief, and is really, I think, trying to build a new kind of journalism, and we&#39;re having a lot of fun doing it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really interesting. Let&#39;s talk about books. What are some of your favorite, and what have you been reading recently?</p><p> HOFFMAN: I am, perhaps disappointingly, I read a lot of, I read almost exclusively nonfiction. I read a lot of business nonfiction. I&#39;m like, I can&#39;t escape my job in my free time, I guess.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Hey, this is business nonfiction.</p><p> HOFFMAN: I wrote the kind of book that I like to read, really. You know, I had COVID actually for the first time around Christmas of last year, and I reread–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s funny, November for me, the first time.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, it&#39;s funny. If you get the audio book, which I recorded, I did it that week between Christmas and New Year&#39;s because it takes a couple of days and I have a full-time job, and I had COVID, and so you can kind of hear it. But actually I reread like “Barbarians at the Gate” and “Den of Thieves” like those old really great yarns.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “Genius Failed” is also in that same school.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Yeah, all those are great. And then there&#39;s a new generation of them that I&#39;ve really loved that friends and colleagues and competitors of mine have written. Tripp Mickle had a great book come out last year about Apple. He was my colleague at the “Wall Street Journal.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What&#39;s the name of that book?</p><p> HOFFMAN: He&#39;s Going to Kill Me, it&#39;s called “After Steve.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Okay, sure, I remember that coming out.</p><p> HOFFMAN: Which I really loved. Another former colleague, Erich Schwartzel, wrote this great book called “Red Carpet” about Hollywood and China, and soft power and business and commerce that&#39;s fantastic.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Interesting.</p><p> HOFFMAN: And again, he&#39;s going to think I&#39;m just buttering him up, but my boss, Ben, had a great book come out a couple weeks ago, really fortuitously timed, but about this era of viral digital media that is just now completely come crashing to an end. I thought that was a great read.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What&#39;s the name of that book?</p><p> HOFFMAN: It&#39;s called “Traffic.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “Traffic,” really intriguing.</p><p> Our final two questions, What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in journalism?</p><p> HOFFMAN: People have been talking about the death of journalism for a long time, and it&#39;s extremely true in local journalism, which is where I really kind of wanted to go. I wanted to apply to newspapers in Boulder and Topeka, and it was right at the sort of the start of the end for them. This was 2008, you know, Facebook and Craigslist were just killing their ad business, and they hadn&#39;t totally been hollowed out yet, but they were getting there.</p><p> I mean, like there will always be demand for smart people to make sense of an incredibly complicated world. Just sort of be agnostic about where that is. You know, again, I&#39;ve had four jobs basically in journalism. One was, again, at a parenting magazine in the Midwest, at a legal trade publication in New York, at the “Wall Street Journal” and then a thing that didn&#39;t exist a year ago. So you pick up skills at every one of them.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting.</p><p> And our final question, what do you know about the world of journalism and investigative reporting today? You wish you knew 10, 15 years ago when you were first getting started.</p><p> HOFFMAN: It&#39;s better to be lucky than good.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There you go.</p><p> HOFFMAN: If you can be both, that&#39;s great. And look, I think you put yourself in a position to get lucky, but I don&#39;t know, my one piece of advice I guess is always take the meeting. You literally never know.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Always take the meeting.</p><p> HOFFMAN: There is this 80/20 rule in journalism people talk about, which is that 80% of tips come from 20% of sources. These are like professional sources who know what the deal is. But I will tell you, that long tail is really long. And you get really interesting stuff if you&#39;re willing to spend some time on it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite fascinating.</p><p> Liz, thank you for being so generous with your time.</p><p> We have been speaking with Liz Hoffman.

My <em>Sunday morning</em> look at incompetency, corruption and policy failures:</p><blockquote><p> • <strong>Tesla created secret team to suppress thousands of driving range complaints</strong> : About a decade ago, Tesla rigged the dashboard readouts in its electric cars to provide “rosy” projections of how far owners can drive before needing to recharge, a source told Reuters.去年，这家汽车制造商收到了大量的练习场投诉，以至于它成立了一个特别团队来取消车主的服务预约。 ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> )</p><p> • <strong>Republicans&#39; excess death rate spiked after COVID-19 vaccines arrived, a study says</strong> : The excess death rate among Republican voters was 43% higher than the excess death rate among Democratic voters” after vaccine eligibility was opened. ( <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/25/1189939229/covid-deaths-democrats-republicans-gap-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR</a> ) <em>see also</em> <strong>Excess Death Rates for Republican and Democratic Registered Voters in Florida and Ohio</strong> : During the COVID-19 Pandemic In this cohort study evaluating 538 159 deaths in individuals aged 25 years and older in Florida and Ohio between March 2020 and December 2021, excess mortality was significantly higher for Republican voters than Democratic voters after COVID-19 vaccines were available to all adults, but not before. These differences were concentrated in counties with lower vaccination rates, and primarily noted in voters residing in Ohio.

By translating the Silicon Valley jargon of exits and scaling into the legalese of antitrust law, Wansley and Weinstein have opened a door for the prosecution of tech investors and their anticompetitive behavior. “Courts will have to adjust the way they&#39;re thinking about recoupment,” Weinstein says. “What did the investors who bought from the VCs think was going to happen? Did they think they were going to recoup?” That, he says, would be a “pretty good pathway” for courts to follow in determining whether a company&#39;s practices are anticompetitive.

Your car&#39;s digital infrastructure is a costly, dangerous nightmare – but for automakers in pursuit of postcapitalist utopia, it&#39;s a dream they can&#39;t give up on.

( <a href="https://racketmn.com/life-surge-grace-church-mn-tim-tebow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racket</a> )</p><p> • <strong>The Snow Crab Vanishes</strong> : Over the past few years, billions of snow crabs have unexpectedly disappeared from the Bering Sea. What happens to the Indigenous people who depend on them for survival? ( <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-snow-crab-vanishes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired</a> )</p><p> • <strong>Workers Wanted A Union. Then The Mysterious Men Showed Up</strong> .

( <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/07/26/covid-misinformation-doctor-discipline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> )</p><p> • <strong>The Greatest Scam Ever Written</strong> : How a Montreal copywriter swindled victims out of $200 million by pretending to be a legendary psychic.

But a few companies and executives had a very early read on what was to come.</p><p> One of the first people to realize markets were underestimating the risks was Bill Ackmann of <a href="https://pershingsquareholdings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pershing Square Capital</a> . Very early on, he realizes the credit market spreads were incredibly tight, with investors assigning no risk premiums to corporates or junk over investment grade. Ackman shorts the entire credit market, and two and half weeks later, the markets come to the same conclusion. His firm Pershing Square Capital bought $27 million of swaps that soon after became worth $2 billion.</p><p> She explains how Delta, Hilton, Ford, and soon-to-IPO also had an early heads-up as to the changing zeitgeist. As people became increasingly uncomfortable traveling, they were among the first to be hit with a wave of cancellations. Bankers like David Solomon of Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon of JPM also figure into the discussion.</p><p> A list of her favorite books <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/07/mib-liz-hoffman/#more-317442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is here</a> ; A transcript of our conversation is <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/08/transcript-liz-hoffman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a> Tuesday.</p><p> You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/liz-hoffman-on-the-pandemic-stories-impacting-markets/id730188152?i=1000622694204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Podcasts</a> , <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/44wqFI7hW8XMJlPWIK5zvq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> , <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/masters-in-business/episode/liz-hoffman-on-the-pandemic-stories-impacting-markets-305673720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stitcher</a> , <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-07-28/liz-hoffman-on-the-pandemic-stories-impacting-markets-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> , <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzRlNGNkOTEwLTQwYTEtNDYxOS1hNWYzLWFlMmIwMDEyZmZmZi81ODczYTNjYi0yOThmLTQwYmMtYjcxZi1hZTJiMDAxMzAwMGQvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> , and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe4PRejZgr0PzN7r8NikAnOqP70DHhoJ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> .
