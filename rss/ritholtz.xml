href="https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2023/07/fred-adds-macroeconomic-uncertainty-index-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">最近添加</a>到 FRED 出色的数据库中的。它是“衡量未来 1 个月、3 个月和 1 年整体经济状况的不可预测性的月度指标”。 <a href="https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2023/07/fred-adds-macroeconomic-uncertainty-index-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FRED 的帖子</a>指出，“经济学家 Kyle Jurado、Sydney Ludvigson 和 Serena Ng 使用一组 132 个单独的宏观经济时间序列来计算预测因子并估计特定时期的不确定性指标。”</p><p>我不相信它，因为在大多数情况下，世界太随机，大多数预测都不可靠，甚至没有用。当然，你可以推断出几周或几个月，但这并不是真正的预测，它比其他任何东西都更符合趋势。</p><p>我对此表示同意。</p><p>但华尔街常用的“不确定性”似乎与对经济状况不佳和/或市场波动加剧的担忧相关。充其量，这只是巧合，尽管上面的图表表明它实际上滞后了很多。这是在我们考虑

/></a></p><p></p><p>产生一些东西可以让你转向现金或债券或以其他方式对冲经济低迷，这是一项艰巨的任务。我不确定这些放大的图表中是否有很多可靠且鼓舞人心的信号。</p><p>除了滞后和不良信号之外，“不确定性”的<em>一个大</em>问题是所有不确定性指数中内置的固有假设。根据定义，未来总是未知且不可知的；这意味着不确定性是人类理解明年可能发生的事情的默认设置。如果我们忽视这个不言而喻的道理，我们就要自担风险。</p><p>正如我<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2012/06/revisiting-the-uncertainty-trope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">十年前</a>指出的那样，我们度过了快乐的小日子，却忽视了下一次经济衰退不可避免地带来的未来一系列可怕的事情：</p><blockquote><p> “大多数时候，人类生活在一个自我创造的幻想的快乐小泡沫中。我们不断地对自己撒谎。我们将过去和现在所做的一切都合理化。我们进行选择性感知，只看到与我们一致的事物。我们的选择性保留保留了好的东西，而忽略了其余的大部分。在人们的印象中，我们都比相机上显示的更年轻、更漂亮、更苗条、头发更多。</p><p><em>简而言之，我们创建了一个与客观宇宙仅有短暂相似之处的现实构造。</em></p></blockquote><p>一旦事情变得可怕，随着裁员的增加和市场的摇摇欲坠，我们对自己撒谎的能力就会受到损害。恐惧会对一个人造成这种影响。当“<em>不确定性</em>”上升时，并不是因为宏观环境充满挑战，而是因为我们头脑中的小叙述者被剥夺了说服我们相信过去几个月里有效的童话故事仍然有效的能力。</p><p>正如<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/03/imf-launches-world-uncertainty-index-wui-furceri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">国际货币基金组织提醒</a>我们的那样，世界总是充满不确定性；但在即时通讯和社交媒体的现代时代，我们似乎对此<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/05/half-empty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">更加敏感</a>：</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ahir-chart1.jpg" target="_blank"

/></a></p><p>为了让任何“不确定性指数”有价值，你必须相信你今天对未来的了解实际上少于一年前对未来的了解。我的观点是，在这两个时刻，你一无所知。区别在于，在某个时刻你感到害怕，而在另一个时刻你却没有。</p><p>我已经多次讨论过为什么情感大多是无用的。现在，将这种情绪应用到未来的情况中，你最终会尝试捕捉不确定性。我还没有找到一个<em>先验</em>有用的。</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>以前</em>：<br

RITHOLTZ，商科硕士主持人：这周的播客，哇，我玩得很开心，特别有趣，特别特别。无论如何，我有一个非常有趣的客人。丹·哈里斯 (Dan Harris) 写了《快乐 10%》一书。这是一篇简短的文章，讲述了他是如何陷入困境、抑郁、吸毒，以及在电视直播中他担任新闻播音员和主播时真正陷入恐慌的。他讲述了他如何偶然进入正念和冥想的故事。</p><p>我真正发现这本书令人着迷的是它没有伟大的承诺。这不会改变你的生活。它被称为“快乐 10%”，因为，嘿，如果你能让你的生活变得更好 10%，这对我来说听起来是一笔值得的交易。丹是一个迷人的人，他确实讲述了一个精彩的故事，讲述了他如何偶然进入自助领域，以及它如何真正帮助他扭转抑郁症和他的生活。</p><p>我发现丹是一个很有魅力的人，他对人类心理和我们生来的条件有很好的了解，并教我们如何充分利用我们继承的湿件。</p><p>我认为这是一次引人入胜的对话，我想您也会发现这一点。</p><p>话不多说，下面是我与“10% 快乐者”丹·哈里斯的对话。</p><p>丹·哈里斯（DAN HARRIS），作者，10% 快乐：谢谢你，巴里。很高兴来到这里。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们来谈谈您的背景吧。科尔比学院英语学士学位，从第一天起计划就是新闻吗？</p><p>哈里斯：我脑子里把电视新闻和电影混为一谈。我有点以为它们是同一件事。所以我 -</p><p> RITHOLTZ：有时是的。</p><p>哈里斯：是的，是的。我有做一些有趣和迷人的事情的愿望。电视新闻很有趣，但不太迷人。但当我在科尔比学院时，我去了纽约市的纽约大学电影学校学习了一个学期，我不太擅长电影，但我确实喜欢我参加的纪录片课程。</p><p>所以我在电视新闻领域进行了很多实习，然后我就朝着这个方向前进了。</p><p>里索兹：太迷人了。你在巴格达报道战争。你直接飞进了卡特里娜飓风的中心。这似乎是性感的、真实的事情正在发生。有些电视节目很迷人吗？</p><p>哈里斯：是的，我认为当我达到国家和国际水平时，那是相当迷人的。我更多地谈论的是大学刚毕业时的情况。我在缅因州班戈和缅因州波特兰等地的当地新闻界工作了七年。我用步枪报道轮胎火灾和谋杀案，呃，像很多随机的东西。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以让我们向前推进一点，不仅是你在 ABC 一段时间，而且最终他们会选择你来填补，呃，晚上、周末和很晚。</p><p>然后你接到一个电话，要与一些大人物合作，你知道，你只能在电视直播中陷入恐慌。告诉我们那次经历。</p><p>哈里斯：太糟糕了。那是 2004 年。我当时是一名新闻阅读员。这就好像这个人会在每个整点的时候出现并阅读“早安美国”的头条新闻。我说了几秒钟就失去了兴趣。我的心开始狂跳，肺部也开始痉挛。我无法呼吸，如果你想做新闻，这会很不方便。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这不会有什么不方便。</p><p>哈里斯：是的，没用。我不得不中途退出，这真是太丢脸了，非常可怕，我，你知道，最终这对我来说真的是一件好事，但在那一刻，这是我一生中最尴尬的时刻。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：公平地说，你可以在 YouTube 和其他地方找到它，你看起来有点痛苦，呼吸有点困难。我确信内心感觉更糟，但值得赞扬的是，你把它保持在一起足够长的时间来完成其中一个部分，然后敲出，即使你还有几个部分要完成。</p><p>除非您密切关注，否则我认为普通观众可能不会注意到任何事情，除了视频突然与正在发生的事情不匹配之外。</p><p>哈里斯：是的，我的意思是成为一个反社会者是有帮助的。你知道，就像我真的可以隐藏自己的情绪一样。我想，你知道，我当时 32 岁。我基本上整个成年生活都是在镜头前度过的。我真的知道如何在各种情况下保持一致。我去过战区。所以，是的，你是对的。当你看视频时，你会发现这不像我，我满头大汗，然后扯下麦克风逃跑。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，阿尔伯特·布鲁克斯的广播新闻中的场景，就像刚刚湿透一样，总是，总是让我笑起来。但话虽如此，这引出了一个显而易见的问题。你经历过充满死亡和破坏的悲惨情况，毫不夸张地说，你经历过伊拉克、巴格达和卡特里娜飓风以及其他一些可怕的情况。是什么导致了这一刻让它如此迷失方向？</p><p>哈里斯：我认为这是在可怕的情况下，然后回家并患有未确诊的抑郁症和焦虑症，然后使用包括可卡因在内的消遣性药物进行自我治疗。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我喜欢自我治疗这个表达方式。正如你所说，我们刚刚变得兴奋。</p><p>哈里斯：是的，越来越兴奋，但是我们——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：麻木疼痛。</p><p>哈里斯：我们会自我治疗，或者用很多东西来获得快感。</p><p>里索兹：当然。</p><p>哈里斯：购物、赌博、娱乐、社交媒体、性、食物，我们一直在——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：多巴胺瘾君子，对吗？</p><p>哈里斯：是的，我们正在缓解这种内心的不满足，这种内心的恐惧，所以对我来说，它是可卡因，当我在广播中出现惊恐发作时，我并不兴奋。所以直到后来我去看心理医生时，他问：“你吸毒吗？这可能是一个贡献者吗？”我当时想，“哦，是的。”</p><p> RITHOLTZ：嗯，我并不吸毒，只是在周末吸毒。</p><p>哈里斯：完全正确。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：然后我回到办公桌上准备出发。那么，让我们谈谈这如何导致了，我讨厌表达之旅，但这如何导致了你接下来的几个步骤。你对冥想的先入为主的观念是错误的。您在书中写道，告诉我们原因。</p><p>哈里斯：这很有趣，我也讨厌“旅程”这个词。就像是-</p><p>里索兹：对吗？</p><p>哈里斯：我觉得——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：太任性了。</p><p>哈里斯：而且，这就像已经结束了一样。这是陈词滥调、陈词滥调。我认为对语言的挑剔或者对我使用的词语的挑剔实际上是我在这里添加的唯一价值。我知道我们要谈论生意，但对我来说，我的意思是，我对冥想或所谓的灵性真的很感兴趣，但它经常用“旅程”和“以心为中心”等词来表达，而且——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：非常呜呜。</p><p>哈里斯：这是——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：感谢使用“persnickety”这个词，这是一个很棒的词。我真的很感激。</p><p>哈里斯：当它从我嘴里出来时，我就想，天哪。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：不，不，这有效。所以我们不喜欢装扮的呜呜一面，这实际上是一种让内心的声音安静下来的方法，有时内心的声音真的很吵闹，这会引导我们走向你的下一步，再次抱歉。你最终要么见到埃克哈特·托尔，要么会见埃克哈特·托尔。告诉我们一些关于——我没有正确地发音他的名字。</p><p>哈里斯：这是一个很难发音的名字。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，但请告诉我们一些关于他的事情。</p><p>哈里斯：好的，首先发生的事情是，我被指派为美国广播公司新闻报道信仰和灵性，这是我不想做的，但事实证明这很棒，我学到了很多东西，通过这件事，我最后读了一本名叫埃克哈特·托尔（Eckhart Tolle）的人写的书，这是他的发音。畅销自助大师。</p><p>里索尔兹：是的。</p><p>哈里斯：我从来没有听说过他，因为我对自助不感兴趣，但我的一位制片人建议我读他的书。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：请给我们介绍一下托尔，以及您从这位绅士身上学到了什么？</p><p>哈里斯：至少在我的眼睛和耳朵看来，他完全令人反感。他有一种超凡脱俗的空灵感。他是一个身材矮小的德国人，他写了关于精神觉醒的文章，他经常使用“振动”这个词。这不是我真正喜欢的。</p><p>里索兹：长袍？</p><p>哈里斯：没有长袍。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：花环？</p><p>哈里斯：没有长袍，什么都没有。但如果他——考虑到我在他的书中读到的内容，如果他是这样出现的，我不会感到惊讶，但他实际上就像一个穿卡其裤的人。</p><p>里索兹：（笑声）</p><p>哈里斯：一开始我对他不太感兴趣，但后来他开始展开这篇关于人类状况的论文，这让我非常着迷。他的论点是，我们所有人的头脑中都有一个声音，他指的不是精神分裂症或听到声音，他指的是内心对话，我们一直在进行的内心对话，如果我们大声广播，我们就会会被锁起来。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：（笑声）或者至少取消了。</p><p>哈里斯：他妈的肯定你会被取消。对于我们所有人来说，我们醒来，被这个声音从床上赶下来，它整天对我们抱怨，我们不断地想要东西，不想要东西，评判别人，把自己与其他人比较，贬低自己。当你没有意识到这种不间断的对话时，托尔称之为自我，当你没有意识到自我时，它就拥有了你。这对我来说是一个巨大的啊哈，因为我想，好吧，这是真的。我以前从未听说过，A.</p><p> B，这个自我，我头脑中的这个声音导致我惊恐发作。我去报道战区。我当时的老板是你的同事大卫·威斯汀。我出发去报道战区，没有考虑心理后果。回到家，我感到沮丧，自我意识不够，不知道自己沮丧，然后盲目地自我治疗，或者变得兴奋，然后这一切都在我脸上爆发。这全都是自我。</p><p>这真的让我感动，改变了我的生活。这是一个被过度使用的短语，但确实如此。读那本书改变了我的生活。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么你是从 Tolle 的书里摘下来的，它的名字是？</p><p>哈里斯：我读的那本叫做《新地球》。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：但是他有很多书，对吧？一整套书。</p><p>哈里斯：他写了一大堆书。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：从那里开始，你开始冥想。告诉我们最初的经历是什么，当你意识到，嘿，这是我可以定期做的事情。</p><p>哈里斯：所以托尔很令人沮丧，因为他很好地描述了头脑中的声音，但实际上并没有给你任何帮助。我的一个朋友开玩笑说他是对的，但没有用。所以见到他后我很沮丧。在那之后，我徘徊了一段时间，才偶然发现了冥想，那是在 2008 年、2009 年，所以那是在冥想变得流行之前。 60 年代很酷，然后变得不酷，然后又变得很酷，就像早期一样。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：它确实来了又去，TM，超验冥想曾经盛行了一段时间，现在它有了各种各样不同的名字。那么你进入冥想的入门药物是什么？你是怎么找到路进来的？</p><p>哈里斯：科学。我开始阅读所有这些当时还没有得到充分宣传的科学知识，这些科学表明冥想可以重新连接大脑的关键部分，帮助缓解焦虑和抑郁，这两种问题我从小就一直在应对。它可以帮助降低血压，增强免疫系统。因此，作为一名彻头彻尾的优化者，科学确实让我着迷。我当时想，“哦，好吧。也许我应该尝试一下这个。”我也想，但作为一名记者，你会对此产生共鸣，巴里，就像，因为科学并不为人所知，我当时想，哦，这是一个好故事。没有其他人参与这个故事。这是我一生中第一次真正走在潮流的前面。所以我开始尝试。</p><p>我开始每天花几分钟，这非常困难。这非常令人沮丧。你知道，通常当你坐着时，我们不必在这里过多讨论细节，但冥想基本上包括坐着，闭上眼睛，试图专注于一件事。通常是呼吸的感觉。你没有深呼吸，你只是像平常一样感受呼吸。然后每次你分心时，这种情况会发生一百万次，因为我们的思想很疯狂，你就会一次又一次地开始。但最后一部分真的很难，因为这就像手里拿着一条活鱼。头脑是如此古怪和失控，不断地计划和提出愚蠢的问题，沙鼠在哪里狂奔，等等，等等。如果你认为自己在这方面失败了，你很容易灰心丧气。</p><p>所以一开始我对此很挣扎，我想大多数人都是如此。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：读这本书时，我很震惊，一些关于正念的建议与良好的投资建议有多么相似。我将向您提供我从书中摘录的有关您的经历的几句话。我忍不住指出它与良好的投资建议有多么相似。让我们从争取成功开始就可以了，只要你意识到结果不在你的控制之下。告诉我们这一点。</p><p>哈里斯：首先，我认为您的见解非常好。我确实认为你想要给你的日常头脑带来的理智和你想要给生活这个重要领域——投资——带来的理智之间有很大的重叠。</p><p>所以不执着于结果。这是佛教徒给我们的一个非常笨拙的短语。但这基本上意味着我们生活在一个完全不受我们控制的世界。所以我们能做的就是，这是一个很好的表达，我们能做的就是我们能做的一切。你可以尽情地努力，你可以尽情地思考、分析市场，但事情并不完全在我们的掌控之中。</p><p>因此，如果你能有这种态度，我会尽我所能，并认识到我无法控制结果，我不应该执着于具体结果，我认为这是普遍幸福和良好投资的秘诀。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，我认识的最好的交易者关注的是过程，而不是结果，因为如果你有一个好的过程，即使你有一个很好的过程，有时在外面，听着，我们无法控制美联储将要做什么或者企业盈利是多少，或者嘿，这个债务上限的事情，也许有效，也许无效，但结果只会与你的过程加上世界的一些随机性一样好。</p><p>哈里斯：当然。中国停工，供应链堵塞，印度有季风。我的意思是，有很多难以预测的因素，比如政治动荡。那么你想做什么？每次发生超出你控制范围的事情时，你都想殴打自己吗？这会有助于你的恢复力吗？这会让您的团队在办公室感到高兴吗？不。</p><p>你想要做的是有一个良好的过程并抱有最好的希望。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么另一个问题，当你担心时问自己一个简单的问题，引用：“这有用吗？”我发现这很有趣。我经常接到客户的电话，他们惊慌失措，我刚刚在电视上看到这个新闻报道，担心有什么好处呢？该压力有什么价值？</p><p>哈里斯：有时，有时，一定程度的担忧和压力会有所帮助。我称之为建设性的痛苦。</p><p>里索兹：动机？</p><p>哈里斯：是的，或者就像从各个角度思考一样，你知道，有一点手动操纵，而且，你知道，你知道，有一个很棒的表达方式，永远不要独自担心。因此，我认为与您的同事、朋友或配偶谈论投资或其他任何事情实际上很有意义。</p><p>然而，我们往往担心得太过头了。当你第十七次经历所有可怕的事情时，如果你没有得到你想要的投资回报率，或者如果你错过了你的航班或其他什么，也许在那一刻问问自己，这个有用吗？我换个频道并考虑其他事情会不会更好？</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以这反映了标题本身，“小的改进、渐进的改变比巨大的转型胜利更可行。”这是一个巨大的见解。</p><p>哈里斯：你有多少次经历过巨大的转变时刻？他们不会遇到或来，他们不会经常越过横梁。通常，你认为的巨大转变时刻会成为美好的回忆，但不会融入你的生活。</p><p>改变是困难的。变化是，这是坏消息。好消息是这是完全可行的。如果你承诺做出一些小改变，那 10% 的幸福感将像任何良好的投资一样逐年复合。这是一个令人难以置信的好消息。</p><p>快乐、平静、平静、联系、慈悲，所有我们想要的心灵状态，只是简单的旁白。我们可能认为我们想要金钱、权力、成功，但归根结底，我们真正想要的是生命的基本粒子，是心灵状态。我们想要感受特定的方式。这些心理状态都是你可以训练并承担责任的技能。这是令人难以置信的消息。心是可以训练的。你可以在脑部扫描中看到它。你在功能磁共振成像中对某人的大脑进行基线读取，然后让他们进行几周的冥想，然后将他们放回扫描中，大脑就不同了。大脑可以被训练，思想也可以被训练，这是一个非常令人振奋的消息。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这是我非常喜欢的另一句话。正念代表了被动生活的另一种选择。</p><p>哈里斯：是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们来谈谈反应和响应之间的区别，您将其描述为与某些输入交互的两种截然不同的方式。</p><p>哈里斯：我可以想象很多从事投资或金融业务的人普遍会有这样的感觉：如果他们太高兴，他们就会失去优势。而这并不是这项技能的全部意义。你看到高管和更衣室里的人在冥想是有原因的，因为这会让你变得更加敏锐，情绪反应更少。</p><p>因此，正如您之前所说，您想要的是能够明智地应对生活中发生的事情，而不是被自我的恶毒傀儡所俘虏，这会让您做出愚蠢的决定，说出那些将要发生的事情毁掉你婚姻接下来的48小时，仅仅因为你脑子里突然浮现出一些小想法，就吃掉了奥利奥的袖子。您希望能够明智地应对内部刺激和外部刺激，以便顺应生活的所有变化，而不是淹没在其中。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：在生活的变化中冲浪，我真的很喜欢这样。</p><p> I have a colleague, Mike Batnick, who has this wonderful chart going back 30, 40 years, and it&#39;s called Reasons to Sell, And you see every year there&#39;s some crazy thing that happens. That&#39;s an excuse to react and sell. But over the whole time, that chart goes from the lower left to the upper right. And the markets compound and go over time.</p><p> If you react to the reasons to sell, you miss out on that big move up. And I see parallels in the book for just how we live our everyday lives.</p><p> HARRIS: Absolutely. Yeah, you don&#39;t want to miss out on dollar cost averaging because you&#39;re freaking out about every little jot and tittle in the news. Like you, I also have a podcast. Also, mine is called “10% Happier.” And we spend quite a bit of time talking about the psychology of money, because that&#39;s a huge part of the human condition. We need money. But we also don&#39;t want to get so obsessed with it that we make irrational decisions.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned executives and athletes. A lot of Wall Streeters very famously meditate– Ray Dalio, Paul Tudor Jones, Michael Novogratz, Dan Loeb, the list goes on and on and on. Have you worked with any people in finance and how have you found their intensity level and their ability to throttle back a little bit?</p><p> HARRIS: Well, then there&#39;s Axe in “Billions.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, I&#39;m trying to stay away from the fictional characters.</p><p> HARRIS: I, it&#39;s very interesting. I do a lot of corporate speaking and a lot of banks bring me in, investment banks, big banks. And I think it&#39;s really about wanting to have people who are, a more business-friendly term might be emotionally intelligent, who can ride the waves, you know, as we said before, rather than drowning in them, and who can be good leaders instead of acting out all of their neuroses. These are important skills in any field, but I get a lot of invitations from people in finance.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You mentioned some people are concerned they would lose their edge, not be competitive. Do you have to be paranoid and worried all the time to stay at the top of your game?</p><p> HARRIS: Do you think it helps? Like I mean this is something I&#39;ve wrestled with a lot. I&#39;d be curious to see what your point of view is. You know I do a lot of worrying but at some and I do believe up into a certain point it&#39;s useful.</p><p> But at some point it&#39;s completely degrading my judgment, it&#39;s degrading my sleep, it&#39;s degrading my capacity to have an open mind with peripheral vision for new opportunities because I&#39;m coiled into anger or fear. You know, only a certain amount of it is useful and I just, I can&#39;t see the argument for being, it being perpetually useful.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So the key, since you asked me, I&#39;ll answer. The key from my perspective is you have to worry about the right things and recognize. So my favorite joke is talking to a manager who is complaining about the Fed. First it was quantitative easing and then it was zero interest rates and they&#39;re complaining, complaining, complaining. And in the back of my head, I&#39;m always thinking, “Oh, this guy&#39;s underperformed for a decade and he&#39;s blaming the Fed.”</p><p> That&#39;s very different than saying, “Hey, the Fed is talking a lot about inflation in 2021 and it sounds like they&#39;re going to rapidly raise rates. What happens when rates go up rapidly? Well, it&#39;s very bad for long dated bonds. I got to tighten my duration and own shorter dated bonds so they won&#39;t take a 10 or a 20% hit if rates do go much higher.</p><p> That seems to be a more responsive way of worrying as opposed to just freaking out about something that&#39;s out of your control.</p><p> HARRIS: I love what you said. Worrying about the right things. Prioritize your worry and then stop it and you know live your life get enough sleep. All of those things will help your performance writ large and useless, miasmatic, you know constant freaking out is rarely helpful.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So explain to me how do you go from, “Hey, this meditation thing helps me stay a little centered, quiets the voices in my head,” to, “I know I&#39;ll write a book on this.”</p><p> HARRIS: This is a business story actually because I had an entrepreneurial feeling back in 2009, I think, that I was reading all of these books about meditation that were really helpful but they were also really annoying and they were written in a cloying, sentimental way, and I thought, “Well, I&#39;m going to write one that has the F word in it a lot, and that tells a very embarrassing personal story.” And my whole goal was to make meditation attractive to a whole new audience of skeptics. And that was an entrepreneurial itch that I had.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s kind of interesting. I love the premise that practicing meditation and mindfulness will make you a little happier. Why 10%?</p><p> HARRIS: It&#39;s funny. I mean, it was a joke. I mean, I was in a conversation with somebody, one of my colleagues at ABC News, and she was asking me, like, “Why are you into this meditation thing? What&#39;s the matter with you?” And I said, I was kind of reaching for some answer that would satisfy her, and I said, “Eh, it makes me like 10% happier.”</p><p> And I could see that it just made her go from scorn to mild interest. And I thought, “Okay, this is my schtick. I&#39;m just going to say that.” And my publishers didn&#39;t get the joke. They were trying to bargain me up to 30% happier.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re haggling over the title.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes, we were haggling.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But, you know, the idea of “10% Happier,” the whole concept of incremental change and not overselling it and here&#39;s the bar and then we&#39;re going to pass the bar, that&#39;s a great approach as opposed to all the other books that promise to transform your life and then sit on the shelf a third read and disappoint them.</p><p> HARRIS: If they really were going to transform your life, those authors wouldn&#39;t keep writing more books, right? And that overpromising, that kind of reckless hope that is peddled in the darker precincts of the self-help world is, I think, what I was really trying to counterprogram against. And like I said earlier, though, the 10% does compound annually.</p><p> These are skills and happiness and the other mental states that we want are skills, as I keep saying, because I think it&#39;s so important and interesting and we can just, you can continue to get to improve over time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So the first line of the book just cracked me up. My inner voice is an (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Explain why your inner voice seems to be disagreeing with you.</p><p> HARRIS: I think it&#39;s a pretty much a statement of the universal, you know, of the human condition. We have these nattering, chattering inner voices that are constantly running us down, constantly making negative comments about other people, and that is, you know, we don&#39;t, that&#39;s not actually something we should feel guilty about. I think it&#39;s because of evolution, you know, evolution bequeathed us this mind that is racing, why? Because we need to look —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Always looking for threats.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes, saber tooth tigers, food, sexual partners, because natural selection really didn&#39;t care about your happiness, it cared about getting your DNA into the next generation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, right.</p><p> HARRIS: And so that is the mind we&#39;re left with. And there are beautiful parts of it, like without the racing mind we probably wouldn&#39;t have skyscrapers or the iPhone. And so yeah, there are a lot of great parts of the human mind, but there are a lot of bugs in the design. And one of the bugs is that we&#39;re never satisfied, we&#39;re rarely satisfied, we&#39;re rarely in the present moment. And the good news is that you can train yourself to kind of reduce the power of those bugs.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So I don&#39;t find my inner voice to be as distasteful as yours, but I have a very noisy internal dialogue. It&#39;s lots of distraction, constant input. And my wife says, you know, nothing escapes my notice, we&#39;re sitting out having dinner and after every now and then she&#39;ll like tell me about the people in that corner.</p><p> So well he came in from the bathroom, the zip was open. After the second he walked away, the wife pulled out the phone and started, just peripheral vision and it&#39;s not that I&#39;m trying to pay attention to other stuff, it&#39;s just everything is this fire hose of input and then everybody in the back of my head is having a conversation about it.</p><p> So I don&#39;t find it&#39;s like a nasty, unpleasant person chattering away, it&#39;s just a cacophony. And I would love to be able to sort of quiet that down a bit.</p><p> HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s, as with a lot of the things I say, it&#39;s meant to be kind of poetic language in the form of a joke. And so yes, what you&#39;re describing isn&#39;t necessarily as noxious as some of the thoughts that come up in my head. And yet it is making you less happy. And in that sense, it&#39;s an (EXPLETIVE DELETED) and so, and what my point is, is that there are practices that can turn the volume down.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk a little bit about writing the book.</p><p> I know sometimes it&#39;s exhilarating, sometimes it&#39;s a slog, sometimes it&#39;s both. What was your experience like putting this down on paper? I know you spent four years writing this.</p><p> HARRIS: Five years, I think.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Five years.</p><p> HARRIS: Whenever anybody says I really love writing, I think, oh, you must be a bad writer, because it&#39;s awful, and it just took so much sweat and grit, and I was doing it as a side hustle. I had a full-time job as the anchor of Nightline and the anchor of the weekend edition of “Good Morning America.” It was so hard, and I&#39;m now on a, I&#39;m writing the sequel right now, and I think I&#39;m in my sixth or seventh year. It is just so hard for me to write. I&#39;m trying to learn these important lessons and then give it back to you in the form of a narrative.</p><p> I want you to feel like you&#39;re watching a movie and that you could read it in an afternoon because the story&#39;s good and it tugs you along, but I need to weave in all of these teaching points and for me, the blocking and tackling of that is very, very hard.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s work and it&#39;s very hard to do on the side.</p><p> If you&#39;re just doing that, and then when I was writing my first book, I remember I had to do less because your discipline, your creativity, it&#39;s a very, very small tank and it gets exhausted pretty quickly. So at the end of a long day to sit down and pound out 20, 30 pages, that&#39;s really hard.</p><p> HARRIS: You&#39;re absolutely right. I mean, that&#39;s an insight. I hadn&#39;t really thought about this. It&#39;s true. I mean, I have retired from ABC News, so I have fewer things on my plate, but I host a podcast, which is two, almost three times a week.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s a lot.</p><p> HARRIS: It&#39;s a lot and I&#39;m writing this book and I&#39;m working on some TV stuff and I give speeches. I have a lot of stuff going on still and one of the biggest battles for me is the tank issue that you just talked about. Because if somebody gets on my calendar in the morning, well that completely derails my creative time and there&#39;s an opportunity cost. Any amount of time I&#39;m thinking about something else or being creative in somebody else&#39;s lane, it reduces my capacity to finish my own work.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: When do you do your writing? I personally have found like five to eight in the morning is just the golden hour.</p><p> HARRIS: I, for me, will get up at around seven or eight, because for me, I really try to get enough sleep. So I&#39;ll get up around seven or eight. I don&#39;t have a boss, so I can do whatever the hell I want.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, the same.</p><p> HARRIS: And I work most of the morning, but I interrupt it. So I&#39;ll try to not have anything else on my calendar to one or two.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HARRIS: And so I will write for that time, but I will interrupt it with meditation and exercise. So that I&#39;m not, you can&#39;t really write for more than 90 minutes at a time in my experience.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There&#39;s something to that. And then get up from your desk, take a walk around the block, come back. That&#39;s when you could do the edit, revise it. But that creative first flow, I love that feeling early in the morning when it&#39;s like a clean slate of paper and a fresh reboot, words just tumble out, it&#39;s very, very different.</p><p> HARRIS: I really don&#39;t have, I have very few moments of joy. It really is mostly suffering for me. And I&#39;m wondering, can I do this again? I&#39;m 51, almost 52, and I think I could write small books or more like how-to books, but these big books like this one I&#39;m writing now that is like a movie of a true narrative or like “10% Happier” they just read. It takes so much out of me, I&#39;m not sure. Maybe I could do one more before I die, but I don&#39;t even know.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So if you break it down into smaller pieces, it&#39;s much more doable.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And putting out, you know, thousand word columns, 800 word columns.</p><p> HARRIS: That I could do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So that&#39;s all a book is, is a collection of those shorter chapters.</p><p> HARRIS: Not my books though, because it has this, it is a movie. Oh, you could have the thread weaving through the whole tapestry. You could certainly do that. To me, as soon as you get into that, it&#39;s like it&#39;s too —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> HARRIS: It&#39;s like building the Taj Mahal. You know, it&#39;s just too — that, for me, and I maybe just don&#39;t have a good brain, but doing a discrete thousand-word essay, I&#39;ll occasionally write something for “The Times” or whatever, that&#39;s hard, but it&#39;s discreet and I can get it done quickly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HARRIS: But as soon as I have to think about the structure, the themes carrying out and building upon one another and the scenes that are required in order to teach it, I&#39;m torturing you with my process here.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No, I find it fascinating because–</p><p> HARRIS: But it&#39;s very hard.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I have two projects I&#39;m working on and one of them is just trying to stitch together all these previous writings and the other is something from scratch that&#39;s a whole broad overview of something that, word one, I wrote the introduction, and that was pretty much it. It&#39;s easier stitching together the previous thoughts than coming up with a whole holistic tapestry from scratch.</p><p> That said, the journey of 1,000 miles begins with one step and breaking big projects up into smaller and smaller chunks makes it doable, right?</p><p> HARRIS: Totally agree.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Like if you&#39;re thinking about, I have a 500 word book to write, that&#39;s paralyzing. I have to write the introduction, I have to write the overview, I have to put together the structure. That makes it almost tolerable.</p><p> HARRIS: I completely agree with you. I just think the difference here is that in books like “10% Happier” and in the next book I&#39;m writing, which is called “Me, A Love Story.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> HARRIS: I&#39;m glad you get that joke. Some people don&#39;t get it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I think that&#39;s very funny.</p><p> HARRIS: I&#39;m really trying to make a movie. What I mean by that is it&#39;s a yarn. It&#39;s not me sharing a bunch of ideas with you. It should feel like you&#39;re on one person&#39;s story the whole way, and weaving the teaching points into that is just really, anyway, I&#39;m rambling at this point.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No, no, this is all good.</p><p> So what do you make of the claim that really you just need 12 and a half minutes of meditation a day to see positive results? I keep seeing 10 minutes, 12 minutes, how realistic is that?</p><p> HARRIS: Okay, so that 12 and a half minute number, I believe comes from a neuroscientist.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> HARRIS: It&#39;s a friend of mine at the University of Miami. Her name is Amishi Jha, and she studies high stress, people in high stress fields, like first responders and Marines. And she has found that the minimum effective dose for her populations is 12 and a half minutes a day. And I believe her.</p><p> However, I feel like it&#39;s daunting for most people to hear that if you&#39;ve never meditated before. And so I say two things. One, one minute counts, it will confer benefits. And we know from behavior change science that starting small is really important.</p><p> The second thing I have to say is daily-ish. Give yourself flexibility, don&#39;t beat yourself up if you miss a day, don&#39;t get overly persnickety about which time of day you&#39;re meditating. Give yourself a break and take it easy and start small and that is the route to effective habit building.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So what is the response to the book been like? And let me just tell the listening audience, you were 15 minutes late from speaking upstairs because we couldn&#39;t get you out of there because it was a giant line of people asking you to sign books. So I have to think the response has been really positive.</p><p> HARRIS: The most amazing thing that&#39;s happened in my professional life, right below having a child and getting married. I mean, I can&#39;t believe it. It&#39;s almost 10 years since the book came out. I honestly, honestly thought that it would go nowhere.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You describe it as a fiery failure. Your mom begged you not to write about your personal failures.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes, I was terrified. And that this thing has turned into something that&#39;s so helpful for so many people. It swallowed my life. You know, I mean, I quit this career that I loved in TV news to do this full-time, to host a podcast, to write more books, and to give speeches, and it&#39;s just incredible. It&#39;s absolutely incredible and I&#39;m, this is a clichéd thing I&#39;m about to say, but I&#39;m like really grateful.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Nothing wrong with a little gratitude, can&#39;t go wrong with that.</p><p> What practical tips do you have for incorporating meditation, mindfulness, whatever, into people&#39;s daily lives? Because the thing that makes the book so interesting versus all the other books is you really tell people do this, do this, do this, as opposed to the sort of woo-woo spiritual be at one with the universe, which really, all right, I&#39;m one with the universe, now what? It really isn&#39;t very helpful.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes, so a couple of ways to get started. One is there are lots of meditation apps out there, and they all are either free or they have free trials. I would do some taste testing. You can also read a good book. There are plenty of them. One book that&#39;s come to mind is called “Real Happiness” by Sharon Salzberg. Very, very, very, very practical.</p><p> Another thing you can do is, If you live in a major city, most of them have meditation centers where you can drop in and even if they&#39;re sectarian, in other words, even if they&#39;re Buddhist, don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s not a proselytizing religion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, Buddhists tend to be kind of low key, right?</p><p> HARRIS: I consider myself a Buddhist and I&#39;m not like trying to convince anybody to join me in that tradition. It&#39;s really about giving you exercises to train your mind.</p><p> In terms of fitting it into your day, just like I said before, and you can&#39;t hear this enough, set the bar low. Don&#39;t try to do too much off the bat, and don&#39;t beat yourself up when you fall off the wagon because it&#39;s inevitable. So sneak it in into the little parts of your day where you&#39;ve got an extra minute or two, right before dinner, or right when you pull your car into the garage, either at work or when you&#39;ve come home.</p><p> Little points in the day where you might otherwise be FOMO-inducing, Instagram scrolling. You can do that too, but can you just carve one minute out or two minutes out to do this thing? I think you can.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really intriguing.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk about the podcast. What made you decide to say, I know I&#39;ll talk to people about this three times a week?</p><p> HARRIS: You know, I generally throughout this whole thing, I&#39;ve had no idea what I was doing. So I&#39;m almost like the opposite of a master&#39;s, a master in business. I&#39;ve been just stumbling through.</p><p> I wrote the book because I had this idea that I could maybe, that maybe there was a space in the market for this. And I turned out to be right about that, but I wasn&#39;t confident as I did it. The book was way more successful than I thought, and then I was kind of thinking about it, like, “Oh, what do I do next?” And this was in, the book came out in &#39;14, and I think in around &#39;16, friends of mine were starting podcasts. I have a buddy named Sam Harris, we&#39;re not related, but he&#39;s got a very popular podcast, And he&#39;s a friend. And I was like, “I ran into somebody in the elevator at ABC News.” And I was like, “Do we do podcasts here?” And they were like, the next day, there was a bunch of people in my office, they were like, “Let&#39;s do this.” So I started a podcast with no real plan. My initial thought was, “Hey, I&#39;m kind of interested in what&#39;s beyond “10% Happier.” There&#39;s all this talk of enlightenment. Is that real?” So I really focused it on deep end of the pool meditation and Buddhism stuff at first.</p><p> And then over the years, especially during the pandemic, I started to expand it to just the human condition and really how do we do life better in all areas of life. So now we talk about work, we talk about sex, we talk about romance, we talk about conflict, boundaries, managing money, every, any area of life where we tend to suffer or struggle, we bring in people to help you unlock. And that has been totally fascinating. It has really helped me do my own life better because this is like an extended therapy session for which I get paid.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting. You have on the podcast His Holiness the Dalai Lama. How does that come about? Does the Lama have an agent or a PR firm? How do you land the Dalai Lama as a pod guest?</p><p> HARRIS: You know, one thing that&#39;s interesting is I&#39;m basically like the beat reporter for Buddhism. I know most of the Buddhists.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You know all the big Buddhists.</p><p> HARRIS: I guess I do. I&#39;m a little bit like, what&#39;s that, in Caddyshack, Bill Murray talking about getting —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, I got that going for me, so that&#39;s nice. Right, you&#39;re going to achieve total consciousness on your deathbed. So you have that going for you, so that&#39;s nice.</p><p> HARRIS: I do, which is nice.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: By the way, I literally have that line written down on the off chance that you would reference it and I&#39;m so happy you did. I&#39;m 11% happy.</p><p> HARRIS: Any chance to reference Bill Murray or Caddyshack.</p><p> So I mean, I&#39;ve found myself in this, I was like a traditional hard-charging newsman. I was covering wars and natural disasters, mass shootings, political campaigns, and then all of a sudden, I got interested in meditation and now I&#39;m like, I know all these spiritual leaders. They sleep at my house. This is my life now.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s hilarious.</p><p> HARRIS: It&#39;s very strange.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh my God.</p><p> HARRIS: And so the Dalai Lama was the first guest on my podcast because one of his best friends is an eminent American neuroscientist by the name of Richard Davidson, who is a friend of mine. And so I will call Richie once in a while and be like, “Hey, can you get the Dalai Lama on my show?” And he makes it happen. And so I actually have had him on four times. And in the fall, I went over to India and I spent two weeks hanging around him. And we did this whole big, long podcast series about the Dalai Lama. And he&#39;s a fascinating dude.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: To say the very least, when he&#39;s in America, does he crash on your couch? No, he doesn&#39;t. Or where does the llama stay?</p><p> HARRIS: Well, he&#39;s 87 or 88 now, so he is not traveling much. He tends to stay in highly secure hotel rooms.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And you said something earlier that I let slip by unnoticed because I was so entranced with the Bill Murray reference, but you said you&#39;re not a master&#39;s in business, you never expected that. I can&#39;t tell you how many people sat across from me who are wildly successful, very accomplished people, and they talk about the role of serendipity and random luck, and just recognizing an opportunity that, hey, am I crazy, but is this a market that&#39;s untapped?</p><p> And, well, it&#39;s untapped for a reason. Maybe we should tap it and see what happens.</p><p> So how much of your experiences with meditation in the book, in the podcast, and everything else around what you&#39;ve learned is just random luck, and how much of it is you saying, there&#39;s something here, and it&#39;s a new story that no one&#39;s really covering?</p><p> HARRIS: I think it&#39;s a mixture. I mean, I will never underplay luck. I mean, I&#39;ve been lucky in just so many areas of my life, and I also think there is some strategy and some lucky insights, you know? Like, I have a animalistic sense, I think, for what is going to work in this area and where the shortfalls and pitfalls are in self-help and self-development. And I think that is actually doing a service. It&#39;s turned out to be quite a lucrative business. And I also think that it&#39;s helping people and taking these ancient teachings and updating them for new audiences.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Buddha, a lucrative side hustle, whoever would have guessed that.</p><p> HARRIS: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So before we get to our favorite questions that I ask all my guests, I have to just ask about the RAIN technique, Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Non-Identify. How familiar are you with the OODA loop from the fighter pilot, I want to say Boyd, I&#39;m trying to remember his name, John Boyd, Colonel John Boyd, which is–</p><p> HARRIS: Never heard of it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: All right, so the OODA loop is Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. And this was early mid-century US Air Force trying to figure out what sort of advantages can we give to fighter pilots when it was still, you know, hand-to-hand, air-to-air combat, not just press a missile and forget about it. That idea of Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Non-Identify is very similar to on a completely different context, Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. It&#39;s just funny how those four steps — here you&#39;re trying to deal with something internally, there you&#39;re dealing with an external threat. Tell us about the RAIN technique.</p><p> HARRIS: I mean, I love that. I think there are lots of these acronyms out there that help you just navigate life. RAIN is Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Non-Identification. So That sounds like a mouthful, but it&#39;s pretty simple. You&#39;re in a tough moment, you&#39;re struggling, and it could be something internal or external, and very quickly you can learn how to do these four steps. Recognize it just to notice what&#39;s happening right now.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Stop, take a beat, figure out what&#39;s going on.</p><p> HARRIS: Wake up to what&#39;s happening.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HARRIS: Allow is instead of fighting it or acting on it in some way that is fighting it, like I&#39;m feeling like some tiny pang of hunger and I&#39;m just going to randomly eat the most recent thing or my wife said something mildly annoying and I&#39;m going to snap at her. Instead of acting blindly, just allow the feeling to be there.</p><p> I is investigate, which doesn&#39;t mean like, “Where did this come from?” And it&#39;s not a cognitive thing. It&#39;s more just like, “How is this showing up in my body?” Can you investigate, “How is this anger or hunger? Where am I experiencing in my body?” Which just allows you to sort of take it in on a deep level and be with it in the current moment.</p><p> And Non-identification is to recognize that you don&#39;t need to take your inner (EXPLETIVE DELETED) personally. And you didn&#39;t create your mind, you didn&#39;t create your body, you didn&#39;t create the world. You may think you have all of this agency, you&#39;re this ego, separate from the world, peering out fretfully from behind these eye holes, but you&#39;re part of the universe. That sounds a little out there, but it&#39;s actually non-negotiably true.</p><p> And so all of this stuff is nature. You are nature. And can you just for a second see your emotion from that perspective so that it doesn&#39;t own you. And I just think this is a nice little way to navigate the world.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I like it, I like it a lot.</p><p> Let&#39;s jump to our favorite questions and we&#39;ll get you out of here in time to hit your next gig. Starting with, tell us what you&#39;re consuming for entertainment. What are you streaming or watching? What podcasts are you listening to? Give us a little bit about what&#39;s keeping you entertained.</p><p> HARRIS: “Succession” baby. I watch “Succession” you know, I mean, Not only am I watching the show as it wraps up, but my wife and I love it so much, we went back and started watching from season one.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> HARRIS: And I think it&#39;s just a masterful piece of art. The writing, the acting, it&#39;s all just incredible. And it&#39;s hard to watch because you&#39;re just watching, it&#39;s one of the most violent shows I&#39;ve ever seen.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s so funny you say that. I couldn&#39;t get past the second episode. I didn&#39;t have that experience with The Sopranos. I didn&#39;t have that experience with a lot of other great television, I had a hard time with this.</p><p> HARRIS: So I had a similar experience with you with “Succession.” The first time I watched it, I didn&#39;t like it and I set it aside. And then COVID hit and I got COVID and I was in bed and I watched seasons one and two because I was in bed and bored and nothing else to do. And then I got it because I really had to like live with it for a minute. It is so–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s a commitment. Here, 14 hours, see if you like it.</p><p> HARRIS: Well, if I didn&#39;t like it, I would&#39;ve watched something else. But it is, first of all, one reason to stay with it is it&#39;s very funny, extremely funny.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HARRIS: And it gets funnier as it goes. The other reason to live with it is it&#39;s doing what I love in great art, which is it&#39;s transporting you into a different world that feels real.</p><p> And so that&#39;s just anthropologically interesting. But it is a hard show because you&#39;re watching people do very skillful interpersonal violence to one another.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HARRIS: And the show does a kind of violence to you because 3% of the time, they will allow real human kindness and that is what is the cruelest twist.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s keeping you, oh, maybe these people aren&#39;t the worst in the world.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes, yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And then the shiv comes out.</p><p> HARRIS: Correct, right in the kidney.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I love your concept of transporting you to a world that feels almost real. “The Diplomat” is just an eight series.</p><p> HARRIS: Oh yeah, yes, yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Just really well written and well-acted. And then if you like “Bridgerton,” the prequel, “Queen Charlotte,” it&#39;s this crazy, colorful, weird, almost believable alternative world that&#39;s like with great characters and great writing. And you know, you made me think of “Queen Charlotte” because it&#39;s that transporting you to someplace that almost feels real. There&#39;s like one thing that&#39;s off that keeps it fictional, But it&#39;s close.</p><p> HARRIS: I&#39;ll give you two other little entertainment things. One is “Hacks” on HBO Max, or now it&#39;s just called Max. It&#39;s very funny.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: She&#39;s amazing, the lead.</p><p> HARRIS: She&#39;s incredible.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, Amy Smart is it?</p><p> HARRIS: No.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Not Amy Smart.</p><p> HARRIS: What is her name?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m drawing a blank on it.</p><p> HARRIS: She&#39;s a genius.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, she&#39;s fantastic.</p><p> HARRIS: Jean Smart.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Jean Smart.</p><p> HARRIS: : Yes, and the comedian Theo Von, who&#39;s been showing up for me a lot on social media, he is totally inappropriate, but also just incredibly funny. I&#39;m just like, he&#39;s very clippable, you can make short little clips of him because he says pithy little things.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s hilarious. Tell us about your mentors who helped to shape your career.</p><p> HARRIS: I mentioned a couple of people in the course of this conversation. David Westin is one of your colleagues at Bloomberg who was my boss at ABC News, incredible boss and really helped me in my career. Sam Harris, who I also mentioned, who was one of the first people who was a real role model for me in terms of getting into meditation because here was this guy who&#39;s quite well known as an atheist writer and who&#39;s unafraid to mix it up with, and debate with all sorts of people.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes, and so I, you know, I don&#39;t always agree with him, but I find him inspirational and aspirational in that way, and he&#39;s a committed, committed meditator, and so that was really helpful to me. And then Jerry Colonna is quite a well-known executive coach who has been referred to as the Yoda of Silicon Valley. He does a lot of CEO whispering, and he has worked with me in my career and has really helped me grow up.</p><p> And he did a very devastating but impactful 360 review on me, which resulted in me learning a lot about myself. That&#39;s the sequel, actually. That&#39;s the next book.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, the 360 review. Really interesting.</p><p> Tell us about, speaking of books, tell us about some of your favorites and what you&#39;ve read recently.</p><p> HARRIS: I really am into novels right now, and I have been reading a lot of novels as I write my next book because I&#39;m stealing their storytelling techniques. And I&#39;m trying to up my game as a writer. And one of the ways I&#39;m doing that is by reading the greats. Jennifer Egan is a modern writer. She won a Pulitzer for a book in 2011 called “A Visit from the Goon Squad.: And then she wrote a follow-up called “The Candy House.” And I find her to be mesmerizing and bewitching.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Two interesting recommendations.</p><p> So what sort of advice would you give a recent college grad interested in a career in either journalism or broadcast television?</p><p> HARRIS: Steve Go for it. You know, it&#39;s hard, it&#39;s tough, but it&#39;s awesome.</p><p> And I love, I think I said this in my first book, that the right that it confers upon you to walk up to important people and ask impudent questions is incredible.</p><p> And if you have curiosity, this is a playground and I mean it&#39;s a tough business. Content creation is hard and ad supported models are hard as we get into subscriptions that too is hard. It&#39;s tough and it&#39;s competitive but I do think that if you can hack that, it&#39;s worth it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And our final question, what do you know about the world today that you wish you knew 30 or so years ago when you were a Green Cub reporter.</p><p> HARRIS: I heard Scott Galloway, another big business voice, say this recently to me, actually, and he said it about himself, but actually it just comes to mind as my big oversight too. I wish I had been nicer.</p><p> And you think about niceness as kind of weakness, but it&#39;s actually a real strength. And we are social animals. We need other people. We may think in this culture that&#39;s individualistic that we&#39;re going to be self-made, but nobody&#39;s self-made. You&#39;re all co-created. We&#39;re all co-created. If I had taken the time to work on my relationships in all aspects of my life, my life would have been better way quicker.</p><p> Even after meditation came into my life, I was still failing on the relational front. That&#39;s really what the 360 taught me, which is I needed to up my game. And that like taking small moments to be nice to people is, first of all, it can have a huge impact on other people but it&#39;s good for me. I always go through the lens of self-interest because I&#39;m naturally frosty and selfish and I think a lot of people are if they&#39;re capable of looking internally.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m going to interrupt you. I&#39;m trying to remember if it was in the book or something else I had read where you describe and it might even be a Buddhist precept of there&#39;s two types of generosity, the selfish generosity and generous generosity, and even the generous generosity comes back to you.</p><p> HARRIS: Yes, the Buddha talks about wise selfishness. That all — I&#39;m sorry, the Dalai Lama talks about this concept of wise selfishness. If you want to be really good at being selfish, you will be compassionate and generous, because that is the number one source of happiness.</p><p> Let me just say this finally on a broader note, but it&#39;s a related note.</p><p> There are so many bugs in the human design, but there is this feature that is the way out for us as a species of our problems. The feature is this, doing good for other people is to do good for yourself. And that we can ride to personal happiness and species-wide improvements. It is an incredibly hopeful and totally true thing. And I find that to be a source of real personal and sort of micro and macro optimism.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not a coincidence that billionaires also tend to be philanthropists. Right, works out.</p><p> Dan, thank you so much for being so generous with your time.

It&#39;s predicting that the Fed will reduce rates in the future because inflation is likely to be lower than it presently is. Another way of thinking about this is current growth is too hot and the Fed has to set a very tight overnight rate to get the economy to slow. This shows up in the yield curve as a prediction that the Fed will win its battle and lower inflation (and lower growth) is like to occur over the course of the next 10 years. But as the global evidence shows this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a recession is on the horizon.

Its simple but rugged and reliable mechanicals is why it&#39;s a favorite of everyone that traverses desserts, glaciers, mountains and other rough terrain. Land Cruiser is Toyota&#39;s longest-running nameplate, ostensibly a nod to Britain&#39;s Land Rover. (Note the special edition with the round headlights looks like a nod to the latest Defender).</p><p> The new version is coming to America in Spring 2024, giving Jeep and Bronco enthusiasts a third option.</p><p> The specs are impressive:</p><blockquote><p> Powertrain: Hybrid four-cylinder<br /> Gas engine: Turbocharged 2.4-liter 4<br /> Hybrid: 2 electric motors<br /> 4WD: four-wheel drive system with low-range + locking differential<br /> Total Power: 326 horsepower + 465 lb.-ft. of torque.<br /> 2-row, 5-seat SUV<br /> Towing Capacity: 6,000 lbs.<br /> Price: starts in the mid-$50,000 range.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s a good-looking albeit boxy rig. At the new price point with its well-established reputation for legendary toughness and durability, I expect it will find a receptive audience in the States.</p><p></p><p></p><p> <em>Previously</em>

My <em>Sunday morning</em> look at incompetency, corruption and policy failures:</p><blockquote><p> • <strong>This Is <em>the</em> Case</strong> : Special Counsel Jack Smith has sounded the call, but voters must answer it if they wish to preserve American democracy. （ <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-charges-overturn-2020-election/674887/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">大西洋月刊</a>）</p><p> • <strong>As EVs surge, so does nickel mining&#39;s death toll</strong> : In the mineral-rich fringes of Indonesia, whose nickel will feed EV giants like Tesla, the deaths of miners continue to mount. ( <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/indonesia-nickel-mining-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rest Of World</a> ) <em>see also</em> <strong>&#39;A Dangerous Combination&#39;: Teenagers&#39; Accidents Expose E-Bike Risks</strong> : The e-bike industry is booming, but many vehicles are not legal for teenagers, and accidents are on the rise. ( <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/health/ebikes-safety-teens.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a> )</p><p> • <strong>22 years after the $63 billion Enron collapse, a key audit review board finds the industry in a &#39;completely unacceptable&#39; state</strong> . Accounting firms have a critical role in verifying the finances of the companies they audit so that those clients can rely on and publish accurate snapshots of their businesses. Lately, a startlingly high number of those audits are filled with errors and other flaws, according to a report released by a congressional watchdog on Monday. ( <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/26/pcaob-audit-completely-unnacceptable-error-rate-enron-big-4-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune</a> )</p><p> • <strong>The Research Scandal at Stanford Is More Common Than You Think</strong> : In retrospect, much of the data manipulation is obvious. Although the report concluded that Dr. Tessier-Lavigne was unaware at the time of the manipulation that occurred in his labs, in papers on which he served as a principal author, images had been improperly copied and pasted or spliced; results had been duplicated and passed off as separate experiments; and in some instances — in which the report found an intention to hide the manipulation — panels had been stretched, flipped and doctored in ways that altered the published experimental data. All of this happened before he became Stanford&#39;s president. Why, then, didn&#39;t it come out sooner? ( <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/opinion/stanford-president-student-journalist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a> )</p><p> • <strong>Sympathy for the Devil: The making of Robert F. Kennedy Jr</strong> : For decades, he was a superstar environmental lawyer who demanded that Americans should accept and act on the scientific consensus that climate change is real. He specialized in cases in which corporations had hidden the environmental or health costs of their products. His legal work against corporations that dump toxic chemicals in water, waste dumps, and food saved thousands of people from disabling diseases or death. He embraced the science that revealed this and attacked the superficially exculpatory science used by the companies to defend themselves. “That&#39;s what I do for a living,” he told an interviewer. “I litigate scientific issues.” ( <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/07/robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-covid-conspiracy-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slate</a> )</p><p> • <strong>Mass Shootings Disproportionately Victimize Black Americans</strong> : High levels of income inequality and segregation mean higher risk of mass shootings, according to a new study. ( <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-24/black-americans-more-likely-to-be-mass-shooting-victims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CityLab</a> )</p><p> • <strong>Weak, small and reckless: how Ron DeSantis, Republican Napoleon, met his Waterloo</strong> Sidney Blumenthal The Florida governor tried to outflank Trump on the right. Bad idea. Next to the former president, the devil with the best Republican tunes, DeSantis is a minor fiend at best. ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/31/ron-desantis-republican-napoleon-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a> )</p><p> • <strong>How the US Drives Gun Exports and Fuels Violence Around the World</strong> : The US Commerce Department has played booster and concierge to the firearm industry, even as America&#39;s mass shootings horrify the world and gun-crime rates rise in many of the importing countries. Commerce employees help recruit foreign buyers, accompany them at the industry&#39;s premier exhibition in Las Vegas each year, and offer an online portal to pair them with US manufacturers. Since the ban ended, semiautomatic exports have totaled 3.7 million — more than doubling in just the past six years. In absolute numbers, exports are still a fraction of domestic US sales, but their impact on the nations receiving them can be enormous.

( <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/07/long-march-through-institutions-conservatives-rufo-milikh-claremont-desantis-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Magazine</a> ) <em>see also</em> <strong>&#39;This Is a Really Big Deal&#39;: How College Towns Are Decimating the GOP</strong> : Growing population in America&#39;s highly educated enclaves has led to huge gains for the Democratic Party.
