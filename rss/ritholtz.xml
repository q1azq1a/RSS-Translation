RITHOLTZ，商科硕士主持人：本周的播客，请系好安全带。我还有另一位特别嘉宾。 Jon McAuliffe 是 Voleon Group 的联合创始人兼首席投资官。他们是一家价值 50 亿美元的对冲基金，也是最早将机器学习应用于交易和投资管理决策的公司之一。这是一种完整的系统方法，使用计算机的能力、数据库、机器学习以及他们自己的预测引擎来进行投资和交易，并且已经取得了相当不错的记录。</p><p>此前，Jon 在 DE Shaw 从事统计套利业务。他是亚马逊推荐引擎的开发人员之一，目前是伯克利大学的统计学教授。</p><p>我什至不知道从哪里开始，只能说，如果你对人工智能或机器学习或定量策略感兴趣，这只是一个大师班，讲述了该领域第一批人之一如何完成这些工作，不仅进行这种机器学习并将其应用于投资，但这是最好的之一。我认为这是一次引人入胜的对话，我相信您也会发现如此。</p><p>另外，闲话少说，我与 Voleon Group 的乔恩·麦考利夫 (Jon McAuliffe) 进行了讨论。</p><p>乔恩·麦考利夫，欢迎来到彭博社。</p><p> JON MCAULIFFE，VOLEON GROUP 联合创始人兼首席投资官：谢谢巴里。我真的很高兴来到这里。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们先谈谈您的学术背景。您在哈佛大学开始攻读计算机科学和应用数学本科课程。在您继续从加州伯克利分校获得博士学位之前，是什么让您选择了数据分析职业？你多久知道这就是你想做的事？</p><p>麦考利夫：嗯，实际上这是一条蜿蜒的道路。高中毕业时，我对国际关系和外语非常感兴趣。我高中的最后一年作为交换生在德国度过。因此，当我上大学时，我希望主修政府，然后可能在外交部门工作，类似的事情。</p><p>里索兹：真的吗？所以这与你最初的期望有很大的转变。</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。大约花了一个学期的时间，我才意识到课堂上提出的问题没有一个有明确和正确的答案。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这让你有点沮丧吗？</p><p>麦考利夫：这确实让我感到沮丧。是的。</p><p>所以整个冬天我都呆在家里。我留下来了，对不起，我没有回家。寒假期间我留在大学，试图弄清楚我到底要做什么，因为我发现事实并非如此，我的计划被打乱了。我一直对计算机很感兴趣，也玩过计算机，从来没有做过任何严肃的事情，但我想我不妨尝试一下。因此，在春季学期，我参加了我的第一门计算机科学课程。当你编写软件时，一切都有正确的答案。它要么做你想让它做的事，要么不做。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：无法编译。</p><p>麦考利夫：没错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这真的非常令人着迷。那么是什么让你从伯克利来到德肖大学呢？他们是最早的量化商店之一。你是怎么到达那里的？你做了什么类型的研究？</p><p>麦考利夫：是的，实际上，我在本科和博士课程之间在 DE Shaw 度过了一段时间。所以，从哈佛毕业后，我去了 DE Shaw 大学。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么这是否激发了人们对使用机器学习和计算机应用于金融的兴趣，或者那种经历是什么样的？</p><p>麦考利夫：是的，这让我对使用统计思维和数据分析来理解证券价格的动态非常感兴趣并感到兴奋。</p><p>当时机器学习并没有真正发挥作用。我想不是在 DE Shaw，但也可能没有地方。在90年代这个领域还太不成熟。但当我大学毕业时，我已经对在交易和投资中使用这些统计工具产生了好奇和兴趣。然后在 DE Shaw，我有出色的同事，我们正在解决难题。所以我真的得到了很多。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：仍然是表现最好的对冲基金之一，也是最早的量化对冲基金之一，是一个磨练的好地方。</p><p>麦考利夫：当然。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么是哈佛、DE Shaw，然后是伯克利？是啊，没错。然后你从伯克利毕业，最后是怎么来到亚马逊的？我想我应该纠正自己。在 DE Shaw 之后、伯克利之前，在亚马逊工作了一年。我读得正确吗？亚马逊使用的推荐引擎是您帮助开发的？</p><p>麦考利夫：我想说我在努力。</p><p>里索兹：好的。</p><p>麦考利夫：它存在。当我到达那里时的地方。我的经理和他的同事已经构建了我们熟悉的推荐引擎。</p><p>但我研究了改进和形成建议的不同方式。这很有趣，因为当时，亚马逊所有购买历史记录的整个数据库都存储在磁盘上的一个 20 GB 文件中，因此我可以将其加载到我的计算机上并运行它。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我认为我们不能再这样做了。</p><p>麦考利夫：我们不能。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：感谢上帝，亚马逊云服务让您可以投入 25 年和数千亿美元的交易，这是什么？</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我的假设是这样的产品是高度迭代的。第一个版本还不错，它做了一半不错的工作，然后变得更好，然后开始变得几乎令人毛骨悚然的好。就像，“哦，其中有多少只是数据库的大小，有多少只是一个聪明的算法？”</p><p>麦考利夫：嗯，这是一个很好的问题，因为两者有着千丝万缕的联系。使算法变得伟大的方法是使它们更强大、更具表现力、能够描述许多不同类型的模式和关系。但这些方法需要大量数据才能正确区分哪些是信号，哪些是噪声。</p><p>像推荐系统这样的工具越具有表现力，就越容易将一次性噪音误认为是持久信号。这是统计预测中反复出现的主题。这确实是统计预测的核心问题。</p><p>因此，您可以在推荐系统中使用它，可以在我们解决的问题和其他地方预测价格行为。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：几年前，《纽约时报》有一篇相当臭名昭著的文章，内容是关于塔吉特（Target）使用他们自己的推荐系统向人们发送孕妇用品。一位父亲问他十几岁的女儿“这是什么？”然后进去对他们大喊大叫，结果发现她怀孕了，他们把它拼凑起来。</p><p>从这些系统到更复杂的机器学习甚至大型语言模型还有多远的飞跃？</p><p> MCAULIFFE：事实证明，答案是，这是一个规模问题，在 GPT-3 和 ChatGPT 之前并不明显，但事实证明，例如，GPT 是从数据库构建的英语句子，数据库里有一万亿个单词。</p><p>里索兹：哇。</p><p> MCAULIFFE：当你使用一万亿个单词并用它来拟合一个拥有 1750 亿个参数的模型时，显然存在一种转变，事情变得坦率地令人震惊。我不认为任何不感到惊讶的人都说的是实话。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，从它的复杂程度来看，这很奇怪，但从我猜程序员喜欢称之为幻觉的角度来看，这也有点令人惊讶。我想如果您使用互联网作为基本模型，嘿，互联网上有一两件事是错误的。当然，这会出现在 ChatGPT 之类的东西中。</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。最底层的是这个工具 GPT-3。这确实是为 ChatGPT 提供动力的引擎。这个工具有一个目标。这是一个简单的目标。您在句子的开头显示，它会预测句子中的下一个单词。这就是它被训练要做的全部事情。我的意思是，事情真的就是这么简单。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这是一个看起来很聪明的愚蠢程序。</p><p>麦考利夫：如果你愿意的话。但是，预测句子中的下一个单词的问题在于，输出的单词序列是否会导致正确或错误的结果无关紧要。它被训练做的唯一事情就是对下一个单词进行高度准确的预测。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以当我说愚蠢时，它确实非常复杂。只是，我们倾向于称之为人工智能，但我读过很多人说，“嘿，这真的不是人工智能。这是比较初级的东西。”</p><p>麦考利夫：是的，我认为批评家会说人工智能完全是用词不当。这些系统根本没有任何通俗意义上的智能。人工智能研究中的一个常见辩护是人工智能是一个移动目标。一旦你建立了一个可以做一些类似神奇的事情的系统，这就是旧的智力标准，那么提供评估的人就会移动目标。</p><p>我想我会坐在两者之间。我认为这种语言很不幸，因为它很容易被误解。我不会说这个系统是愚蠢的，也不会说它是聪明的。这些不是这些系统的特征。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：但它很复杂且精密。</p><p>麦考利夫：确实如此。它有 1750 亿个参数。如果这不符合你对复杂的定义，我不知道什么才符合。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，这对我有用。那么在您的职业生涯中，Affymetrix 在哪里？推荐引擎是什么样的？</p><p>麦考利夫：是的，这就是我在博士期间作为暑期研究实习生所做的工作。这项工作的目的是，这个问题被称为基因型调用。</p><p>所以-</p><p> RITHOLTZ：基因型识别。</p><p>麦考利夫：我会解释的，巴里。你有同卵双胞胎吗？</p><p>里索兹：我不这么认为。</p><p>麦考利夫：好的，我可以有把握地说你的基因组在世界上是独一无二的。没有人拥有与您完全相同的基因组。另一方面，如果你把你的基因组和我的基因组放在一起，排列起来，它们将有 99.9% 的相同。大约千分之一的位置是不同的。但正是这些差异让你成为你，让我成为我。他们显然具有强烈的科学和应用兴趣。</p><p>因此，能够采集您的 DNA 样本并快速生成所有具有变异性的地方的概况以及您的特定价值观是什么，这一点非常重要。这个问题就是基因分型问题。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这曾经是一个非常昂贵、非常复杂的问题，我们花费了数十亿美元来解决。现在速度快很多，便宜很多。</p><p>麦考利夫：快得多。事实上，即使是我在 2005 年、2004 年研究的技术也已经有好几代了，而且已经不再使用了。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们谈谈您在高效前沿所做的事情。解释什么是实时点击预测规则以及它如何用于关键字搜索。</p><p>麦考利夫：当然。推动谷歌发展的收入引擎是搜索关键词广告。因此，每次您在顶部进行搜索时，您都会看到广告、广告、广告。那么这些广告是如何到达那里的呢？嗯，事实上，这很令人惊讶，也许你不知道，但每次你在谷歌上输入搜索词并按回车键时，就会发生一次非常快的拍卖。许多公司运行软件以电子方式出价，将他们的广告放在搜索结果的顶部。页面上显示的结果或多或少是按照出价的顺序排列的。</p><p>这并不完全正确，但你可以认为它是正确的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：一个粗略的轮廓。因此，Google 页面上的前三个赞助结果都会经历该拍卖过程。我认为在这一点上，每个人都知道其余部分的页面排名是什么。</p><p>麦考利夫：是的，没错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这似乎是谷歌早期的秘密武器，对吧？</p><p>麦考利夫：嗯，谈谈广告投放，所以参与这些拍卖的提供广告的人有一个问题，那就是出价多少，对吗？</p><p>那么您将如何决定出价多少？好吧，您基本上想知道有人点击您的广告的概率，对吧？然后你将其乘以点击后你最终能赚多少钱。这就是对你能赚多少钱的期望。</p><p>然后你调整你的出价以确保它能为你带来利润。然后，你真的必须决定点击率是多少。您必须预测点击概率。这就是我正在解决的问题。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我想说，这听起来像是计算机科学、概率和统计学的一个非常复杂的应用。如果你做对了，你就能赚钱。如果你做错了，你的广告预算就会赔钱。</p><p>麦考利夫：没错。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：请告诉我们一些关于您的博士学位的情况，您在伯克利为博士学位写了什么？</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。实际上，我们又回到了基因组。那是在我攻读博士学位的第一年，人类基因组发表在《自然》杂志上的时候。因此，这确实是高通量、大规模遗传学研究工作爆炸式增长的开始。当你对基因组进行测序后，一个非常重要的问题是，它的所有部分都在做什么？你可以观察一串DNA。它只是由这四个字母组成。但您不想只知道这四个字母。它们是一种代码。 DNA 的某些部分代表有用的物质，它们被细胞转化为蛋白质等。而DNA的其他部分似乎根本没有任何功能。作为一名生物学研究人员，知道哪个是哪个是非常重要的。</p><p>因此，在高通量测序出现之前的很长一段时间里，生物学家会在实验室里非常费力地观察非常小的 DNA 片段并确定它们的功能。但现在我们将整个人类基因组保存在磁盘上，我们希望能够对其进行分析，并让计算机吐出所有功能和非功能的内容，对吗？</p><p>这就是我正在解决的问题。一个非常重要的见解是，您可以利用自然选择的思想和进化的思想来帮助您。这样做的方法是，你拥有人类基因组，对一堆灵长类动物基因组、人类的近亲进行测序，然后将所有这些基因组放在一起。然后你寻找所有基因组都一致的地方，对吗？并没有通过突变而发生变异。</p><p>为什么还没有呢？嗯，消除变异的最大力量是自然选择。如果你的基因组中真正重要的部分发生了突变，那么你就有点不适合，你不会有后代，这就会被消灭。</p><p>因此，自然选择是一种非常强大的力量，导致 DNA 不发生改变。因此，当您进行这些灵长类动物比对时，您可以真正利用这一事实并寻找保护并将其用作某些功能正常的重要信号。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的，真的很有趣。你提到我们的 DNA 是 99.99。</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我不知道你想保留小数点右边多少位，但非常相似。我们与黑猩猩有何相似或不同？我一直——</p><p>麦考利夫：好问题。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：有一个都市传说说他们几乎是一样的。总显得有些言过其实了。</p><p>麦考利夫：98%。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：98%，所以是 2%。</p><p>所以你和我有 0.1% 的差异，我和普通黑猩猩有 2.0% 的差异。</p><p>麦考利夫： 是的，完全正确。因此，黑猩猩本质上是我们最亲近的非人类灵长类动物亲戚。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的，真的非常令人着迷。</p><p>那么我们来谈谈这家公司吧。你们是机器学习研究最早的先驱之一。稍微解释一下这家公司是做什么的。</p><p> MCAULIFFE：当然，所以我们运行完全自动化的交易策略和投资策略。所以我们称它们为完全系统化的。这意味着我们拥有每天在市场交易时间内运行的软件系统。他们获取有关我们正在交易的证券（例如股票）特征的信息，对吗？</p><p>然后他们预测每种证券的价格将如何随着时间的推移而变化。然后他们根据这些预测决定我们的库存变化、持仓变化。然后，这些所需的更改被发送到执行系统，该系统会自动执行它们。好的？</p><p> RITHOLTZ：如此完全自动化，是否有人监督，或者它是通过一些检查自行运行的？</p><p> MCAULIFFE：有很多人工诊断监督，对吧？因此，有些人正在观看充满仪器和遥测的屏幕，了解系统正在做什么，但这些人不会采取任何行动，除非出现问题，然后他们就会采取行动。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们来谈谈机器如何学习识别信号。我假设你从一个巨大的数据库开始，其中包含股票价格、交易量等的历史记录，然后引入许多额外的东西来承受，那么制定特定交易策略的过程是怎样的？</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。正如您所说，我们从一个非常大的历史数据集开始，其中包括价格和交易量、此类市场数据，但重要的是有关证券的各种其他信息。因此，财务报表数据、文本数据、分析师数据。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以这包括从价格、基本面、从收益到收入到销售等等的一切。我假设变化和变化的增量在这方面将非常重要。</p><p>宏观经济呢？有些人称之为噪音，但人们可以想象总和——信号，以及从通货膨胀、利率、国内生产总值到消费者支出的一切。</p><p>麦考利夫：当然。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这些投入值得吗？您如何看待这些投入？</p><p> MCAULIFFE：所以我们不持有暴露于这些事物的投资组合。所以这实际上是我们的商业决策。我们正在与机构投资者合作，他们已经对市场等事物或价值等公认的计量经济风险因素拥有尽可能多的敞口。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>麦考利夫：所以他们不需要我们的帮助来接触这些东西。他们非常有能力处理投资流程的这一部分。我们试图提供的是尽可能的多样化。因此，我们想给他们一个新的回报流，它具有良好且稳定的回报，但最重要的是，它与他们已有的任何其他回报流都不相关。</p><p>里索兹：这很有趣。那么我可以假设您正在将机器学习方法应用于不同的资产类别，还是严格意义上的股票？</p><p>麦考利夫：哦不，我们将其应用于股票、信贷、公司债券，并且我们交易期货合约。在时间成熟时，我们希望我们能够交易世界上的每一种证券。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么，目前，股票、债券，当你说期货时，我假设是商品？</p><p> MCAULIFFE：各种期货合约。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的，真的很有趣。因此，它可以是从利率掉期到大宗商品的任何东西。</p><p>那么这种方法与其他真正专注于股票的量化机构有什么不同呢？</p><p> MCAULIFFE：我认为这与问“嗯，当我们说我们使用机器学习或者我们的原则是机器学习原则时是什么意思？”是同一个问题。那么，这与量化交易中的标准方法有何不同呢？</p><p>这个问题的答案实际上回到了我们不久前提到的这个想法，即您用来形成预测的工具有多么强大，对吗？所以在我们的业务中，我们构建的东西称为预测规则，好吗？这就是我们的小部件。预测规则的作用是它接受一堆输入，一堆关于某一时刻股票的信息，它让你猜测该股票的价格在未来一段时间内将如何变化，好的？</p><p>所以关于预测规则有一个最重要的问题，那就是它们有多复杂？它们有多少复杂性？</p><p>复杂性是一个通俗术语。不幸的是，这是另一个例子，因为在技术环境中借用了通用词，所以事情可能会变得模糊或模棱两可。但是当你在统计预测中使用“复杂性”这个词时，它有一个非常具体的含义。</p><p>就是说这个预测规则的表达力有多大？它在近似显示的数据中所发生的情况方面能做得有多好？请记住，我们有这些巨大的历史数据集，数据集中的每个条目都是这样的。股票在某个特定时刻发生了什么？它的价格走势、财务状况、分析师信息，然后它的价格在接下来的 24 小时或接下来的 15 分钟或其他什么时间里做了什么，好吗？</p><p>因此，当您谈论预测规则的复杂程度时，这意味着它能够在多大程度上捕获您要求预测时可以显示的事物与价格实际发生的情况之间的关系。</p><p>自然地，您会想要使用高复杂性规则，因为它们具有很大的近似能力。他们很好地描述了正在发生的任何事情。但高复杂性有两个缺点。一是需要大量数据。否则它会被愚弄，认为随机性实际上是信号。</p><p>另一个是很难推理出幕后发生的事情，对吧？当你有非常简单的预测规则时，你可以用一句话总结他们正在做的所有事情，对吗？您可以深入了解它们并全面了解它们的行为方式。对于高复杂性的预测规则来说这是不可能的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以我很高兴你提出了这个概念，即它有多容易，或者你有多频繁地欺骗算法或复杂的规则，因为有时结果只是随机的。这让我想起了回测的问题。没有人向你展示过糟糕的回测。您如何处理过度拟合和回测问题，这些问题只针对已经发生的情况，而不是未来可能发生的情况？</p><p>麦考利夫：是的，如果你愿意的话，那就是统计预测中价值百万美元的问题，好吗？您可能会惊讶地发现，相对简单的想法在这里大有帮助。让我描述一下如何处理这个问题的一个小场景。</p><p>我们同意我们拥有这个庞大的历史数据集。您可以做的一件事就是开始分析该数据集并找到复杂的预测规则。但你已经开始做错了。在查看数据之前，您要做的第一件事就是随机挑选一半数据并将其锁在抽屉里。这样您就剩下了尚未锁定的另一半数据。</p><p>在这半场，你会变得疯狂。你建立了各种预测规则，简单的规则，极其复杂的规则，介于两者之间的一切，对吗？现在，您可以检查您构建的所有这些预测规则对他们所查看的数据的准确性。答案永远是一样的。最复杂的规则看起来最好。当然，他们最有表现力。因此，他们自然会最好地描述你向他们展示的内容。</p><p>最大的问题是，你向他们展示的是信号和噪声的混合体，你无法判断复杂的规则在多大程度上找到了信号与噪声。您所知道的是，它完美地描述了您显示的数据。</p><p>如果它表现得这么好，你肯定怀疑它一定是过度拟合了，对吧？</p><p>好的，现在你冻结所有这些预测规则。您不能再以任何方式更改它们。现在你打开抽屉，取出所有你从未看过的数据。你不能对你永远不适合的数据进行过度拟合。因此，您获取这些数据，并通过您构建的每个冻结的预测规则来运行它。现在，情况根本不是最复杂的规则看起来最好，相反，您会看到一种 U 形行为，其中非常简单的规则过于简单。他们错过了信号。他们在桌子上留下了信号。这两个复杂的规则也表现不佳，因为它们捕获了所有信号，但也捕获了大量噪声。</p><p>然后，在中间的某个地方是一个最佳点，您可以在预测规则的表达能力与避免将噪声误认为信号方面的工作效果之间进行正确的权衡。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：真的，真的很有趣。是的。所以你们已经建立了金融领域最大的专业机器学习研发团队之一。如何组建这样的团队以及如何让智囊去做适合管理资产的工作？</p><p> MCAULIFFE：嗯，简短的回答是，我们花费了大量的精力来招募和识别机器学习领域的顶尖人才，包括学术界和从业者。我们表现​​出很大的耐心。我们等待了很长时间才能够找到真正最好的人。这对我们来说非常重要，无论是从公司成功的角度来看，还是因为我们非常重视这一点，拥有优秀的同事，才华横溢的同事，我希望在一个可以向所有同事学习的地方工作。我周围的人。</p><p>而且，你知道，当我的联合创始人 Michael Kharitonov 和我谈论创办 Voleon 时，我们想到的原因之一是我们想要控制与我们合作的人。你知道，我们真的希望能够聚集一群人，你知道，他们是我们能找到的最聪明的人，而且，你知道，他们是好人，我们喜欢的人，我们很高兴与之合作的人。</p><p>那么让我们来谈谈 Voleon 构建的一些基本原则。您引用了 Leo Breiman 撰写的一篇名为“两种文化”的论文中基于预测的方法。</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：请告诉我们一些关于“两种文化”实际上是什么的信息。</p><p>麦考利夫：是的。所以这篇论文是大约20年前写的。需要我说的是，利奥·布雷曼（Leo Breiman）是他这一代最伟大的概率学家和统计学家之一，是伯克利大学的教授。</p><p>实际上，在加州大学洛杉矶分校获得终身教职和重返伯克利学术界之间，利奥已经是统计咨询领域的从业者了相当长的一段时间。在那段时间里，他学到了很多关于实际解决预测问题的知识，而不是在学术背景下假设解决它们。</p><p>因此，他对这种差异的所有见解都在他 2000 年撰写的这篇论文中达到了顶峰。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：实际应用与学术理论​​之间的区别。</p><p>麦考利夫：如果你愿意，可以。所以他确定了解决预测问题的两种思想流派，对吧？一所学校是基于模型的。这个想法是你要观察一些东西，比如说股票特征。有件事你希望知道，比如说未来的价格变化。自然界中有一个盒子可以将这些输入转化为输出。</p><p>在基于模型的思想流派中，你尝试打开那个盒子，推理它必须如何工作，制定理论。就我们而言，这些是计量经济学理论、金融经济学理论。然后这些理论有旋钮，但不是很多，你使用数据来设置旋钮，但除此之外你相信这个模型，对吗？</p><p>他将其与机器学习学派进行了对比，机器学习学派也有自然盒子的想法。输入进去，你希望知道的东西就会出来。但在机器学习中，你不会尝试打开盒子。您只需尝试估算一下盒子正在做什么。衡量成功的标准是预测准确性，而且只是预测准确性。</p><p>如果你构建了一个小工具，并且该小工具产生了非常准确的预测，结果看起来就像自然产生的东西，那么那就是成功。在他撰写论文时，他的评估是 98% 的统计数据采用基于模型的方法，2% 的数据采用机器学习方法。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这些统计数据今天仍然有效，还是我们已经发生了很大的变化？</p><p>麦考利夫：我们改变了很多。如今，不同领域的预测问题有不同的组合。但即使在金融领域，我认为也可能更像是 50/50。<br />里索兹：真的吗？那么多？太棒了。</p><p>麦考利夫：我认为，你知道，逻辑的极端是自然语言建模，这种建模已经在基于模型的方法中进行了数十年，在这种方法中，你对人们如何进行对话的语言特征进行了推理，并且这些模型有一些参数，然后用数据拟合它们。</p><p>相反，正如我们所说，你拥有一个包含一万亿个单词的数据库和一个包含 1750 亿个参数的工具，你运行它，并且没有希望完全理解 GPT-3 内部发生的事情，但没有人抱怨这一点是因为结果令人震惊。你得到的东西是令人难以置信的。</p><p>这就是类比，我们推理运行系统投资策略的方式。</p><p>归根结底，预测的准确性才是为投资者创造回报的关键。能够准确地给出预测如何产生的完整描述本身并不能为投资者创造回报。</p><p>现在，我并不反对可解释性和简单性。其他条件都相同，我喜欢可解释性和简单性，但其他条件并不相同。</p><p> If you want the most accurate predictions, you are going to have to sacrifice some amount of simplicity. In fact, this truth is so widespread that Leo gave it a name in his paper. He called it Occam&#39;s Dilemma. So Occam&#39;s Razor is the philosophical idea that you should choose the simplest explanation that fits the facts.</p><p> Occam&#39;s dilemma is the point that in statistical prediction, the simplest approach, even though you wish you could choose it, is not the most accurate approach. If you care about predictive accuracy, if you&#39;re putting predictive accuracy first, then you have to embrace a certain amount of complexity and lack of interpretability.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really quite fascinating.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk a little bit about artificial intelligence and large language models. You follow DE Shaw playing in e-commerce and biotech, it seems like this approach to using statistics, probability and computer science is applicable to so many different fields.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: It is, yeah. I think you&#39;re talking about prediction problems ultimately. So in recommender systems, you can think of the question as being, well, if I had to predict what thing I could show a person that would be most likely to change their behavior and cause them to buy it, that&#39;s the kind of prediction problem that motivates recommendations.</p><p> In biotechnology, very often we are trying to make predictions about whether someone, let&#39;s say, does or doesn&#39;t have a condition, a disease, based on lots of information we can gather from high throughput diagnostic techniques.</p><p> These days, the keyword in biology and in medicine and biotechnology is high throughput. You&#39;re running analyses on an individual that are producing hundreds of thousands of numbers. And you want to be able to take all of that kind of wealth of data and turn it into diagnostic information.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And we&#39;ve seen AI get applied to pharmaceutical development in ways that people just never really could have imagined just a few short years ago. Is there a field that AI and large language models are not going to touch, or is this just the future of everything?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: The kinds of fields where you would expect uptake to be slow are where it is hard to assemble large data sets of systematically gathered data. And so any field where it&#39;s relatively easy to, at large scale, let&#39;s say, produce the same kinds of information that experts are using to make their decisions, you should expect that field to be impacted by these tools if it hasn&#39;t been already.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you&#39;re kind of answering my next question, which is, what led you back to investment management? But it seems if there&#39;s any field that just generates endless amounts of data, it&#39;s the markets.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: That&#39;s true. I&#39;ve been really interested in the problems of systematic investment strategies from my time working at DE Shaw. And so my co-founder, Michael Kharitonov, and I, we were both in the Bay Area in 2004, 2005. He was there because of a firm that he had founded, and I was there finishing my PhD. And we started to talk about the idea of using contemporary machine learning methods to build strategies that would be really different from strategies that result from classical techniques.</p><p> And we had met at DE Shaw in the &#39;90s and been less excited about this idea because the methods were pretty immature. There wasn&#39;t actually a giant diversity of data back in the &#39;90s in financial markets, not like there was in 2005. And compute was really still quite expensive in the &#39;90s, whereas in 2005, it had been dropping in the usual Moore&#39;s Law way, and this was even before GPUs.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: And so when we looked at the problem in 2005, it felt like there was a very live opportunity to do something with a lot of promise that would be really different. And we had the sense that not a lot of people were of the same opinion. And so it seemed like something that we should try.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: There was a void, nothing in the market hates more than a vacuum in an intellectual approach.</p><p> So you mentioned the diversity of various data sources.</p><p> What don&#39;t you consider? Like how far off of price and volume do you go in the net you&#39;re casting for inputs into your systems?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well I think we&#39;re prepared as a research principle, we&#39;re prepared to consider any data that has some bearing on price formation, like some plausible bearing on how prices are formed. Now of course we&#39;re a relatively small group of people with a lot of ideas and so we have to prioritize. So in the event, we end up pursuing data that makes a lot of sense. We don&#39;t try…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I mean, can you go as far as politics or the weather? Like how far off of prices can you look?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: So an example would be the weather. For most securities, you&#39;re not going to be very interested in the weather, but for commodities futures, you might be. So that&#39;s the kind of reasoning you would apply.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really, really interesting.</p><p> So let&#39;s talk about some of the strategies you guys are running.</p><p> Short and mid-horizon US equities, European equities, Asian equities, mid-horizon US credit, and then cross-asset. So I might assume all of these are machine learning based, and how similar or different is each approach to each of those asset classes?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, they&#39;re all machine learning based. The kind of principles that I&#39;ve described of using as much complexity as you need to maximize predictive accuracy, et cetera, those principles underlie all the systems. But of course, trading corporate bonds is very different from trading equities. And so the implementations reflect that reality.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk a little bit about the four-step process that you bring to the systematic approach. And this is off of your site. So it&#39;s data, prediction engine, portfolio, construction, and execution. I&#39;m assuming that is heavily computer and machine learning based at each step along the way. Is that fair?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: I think that&#39;s fair. I mean, to different degrees. The data gathering, that&#39;s largely a software and kind of operations and infrastructure job.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do you guys have to spend a lot of time cleaning up that data and making sure that, because you hear between CRISP and S&amp;P and Bloomberg, sometimes you&#39;ll pull something up and they&#39;re just all off a little bit from each other because they all bring a very different approach to data assembly. How do you make sure everything is consistent and there&#39;s no errors or inputs throughout?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, through a lot of effort, essentially.</p><p> We have an entire group of people who focus on data operations, both for gathering of historical data and for the management of the ongoing live data feeds. There&#39;s no way around that. I mean, that&#39;s just work that you have to do.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You just have to brute force your way through that.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And then the prediction engine sounds like that&#39;s the single most important part of the machine learning process, if I&#39;m understanding you correctly. That&#39;s where all the meat of the technology is.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, I understand the sentiment. I mean, it&#39;s worth emphasizing that you do not get to a successful systematic strategy without all the ingredients. You have to have clean data because of the garbage in, garbage out principle. You have to have accurate predictions, but predictions don&#39;t automatically translate into returns for investors.</p><p> Those predictions are kind of the power that drives the portfolio holding part of the system.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk about that portfolio construction, given that you have a prediction engine and good data going into it, so you&#39;re fairly confident as to the output. How do you then take that output and say, “Here&#39;s how I&#39;m going to build a portfolio based on what this generates”?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, so there are three big ingredients in the portfolio construction. The predictions, what is usually called a risk model in this business, which means some understanding of how volatile prices are across all the securities you&#39;re trading, how correlated they are, how, you know, if they have a big movement, how big that movement will be. That&#39;s all the risk model.</p><p> And then the final ingredient is what&#39;s usually called a market impact model. And that means an understanding of how much you are going to push prices away from you when you try to trade. This is a reality of all trading.</p><p> If you buy a lot of a security, you push the price up. You push it away from you in the unfavorable direction. And in the systems that we run, the predictions that we&#39;re trying to capture are about the same size as the effect that we have on the markets when we trade.</p><p> And so you cannot neglect that impact effect when you&#39;re thinking about what portfolios to hold.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So execution becomes really important. If you&#39;re not executing well, you are moving prices away from your profit.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: That&#39;s right. And it is probably the single thing that undoes quantitative hedge funds most often is that that they misunderstand how much they&#39;re moving prices, they get too big, they start trading too much, and they sort of blow themselves up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s funny that you say that, because as you were describing that, the first name that popped into my head was long-term capital management, was trading these really thinly traded, obscure fixed income products.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And everything they bought, they sent higher, because there just wasn&#39;t any volume in it. And when they needed liquidity, there was none to be had. And that plus no risk management, 100X leverage equals a kaboom.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yes. Barry, they made a number of mistakes. The book is good. So “When Genius Failed.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, absolutely.</p><p> I love that book.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Really fascinating.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So when you&#39;re reading a book like that, somewhere in the back of your head, are you thinking, hey, this is like a what not to do when you&#39;re setting up a machine learning fund? How influential is something like that?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well, 100%. I mean, look, I think the most important adage I&#39;ve ever heard in my professional life is, good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment.</p><p> So the extent to which you can get good judgment from other people&#39;s experience, that is like a free lunch.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Cheap tuition.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That is like a free lunch.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: And so we talk a lot about all the mistakes that other people have made. And we do not congratulate ourselves on having avoided mistakes. We think those people were smart. I mean, look, you read about these events and none of these people were dummies. They were sophisticated.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Nobel laureates, right? They just didn&#39;t have a guidebook on what not to do, which you guys do.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: We don&#39;t, no, I don&#39;t think we do. I mean, apart from reading about, right. But everybody is undone by a failure that they didn&#39;t think of or didn&#39;t know about yet. And we&#39;re extremely cognizant of that.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That has to be somewhat humbling to constantly being on the lookout for that blind spot that could disrupt everything.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yes, yeah, humility is the key ingredient in running these systems.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite amazing. So let&#39;s talk a little bit about how academically focused Voleon is. You guys have a pretty deep R&amp;D team internally. You teach at Berkeley. What does it mean for a hedge fund to be academically focused?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: What I would say probably is kind of evidence-based rather than academically focused. Saying academically focused gives the impression that papers would be the goal or the desired output, and that&#39;s not the case at all. We have a very specific applied problem that we are trying to solve.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Papers are a mean to an end.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Papers are, you know, we don&#39;t write papers for external consumption. We do lots of writing internally, and that&#39;s to make sure that, you know, we&#39;re keeping track of our own kind of scientific process.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But you&#39;re fairly widely published in statistics and machine learning.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yes.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What purpose does that serve other than a calling card for the fund, as well as, hey, I have this idea, and I want to see what the rest of my peers think of it, when you put stuff out into the world, what sort of feedback or pushback do you get?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: I guess I would have to say I really, I do that as kind of a double life of non-financial research. So it&#39;s just something that I really enjoy.</p><p> Principally, what it means is that I get to work with PhD students and we have really outstanding PhD students at Berkeley in statistics. And so it&#39;s an opportunity for me to do a kind of intellectual work that, namely, you know, writing a paper, laying out an argument for public consumption, et cetera, that is kind of closed off as far as Voleon is concerned.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So not adjacent to what you guys are doing at Voleon?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Generally no.不。</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really interesting. So then I always assume that that was part of your process for developing new models to apply machine learning to new assets. Take us through the process. How do you go about saying, hey, this is an asset class we don&#39;t have exposure to, let&#39;s see how to apply what we already know to that specific area?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, we have, it&#39;s a great question. So we&#39;re trying as much as possible to get the problem for a new asset class into a familiar setup, as standard a setup as we can.</p><p> And so we know what these systems look like in the world of equity.</p><p> And so if you&#39;re trying to do the same, if you&#39;re trying to build the same kind of system for corporate bonds and you start off by saying, “Well, okay, I need to know closing prices or intraday prices for all the bonds.” Already you have a very big problem in corporate bonds because there is no live price feed that&#39;s showing you a “bid offer” quote in the way that there is in equity.</p><p> And so before you can even get started thinking about predicting how a price is going to change, it would be nice if you know what the price currently was. And that is already a problem you have to solve in corporate bonds, as opposed to being just an input that you have access to.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: The old joke was trading by appointment only.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And that seems to be a bit of an issue. And there are so many more bond issuers than there are equities.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Absolutely.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is this just a database challenge or how do you work around it?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: It&#39;s a statistics problem, but it&#39;s a different kind of statistics problem. We&#39;re not, in this case, we&#39;re not trying to yet, we&#39;re not yet trying to predict the future of any quantity. We&#39;re trying to say, I wish I knew what the fair value of this CUSIP was. I can&#39;t see that exactly because there&#39;s no live order book with a bid and an offer that&#39;s got lots of liquidity that lets me figure out the fair value. But I do have …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: At best, you have a recent price or maybe not even so recent.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: I have lots of related information. I know, you know, this bond, maybe this bond didn&#39;t trade today, but it traded a few times yesterday. I get to say, I know where it traded. I&#39;m in touch with bond dealers. So I know where they&#39;ve quoted this bond, maybe only on one side over the last few days. I have some information about the company that issued this bond, et cetera.</p><p> So I have lots of stuff that&#39;s related to the number that I want to know. I just don&#39;t know that number. And so what I want to try to do is kind of fill in and do what in statistics or in control we would call a now-casting problem.</p><p> And an analogy actually is to automatically controlling an airplane, surprisingly. If a software is trying to fly an airplane, there are six things that it absolutely has to know. It has to know the XYZ of where the plane is and the XYZ of its velocity, where it&#39;s headed.</p><p> Those are the six most important numbers.</p><p> Now nature does not just supply those numbers to you. You cannot know those numbers with perfect exactitude, but there&#39;s lots of instruments on the plane and there&#39;s GPS and all sorts of information that is very closely related to the numbers you wish you knew.</p><p> And you can use statistics to go from all that stuff that&#39;s adjacent to a guess and infill of the thing you wish you knew. And the same goes with the current price of a corporate bond.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really kind of interesting. So I&#39;m curious as to how often you start working your way into one particular asset or a particular strategy for that asset and just suddenly realize, “Oh, this is wildly different than we previously expected.” And suddenly you&#39;re down a rabbit hole to just wildly unexpected areas. It sounds like that isn&#39;t all that uncommon.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: It is not uncommon at all.</p><p> It&#39;s a nice, you know, there&#39;s this kind of wishful thinking that, oh, we figured it out in one asset class in the sense that we have a system that&#39;s kind of stable and performing reasonably well that we have a feel for. And now we want to take that system and somehow replicate it in a different situation.</p><p> And while we&#39;re going to standardize the new situation to make it look like the old situation, that&#39;s the principle. That principle kind of quickly goes out the window when you start to make contact with the reality of how the new asset class actually behaves.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So stocks are different than credit, are different than bonds, are different than commodities. They&#39;re all like starting fresh over. What&#39;s some of the more surprising things you&#39;ve learned as you&#39;ve applied machine learning to totally different asset classes?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well I think corporate bonds provide a lot of examples of this. I mean the fact that you don&#39;t actually really know a good live price or a good live bid offer seems, you know…</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It seems crazy.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: it&#39;s surprising. I mean, this fact has started to change. Like, over the years, there&#39;s been an accelerating electronification of corporate bond trading. And that&#39;s been a big advantage for us, actually, because we were kind of first movers. And so we&#39;ve really benefited from that.</p><p> So the problem is diminished relative to how it was six, seven years ago when we started.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: But it&#39;s still essentially.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Relative to equities, it&#39;s absolutely there.是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you get – so in other words, if I&#39;m looking at a bond mutual fund or even a bond ETF that&#39;s trading during the day, that price is somebody&#39;s best approximation of the value of all the bonds inside. But really, you don&#39;t know the NAV, do you? You&#39;re just kind of guessing.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Barry, don&#39;t even get me started on bond ETFs. (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really? Because it seems like that would be the first place that would show up, “Hey, bond ETFs sound like throughout the day they&#39;re going to be mispriced a little bit or wildly mispriced.”</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well, the bond ETF, there&#39;s a sense if you&#39;re a market purist in which they can&#39;t be mispriced because their price is set by supply and demand in the ETF market, and that&#39;s a super liquid market.</p><p> And so there may be a difference between the market price of the ETF and the NAV of the underlying portfolio.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. Except in many cases with bond ETFs there&#39;s not even a crisply defined underlying portfolio. It turns out that the authorized participants in those ETF markets can negotiate with the fund manager about exactly what the constituents are of the Create Redeem baskets.</p><p> And so it&#39;s not even at all clear what you mean when you say that the NAV is this or that relative to the price of the ETF.</p><p> So when I asked about what&#39;s surprising when you work you in on a rabbit hole, “Hey, we don&#39;t know what the hell&#39;s in this bond ETF. Trust us, it&#39;s all good.” That&#39;s a pretty surprise and I&#39;m only exaggerating a little bit, but that seems like that&#39;s kind of shocking.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: It is surprising when you find out about it, but you quickly come to understand if you trade single name bonds as we do, you quickly come to understand why bond ETFs work that way.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I recall a couple of years ago there was a big Wall Street Journal article on the GLD ETF. And from that article, I learned that GLD was formed because gold dealers had just excess gold piling up in their warehouses and they needed a way to move it. So that was kind of shocking about that ETF.</p><p> Any other space that led to a sort of big surprise as you worked your way into it?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well, I think ETFs are kind of a good source of these examples. The volatility ETFs, the ETFs that are based on the VIX or that are short the VIX, you may remember several years ago.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I was going to say the ones that haven&#39;t blown up.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, right. There was this event called Volmageddon.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Where …</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That was ETF notes, wasn&#39;t it? The volatility notes.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, the ETFs, ETNs, right. So there are these, essentially these investment products that were short VIX and VIX went through a spike that caused them to have to liquidate, which was part, I mean, the people who designed the 16 traded note, they understood that this was a possibility, so they had a sort of descriptions in their contract for what it would mean.</p><p> But yeah, always surprising to watch something suddenly go out of business.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: We seem to get a thousand year flood every couple of years. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t be calling these things thousand year floods, right? That&#39;s a big misnomer.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: As statisticians, we tell people, if you think that you&#39;ve experienced a Six Sigma event, the problem is that you have underestimated Sigma.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really interesting. So given the gap in the world between computer science and investment management, how long is it going to be before that narrows and we start seeing a whole lot more of the sort of work you&#39;re doing applied across the board to the world of investing?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well I think it&#39;s happening, it&#39;s been happening for quite a long time. For example, all of modern portfolio theory really kind of began in the 50s with, you know, first of all Markowitz and other people thinking about, you know, what it means to benefit from diversification and the idea that, you know, diversification is the only free lunch in finance.</p><p> So I would say that the idea of thinking in a systematic and scientific way about how to manage and grow wealth, not even just for institutions, but also for individuals, is an example of a way that these ideas have kind of had profound effects.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I know I only have you for a little while longer, so let&#39;s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests, starting with, tell us what you&#39;re streaming these days. What are you either listening to or watching to keep yourself entertained?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Few things I&#39;ve been watching recently, “The Bear” I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So great.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: So great, right?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: And set in Chicago, I know we were just talking about being in Chicago.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re from Chicago originally, yeah.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: So.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And there are parts of that show that are kind of a love letter to Chicago.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Absolutely, yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: As you get deeper into the series, because it starts out kind of gritty and you&#39;re seeing the underside, and then as we progress, it really becomes like a lovely postcard.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, yeah.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Such an amazing show.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Really, really love that show. I was late to “Better Call Saul” but I&#39;m finishing up. I think as good as “Breaking Bad”. Maybe when you haven&#39;t heard of, there&#39;s a show called “Mr. In Between”, which is —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “Mr. In Between”.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, it&#39;s on Hulu, it&#39;s from Australia. It&#39;s about a guy who&#39;s a doting father living his life. He&#39;s also essentially a muscle man and hit man for local criminals in his part of Australia. But it&#39;s half hour dark comedy.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, so not quite “Barry” and not quite “Sopranos”, somewhere in between.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: No, yeah, exactly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Sounds really interesting. Tell us about your early mentors who helped shape your career.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well, Barry, I&#39;ve been lucky to have a lot of people who were both really smart and talented and willing to take the time to help me learn and understand things.</p><p> So actually my co-founder, Michael Kharitonov, he was kind of my first mentor in finance. He had been at DE Shaw for several years when I got there and he really taught me kind of the ins and outs of market microstructure.</p><p> I worked with a couple of people who managed me at DE Shaw, Yossi Friedman, and Kapil Mathur, who have gone on to hugely successful careers in quantitative finance, and they taught me a lot too. When I did my PhD, my advisor, Mike Jordan, who&#39;s a kind of world-famous machine learning researcher, you know, I learned enormously from him.</p><p> And there&#39;s another professor of statistics who sadly passed away about 15 years ago, named David Friedman. He was really just an intellectual giant of the 20th century in probability and statistics. He was both, one of the most brilliant probabilists and also an applied statistician. And this is like a pink diamond kind of combination. It&#39;s that rare to find someone who has that kind of technical capability, but also understands the pragmatics of actually doing that analysis.</p><p> He spent a lot of time as an expert witness. He was the lead statistical consultant for the case on census adjustment that went to the Supreme Court. In fact, he told me that in the end, the people against adjustment, they won in a unanimous Supreme Court decision. And David Friedman told me, he said, “All that work and we only convinced nine people.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s great. Nine people that kind of matter.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, exactly. So it was just, it was a real, it was kind of a once in a lifetime privilege to get to spend time with someone of that intellectual caliber. And there were others too. I mean, I&#39;ve been very fortunate.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s quite a list to begin with. Let&#39;s talk about books. What are some of your favorites and what are you reading right now?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Well, I&#39;m a big book reader, so I had a long list. But probably one of my–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: By the way, this is everybody&#39;s favorite section of the podcast. People are always looking for good book recommendations and if they like what you said earlier, they&#39;re going to love your book recommendations. So fire away.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: So I&#39;m a big fan of kind of modernist dystopian fiction.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Okay.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: So a couple of examples of that would be the book “Infinite Jest” by David Foster Wallace, “Wind Up Bird Chronicle” by Haruki Murakami. Those are two of my all-time favorite books. There&#39;s a, I think, much less well-known but beautiful novel. It&#39;s a kind of academic coming of age novel called “Stoner” by John Williams. Really moving, just a tremendous book. Sort of more dystopia would be “White Noise” DeLillo, and kind of the classics that everybody knows, “1984” and “Brave New World.” Those are two more of my favorite.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s funny, when you mention “The Bear” I&#39;m in the middle of reading a book that I would swear the writers of the bear leaned on called “Unreasonable Hospitality” by somebody who worked for the Danny Myers Hospitality Group, Eleven Madison Park and Gramercy Tavern and all these famous New York haunts. And the scene in “The Bear” where they overhear a couple say, “Oh, we visited Chicago, and we never had deep dish.”</p><p> So they send the guy out to get deep dish. There&#39;s part of the book where at 11 Madison Park, people actually showed up with suitcases. It was the last thing they would eat doing before they&#39;re heading to the airport. And they said, “Oh, we ate all these great places “in New York, but we never had a New York hot dog.” And what do they do? They send someone out to get a hot dog. They plate it and use all the condiments to make it very special.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: I see.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And it looks like it was ripped right out of the barrel or vice versa. But if you&#39;re interested in just, hey, how can we disrupt the restaurant business and make it not just about the celebrity chef in the kitchen but the whole experience, fascinating kind of nonfiction book.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: That does sound really interesting.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yeah, really. You mentioned “The Bear” and it just popped into my head.</p><p> Any other books you want to mention? That&#39;s a good list to start with.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, my other kind of big interest is science fiction, speculative fiction.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I knew you were going to go there.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Unsurprisingly, right, sorry.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Let&#39;s go.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Sorry, but so there are some classics that I think everybody should read. Ursula Le Guin is just amazing. So “The Dispossessed” and “The Left Hand of Darkness.” Those are just two of the best books I&#39;ve ever read, period. Forget it.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “Left Hand of Darkness” stays with you for a long time.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, yeah, really, really amazing books. I&#39;m rereading right now “Cryptonomicon” by Neil Stevenson. And one other thing I try to do is I have very big gaps in my reading. For example, I&#39;ve never read “Updike.” So I started reading the Rabbit series. –</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, “World According to Garp”, and they&#39;re very much of an era.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, that&#39;s right.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What else? Give us more.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Wow, okay. Let&#39;s see, George Saunders, he, oh wow. I think you&#39;d love him. So his real strength is short fiction. He&#39;s written great novels too, but “10th of December” this is his best collection of fiction. And this is more kind of modern dystopian, kind of comic dystopian stuff.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You keep coming back to dystopia. I&#39;m fascinated by that.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: I find it&#39;s very different from my day-to-day reality. So I think it&#39;s a great change of pace for me to be able to read this stuff.</p><p> So some science writing, I can tell you probably the best science book I ever read is “The Selfish Gene” by Richard Dawkins, which kind of really, you have a kind of intuitive understanding of genetics and natural selection in Darwin, but the language that Dawkins uses really makes you appreciate just how much the genes are in charge and how little we as the, as the, you know, he calls organisms survival machines that the genes have kind of built and exist inside in order to ensure their propagation.</p><p> And the whole point of view in that book just gives you, it&#39;s really eye-opening, makes you think about natural selection and evolution and genetics in a completely different way, even though it&#39;s all based on the same kind of facts that you know.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right. It&#39;s just the framing and the context.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: It&#39;s the framing and the perspective that really kind of blow your mind. So it&#39;s a great book to read.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Huh, that&#39;s a hell of a list. You&#39;ve given people a lot of things to start with. And now down to our last two questions. What advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in either investment management or machine learning?</p><p> MCAULIFFE: Yeah, so I mean, I work in a very specialized subdomain of finance, so there are a lot of people who are going to be interested in investment and finance that I couldn&#39;t give any specific advice to. I have kind of general advice that I think is useful, both for finance and even more broadly. This advice is really kind of top of Maslow&#39;s pyramid advice if you&#39;re trying to kind of write your novel and pay the rent while you get it done, I can&#39;t really help you with that.</p><p> But if what you care about is building this career, then I would say number one piece of advice is work with incredible people. Like far and away, much more important than what the particular field is, the details of what you&#39;re working on is the caliber of the people that you do it with. Both in terms of your own satisfaction and how much you learn and all of that.</p><p> I think you&#39;ll learn, you&#39;ll benefit hugely on a personal level from working with incredible people. And if you don&#39;t work with people that are like that, then you&#39;re probably going to have a lot of professional unhappiness. So it&#39;s kind of either or.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s a really intriguing answer.</p><p> So final question, what do you know about the world of investing, machine learning, large language models, just the application of technology to the field of investing that you wish you knew 25 years or so ago when you were really first ramping up.</p><p> MCAULIFFE: I think one of the most important lessons that I had to learn the hard way, kind of going through and running these systems was that it&#39;s, kind of comes back to the point you made earlier about the primacy of prediction rules. And it may be true that the most important thing is the prediction quality, but there are lots of other very necessary mandatory ingredients and I would put kind of risk management at the top of that list.</p><p> So I think it&#39;s easy to maybe neglect risk management to a certain extent and focus all of your attention on predictive accuracy. But I think it really does turn out that if you don&#39;t have high quality risk management to go along with that predictive accuracy, you won&#39;t succeed.</p><p> And I guess I wish I had appreciated that in a really deep way 25 years ago.</p><p> Jon, this has been really absolutely fascinating. I don&#39;t even know where to begin other than saying thank you for being so generous with your time and your expertise.</p><p> We have been speaking with Jon McAuliffe.

That&#39;s been estimated as high as $50 billion a year by the Economic Policy Institute, which extrapolated from a 2008 survey of low-wage front-line workers in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.

Combined with other “non-pharmaceutical interventions” (NPIs) such as masking and social distancing, they slowed the spread of the disease, saving millions of people from falling ill, landing in the hospital, or dying. Absent these measures, hospitals, which already were overrun with patients in dire condition, would have fared even worse.

In January, a settlement between a former employee and the firm reportedly began circulating among Tiger investors. And this summer, an anonymously written and damning memo that made aggressive, yet unsubstantiated, claims about the firm&#39;s performance, investment approach, and personnel started circling far and wide within Wall Street and Silicon Valley circles. It&#39;s the sort of squabbling and attention that makes LPs look twice at an investment. One thing seems to be clear: Someone has it out for the firm. And the timing couldn&#39;t be worse.

And one of the things I thought about was all the lessons I&#39;ve learned over the years. And I thought that a fun way to celebrate would be to take the time and write down some of those ideas and lessons that have come to influence my thinking.

( <a href="https://www.ian-leslie.com/p/stories-are-bad-for-your-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ruffian</a> )</p><p> • <strong>Why You Are Probably A Non-Player Character</strong> : It&#39;s getting ever harder to distinguish humans from bots, not just because bots are becoming more humanlike, but also because humans are becoming more botlike. Here&#39;s why: the brain is commonly regarded as a thinking machine, but it&#39;s more often the opposite: a machine that tries to circumvent thinking. This is because cognition costs time and calories, which in our evolutionary history were scant resources. As such, the brain evolved to be a “cognitive miser” that operates according to the principle of least effort, taking shortcuts in thinking and perceiving that build a workable but hugely simplified (and cost effective) model of the world.

Self-directed drone swarms. How a US Navy task force is using off-the-shelf robotics and artificial intelligence to prepare for the next age of conflict.

It&#39;s religion, repackaged</strong> . It&#39;s no accident — the intertwining of religion and technology is centuries old. ( <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vox</a> )</p><p> • <strong>How a conservative, gun-toting doctor defended abortion access in Appalachia</strong> : “We did everything,” he said of his longtime practice. “We were a gynecologist&#39;s office and we delivered babies. And we just happened to do abortions.” It was just another part of providing care, as routine as doing hysterectomies and prescribing birth control. That puts him at odds with some of his neighbors. Since 1978, Adams has lived in Bristol, a community that straddles the Tennessee-Virginia state line — unapologetically Trump country, unequivocally part of the Bible belt. His belief that sexual health care is normal has meant that his life is anything but. You might say that he&#39;s the face of abortion in Bristol if it weren&#39;t for the fact that he doesn&#39;t really want people to know what he looks like.

Then, a heat wave hit the East Coast, raising temperatures to the 90s in New York City. You could have continued your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Endless_Summer">Endless Summer</a> , working remotely in the AM, sneaking out for a few hours of mid-day beach fun, then returning home post-surf to respond to emails and other work-related detritus.</p><p> And yet, the city was jam-packed this week. Streets were filled, restaurants booked, traffic busy, and even offices seemed to have a marked increase in the number of bodies filling the hallways.</p><p> Lots of major employers in the New York City area have put a flag in the ground: October 1 <sup>st</sup> . That seems to be the drop dead date for when many companies will require employees to be back at least three, sometimes four, and five days per week.</p><p> My frame of reference is finance, and so seeing these requirements in places like JP Morgan Chase — which has abandoned its hybrid attendance policy for 5 days a week; Bloomberg is 4 days (Oct 1); Citi and Wells Fargo are 3 days a week, Black Rock four days, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley join JPM at five.</p><p> But it&#39;s not just finance: Federal workers have been <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/2023-09-07/as-federal-workers-are-ordered-back-to-their-offices-pockets-of-resistance-remain">ordered back</a> to their offices; Amazon, Apple and Google are at 3 days/week; Salesforce is three days a week in the office and four days for client-facing employees. Even Zoom is requiring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/business/zoom-return-to-office.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-person work</a> . <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/as-summer-ends-workers-head-back-to-the-office.aspx">Resume Builder</a> notes “A whopping 90% of companies plan to implement return-to-office policies by the end of 2024.” According to <a href="https://buildremote.co/companies/return-to-office/">Build Remote</a> (not exactly an unbiased source) 21% of the Fortune 100 require three office visits per week, with 77% operating on a hybrid work schedule.</p><p> All of these add up to the inescapable conclusion that the era of freewheeling “ <em>come in whenever the hell you like</em> ” is coming to an end.</p><p> Of course, there are a few wild cards here. There&#39;s been an uptick in COVID infections albeit from a mild variant; new booster shots will be available later this month. But barring some new deadly variant surge, it&#39;s unlikely that the endemic will remain a factor in return to office.</p><p> Small, nimble firms have been using WFH and flex hybrid schedules as a key selling point. Indeed, recent data shows a 29% surge in <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/media/business-fundamentals/hybrid-jobs-surge-29-yoy-in-q2-2023-as-companies-embrace-flexibility-reveals-globaldata/">Hybrid job listings</a> . You can be a cog in some massive faceless machine, goes the pitch, or you can work for (fill in the blank) start-up and have a lot more flexibility when you go small instead of big.

Within 24 hours, that partner was already on a flight back home.

And No One Is Sure Why</strong> . For nearly as long as Medicare has existed, it has been a notorious budget buster, alarming a wide range of politicians and budget experts. In 1983, Ronald Reagan said: “The need for action now is clear. Health care costs are climbing so fast they may soon threaten the quality of care and access to care which Americans enjoy.” In 1995, the Medicare trustees warned. If the rate of growth had kept up, the dotted line shows how much Medicare would have gone on to spend on each beneficiary. But that&#39;s not what happened. The difference is enormous. And no one is quite sure why.

Every studio exec in Tinseltown (but one) turned down “ <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> .” <sup>1</sup> All the largest Hollywood studio honchos passed on “ <em>Star Wars</em> .” <sup>2</sup></p><p> Which brings us to “ <a href="https://johnwick.movie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Wick</a> .”</p><p> The first of the Keanu Reeves action movie was made for $20 million dollars. It was made as an independent film because none of the studios were interested: Nobody wanted to finance it; once it was financed, no one wanted to distribute it; even after a distribution deal was inked, no one wanted to show it or review it.</p><p> But it almost wasn&#39;t made at all.</p><p> Watch Danny Boyd of CinemaStix&#39;s video (above) about the challenges of making a flick about a retired hitman. Despite being attached to a bankable star, despite being associated with the stuntmen and fight choreographers of the enormously successful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matrix</a> films, and despite a nearly insatiable demand for action movies, everyone passed on the film.</p><p> With the benefit of hindsight, all of these things are obvious to us: How could John Wick&#39;s style of Hong Kong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_fu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gun Fu</a> not be a smash hit? None of the studio heads had the vision to see its potential.</p><p> Because no one in Hollywood knows anything.</p><p> Kinda like Wall Street.</p><p> From CinemaStix&#39;s discussion above:</p><blockquote><p> “We were literally turned down by every studio that we went to. It&#39;s Keanu Reeves being an assassin kills dozens of people over a puppy and it&#39;s directed by not one but two crazy stuff guys so yeah it wasn&#39;t a great pitch.”</p><p> -Chad Stahelski &amp; David Leitch, Co-Directors</p><p> “But even after the movie got made I mean that was far from it. John Wick was still a couple of studio execs beguiled faces away from getting sent straight to Blu-ray nobody with any power understood it nobody with any money wanted to distribute it, and none of the critics in early screenings for it could figure out why they&#39;ve never heard of it.”</p><p> -Danny Boyd, CinemaStix</p></blockquote><p> No commercial potential?</p><p> Just the box office for the first film, and its three sequels was <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchise/fr1313312517/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billion dollars</a> . John Wick 4, which came out this summer, did $432.2 million at the box office. Chapter 5 is <a href="https://collider.com/john-wick-4-story-action-title-director-chad-stahelski-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> , and heading to theaters in 2026, which you wouldn&#39;t want to bet against the box office of that one either. To say nothing of video games, comic books, television series, and a spin-off film from the original. By the time it&#39;s all said and done, the John Wick franchise will be worth more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick#Box_office_performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 billion dollars</a> . And it almost wasn&#39;t made because none of the studio heads could see the commercial potential in the film.</p><p> <em>John Wick</em> is yet another reminder about just how little any of us know about what might happen in the future…</p><p></p><p></p><p> <em>Previously</em> :<br /> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2016/05/161589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nobody Knows Nuthin&#39;</a> (May 5, 2016)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/10/can-anyone-catch-nokia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can Anyone Catch Nokia?</a> (October 26, 2022)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2021/05/why-the-apple-store-will-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why the Apple Store Will Fail</a> (May 20, 2021)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/05/john-chambers-best-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“No matter how you cut it, you&#39;ve got to own Cisco” -2000</a> (May 15, 2023)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/06/nobody-knows-anything-2023-first-half-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Knows Anything, 2023 First Half Edition</a> (June 30, 2023)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/nobody-knows-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Knows Anything</a> (Collection)</p><p></p><p></p><p> <em>Source</em> :<br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/DGQ9fQ8XV0o?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When you hire stunt guys to direct the movie</a><br /> by Danny Boyd<br /> CinemaStix, April 1, 2023</p><p></p><p></p><p> __________</p><p> 1. <em>Raiders</em> to become one of the highest-grossing films of all time, and nominated for nine Academy Awards.</p><p> 2.
