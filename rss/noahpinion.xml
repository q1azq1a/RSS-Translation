href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/us-gdp-grew-at-a-4point9percent-annual-pace-in-the-third-quarter-better-than-expected.html">4.9%</a> ，与中国官方公布的增长率一样快，这对于美国来说是异常快的。失业率继续<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">徘徊在 3.8% 的历史低点附近</a>，而主要失业率则持续徘徊在历史低点附近。 - 年龄就业率<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12300060">接近历史最高水平</a>，接近 81%。通货膨胀率已大幅下降，目前<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL">约为 3.7%</a> ，核心通货膨胀<a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1718257239817925078">率略低</a>，<a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker">工资中位数增长</a>速度超过了通货膨胀率。与此同时，新的调查数据显示，<a

年底以来，大部分科技行业，尤其​​是风险投资的初创行业都遭受了打击。很容易自然地推断出我们自己的表现经济的小角落到整个事情。</p><p>但事实上，值得一问的是<em>，为什么</em>科技泡沫破灭没有将美国经济拖入全面衰退。事实上，有很多宏观经济模型可以说明单个行业甚至单个公司的冲击如何在整个经济中传播并导致整个经济陷入悬崖。 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393299000446">Horvath (2000)</a>和<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/The%20Network%20Origins%20of%20Aggregate%20Fluctuations.pdf">Acemoglu 等人。 （2012）</a>就是两个例子。其基本思想并不难理解——行业和公司之间进行贸易，因此当一个行业和公司倒闭时，它从其他行业和公司购买的中间产品就会减少，等等。</p><p>现在，这里需要注意的是，基本上你能想到的任何想法都有宏观模型，而且它们都很难凭经验进行检验——例如，你可以找到证据表明部门冲击非常重要，并且有证据表明部门冲击<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20160353">非常重要</a>。它们<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165188915000573">根本不重要</a>，你决定相信哪个结果基本上取决于你更喜欢哪一组假设。但人们普遍认为，2008 年的大衰退是由金融业的崩溃引发的，而且大多数人认为互联网泡沫的破裂与 2001 年的温和衰退有关。因此，值得一问的是，为什么科技股会崩溃2022-23 年没有出现类似的负面结果。</p><p>无论如何，首先让我们回顾一下这次破产是如何发生的一些细节。</p><h4> 2022-23 年的科技泡沫是如何下降的</h4><p>围绕生成式人工智能的兴奋是如此强烈，以至于科技行业以外的人甚至很难意识到软件行业的大部分仍在遭受重大洗牌。但业内人士都知道。人工智能很棒，但消费互联网、SaaS、金融科技、加密货币等都受到了打击。</p><p>整件事要从2021年11月开始，当时发生了两件事。首先，投资者意识到利率将会大幅上涨。一般来说，加息对股价不利，因为它们使公司更难借钱，而且因为它们增加了投资者用来评估未来现金流的“贴现率”。如果您开始预期利率会更高，那么您通常应该预期股价会低于原本的水平。当我们查看<a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2023/05/constructing-forward-interest-rates-in-fred/">远期利率</a>数据（与利率预期密切相关）时，我们看到它们从 2021 年 11 月开始上升，比美联储实际开始加息的几个月早。</p><p><a

href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/02/biden-china-xi-burns-beijing-reset-detente-election-campaign/">态度比他就任总统的前两年更加温和</a>。部分原因可能是因为中国的经济困境使它看起来不像是迫在眉睫的威胁，但部分原因肯定是因为乌克兰和现在以色列的战争正在吸引美国的注意力和努力。</p><p>但无论这种暂时的缓和是好主意还是错误，将焦点从亚洲整体转移肯定是一个误判。无论美国希望对中国表现得多么强硬，向该地区投入更多外交精力和军事准备都是有意义的。特别是，应该强烈抵制重新陷入中东冲突的冲动。这既是因为亚洲是一个具有更重要战略意义的地区，也是因为美国的力量比在中东更适合在亚洲取得更积极的成果。</p><h4>亚洲值得保护</h4><p>正如该博客的老读者所知，我在日本生活了几年，并且有机会前往东亚其他地区旅行。它是人类有史以来创造的最令人震惊的文明顶峰之一。<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/tokyo-is-the-new-paris">东京</a>、首尔、新加坡等东亚城市，以及直到最近的香港，可以说是世界上最宏伟的城市——超高密度、高效、繁华、充满生机、创造力和个人自由，但也极其安全。东亚是一个富裕地区，生活质量很高，只有北欧和英语圈的部分地区可以与之媲美。 Maciej Cegłowski<a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/08/a_walk_in_hong_kong.htm">将它们称为</a>“零世界”，我认为这是一个恰当的描述。</p><p>与此同时，南亚和东南亚<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/china-at-the-peak">现在是世界重要的增长中心</a>。这些国家正在使<em>20 亿</em>人摆脱贫困，其工业化进程仅次于中国最近取得的成就。 </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"

href="https://twitter.com/ianellisjones/status/1718701969093558549">在台湾问题上</a>，在<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/10/29/south-china-sea-confrontation/">南海</a>领土主张问题上，等等。</p><p>这些威胁可能永远不会成为现实。习近平可能会认为他满足于武力威胁，直到十年后他被更理性的人取代。缓和可能会占上风，战争可能会避免一代人的时间。但如果战争真的爆发，<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-war-economy-sizing-up-the-new">中国的绝对实力</a>——其威力让俄罗斯或伊朗的任何力量都相形见绌——将给该地区的大部分地区带来毁灭性的打击。</p><p>亚洲国家当然不希望这样。但他们也不想屈服于中共霸权的未来。 2019 年让世界尝到了这一切的滋味。习近平决定废除赋予香港实质性个人自由的“一个国家、两种制度”政策的关键要素后，引发了大规模的抗议浪潮，在最高峰时，每 7 个香港居民中就有 2 个被卷入抗议活动。街头。</p><p>我<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/i-will-never-get-to-go-to-hong-kong">亲眼</a>目睹了其中一些抗议活动，如果你想了解它是什么样的，我强烈推荐纪录片《<a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/revolutionofourtimeseng">我们时代的革命</a>》。中国利用严厉的新国安法镇压了 2020 年的抗议运动， <a href="https://www.hrw.org/feature/2021/06/25/dismantling-free-society/hong-kong-one-year-after-national-security-law">消除了许多使这座城市成为世界上最伟大城市之一的独特文化</a>、活力和自由。一个例子是香港独特的电影业，它启发并娱乐了世界，但中国<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59047633">现在对其进行严格审查</a>。这只是对公民社会、个人表达、粤语等更普遍破坏的一小部分。</p><p>对香港的镇压并没有造成大规模死亡，但它向亚洲其他国家证明，中国并不是一个维持现状的大国。该地区<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/assessing-us-and-chinese-influence-southeast-asia">对中国的评价</a><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2023/07/27/views-of-china/">开始大幅下降</a>，而对美国的评价则保持<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2023/06/27/overall-opinion-of-the-u-s/">强劲积极</a>。从印度、菲律宾到越南，各国开始深化与美国的<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-reveals-locations-4-new-strategic-sites-us-military-pact-2023-04-03/">联盟</a>、 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india-japan-us-australia-hold-first-malabar-naval-exercise-off-australia-2023-08-10/">准联盟</a>和“<a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/assessing-bolstered-us-vietnam-relationship">战略伙伴关系</a>”，也开始相互结成<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-462">制衡联盟</a>，但如果没有中国的力量，这些还不足以抵抗中国的力量。美国也在其中，每个人都知道这一点。</p><p>请注意，这与欧洲不同。欧盟和英国拥有足够的人口、工业能力和技术，可以在美国提供最少援助的情况下无限期地<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/europe-has-to-stand-against-russia">抵御俄罗斯的侵略</a>（如果它们选择这样做的话）。美国仍然是乌克兰战争努力的关键的唯一原因是欧洲一直<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/05/russia-war-eu-says-europe-cannot-replace-us-support-to-ukraine.html">不愿</a>完全介入这一角色。随着时间的推移，这种情况有望改变。但在亚洲，中国如此强大，美国的力量不可或缺。</p><p>总而言之，<em>亚洲希望并且需要美国来保护它</em>。它需要美国的军事力量和经济参与，不是为了压垮中国，而是为了维持运转良好的现状。亚洲发达国家希望保持富裕和自由，亚洲发展中国家希望继续靠自己致富，为此，它们需要美国阻止习近平试图颠覆现代世界最伟大的成功故事。</p><p>中东的情况则基本相反。</p><h4>中东需要自我改革</h4><p>过去，穆斯林学者<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisions_of_the_world_in_Islam">常常将</a>伊斯兰教控制之外的世界称为“dar al-harb”，意思是“战争之家”。今天，这个词可能准确地描述中东。以色列战争虽然残酷，但规模可能比近几十年来震撼该地区的其他大规模战争要小。伊拉克战争造成超过五十万人死亡。叙利亚战争造成超过五十万人死亡。也门战争已造成近 40 万人死亡。针对 ISIS 的战争造成近 20 万人死亡。这些都是利比亚战争等各种较小冲突的基础。</p><p>人们合理地担心以色列战争将导致对巴勒斯坦人的种族清洗——或者从长远来看，巴勒斯坦人将对以色列人进行种族清洗。这种担忧是有根据的。数十年来，基于种族和宗教的大规模驱逐和残暴行为在中东已司空见惯。以色列本身的人口主要不是来自大屠杀的欧洲难民的后裔，而是逃离20世纪中叶穆斯林国家<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world">暴力运动的</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews">中东犹太人</a>的后裔。叙利亚政府之所以如此残暴，部分原因是执政的阿拉维派少数派担心一旦失去权力就会发生种族灭绝。雅兹迪人遭到伊斯兰国的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazidi_genocide">屠杀和奴役</a>。伊拉克战争的大部分时间实际上只是伊拉克逊尼派和什叶派在该国各个地区和社区之间进行种族清洗。萨达姆侯赛因对库尔德人的残酷对待是出了名的。等等等等。</p><p>中东的基因或文化并没有什么固有的因素使它比亚洲更加好战和混乱。事实上，在第二次世界大战期间，这种关系在很大程度上发生了逆转。中东<em>为何</em>成为战争之地是一个复杂的故事。美国和俄罗斯等外部势力的干预无疑加剧了局势。石油的诅咒给了一些中东国家足够的资金来进行斗争，而不必被迫建立强大的机构，这与此有很大关系。当然，宗教也是一个因素。</p><p>但问题在于，中东多年来一直陷入一种不良的平衡状态，统治者过着奢侈的生活，而贫困的群众则专注于宗派冲突和复仇。除以色列和土耳其外，该地区经济普遍停滞。

href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/debating-defence-budgets-why-military-purchasing-power-parity-matters">他们的钱更划算</a>……。事实上，两国的军费开支可能<a href="https://twitter.com/MEaglen/status/1689283338102616065">大致相等</a>。）</p><p>以下是国防分析师 Tom Shugart 对国防部报告的<a href="https://twitter.com/tshugart3/status/1716259376183361842">详细分析</a>（<a href="https://twitter.com/tshugart3/status/1716465378635751757">这是第二部分</a>）。基本上，中国正在建造大量的船舶、飞机和导弹。这些是它将在<a href="https://twitter.com/ianellisjones/status/1718701969093558549">台湾或南中国海战争</a>中用来对抗美国的武器。它还正在建造更多的核武器。</p><p> Shugart 主题的一些摘录：</p><blockquote><p> [中华人民共和国通过增强解放军的军事能力，正在对该地区的邻国采取更多的胁迫行动（只要问问菲律宾和台湾就知道了）。在提高对抗美国的能力的同时，它似乎基本上不再有兴趣谈论了……</p><p>报告称，今年解放军海军的舰体数量从 340 艘增加到 370 艘，水面战斗舰艇数量从 125 艘增加到 140 艘……30 艘舰体数量的增加超出了我的预期，水面战斗舰数量也增加了 15 艘。我知道他们正在建设，但不知道他们建设得那么快……</p><p>就解放军未来的增长而言，国防部预计到 2025 年将拥有 395 艘舰艇，到 2030 年将达到 435 艘……国防部估计解放军去年已建造了 21 艘元级潜艇，而 2022 年为 17 艘……</p><p>转向解放军空军：今年的报告显示，解放军空军目前拥有 1900 架第四代战斗机中的 1300 架（我假设 1300 架也包括第五代战斗机），比上一年增加*500*……</p><p>报告显示，中国远程导弹的各个类别都有大幅增长。部署的洲际弹道导弹发射器从 300 个跃升至 500 个，导弹数量从 300 个增加到 350 个……虽然发射器数量保持不变，但中程导弹（即“关岛杀手”）的数量估计却增加了从有点模糊的“250+”到可靠的500……</p><p>美国国防部目前估计中国拥有 500 枚核弹头库存，比去年增加了 100 枚。它还将更长的时间表提前至 2030 年“拥有超过 1,000 枚弹头”，而到 2036 年将拥有“约 1,500 枚”弹头。</p></blockquote><p>这绝对是惊人的军事建设速度，而且还不是战时。这远远超出了美国所能控制的范围。中国每年建造21艘潜艇，而美国则难以建造<em>两艘</em>。这是<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2022/01/03/us-navy-avoided-a-2022-trough-in-submarine-fleet-size-but-industry-challenges-threaten-future-growth/">去年的</a>：</p><blockquote><p>即将卸任的特朗普政府随后提出了 72 至 78 艘攻击潜艇的目标，而拜登政府此后<a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/RL32665.pdf">确定了 66 至 72 艘攻击潜艇的范围</a>——除非有什么改变，否则对海军来说仍然遥不可及……</p><p>该工业基地由主承包商通用动力电船公司和支持造船商亨廷顿英格尔斯工业公司的纽波特纽斯造船厂领导，一直难以按计划每年交付两艘弗吉尼亚级攻击潜艇。两个船厂各自建造船只的不同部分，然后轮流由谁进行最后的组装和交付。承包商迟迟将一艘又一艘的船交付给海军。</p></blockquote><p>美国国防工业基地已萎缩至 20 世纪 90 年代的一小部分。军事分析家帕特里克·福克斯<a href="https://twitter.com/RealCynicalFox/status/1717223315662627033">有这样的说法</a>：</p><blockquote><p>拜登政府最明显的失败之一是他们拒绝积极进行再工业化以提高我们的武器制造能力。这种必要性在 2022 年变得更加明显，并且在此期间变得更加重要。</p></blockquote><p>他还展示了更多数据，说明我们为乌克兰制造炮弹付出了多少努力——这只是我们为与中国发生冲突而需要建造的炮弹的一小部分。</p><p>如果你不担心这个，你应该担心。你可以安慰自己，美国的技术仍然比中国好一点（也许），但世界大战告诉我们，如果你的技术相当好，数量上的巨大优势是决定性的。美国现在正处于这种不对称的失败者一方。这个世界上不再有民主的武库，这个事实应该让你感到困扰。</p><h4> 3.产业政策实际上并不是为了低工资</h4><p>在过去的几个月里，出现了很多对产业政策<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-pushback-against-industrial-policy">草率的批评</a>，我很快就会在另一篇文章中讨论更多这些批评。但也有一些有趣且明智的批评，我觉得我也应该解决这些问题。例如，<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-industrial-policy-dilemma">马特·伊格莱西亚斯认为</a>，产业政策将难以创造良好的就业机会，因为它依赖廉价工资作为国际竞争力的来源：</p><blockquote><p>假设你是一个贫穷的国家......然后有人受到你国家低工资的诱惑，建造了几家工厂......现在作为一个持续的事情，他的利润率非常高，因为工资太低了。工厂的工人不喜欢这样，开始谈论……罢工，要求加薪。政府做什么？……如果政府关心产业政策和创建一个发展型国家，它可能<a href="https://pseudoerasmus.com/2017/10/02/ijd/">会选择镇压劳工并帮助镇压罢工</a>。</p><p>为什么？嗯，因为即使工厂工人的工资过低……国家经济发展的整个战略都是建立在利用这一事实的基础上的……你要做的就是吸引更多的投资，建造更多的工厂，并将更多的工人从农场转移到工业工作中。部门重新分配……是提高工资的策略……</p><p>发展型国家的首选举措是比自由市场<em>更加敌视工人利益</em>……对于像美国这样已经富裕的国家来说，困境在于很难想象一个富裕国家如何才能获得通过保持低工资来变得更富有……[D]你想制定自己的<em>产业政策</em>——抑制工资——以防止外国竞争者偷走你的行业吗？</p></blockquote><p>这种批评值得认真对待，因为毫无疑问，过高的工资将使美国工业在国际市场上失去竞争力。由于美国经济规模庞大且<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS">相对封闭</a>，美国人习惯于只考虑为国内市场生产。你可以通过关税等措施保护国内市场。</p><p>但事实上，为<em>世界</em>市场生产极其重要，不仅因为世界市场很大，而且因为为世界生产产品可以推动企业提高生产力水平。因此，在这里你必须具有竞争力，并且不要被中国的竞争严重低估。如果美国工人不断罢工并获得越来越高的工资，最终印度、巴西或德国将没有人愿意购买波音飞机、福特汽车或英特尔半导体；他们会从中国购买。</p><p>但从数量上来说，低劳动力成本有多重要？马特引用了<a href="https://pseudoerasmus.com/2017/10/02/ijd/">一些历史研究</a>作为证据，表明日本纺织工业在 20 世纪初通过保持较低的劳动力成本在竞争中击败了印度纺织工业。但有什么理由认为这个例子与美国当今的处境相关吗？</p><p>首先，当时的纺织制造业属于劳动密集型行业，这意味着在企业的成本计算中，劳动力成本显得尤为重要。 2020 年代的高科技制造业，例如半导体行业，是资本密集型产业——制造大量机床，然后为工厂配备知道如何操作这些工具的博士级员工。是的，你需要一些低技能工人来建立、清洁和守卫晶圆厂，并为博士人员提供午餐等。但这些人的工资不会占生产成本的很大一部分。你所面临的主要劳动力成本主要是你必须支付给超高技能工人的高薪；正如任何科技公司所知，这些工人并不倾向于组建工会并推动工资不断上涨。</p><p>我们特别应该看看中国做对了什么。中国不是全球高科技制造业的中心，因为劳动力成本低；事实上，它的劳动力<a href="https://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/global_labor_rates_china_is_no_longer_a_low_cost_country">不再非常便宜</a>，而且多年来它<a href="https://www.conference-board.org/publications/China-Competitiveness-Rising-Labor-Unit-Costs">一直不被认为</a>是特别低成本的生产国。相反，中国的竞争基于规模——由于其密集的供应商网络和训练有素的生产工程师组成的庞大劳动力，中国是唯一一个可以快速生产大量高科技产品的地方。与此同时，德国的制造业工资甚至高于美国，并且是众所周知的高科技制造和出口强国。

<a href="https://www.bls.gov/k12/productivity-101/content/what-is-productivity/what-is-unit-labor-cost.htm">单位劳动力成本</a>”——每单位产出的生产成本是多少。公司的生产力越高，其单位劳动力成本就越低，即使其工资确实很高。</p><p>当然，降低土地和监管审批成本是降低单位劳动力成本的重要途径。但改进技术和<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/american-workers-need-lots-and-lots">鼓励自动化也很关键</a>。在产业政策方面，我们应该考虑的真正权衡不是“工资与竞争力”，而是“工厂创造就业机会与竞争力”。产业政策倡导者不需要接受低工资；他们需要接受低工资。他们需要承认，制造业通过促进当地服务的<a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/multipliers.pdf">乘数效应</a>间接创造了良好的就业机会。</p><h4> 4.太阳能利好消息</h4><p>太阳能是您的朋友。它并不是一种比煤炭或核能更软弱、更不男子气概的能源形式。这不是破坏资本主义的嬉皮士阴谋。这并不是一个绝望的后退，让我们靠豆荚生活并吃虫子。这是<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/dont-be-a-decel">一场真正的技术革命</a>，是人类的聪明才智利用太空聚变能并将其直接转化为纯电力的现代奇迹。</p><p> More importantly, it&#39;s just really really cheap. Jenny Chase, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, has <a href="https://twitter.com/solar_chase/status/1718296328676032934">a great annual thread</a> where she assesses the situation of the solar industry. Here are a few choice tidbits from this year&#39;s thread.</p><p> A lot of people used to claim that we need a technological breakthrough in solar cell efficiency in order to make solar economically viable. This was never true — it turned out we only needed cost reductions — but in any case, we did keep increasing cell efficiency incrementally, and those increases added up. Chase writes:</p><blockquote><p> Incremental improvements in solar modules continue. 2023 was the move from PERC (module efficiency ~21.3%) being the standard design, to TOPCon (~22.3%). The average solar module in 2023 was about 21.6% efficient, up from 15.4% (a now-obsolete multicrystalline design) in 2012.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a pretty big increase!</p><p> Anyway, speaking of the cost declines, they just keep on happening. In 2021 there was a sudden small increase in solar costs, causing some people to think that the era of learning curves was over. But it was just a temporary bump from temporarily higher materials costs in the wake of the pandemic. Chase notes that costs have come back down:</p><blockquote><p> In October 2021, when the standard mono module price was 27.3 US cents per W, I said it would &quot;come back down over 1-2 years&quot; (referring to all-time low of 19 cents in summer 2020). Since it&#39;s now 13.6 US cents in normal markets (ie not the US or India), not too bad a call.</p></blockquote><p> As for whether levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is a good measure of costs, Chase drily notes that it&#39;s pretty much the only measure of cost that matters to utilities on the margin:</p><blockquote><p> By the way, LCOE is just a fancy way of saying &quot;the price you gotta pay someone for power to get them to build a power plant&quot;.</p></blockquote><p> Of course, if you keep building lots and lots of solar, eventually intermittency starts to matter more. Chase explains that this intermittency will manifest as low or even negative electricity prices during the sunniest parts of the day:</p><blockquote><p> After grid and land issues, the next big challenge for PV will be power price cannibalization. Basically, solar plants in one area all generate at the same time. This means that they reduce the price of power at that time, “cannibalizing” their own revenues…High solar penetration resulting in power price cannibalization also affects other power plants, but not as much as it affects solar, because solar plants generate most at times when solar is pushing the price down most. This will inhibit further solar build…By 2030 most countries will have spot power prices of zero for a few hours every sunny day.</p></blockquote><p> Intermittency doesn&#39;t really matter when you only build a modest amount of solar. But when you build an absolutely huge amount, like we&#39;re expected to do in the near future, it starts to bite a lot. But Chase is optimistic that batteries are going to be a pretty effective solution to that problem:</p><blockquote><p> It may well be that &quot;negative power prices for a few hours every sunny day, followed by high evening power prices when the sun goes down&quot; is a problem solved by capitalism and batteries…Utility-scale batteries became a thing much faster than I expected. <a href="https://twitter.com/YayoiSekine">@YayoiSekine</a> &#39;s team recorded 16.8GW/32.9GWh of gross energy storage capacity additions worldwide in 2022, and expect 41.9GW/98.6GWh in 2023.</p></blockquote><p> Anti-solar people also claim that solar won&#39;t have enough land to build on. This is probably an issue for wind, but for solar, Chase thinks it&#39;s not that big of a deal:</p><blockquote><p> There is enough land for lots of solar. There are enough golf courses in the US for about 370GW, ffs. There&#39;s also loads and loads of roofs…</p></blockquote><p> So anyway, that&#39;s all very optimistic stuff, and you should be optimistic too! Solar, together with batteries, looks like the first major step-up transition we&#39;ve gotten in electric power generation technology since the advent of coal itself.</p><h4> 5. What&#39;s destroying the humanities?</h4><p> A bunch of people got upset when it was reported that the University of North Carolina system <a href="https://www.wunc.org/education/2023-10-19/unc-system-state-nc-budget-3-7-billion-2023">will now give out</a> distinguished professorships only to scholars in STEM fields, and not to professors in the humanities. Some <a href="https://twitter.com/RebeccaSpang/status/1717887249679777940">took it as a sign</a> of the “dismantling of public higher ed in the USA”. I&#39;m not so sure it means that much, but I do think it&#39;s very likely that the shift away from an emphasis on the humanities will continue.

And the timing lines up with the Great Recession, which strongly implies that once economic constraints started to bite, America&#39;s youth became less eager to take a four-year voyage of intellectual pleasure and more focused on grabbing the brass ring.</p><p> But Bates College prof Tyler Austin Harper <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_A_Harper/status/1717935971985924576">believes</a> that the humanities have shot themselves in the foot by being “nakedly ideological”. He writes:</p><blockquote><p> [W]e&#39;ve created the conditions for what&#39;s going on at UNC. How did anyone think we could get away with being nakedly ideological for years without any chickens coming home to roost?..Universities have always been tacitly left-leaning and faculty have always been openly so, but institutions have never been this transparently, officially political. Almost every single job ad in my field/related fields this year has some kind of brazenly politicized language…</p><p> An example. Here&#39;s language from a current lit job ad: &quot;We see this position as building on recent hiring in the English department in decolonial and anti-racist pedagogies and practices as well as a recent cluster hire in research related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&quot;…Imagine if a public university job ad instead read: &quot;We see this position as building on recent hiring in the English department in traditionalist pedagogies and practices as well as a recent cluster hire in research related to pro-life ethics, nationalism, and family values.&quot;</p><p> …This is about universities shamelessly embracing, as their official institutional posture, an openly ideological framework/stance.</p></blockquote><p> Color me skeptical. While I do think that conservatives and red-state politicians are very mad at this ideological shift in humanities academia — and I agree with Harper that they have a right to be upset — I doubt that this is driving kids&#39; desire to avoid these majors. Young people are the ones who choose what to major in, not Republican politicians, and the young generation has a <em>lot</em> of lefties. I doubt very much that faculty job descriptions with “diversity, equity, and inclusion” in their names are what&#39;s making kids avoid history and English majors like the plague.</p><p> Instead, my guess is that the ideological shift in humanities academia is more an effect of the sector&#39;s shrinkage than the cause of it. As all the money and opportunity in humanities academia dries up, people who care about living a decent life and having a well-paying job drift away from the profession. Who does that leave in humanities departments? People who obsessively love their research, of course, but also committed ideologues. So those ideologues will have proportionately more and more sway over hiring and over the culture of the field as a whole.</p><p> Of course, humanities departments that become more ideological may be more likely to provoke conservative officials to cut their budgets more. But I think the collapse in humanities majors has to be regarded as the likeliest culprit for the shift here. So although I&#39;d personally like to see humanities departments be less ideological, I doubt this will save them from decline. The only thing that will save them, I predict, is if the US economy returns to a state in which young people are confident that they can get a good job no matter what they major in.</p><p> So basically, humanities profs who want to save their fields should be strong proponents of a pro-growth economic agenda. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-ae2?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-ae2?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p> ]]>;

I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not — Muslim countries seem likely to be at least annoyed with the US, but <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/25/pro-israel-rallies-allowed-in-india-but-palestine-solidarity-sees-crackdown">India seems</a> more on the pro-Israel side.

UNCTAD&#39;s website basically says that their present categorization is based on the categories that people used in the past:</p><blockquote><p> This categorization is based on a distinction between developing and developed regions that was commonly used in the past (see <a href="https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/papers/27082814/8">Hoffmeister, 2020</a> ) and is maintained by UNSD with the understanding that being part of either developed or developing region is through sovereign decision of a state (see the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/">M49 website</a> ).</p></blockquote><p> But that makes no sense. The whole idea of a “developing” country is that it&#39;s <em>developing</em> , which means at some point it can become <em>developed</em> . So freezing in the categories of the past makes no sense. Anyway, <a href="https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/papers/27082814/8/read">Hoffmeister&#39;s 2020 paper</a> doesn&#39;t provide much enlightenment here, making some hand-wavey justifications based on which countries have colonial pasts and which don&#39;t (though again, South Korea breaks this mold, and Thailand and Iran never colonized, etc.). It&#39;s only once we go to <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/">the UN&#39;s “M49” website</a> that we find some plausible answers:</p><blockquote><p> There is no definition of developing and developed countries (or areas) within the UN system. However, in 1996 the distinction between “Developed regions” and “Developing regions” was introduced to the Standard country or area codes for statistical use (known as M49). These groupings were intended solely for statistical convenience at the time and did not express a judgement about any country&#39; or area&#39;s stage of development. Over time the use of the distinction between &quot;Developed regions&quot; and &quot;Developing regions&quot;, including in the flagship publications of the United Nations, has diminished. Since 2017, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) report and the statistical annex to the Secretary General&#39;s annual report on SDGs progress uses only geographic regions without referring to the two groupings of developed and developing regions. Therefore, following consultation with other international and supranational organizations active in official statistics, the “Developed regions” and “Developing regions” were removed from the &quot;Other groupings&quot; of the M49 in December 2021.</p><p> Following its removal from M49, several users expressed the need to maintain the distinction of developed and developing regions based on the understanding that <strong>being part of either developed or developing region is through sovereign decision of a state</strong> . Therefore, a file was created that contains an updated classification of developed and developing regions as of May 2022, in addition to the historical classification of December 2021…The updated classification reflects a recent action by the Republic of Korea to be considered part of developed regions. (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote><p> So now I think we have an answer. The UN didn&#39;t actually want to draw a distinction between developing and developed countries, and they&#39;ve tried to remove the classification entirely. But certain countries keep insisting that the distinction be maintained. And whether a country gets included in the “developed” or “developing” blocs is basically at the request of that country&#39;s government. South Korea wants the UN to call it a “developed” country, while Singapore, for all its fabulous wealth and high technology, wishes to be called a “developing” country.</p><p> One presumes these desires are political in nature. Singapore, a tiny city-state, has to maintain good relationships with the poorer countries of Southeast Asia that surround it, and so would rather not be singled out from them. Turkey and Malaysia probably have similar imperatives. But South Korea would prefer to advertise its successful development on the world stage.</p><p> Anyway, this whole investigation might seem excessively punctilious, but the key point is that the notion of the Global South and Global North is inherently a <em>geopolitical</em> one. Much of it has to do with the politics of decolonization, which played out well before I was born. The notion of former European colonies as a geopolitical bloc — embodied by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> , “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-Worldism">Third Worldism</a> ”, etc. — left its mark on a lot of these economic categories.</p><p> But I think it is possible to classify the world&#39;s economies in a more useful way.

And Sub-Saharan Africa is mostly poor and stagnant, with a few exceptions at the southern tip and the west coast.</p><p> It&#39;s not hard to tell what separates the fast-growing countries from the stagnant ones — it&#39;s <em>manufacturing</em> . If you look at <a href="https://oec.world/">which goods these countries export</a> — which is a good proxy for what they specialize in — you&#39;ll see that the fast-growing countries almost all export manufactured goods, while the stagnant ones mostly export natural resources like fossil fuels, minerals, and agricultural products. Economic research <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176520304420">shows this correlation</a> clearly.</p><p> And economic theory gives us a clear reason why manufacturing-based economies should grow faster than resource-based ones: <em>productivity.</em> There&#39;s lots of scope to improve the productivity of manufacturing, especially if you&#39;re not near the frontier yet. But there&#39;s just not much scope to improve the productivity of resource extraction (especially because the extraction is often done by foreign companies whose technology is already cutting-edge).</p><p> Resource exporters can do lots of things to improve their GDP — stable governance, a good business climate for local services, etc. — but ultimately their space for growth is more limited. And even the most well-governed resource-based economies will be limited by their population sizes — if your country has hundreds of millions of people like Nigeria does, resource rents will be stretched thin, while if you have only a few million people like Norway, there will be more to go around.</p><p> In other words, there are basically four Global Souths. I think I&#39;ll give them names:</p><ol><li><p> <strong>The mostly-developed countries</strong> : Industrialized countries that are on the cusp of developed status, and are only thought of as “developing” for historical or political reasons. These include Turkey, Malaysia, and arguably China, Thailand and Mexico.</p></li><li><p> <strong>The industrializing countries</strong> : Rapidly industrializing countries that are still poor or middle-income but are growing fast. There include India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and potentially the Philippines and Indonesia.</p></li><li><p> <strong>The resource exporters</strong> : Upper-middle-income countries that specialize in resource extraction. These include Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Iran, Botswana, Namibia, Kazakhstan, and so on.</p></li><li><p> <strong>The poor countries</strong> : These countries mostly export natural resources but either don&#39;t have enough of them to afford decent standards of living, or are plagued by war and/or poor governance. These include countries like Nigeria, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan, Sudan, and so on.</p></li></ol><p> Every time a country moves from the “industrializing” category to the “mostly-developed” category, the old dividing lines between Global South and Global North become a bit less relevant. Already, this process has turned the two-peaked global income distribution of the old colonialist world into something that looks much more natural: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg" width="648" height="918" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1445,&quot;width&quot;:1020,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:648,&quot;bytes&quot;:217567,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9315b962-86d8-4f6a-8508-6ddccbc02c40_1020x1445.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> Continuing this process should be the goal of development policy — for poor countries, but also for rich countries and international economic organizations that have an interest in a richer, more equal world. This means helping the industrializing countries escape whatever “middle-income traps” they find themselves in, and propelling as many of the poor countries as possible onto the escalator of industrialization. Industrialization is the means by which the shackles of the colonial age are thrown off; by this means we can build a world where nations respect each other as equals.</p><p> I fear that many on the political Left don&#39;t understand this. When I read <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2022/11/the-long-slow-death-of-global-development/">accounts of global economic development</a> by thinkers who lean to the socialist side, I often encounter nostalgia for the “trente glorieuses” — the three postwar decades. In those decades, most of the industrial growth happened in rich countries — the old “Global North” — and poor countries mostly exported resources to them. To people on the left, this relationship represents at least a partial rectification of the exploitation of colonialism — finally, the Global South was getting a fair price for their resources!</p><p> And sure, it was an improvement. But fundamentally, it still represented an unequal relationship — the Global North controlled all the high-value-added and high-tech parts of the supply chain, while the Global South mainly dug up rocks for them. Ultimately, that pattern of development was a trap for the resource exporters of the Global South, because it meant they could only rise as high as their resource endowments would allow them to. The stagnation of countries like Brazil and South Africa demonstrates that there&#39;s an inherent ceiling to resource-based development. (Many saw this trap and tried to break out of it, but only a few like South Korea and Taiwan succeeded.)</p><p> The decades since 1990, however, have been <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/economic-development-is-doing-ok">a much different story</a> . Manufacturing has finally spread beyond the boundaries of the Global North. It&#39;s not just a few countries like Turkey and Malaysia joining the party, either — China now manufactures more than the US and Europe combined, and the countries of South and Southeast Asia are rising fast.</p><p> I believe that despite the geopolitical <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/were-not-ready-for-the-big-one">disruptions</a> caused by the industrialization of much of the Global South, ultimately this will lead to a world that&#39;s both richer and more equal. And we&#39;ll know it&#39;s working because the categories of Global North and Global South will start to make less and less sense; the more ridiculous and out-of-date the old Brandt Line starts to look, the brighter the future will be. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/does-the-notion-of-a-global-south?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/does-the-notion-of-a-global-south?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p> ]]>;

So your friendly neighborhood econ blogger, Yours Truly, is here to bring it <em>above</em> the radar…or whatever the metaphor is. Anyway, here&#39;s some good news.</p><p> A week ago, the Fed and Treasury <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm">released its 2022 data</a> from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is a big survey they do every three years in which they ask households about their finances. Household surveys are important because they allow us to calculate things like <em>medians</em> — if you want to know how a household in the middle of the national income or wealth distribution is doing, you need to talk to a ton of households to find out what that distribution looks like. A downside of household surveys is that they take a long time to do (which is why the SCF only comes out every three years), so they don&#39;t give you up-to-the-minute information. Another downside is that you have to be very careful about which households you survey, in order to get a representative sample. But even with those limitations, survey data is hugely informative.</p><p> Basically, the 2022 numbers — which you can see summarized in <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf">the Fed&#39;s report</a> — tell a really encouraging story. In a nutshell:</p><ul><li><p> Americans&#39; wealth is way up since before the pandemic.</p></li><li><p> The increase is very even across the board, with people at the bottom of the distribution gaining proportionally more than people at the top.</p></li><li><p> Inequality is down, including racial inequality, educational inequality, urban-rural inequality, overall wealth inequality.</p></li><li><p> Debt is much less of a problem.</p></li><li><p> There&#39;s even some surprising good news about income as well as wealth.</p></li></ul><p> In other words, a rising tide is lifting all boats. I know it can be tough to believe that, with all the doom and gloom you see in the media, but the numbers speak for themselves. And just so you know, all the numbers I give in this post are adjusted for inflation, so don&#39;t worry about that.</p><h4> First, the good news</h4><p> The biggest piece of good news is that the typical American family got about 37% richer between 2019 and 2022: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg" width="528" height="555" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:555,&quot;width&quot;:528,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:57737,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6439e8a3-168b-4c9c-bcfd-0d04b8ec83e9_528x555.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Source: <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf">FRB</a></figcaption></figure></div><p> The fact that the dark blue bar increases by more than the light blue bar means that inequality went down. This was also true in the late 2010s, but wealth increased more slowly in those years. So the early 2020s have been quite a bonanza.</p><p> (Note that the SCF&#39;s definition of “family” is actually very close to the Census Bureau&#39;s definition of “household”, which is what you usually see quoted in these statistics. So while normally I wouldn&#39;t use these terms interchangeably, here I will.)</p><p> This translates to an increase in wealth of about $51,800 for the median American household over three years. Not bad! Median family net worth is now about $192,900. This is much higher than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult">Credit Suisse&#39;s prediction</a> , and would put the US at 6th or 7th in the world.</p><p> Even more amazing is how even the increases have been — it really is all across the board.

The reason I didn&#39;t include them is because they were so big — the increases were 143% and 900%, respectively.</p><p> <em>900%?</em> How is that even possible? The answer is that the people at the bottom half of the distribution had almost no net wealth to begin with. In 2019, the typical household in the bottom 25% had a net worth of only $400, which increased to $3500 in 2022. That&#39;s still a very low level of wealth. But remember, it&#39;s a <em>net</em> number — the people without much wealth in the US often have a lot of <em>debt</em> , which cancels out the assets they own.</p><p> And a big reason that the wealth of the bottom 25% went up so much is that Americans are slowly getting out of debt.

Bond wealth increased by quite a bit — by about $70k for the median bond-owning household, which is surprising given that interest rates went up (which drives bond prices down). What must have happened was that Americans saved so much money that their bond holdings increased <em>in spite of</em> the rate hikes. Which means that if and when rates go back down, wealth will get pumped up even more.</p><p> (Side note: Whether bonds actually represent net wealth for society is a complicated question; someone is on the hook for that liability. But that&#39;s a topic for another day; from the perspective of a household, a bond is wealth.)</p><p> In fact, the increase in wealth despite interest rate hikes is an incredibly good sign. Remember that the value of any asset depends in part on the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp">discount rate</a> , which is how much you&#39;d rather have a dollar today vs. a dollar tomorrow. When interest rates go up, the discount rate goes up, which means assets are worth less. Remember the big stock crash in late 2021 and early 2022? That was probably driven by rate hikes. Higher rates also lower the value of bonds and — most importantly — houses.</p><p> And yet despite the fact that rates went from around 0% to over 4% over the course of 2022, <em>wealth still went up</em> . That means this wealth boom is very different from the increases in earlier decades, when rates were relentlessly lowered. Remember how for all those years we heard that the Fed was “inflating” or “propping up” stocks and houses and bonds by lowering rates and doing quantitative easing? Well, 2022 was the exact opposite of that. And yet the wealth gains didn&#39;t stall out.</p><p> That&#39;s a great sign for the future, because it means that if and when rates go down, Americans&#39; wealth will rise by <em>even more</em> . House price increases, in particular, are pretty clearly being driven by factors other than interest rates — <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/el2022-26.pdf">the shift to remote work</a> being the biggest driver, but also the Millennial generation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/17/millennial-home-ownership">finally buying homes</a> .</p><p> Now, one slight note of caution. A bit of the increase in wealth — about <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf/dataviz/scf/chart/#series:Owned_Vehicles;demographic:all;population:all;units:median">$8300 for the median household</a> — came from an increase in the value of used cars. A lot of people question how much of the value of a used car is actually wealth, because if you sell your car, you&#39;ll either have to take the bus, which is a much slower and worse experience, or use some very expensive service like Uber. (This is much less of a concern for houses than cars, because if you sell your house you can rent a really nice house instead.) So if you don&#39;t think a car is wealth, then the median household&#39;s gains were a little lower than the number I quoted above. But the basic story doesn&#39;t change.</p><p> Oh, and by the way, there&#39;s one more piece of good news as well. The SCF doesn&#39;t just ask people about wealth, it also asks them about income. The Census Bureau&#39;s numbers, which are the ones you usually see quoted in the media, say that <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N#0">real median household income</a> went down by about 4.7% between 2019 and 2022. But the SCF finds that <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf/dataviz/scf/chart/#series:Before_Tax_Income;demographic:all;population:1;units:median">it went up by about 3%</a> over that time period. I&#39;m not sure why the discrepancy exists (I&#39;ll check on it and get back to you), but the SCF is a very broad, detailed, careful survey, so I tend to trust it a little bit more here.</p><p> So anyway, the basic story here appears to be that Americans saved a lot of money since 2019, and the value of their houses and retirement accounts went up in spite of rate hikes. That&#39;s great news, and it suggests that much of <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/households-less-optimistic-about-finances">the pessimism Americans are feeling</a> about their finances is really more about the general unrest in American society and the scary stuff on the news.</p><p> But it&#39;s also worth noting that rising wealth does leave out one important group of people — the folks who are looking to buy into the system.</p><h4> The subtle challenge of broad-based wealth</h4><p> There&#39;s something subtle about the notion of broad-based financial wealth in a society. Most people think of assets — stocks, housing, bonds, etc. — as something that you make money from by <em>selling it to someone else</em> . But how can this work at the level of a whole society? If everyone has some of the same assets — if everyone has a Vanguard retirement account, a house, etc. — then <em>who can they sell those assets to?</em> How do you make money selling something that everyone already has?<em> </em></p><p>In fact, there are some answers to that question. They can sell the assets to foreigners, or to young people who get born and grow up not having any assets. But the more fundamental answer here is that assets generally do have ways of getting you money even if you don&#39;t sell them. This is called “fundamental value”. Stocks pay dividends, bonds pay interest, rental properties pay rent. Even a house that you live in gives you an income stream, though it&#39;s harder to see — it&#39;s <em>the income you get to keep by not having to pay rent</em> . That income stream is called “owner&#39;s equivalent rent”, and it represents the fundamental value of owner-occupied housing.</p><p> This is important when we think about house prices and house affordability.</p><p> A lot of people point out that when house prices go up, it makes it more difficult for first-time homebuyers to afford houses. The Federal Reserve&#39;s report makes this point as well, noting that the median home now costs 4.6 years of the median family&#39;s income, compared to less than 3 years back in the late 90s. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg" width="860" height="372" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:372,&quot;width&quot;:860,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:56160,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F298a23e1-2d34-4880-af47-24d56bc9ff95_860x372.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Source: <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf">FRB</a></figcaption></figure></div><p> This makes it harder for young people to buy into the whole housing system. Basically, they have to pledge more years of their future income — and come up with more cash as a down payment — in order to get a house today. Of course, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US">mortgage rates around 8%</a> make it even more difficult.</p><p> Now, that increased cost <em>might</em> be due to improved fundamental value. After all, houses are <a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/living/article/column-home-size-america-17738749.php">getting bigger</a> and getting nicer amenities. Those improvements increase the amount that you&#39;d be willing pay to rent the house, so they increase the amount you save by living in the house — thus, you&#39;re paying more, but it&#39;s because you&#39;re getting more fundamental value. Houses can also become more valuable just from being located in the right city — if your town becomes a tech hub, the house represents a convenient place to find a job, and that makes it fundamentally more valuable (though ideally, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Land-Big-Deal-wages-about-ebook/dp/B0BL8H6Y9S">this value should be taxed away</a> and spent on public goods or returned to the public as cash…but that&#39;s a story for another day).</p><p> So anyway, it&#39;s possible to imagine a world in which reduced housing affordability isn&#39;t a bad thing, because houses are getting better. But in the real world, there probably are some problems that result for reduced affordability.</p><p> First of all, young people looking to buy houses don&#39;t necessarily have the <em>liquidity</em> — ie, the down payment — to buy a house, especially in a pricey market like San Francisco. That can delay the day when young people get started building housing wealth, leading to <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-there-be-a-millennial-big-chill">generational frustration</a> and low fertility rates.</p><p> Even worse, if housing becomes pricier because of <em>artificial scarcity</em> — NIMBYs using local government regulation and lawsuits to block new construction — then the total amount of value that the housing stock is providing is not actually increasing. In this case, older generations are actually forming a de facto cartel to overcharge young people for houses, forcing young people to sacrifice more years of their working life so that old people can live high on the hog. And making houses artificially scarce means there&#39;s less housing to go around, which hurts the economy as a whole.</p><p> This is really the problem with using owner-occupied housing as the vehicle for a society&#39;s broad-based middle-class wealth. If you manage nationwide housing prices and supply over time like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-08/behind-the-design-of-singapore-s-low-cost-housing?sref=R8NfLgwS">Singapore does</a> , then it can be OK, but that&#39;s very tough to do. In the US, extracting more and more from the younger generations is often the quickest and easiest route to wealth for older middle-class homeowners. That&#39;s why some people look at rising middle-class housing wealth with ambivalence or even trepidation.</p><p> But I&#39;m not so worried this time around. First of all, young people who <em>do</em> buy in today stand to gain a lot — their wealth will soar if and when interest rates fall, and they&#39;ll also be able to refinance their mortgages. This will be true even if a big nationwide push for new housing construction — the YIMBY movement you&#39;ve heard so much about — manages to take the edge off of artificial housing scarcity.</p><p> In other words, the new SCF data has me feeling very optimistic about the state of Americans&#39; finances. I understand that the country is in a restless, divided state, and that there are scary things going on out there in the world. But the transition of most of the American population to a more secure financial footing is something to celebrate, regardless. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/great-news-about-american-wealth?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/great-news-about-american-wealth?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p> ]]>;

attack on Israel, <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/western-leftists-have-lost-the-plot">I wrote a very frustrated post</a> about how Western leftists, many of whom rushed to express solidarity with Hamas, had forfeited much of the moral high ground in American society. That post has now become one of the most popular in the history of this blog. But it left some people confused. Who are “leftists”? The DSA, certainly, but what about BLM? Or Bernie Sanders or AOC? Is Biden a “leftist”? Who exactly was I condemning, when so many prominent Democratic and progressive leaders had stepped forward to condemn Hamas?</p><p> It&#39;s a fair question. If you don&#39;t follow online political debates closely (and honestly, why would you?), the word “leftist” may not seem all that different from the word “progressive”, or even “liberal”. And even some people who do follow those debates don&#39;t know exactly where a writer like me draws the line. If you&#39;re going to complain about a whole group of people, it&#39;s important to be clear about who&#39;s in that group.</p><p> In fact, there&#39;s no official definition of who&#39;s a “leftist” — they certainly don&#39;t use that term for themselves. But in the years since Bernie Sanders&#39; movement exploded on the national scene in 2016, it&#39;s been intuitively clear to me that many of his most ardent supporters cared about a somewhat different set of issues, talked differently about politics, and got their information from a somewhat different set of sources than most progressives. They deeply resented the Democratic party establishment and were always talking about overthrowing it and taking over the party. They seemed to care a lot more about <a href="https://twitter.com/fedtanyl/status/1716231703587414422">student loans</a> and abolishing out-of-pocket health costs. They were often <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-left-nimby-canon">opposed</a> to new housing construction. They were more likely to call themselves “socialist”, and to have admiration for <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bernies-new-speechwriter-applauded-chavezs-economic-miracle">Hugo Chavez</a> . They seemed much more focused on foreign policy (especially after Biden <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/biden-is-triangulating-the-left">stole some of their thunder</a> on economic issues). They constantly called American an “empire”.</p><p> Above all, they seemed obsessed with <em>Palestine</em> , far more than regular progressives. There&#39;s nothing inherently socialist about the Palestinian cause, and there are plenty of other peoples out there who are also oppressed and who also deserve their own country. But the people I came to think of as “Western leftists” elevated Palestine far above all of those others in their pantheon of causes. It was the one thing that most clearly distinguished them from progressives. I never quite figured out why.</p><p> Now I think I&#39;m starting to understand a bit better. In <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/quit-dsa-gaza-israel/">a post about why he quit the DSA</a> , Maurice Isserman explains that Palestine became a wedge issue that extremist “entryists” used to muscle out more moderate members:</p><blockquote><p> As the new hard-line caucuses gained influence, the issue of Palestine became ever more important in DSA&#39;s internal political culture…[Israel&#39;s repression of Palestinians] doesn&#39;t account for the singularly important role of Palestine in DSA&#39;s rather short list of international concerns, completely overshadowing the attention paid, for example, to Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, or to the rights of other oppressed peoples, like the Kurdish Muslims, or China&#39;s Uyghur Muslims. Concern for Palestine, entirely legitimate in itself, also served other purposes for DSA&#39;s new sectarian leadership, furnishing a convenient stick to beat DSA&#39;s moderate wing if it wasn&#39;t willing to embrace the most extreme positions on the Palestinian question—up to and including denying Israel&#39;s right to continued existence…</p><p> Starting as far back as the 2017 national convention, chants of “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free” began to be heard at DSA gatherings, and support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel became a litmus test within the organization for political purity. For the sectarians, discrediting elected DSAers who fail that test helps to move the organization closer to the desired break with the Democratic Party.</p></blockquote><p> This makes a lot of sense. Palestine wasn&#39;t just a liberation struggle that the Democratic establishment had deemphasized because of the US alliance with Israel; it was also a perfect wedge issue, because principled (and thus moderate) socialists would be turned off by Hamas&#39; clear genocidal intent.</p><p> But even before Hamas&#39; attack on October 7, it had become clear to me that something was broken in the Western leftist&#39;s worldview. A lot of little things added up — their willingness to blame NATO for Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, their obsession with unworkable economic policies that seemed crafted to provoke pushback from establishment Democrats, their insistence that America is an oligarchy instead of a true democracy, their embrace of NIMBYism, their flirtation with degrowth and with fringe economic theories, and so on. In April of 2022 <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-american-socialist-worldview">I wrote a post</a> expressing exasperation with the whole American leftist project. I didn&#39;t even mention Palestine. But already, I knew something was off.</p><p> Anyway, here is that post, which I think has aged fairly well.</p><div><hr></div><p> I was extremely annoyed to see Noam Chomsky urging Ukraine to make concessions to Russia, in <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/04/noam-chomsky-on-how-to-prevent-world-war-iii">a recent interview in Current Affairs</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;m not criticizing Zelensky; he&#39;s an honorable person and has shown great courage. You can sympathize with his positions. But you can also pay attention to the reality of the world. And that&#39;s what it implies. I&#39;ll go back to what I said before: there are basically two options. One option is to pursue the policy we are now following, to quote Ambassador Freeman again, to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. And yes, we can pursue that policy with the possibility of nuclear war. Or we can face the reality that the only alternative is a diplomatic settlement, which will be ugly—it will give Putin and his narrow circle an escape hatch…We know the basic framework is neutralization of Ukraine, some kind of accommodation for the Donbas region, with a high level of autonomy, maybe within some federal structure in Ukraine.</p></blockquote><p> The arrogance of this kind of armchair quarterbacking is breathtaking — an American public intellectual dictating territorial and diplomatic concessions to Ukraine. Chomsky uses the word “we” to describe the parties that he imagines will make these concessions to Russia, but the first person pronoun is totally unwarranted — it is 100% Ukraine&#39;s decision how much of their territory and their people to surrender to an invader who is engaging in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html">mass murder</a> , <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/rape-weapon-ukraine-war-crime-sexual-violence">mass rape</a> , and mass removal to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/reports-russians-deporting-ukrainians-camps-troubles-stalin-survivors-rcna21456">concentration camps</a> in the areas it has conquered. It is 0% Noam Chomsky&#39;s decision.</p><p> It would be nice to think that Chomsky is just getting very old here (he&#39;s 93!). But sadly, this is milder than things he&#39;s done in the past.

It has not. But I would expect better of the socialists than of the rightists — or perhaps I should say that I would <em>hope</em> for better. That — and the fact that people who sympathize with socialism are probably a lot more likely to read my blog than people who sympathize with Trumpism — is why I&#39;m taking the time to vent my exasperation with socialists instead of ranting on and on about why Tucker Carlson &amp; co. are bad.</p><p> Before the war hit, socialists were sort of <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/biden-is-triangulating-the-left?s=w">pivoting to foreign policy</a> . Their domestic economic agenda had been mostly superseded by the Biden administration&#39;s bold initiatives — and when those bold initiatives were rejected by Joe Manchin and received only lukewarm support in the polls, it showed that a President Sanders would have fared no better. Foreign policy, however, is an area where there&#39;s a lot more agreement between mainstream liberals and conservatives, and so presents a more attractive wedge issue that socialists can use to denounce establishment Democrats. And the battle against the Iraq War was one of the main things that revived the American socialist movement, so it made sense to play to their strengths.</p><p> Then two things derailed that pivot. The first was Biden&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan, which put an end to America&#39;s post-9/11 “forever wars” in Muslim countries. Next, the war in Ukraine cast the US and NATO firmly in the good-guy role, swooping in to give the plucky Ukrainians the tools to defend themselves against imperialist aggression and atrocity. Suddenly, socialists&#39; pseudo-Chomskian framing of foreign policy — that the world&#39;s wars are caused by US imperialism driven by manufactured consent and the greedy military-industrial complex — looked out of touch with reality, <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/1503758826461409287">even to socialists in Europe</a> .</p><p> And it <em>is</em> out of touch with reality. But it&#39;s not the only part of the socialist worldview that has veered dangerously into fantasy-land in the years since Bernie Sanders&#39; presidential campaign breathed new life into the movement.</p><p> At the center of the new American socialist worldview was a “theory of change”. It was almost impossible not to talk to socialists between 2016 and 2020 and not hear this phrase. In purely electoral terms, the socialist “theory of change” seemed to be that Bernie Sanders held a unique ability to unite traditional progressive constituencies with White working class voters of the kind who switched from Obama to Trump, all while energizing the youth to come out and vote.</p><p> But Bernie was simply unable to do this. In 2020 <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/how-bernie-sanders-lost-white-working-class/">he lost the White working class voters</a> who had flirted with him in 2016, while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/insiders-recount-how-sanders-lost-the-black-vote--and-the-nomination-slipped-away/2020/03/24/2b7b8b8e-685e-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html">never really managing to connect with the Black voters</a> who form the core of the Democratic primary electorate. Nor did the youth come out to vote. When most primary voters coalesced around Joe Biden on Super Tuesday and afterwards, Bernie supporters <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/bernie-sanders-anti-establishment-lost-voters.html">tried to craft a narrative</a> that they had been <a href="https://ifunny.co/meme/RD7m2uXT7">stabbed in the back</a> by an establishment conspiracy, instead of simply being rejected by the voters. The narrative did not take.</p><p> Another part of the “theory of change” was the idea of “shifting the Overton Window”. Instead of its traditional definition as the boundaries of public discussion, socialists reimagined the Overton Window to be the public&#39;s perception of what constitutes a moderate and reasonable policy. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/26/745034477/the-practical-reasons-candidates-talk-about-improbable-policies">The idea was</a> that by proposing very dramatic and extreme plans like Bernie&#39;s “Medicare For All” plan — which would have effectively abolished private health insurance and eliminated all forms of cost sharing, measures that go far beyond the systems used by European social democracies — socialists could then get a more moderate single-payer or public option system as a compromise. A few socialists painted Obamacare — the most significant health care reform since the creation of Medicare itself — <a href="https://www.wonkette.com/hey-remember-when-nancy-pelosi-killed-45-000-americans-by-passing-obamacare">as mass murder</a> , simply because it wasn&#39;t Bernie&#39;s plan. This was a theory of <em>negotiation</em> — demand more up front, and you&#39;ll get more in the end, even if you don&#39;t get everything you ask for.</p><p> This theory also failed. The phrase “Medicare For All” polled consistently well, but when the specifics of the plan were explained, poll numbers <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/428958-poll-voters-want-the-government-to-provide-healthcare-for/">tended to drop off sharply</a> . Ultimately, the socialists got neither their preferred health care plan nor any sort of compromise at all — health care was simply de-emphasized by the Biden administration and the Democratic Congress, and no one except socialists seemed to care. The simple truth is that the Democrats already spent a huge amount of political capital on one big health care reform, and the nation was not in the mood to repeat the trick. The socialists asked for the moon and got nothing at all.</p><p> The third part of American socialists&#39; “theory of change” was a theory of power. Socialists allege that democracy in America is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Takeover-Corruption-Conquered-Government/dp/0307237354">bought and paid for by the rich</a> , and that thus we live in an oligarchy instead of a true democracy. (This bears more of a resemblance to the Progressive anti-corruption movement of early 20th century America than to a class-based Marxist analysis, showing that the American socialist movement&#39;s true roots are syncretic, but I digress.)</p><p> This may or may not be true, but as of now the idea that America is an oligarchy is a faith-based belief rather than anything grounded in evidence. The idea is often touted as a scientific fact, but in fact the empirical support relies entirely on one rather mediocre political science paper by Gilens &amp; Page that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study">doesn&#39;t actually say what people think it says</a> and is contradicted by most of the rest of the literature. I <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/yes-the-us-is-still-a-flawed-democracy?s=w">wrote about this back in December</a> :</p><blockquote><p> There are many more problems with the paper, so you can <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study">go read Matthews&#39; entire article</a> , and the three critique papers. But the statistics quoted in the excerpt above are already utterly damning for the Gilens/Page result. The whole model has almost no explanatory power at all — an R-squared of 0.074, for a model with that many variables, is nothing. And the fact that Gilens &amp; Page&#39;s data shows that policy outcomes tend to agree with the middle class as much as they agree with the rich completely destroys the claim in the tweet above — ie that “elected officials make policy to benefit the richest ten percent of the country to the exclusion of the needs of everyone else.”</p></blockquote><p> This theory started showing its limits when Bernie was defeated by Biden despite having a much bigger war chest. But the message didn&#39;t penetrate the wall of faith. When socialist candidate Nina Turner lost a Democratic primary campaign to an opponent she outspent 2 to 1, <a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1422755974050291712">she claimed that she didn&#39;t really lose</a> because the election had been “manipulated” by “evil money”.</p><p> In other words, this theory of power and oligarchy looks mainly like excuse-making — a way to explain socialists&#39; lack of popular appeal as the machinations of rich power brokers in an imagined smoky back room. Excuses like this might salve wounded egos, but they don&#39;t tend to lead to self-reflection.</p><p> But it&#39;s not just socialists&#39; theories of change and power that are broken. On specific public policy issues, they are far too eager to embrace faddish intellectual cults offering magical solutions.</p><p> One such example is “degrowth”. Though more popular in Europe than in the US, the idea that the world must address climate change by radically curtailing living standards has gained some credence here as well. This idea is dangerous nonsense, as more and more <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth?s=w">commentators on the Left are beginning to realize</a> . There&#39;s no planning structure that could manage a global degrowth agenda. But even if it were possible, the sacrifices in human welfare required would make it a non-starter in all the countries that matter. (Also, the “scientific” literature supporting degrowth <a href="https://twitter.com/simardcasanova/status/1507343225408872448">is of extremely low quality</a> .) Practically speaking, the only function of degrowth is to make environmentalism hated and reviled.</p><p> A second, even more worrying example is Left-NIMBYism. In response to the nationwide housing affordability crisis, many socialists across the country have embraced the theory that building more housing increases rents and causes gentrification. This is obviously a silly idea to apply at the national scale — if you don&#39;t build houses for people, they won&#39;t have anywhere to live. But even at the local level, <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-left-nimby-canon?s=w">the evidence is strongly against Left-NIMBYism</a> — building more housing holds down rent and usually decreases the displacement of low-income renters from a fashionable neighborhood. But as in so many things, evidence doesn&#39;t dent the socialist worldview — in a recent article, Nathan J. Robinson made the farcical argument that instead of building new housing we should <a href="https://twitter.com/tiredgenerally/status/1503836326117838851?t=xaeZklz6RAPK_2IiALxk5w&amp;s=19">simply build new cities</a> .</p><p> Now the Left-NIMBYism is beginning to extend to alternative energy as well. Although the Sunrise Movement — a darling of America&#39;s new socialists — started out as a promoter of the pro-growth Green New Deal, the organization&#39;s local chapters <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlcooper/status/1507052236618317824?t=glnD_Szvr1im9nR5-zxX1g&amp;s=19">now routinely oppose clean energy projects</a> . It&#39;s possible that Sunrise is beginning to follow in the footsteps of older legacy environmental organizations like the Sierra Club, who tend to <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/americas-top-environmental-groups?s=w">equate environmentalism with a lack of development</a> . This is, of course, extremely deleterious to the fight against climate change, which requires rapid deployment of green energy everywhere in the country. The organization&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1506331119171551244">foray into decrying high gasoline prices</a> certainly isn&#39;t a good sign.</p><p> This has become a pattern; time and again, America&#39;s socialists spend their intellectual and political capital on these vials of snake oil. It was only through <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/modern-monetary-theory-isnt-helping">the timely intervention</a> of more sensible socialist writers that the movement was saved from going all-in on <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-nyt-article-on-mmt-is-really">the pseudo-economics cult called MMT</a> . As for the opposition to Ukraine&#39;s self-defense, it smacks of <a href="https://fightback.org.nz/2015/11/05/against-campism-what-makes-some-leftists-support-putin/">pure anti-American “campism”</a> — the idea that anyone who opposes America can&#39;t be all that bad, even if it&#39;s a rightist dictator like Putin.</p><p> Sure, there are some good ideas in the new socialist movement, but they too often get lost and drowned out by the cacophony of fantasy. It feels like America&#39;s socialists are piecing together a sort of extended universe — a fantasy worldview as potent and immersive as anything dished up by Fox News, which offers the illusion of internal consistency but is actually just an outgrowth of what historian Richard Hoftstadter called “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics">the paranoid style in American politics</a> ”.</p><p> Which is a shame, for several reasons. Most importantly, the US <em>needs</em> a movement dedicated to fighting economic inequality, which has <a href="https://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2020JEP.pdf">gotten utterly out of control</a> . Within my lifetime it feels like we&#39;ve become far more of a class society, and socialism was traditionally the movement that fought for the rights and power of the working class. Even beyond that narrow imperative, socialist movements in Western societies have often provided important sources of dissent and independent thought. Even the subcultures I love, like punk rock, owe much to the (sometimes sublimated or submerged) dream of socialism.</p><p> I would like to think that the new American socialist movement&#39;s forays into the ridiculous and the reprehensible are simply growing pains. But looking at the even starker failures of Corbyn&#39;s movement in the UK and Melenchon&#39;s movement in France, it&#39;s difficult to be optimistic about this. Yes, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/axios-capitalism-update/">about half of young Americans say they like socialism</a> , but this won&#39;t necessarily stop the movement from turning into a kooky fringe over time — as an example, libertarian views in America <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-few-libertarians-but-many-americans-have-libertarian-views/">are quite common</a> , but almost no Americans identify as political libertarians. I can easily envision socialism following a similar path. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-american-socialist-worldview-4aa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-american-socialist-worldview-4aa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p> ]]>;

Increasingly, when I read about this war, it feels less like a typical Israel-Palestine blowup and more like an extension of <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-the-us-should-fight-cold-war">Cold War 2</a> .</p><p> But what does that even mean? I think of a “cold war” as basically a <em>model</em> — a framework for understanding world events. Think about the original Cold War. We say that things like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, or the US-supported coup against Salvador Allende, or Soviet spying, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinating_Committee_for_Multilateral_Export_Controls">CoCOM</a> , or the movie Rocky IV were “part of the Cold War”, but there&#39;s no hard-and-fast definition of what that means. Nobody declared the Cold War, or made policies that used that name. Instead, the competition between the US and the USSR was just a <em>mental framework</em> that writers and politicians and regular people used to make sense of what they saw happening in the world around them — a way to view many small events as part of one overarching big event.</p><p> In the same way, I think of “Cold War 2” as a model for how to think about a lot of the geopolitical happenings in the world today — and some of the economic and cultural ones as well. The Israel-Gaza war, and the bizarre and toxic discourse on both <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/western-leftists-have-lost-the-plot">the far left</a> and the far right in America, the sudden return of industrial policy and the reshaping of supply chains, and so on — can be understood as being at least partly outgrowths of the great-power contest between the US and its democratic allies and an authoritarian bloc led by China and Russia. (If you prefer not to think of these blocs in ideological terms, I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcVSgYz5SJ8">Sarah CM Paine&#39;s framework</a> of “maritime” vs. “continental” powers works just as well.)</p><p> This is one reason I&#39;ve been writing a fair amount about geopolitics over the last three years, and especially since Russia invaded Ukraine. So many of the economic changes we&#39;re seeing now, and which are being planned for the next two decades, are either being driven by Cold War 2 concerns or will have an impact on the outcome of Cold War 2. In a world where the economy becomes a key tool that great powers use to prosecute their conflicts, it&#39;s completely impossible to just “stick to the economics”.</p><p> Now, if the power of models is to simplify, the danger of models is that they can easily be over-applied (as <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-failed-economic-theory-of-everything">some macroeconomists have discovered</a> ). It&#39;s tempting to become so obsessed with Cold War 2 that you see a spy behind every tree, or a foreign propaganda message behind every bad take on Twitter. So I want to draw connections between seemingly disparate events while being careful not to accidentally prod people into conspiracy thinking.</p><p> Anyway, that having been said, let&#39;s talk a bit about why the big topic that&#39;s occupying the nation&#39;s mind these days is really about Cold War 2 — as is a lot of the other dire stuff we&#39;re seeing in the news.</p><h4> The Israel-Gaza war as a Cold War 2 proxy conflict</h4><p> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-lot-of-what-you-see-in-the-news">Read more</a></p> ]]>; </content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[America needs a bigger, better bureaucracy]]></title><description><![CDATA[They're from the government, and they really are here to help.]]></description><link/> https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/america-needs-a-bigger-better-bureaucracy<guid ispermalink="true"> https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/america-needs-a-bigger-better-bureaucracy</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Noah Smith]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 01:03:39 GMT</pubDate> <enclosure length="0" type="image/jpeg" url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg"></enclosure><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure> <a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg" width="975" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:139770,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a> <polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></figure></div><p> This is a picture of Deirdre Beaubeirdre, a character from the comedy sci-fi movie <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em> — an IRS auditor who hounds the immigrant protagonists mercilessly. I loved that movie, but I also thought Deirdre&#39;s character was emblematic of a common and unhelpful way that Americans tend to think about the civil service. Ronald Reagan famously said that “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I&#39;m from the Government, and I&#39;m here to help.” I think that antipathy toward government workers has filtered through to much of American society — not just to libertarians or conservatives, but to many progressives as well.</p><p> I believe that the US suffers from a distinct lack of <em>state capacity</em> . We&#39;ve outsourced many of our core government functions to nonprofits and consultants, resulting in cost bloat and the waste of taxpayer money. We&#39;ve farmed out environmental regulation to the courts and to private citizens, resulting in paralysis for industry and infrastructure alike. And we&#39;ve left ourselves critically vulnerable to threats like pandemics and — most importantly — war.</p><p> It&#39;s time for us to bring back the bureaucrats.</p><p> Aggregate numbers give a decent general impression of how the United States&#39; civil service has withered over the decades. This process began in the 1970s, before Reagan ever took power, and has continued to this day. The percent of American workers employed by the government rose through 1975 and fell thereafter, interrupted only by recessions (in which government employees were less likely to be laid off): </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png" width="1318" height="450" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:1318,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:78969,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> It&#39;s worth noting that much of this decline was at the federal level.

In other words, <em>state capacity is being outsourced</em> . But this graph doesn&#39;t actually capture the full scope of the decline, because it doesn&#39;t include outsourcing via <em>unfunded mandates</em> — things that the government could do, but instead simply orders the private sector to do, without providing the funding.</p><p> I&#39;m far from the first person to sound the alarm about this. John DiIulio wrote a book in 2014 called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bring-Back-Bureaucrats-Federal-Government/dp/1599474670">Bring Back the Bureaucrats</a> : Why More Federal Workers Will Lead to Better (and Smaller!) Government</em> , which is the basis for many of the ideas in this post and others. More recently, Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Center put out <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brinkpaper.pdf">a great report in 2021</a> called “State Capacity: What Is It, How We Lost It, And How to Get It Back”. A few excerpts from the executive summary:</p><blockquote><p> A series of calamities during the 21st century—the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, the financial crisis, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic—have made it painfully clear that American state capacity is not what it once was…On the right, healthy suspicion of rapid government expansion has given way to a toxic contempt for government and public service per se. On the left, efforts to expand “citizen voice” in government as a check on abusive power have produced a sclerotic “vetocracy” that makes effective governance all but impossible…</p><p> [The Niskanen Center is] taking on five new issues that we see as critical arenas for the struggle to rebuild state capacity: (1) expanding and upgrading the federal workforce, (2) improving tax collection and closing the tax gap, (3) overhauling how the federal government acquires and uses information technology, (4) streamlining environmental review to reduce delays and cost overruns in infrastructure projects, and (5) revitalizing the country&#39;s sclerotic public health institutions to better prepare for the next pandemic.</p></blockquote><p> This is in concert with Tyler Cowen&#39;s concept of “state capacity libertarianism”, which <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html">he outlined in January 2020</a> as an alternative to traditional libertarianism or classical liberalism.</p><p> Meanwhile, on the progressive side of the aisle, writers like Ezra Klein have begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/29/opinion/biden-liberalism-infrastructure-building.html">focus on low state capacity</a> as a reason why it&#39;s hard for progressives to accomplish their objectives.

Here are just a few of the reasons why.</p><h4> Bureaucrats vs. NEPA</h4><p> Maybe this is just my personal experience, but I find that when Americans say the word “bureaucracy”, they tend to mean “a bunch of regulations and red tape”, rather than “the civil service”. This sets up an implicit dichotomy between private-sector individuals and companies that just want to do their thing, and civil servants who work tirelessly to enforce rules that prevent them from doing their thing.</p><p> For example, this is the depiction of environmental regulation in the movie <em>Ghostbusters</em> (another of my favorites). Our heroes have set up a private business trapping and imprisoning dangerous ghosts. Then Walter Peck, a bureaucrat from the Environmental Protection Agency, shows up and tells them that the rules forbid them from doing this, eventually managing to shut them down (which causes a citywide catastrophe). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg" width="1000" height="563" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:563,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72751,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> This is also <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Agency">the depiction</a> of environmental regulation in <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> , in which the EPA tries to stop pollution by sending an army to take over Springfield and encasing it in a giant dome.</p><p> But in fact, this is not actually how the most cumbersome environmental regulation works in America! Instead, we have <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-big-nepa-roundup">laws like NEPA</a> and its stronger state-level equivalents like CEQA, which farm out the job of environmental regulation to citizens and the courts. <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-nepa-works">The way it works</a> is this: A developer starts work on a project, like a solar plant or an apartment complex. Then private citizens who don&#39;t want that project in their backyards — because of concern over scenic views, or property values, or “neighborhood character”, or whatever — sue the developer in court. Even if the project satisfies all relevant environmental laws from day 1, citizens can sue the developer under NEPA or CEQA to force it to stop the project and complete a cumbersome environmental review — basically, a ton of paperwork. This often delays the project for years, and drives up costs immensely — which of course discourages many developers from even trying to build anything in the first place.</p><p> Enforcing environmental regulation via judicialized procedural review has had devastating consequences on <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-build-nothing-country">America&#39;s ability to build the thing we need</a> . Housing projects are routinely <a href="https://twitter.com/drvolts/status/1699274424854401281">held up by NIMBYs</a> using environmental review laws to sue developers, often under the most ridiculous of pretexts (such as labeling human noise from apartment complexes <a href="https://calmatters.org/housing/2023/08/ceqa-noise-pollution/">a form of pollution</a> ). The solar plants and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1704574665568498082?t=xePZeWVvwSihO7L6WpCDNw&amp;s=19">battery factories</a> and <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31377/w31377.pdf">transmission lines</a> that we need to decarbonize our economy <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1700240332070244609">aren&#39;t getting built</a> nearly as fast as they should, because they&#39;re getting held up by these review laws. And remember that most of these projects aren&#39;t violating any environmental review laws in the first place — the NIMBYs have the right to sue and hold up development <em>regardless of whether any regulation is actually being violated!</em></p><p> Which raises an obvious question: How can we <em>know</em> if no environmental regulation is being violated, other than waiting for a lawsuit and a multi-year environmental review? The answer is: <strong>bureaucrats.</strong> The answer is that you have a bunch of government workers examine the project and make sure it checks all the relevant regulatory boxes, and then if it does, you simply allow the project to go ahead, without lawsuits or multi-year studies. This is called “ <a href="https://www.citystructure.com/blog/what-is-ministerial-approval-process">ministerial approval</a> ” or “ministerial review”. This is how Japan does things, which is why they&#39;ve been able to <a href="https://jamesjgleeson.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/how-tokyo-built-its-way-to-abundant-housing/">build enough housing</a> to keep rent affordable.</p><p> NIMBYs are absolutely <em>terrified</em> of ministerial review. I strongly encourage you to read <a href="https://twitter.com/cafedujord/status/1715778140595970228">this thread</a> by Jordan Grimes, detailing the dismay of a NIMBY pressure group at a raft of new pro-housing laws in California. The <a href="https://twitter.com/cafedujord/status/1715783029975859585">most terrifying prospect</a> , for the opponents of new housing, turns out to be “as-of-right” development, which means a bureaucrat gets to decide whether to allow a housing project rather than a lawsuit and a judge.</p><p> In other words, environmental regulation doesn&#39;t threaten America&#39;s economy via a sea of red tape enforced by an army of punctilious bureaucrats. It threatens America&#39;s economy via a plague of lawsuits and pointless paperwork that we implemented <em><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article-abstract/32/3/610/6380787">as an alternative</a> to hiring an army of punctilious bureaucrats</em> . If we scrapped this legalistic permitting regime and replaced it with an army of bureaucrats, we would still be able to protect the environment just fine, but we would be able to do it without causing insane multi-year delays and driving costs to the moon.</p><p> The nine most terrifying words in the English language are not “I&#39;m from the Government and I&#39;m here to help”. Nine far more terrifying words are: “Please spend four years completing your Environmental Impact Statement.”</p><h4> Bureaucrats vs. nonprofits and consultants</h4><p> Even as environmental regulation has been outsourced to the courts, a huge variety of other government functions have been outsourced to nonprofits. In a post back in May, I argued that this represented a toxic compromise between anti-government conservatives who wanted to shrink the state and progressives who wanted to increase community input into policymaking: </p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;be4837ba-d71f-4ff8-aebe-03b9130a96cb&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;This Friday, the internet was treated to a highly amusing spectacle: &#8220;La Sombrita&#8221;, a new piece of infrastructure created by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the nonprofit Kounkuey Design Initiative:&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nonprofits are sapping the progressive project &quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:8243895,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Noah Smith&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Econ blogger&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89fd964a-586f-461a-9f5a-ea4587d45728_397x441.png&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:10000}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2023-05-20T22:22:25.120Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe46358f-37f5-4e27-b83d-a6070206ff1a_1200x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/nonprofits-are-sapping-the-progressive&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:122705995,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:268,&quot;comment_count&quot;:98,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Noahpinion&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04281755-2cd6-42e5-a496-e69153abebb2_281x281.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p> Some excerpts from that post:</p><blockquote><p> We do know that <a href="https://learning.candid.org/resources/knowledge-base/how-are-nonprofits-funded/">about a third of nonprofit funding</a> comes from government purchases and grants, and that nonprofit revenue <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/nonprofit-statistics/">rose by about 70% in inflation-adjusted terms</a> from 1998 to 2016. A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation — $2.62 trillion in nonprofit revenue in 2016, 32.3% from government — says that this would equate to <strong>around $850 billion in government spending on nonprofits</strong> in the US</p><p> That&#39;s about 13% of all government spending, including state and local, spent via nonprofits. Compare that to about 18.4% of government spending spent on actual government workers as of 2022. We&#39;ve outsourced a significant amount of our government to nonprofits. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2022/07/06/nonprofits-critical-role-in-deploying-federal-investments-observations-from-the-transforming-cities-lab/">Here&#39;s a brief overview</a> of some of the ways this work is outsourced. Of course the number includes things like public university funding (universities are also nonprofits). But a lot of it is just paying organizations to administer government spending.</p></blockquote><p> Outsourcing government functions to nonprofits — which is definitely a form of privatization, even if no one is officially making a profit — has a number of problems. First there&#39;s the obvious danger of corruption, in which <a href="https://sfstandard.com/politics/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">nonprofits line their pockets</a> by using taxpayer money to help elect leaders who give them more taxpayer money. Of course this money is paid out in executive salaries rather than “profit”, but it amounts to the same thing.</p><p> But even more important is what economists call an “agency problem”. Nonprofits would rather get the government to give them as much money as possible; they would love to rip the government off. And if all the expertise involved in building housing or providing social services resides in the nonprofits instead of the government itself, the government <em>doesn&#39;t have the ability to judge whether it&#39;s getting ripped off</em> . Here&#39;s how I put it in my earlier post:</p><blockquote><p> When the government controls the purse strings but only the contractors know how much things should really cost, you get the worst of both worlds — a government that doesn&#39;t know how to save taxpayer money, paying contractors who don&#39;t <em>want</em> to save taxpayer money.</p></blockquote><p> This problem is especially acute in San Francisco, which <a href="https://twitter.com/bilalmahmood/status/1700549247979176134">makes it extremely difficult</a> to hire workers for the civil service, and has taken nonprofit-outsourcing to an extreme. (In fact, if you want to read a fun satire about nonprofit-outsourcing in SF in the late 60s and 70s, check out Tom Wolfe&#39;s essay “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Chic_%26_Mau-Mauing_the_Flak_Catchers">Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers</a> ”.) Investigations have shown that oversight of SF nonprofits has been <a href="https://sfstandard.com/politics/city-records-show-sf-failed-to-properly-monitor-nonprofits-that-got-millions/">extremely poor</a> — in part because the city got rid of the bureaucrats who could have done that monitoring effectively. Massive inefficiencies are allowed to fester for years, only coming to light after elected officials discover the problems and raise the alarm. <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/09/05/san-francisco-drug-treatment-audit/">The most recent blowup</a> I&#39;ve seen is over an addiction treatment nonprofit:</p><blockquote><p> A San Francisco supervisor is calling for an audit of the city&#39;s largest addiction treatment nonprofit after word leaked that a staffing shortage forced the organization&#39;s detox program to pause intakes last week…</p><p> HealthRight 360 is the largest drug treatment provider in San Francisco and is slated to receive more than $200 million from the city this fiscal year, according to a city database.</p><p> “This is not to cast aspersions on anyone, but I am truly concerned that we are paying for a service that they&#39;re not able to provide,” Stefani said at Tuesday&#39;s hearing.</p></blockquote><p> Of course this doesn&#39;t mean that bureaucrats always have the right incentives. With the wrong funding incentives, civil service agencies can fall into a trap in which they try to maximize the amount they spend each year in order to increase their budgets for future years. An efficient bureaucracy requires avoiding perverse incentives like that. But when the funds are being spent via nonprofits instead of government workers, the incentives are much harder to get right, because the government lacks most of the levers of control that it has over its own workforce.</p><p> Of course, the agency problems doesn&#39;t just apply to nonprofits, but to any government contractors. And when it comes to transportation planning, a huge problem is the amount that governments have come to rely on consultants. The <a href="https://transitcosts.com/">Transit Cost Project</a> has been looking into the question of why it costs so much more to build each mile of train in the US than in other rich countries (most of which have stronger unions). Their <a href="https://transitcosts.com/Final-Report/">big report</a> , released earlier this year, found that state and local governments&#39; excessive reliance on outside consultants rather than in-house bureaucratic expertise was a huge driver of excess cost. Here are some excerpts from <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/02/subway-costs-us-europe-public-transit-funds.html">a great writeup</a> by Henry Grabar:</p><blockquote><p> [M]any of the [transit cost] problems can be traced to a larger philosophy: outsourcing government expertise to a retainer of consultants…</p><p> For example, when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority got to work on the Green Line Extension, the agency only had a <em>half-dozen</em> full-time employees managing the largest capital project the MBTA had ever undertaken. On New York&#39;s Second Avenue subway, the most expensive mile of subway ever built, consultant contracts were more than 20 percent of construction costs—more than double what&#39;s standard in France or Italy. By 2011, the MTA had trimmed its in-house capital projects management group of 1,600 full-time employees (circa 1990) to just 124, tasked with steering $20 billion in investment. Perhaps the most notorious case in this business is the debacle of the California High-Speed Rail project, which in its early years had a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-high-speed-rail-consultants-20190426-story.html">tiny full-time staff managing hundreds of millions of dollars in consulting contracts</a> …</p><p> It&#39;s that lack of institutional know-how, of which consultants are both a symptom and a cause, that really hampers projects…It means staff are overwhelmed by change orders as projects evolve. In the case of New York&#39;s Second Avenue subway, the lack of a powerful, effective team of civil servants may also explain some inexplicable conflicts and mistakes: misunderstandings and feuds with local agencies, hugely overbuilt stations, and so little standardization that the escalators in the three new stops were built by three different companies.</p></blockquote><p> Would replacing some of these consultants with government bureaucrats really lower costs? <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4522676">A recent paper</a> by Zachary Liscow, William Nober, and Cailin Slattery suggests that it would:</p><blockquote><p> [W]e find evidence that state capacity correlates inversely with costs in a several ways. States with (perceived) higher quality DOT employees have lower costs. A state with a neutral rating has almost 30% higher costs per mile than one that rates the DOT employees as “moderately high quality”, all else equal. Consistent with the capacity hypothesis, states that flag concerns about consultant costs have higher costs. States where contractors and procurement officials expect more change orders have significantly higher costs. Frequent change orders could directly lead to higher costs through delays and costly renegotiation; they could also be a downstream symptom of poor administrative capacity at a state DOT—many contractors reference poor-quality project plans made by third-party consultants. Moreover, when we measure capacity using external data we show that states with higher DOT capacity have lower infrastructure costs. A one standard deviation increase in capacity is correlated with 16% lower costs.</p></blockquote><p> And <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31559">a recent paper</a> by Maggie Shi finds that when the government monitors Medicare spending more closely, it reduces waste by a huge amount:</p><blockquote><p> Every dollar Medicare spent on monitoring generated $24–29 in government savings. The majority of savings stem from the deterrence of future care, rather than reclaimed payments from prior care. I do not find evidence that the health of the marginal patient is harmed, indicating that monitoring primarily deters low-value care. Monitoring does increase provider administrative costs, but these costs are mostly incurred upfront and include investments in technology to assess the medical necessity of care.</p></blockquote><p> And guess who&#39;s responsible for monitoring Medicare spending? Bureaucrats. So that&#39;s at least a <em>2300% return on investment</em> in bureaucracy!</p><p> In sum, the years since the 1970s have been a massive experiment in whether a government, by outsourcing core functions to private actors like nonprofits and consultants, can increase the efficiency with which public funds are spent. <em>That experiment has failed</em> , and it needs to be reversed.</p><h4> Preparing for the next threat</h4><p> I became painfully aware of the problems of a weak bureaucracy during the early days of the Covid pandemic. I started a group to help encourage state public health agencies to improve contact tracing — an approach that ultimately proved futile due to hyper-infectious mutations. But back when the virus was less contagious and we still thought contact tracing might work, my partners and I had some meetings with government workers at the CDC. It was clear that they had absolutely no resources to commit to our project, and that they were overwhelmed with other demands.</p><p> Perhaps that&#39;s to be expected in the middle of a massive pandemic. But it was also clear that the CDC workers we talked to didn&#39;t know a lot of basic facts about how their organization worked; there was lots of data that they had no idea how to find, or even who was responsible for collecting it, and they had little concept of who was responsible for contact tracing at the state level. Those are things they should have known long before the pandemic even started.</p><p> In fact, the pathetic crisis performance of the CDC — which before the pandemic was often believed to be one of our most competent government agencies — is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/briefing/monkeypox-cdc-walensky-covid.html">the stuff of legend</a> . Most damningly, the agency was unable to collect even the most basic data on the spread of the virus — data that private individuals were <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">forced to collect</a> in its stead. In addition, it made numerous bad recommendations that were later reversed, issued confusing guidance, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2020-03-04/coronavirus-might-make-americans-miss-big-government">failed to develop Covid tests</a> in the early days of the pandemic. The agency is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02354-6/fulltext">now being reformed</a> , but it&#39;s not yet clear how deep the reforms go.</p><p> But what I&#39;m most afraid of is not another pandemic; it&#39;s a major war. In <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/were-not-ready-for-the-big-one">a widely-read post</a> last week, I warned that a war with China over Taiwan is a lot more likely than most Americans seem to realize, and that we need to be preparing for that grim possibility right now. China&#39;s state apparatus is famously effective in building large amounts of stuff very quickly — in the space of just a few years, while the US was failing to build even a small amount of high-speed rail, China <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/where-china-is-beating-the-world">built a high-speed rail network</a> that dwarfed American transit advocates&#39; wildest dreams. In a war situation, China&#39;s massive production advantage means that the US will be at a dramatic disadvantage in a protracted conflict. We do not have the equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Production_Management">effective bureaucracies</a> that we created in the runup to World War 2.</p><p> But even beyond military production, the US needs to do lots of preparation for the possibility of a China conflict. Private companies need to audit their supply chains to make sure they can sustain production in the event of a war. The US government needs to ensure that critical minerals can be accessed without reliance on Chinese processing facilities. And the government needs to revive the defense-industrial base, so we don&#39;t see bottlenecks of the kind we encountered when we tried to produce Covid masks, tests, and ventilators in the early days of the pandemic.</p><p> All of this requires a large, competent, well-funded bureaucracy. Yet I worry that neither progressives nor conservatives understand this need. Progressives still seem <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1700240330363228601">wedded to the idea of defending NEPA</a> , while conservatives still seem wedded to the idea of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/09/trump-desantis-republicans-dismantle-deep-state/675378/">slashing and burning any government agency they can</a> . It&#39;s a toxic equilibrium in which one side wants to drown the government in a bathtub and the other wants to outsource it to every NIMBY and nonprofit in the country.</p><p> To reestablish US state capacity, we have to sail between the rocks of both of these disastrous approaches. We have to rebuild the civil service, with sufficient long-term funding guarantees, talent, and size. For all our sake, we need to bring back the bureaucrats. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper"

<em>“No! Quite wrong! Open the gates!” — Baron von Munchausen</em></p><p> In <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-b4e">my roundup this week</a> , I endorsed Marc Andreessen&#39;s “ <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a> ”. I noted a couple points of disagreement, but overall I think this sort of uncompromising blast of techno-accelerationism is exactly the kind of extropian enthusiasm we need to shake us out of the doldrums of the gloomy 2010s.</p><p> But still, Marc&#39;s manifesto doesn&#39;t quite articulate how <em>I</em> think about techno-optimism; there&#39;s a good deal of overlap, sure, but I think there&#39;s a lot to be gained from reformulating the idea in my own words, so that when I say I&#39;m a “techno-optimist”, people know exactly what that means.</p><p> Well, here is what I mean.</p><h4> Different types of optimism: Positive vs. normative, active vs. passive</h4><p> When people use the word “optimism”, they can mean various things, so I think it&#39;s good to start with a taxonomy. First, when it comes to technological progress, there are basically two things you can be optimistic about:</p><ol><li><p> You can think that there&#39;s a lot of useful technology out there <strong>left to discover</strong> .</p></li><li><p> You can think that new technology will <strong>make the world better</strong> .</p></li></ol><p> Borrowing a term from economics, I could call these “positive” and “normative” techno-optimism.</p><p> It&#39;s obvious that these aren&#39;t the same thing. For example, I often say I&#39;m “optimistic” that there will be huge advances in autonomous drone technology over the next decade. But I also think that this will <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-u-s-test-intelligent-drone-swarms-in-race-for-military-ai-dominance-db361265">mostly be used for war</a> , rather than for civilian applications like delivering packages. Now that isn&#39;t necessarily bad news for humanity — a future where war evolves into robots fighting other robots in the skies could mean a lot fewer dead human beings. I&#39;m just not very <em>confident</em> that powerful new military technologies will lead to improvements in human welfare. What I am confident about is my prediction that these technologies are <em>possible</em> .</p><p> Positive techno-optimism is basically the opposite of <em>stagnationism</em> . In recent years, a number of thinkers have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728">started to say</a> that humanity has basically picked the low-hanging fruit of what the Universe can do, and that future innovation will <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">get a lot more expensive</a> — or even slow to a trickle. Positive techno-optimism says that no, there&#39;s still a lot of low-hanging fruit, and relative to our total GDP it&#39;s still not that expensive to find it.</p><p> Normative techno-optimism is different. It says that more technology will make the world a better place for humanity. In fact, this kind of techno-optimism is surprisingly rare — even some of my favorite science fiction stories are implicitly or explicitly built around the idea that no matter how our capabilities improve, humans&#39; fundamental brutish nature will never change. As far as I can tell, this very prevalent attitude comes from the World Wars in the 20th century, in which the industrial technologies that were deployed to improve living standards before 1914 were turned to destructive purposes. There are a few people who argue that more technology makes us better people — Steve Pinker made this argument in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a></em> , and I think it&#39;s the implicit premise of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barrayar-Vorkosigan-Saga-McMaster-Bujold-ebook/dp/B005BFIH7M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MX3BSKOH04L2&amp;keywords=barrayar&amp;qid=1697823068&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=barraya%2Cstripbooks%2C149&amp;sr=1-1">Lois McMaster Bujold&#39;s science fiction</a> .</p><p> So that&#39;s one distinction. For both of these, you can then define both <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em> forms of optimism. Passive optimism is basically just the belief that technology either <em>will</em> keep progressing at a rapid clip, and/or that it <em>will</em> improve human life, no matter what we do. Active optimism is the idea that technology will keep progressing and/or improve human life <em>only if</em> we humans take the appropriate actions to make sure this happens. Active optimism is what Gramsci and others have called “optimism of the will”. You could also call these “unconditional” and “conditional” optimism.</p><p> So you could define a little two-by-two chart: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg" width="778" height="594" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:594,&quot;width&quot;:778,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:67084,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> Obviously these aren&#39;t all mutually exclusive. For example, you could think that technological progress is inevitable, but that it&#39;ll only benefit humanity if we choose the right policies. Or you could believe that technological progress will only continue if we choose the right policies, but that if it does continue, it&#39;ll automatically be good for the world. Etc.</p><p> Personally, I subscribe to both positive and normative techno-optimism, but with reservations in both cases. I think there are plenty of new important discoveries out there to be made, but I do think it&#39;s likely that they&#39;ve become more expensive to find. I also think technology <em>usually</em> ends up making life better for most people, but that this isn&#39;t <em>always</em> the case.</p><p> In both cases, though, I&#39;m more of an active than a passive optimist. Whether it comes to sustaining the rate of innovation or making sure that innovations benefit humankind, I think that choosing the right policies is very important.</p><p> So let me unpack why I think these things.</p><h4> Techno-optimism is humanism </h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg" width="644" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:644,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:161274,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/emikusano">@emikusano</a></figcaption></figure></div><p> When Americans think of “technology” they tend to imagine some complicated piece of machinery — maybe something with a screen. But I prefer to think of it in the sense of the Japanese word 技術, which can also mean “technique” or “skill”. This is a much more general definition, and it&#39;s basically the way economists think about technology.</p><p> In economics, what technology does is to expand the set of things society can consume — in other words, it expands our collective set of choices. This doesn&#39;t mean it always expands <em>individual</em> choice — for example, in the age of the internet and cell phones, it&#39;s a lot harder to go off the grid. But if humanity collectively wanted it, we could return to a world where it&#39;s easy to go off the grid; the internet and cell phones give us the <em>option</em> to do this or not, whereas in 1960 we didn&#39;t have that choice.</p><p> The idea of increasing humanity&#39;s collective set of choices is closely related to the economic concept of GDP. GDP is defined by how much people choose to pay, in total, for the things we produce; in other words, it&#39;s just a measure of human choice. It&#39;s not a perfect correspondence, because there&#39;s stuff that GDP leaves out (leisure, inequality, and so on). But it&#39;s pretty closely related. This is why a lot of people talk about the benefits of technology by pointing to a graph like this: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg" width="1020" height="710" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:710,&quot;width&quot;:1020,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:85931,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> Of course, total GDP represents two things: <em>how much each person pays</em> for stuff, and <em>how many people there are</em> to pay.

It&#39;s not the same, since GDP doesn&#39;t equal resource use (something the <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/degrowth-we-cant-let-it-happen-here">degrowthers</a> consistently get wrong).

And in fact, these choices may change over time. As technology has progressed, humans have chosen to have fewer and fewer kids, and world population <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/humanity-is-going-to-shrink">looks likely to shrink</a> in the not-too-distant future. If that&#39;s what we decide we want, then so be it.</p><p> The main reason I think technological progress is usually good for humanity — why I&#39;m a techno-optimist of the “normative” variety — is that I fundamentally believe that humans should be given as much choice as possible. This isn&#39;t something I can prove with facts — it&#39;s just a moral intuition. I am a humanist. I see human beings wanting things, and I want to give them what they want. This doesn&#39;t always mean humans will be <em>happier</em> when they get what they want; sometimes we make choices that make us unhappy. But as a humanist, I believe my species has the right to choose.</p><p> But remember, <em>collective</em> choice is not the same as <em>individual</em> choice. Many choices that societies make go against the choices that individuals make — such as when society throws you in jail for committing a crime. Techno-optimism of the normative, humanist variety requires a belief that on average, over the long run, societies will make choices that result in greater individual choice as well — that some sort of liberalism will eventually prevail. So it&#39;s a bit of <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/is-the-end-of-history-back-on-track">a Fukuyaman idea</a> as well. It entails a belief that society — generally, eventually — does what&#39;s right for the individual.</p><p> That belief often doesn&#39;t pan out. The USSR invented quite a lot of important technologies, but it impoverished its people in pursuit of an ideology that ultimately proved itself to be anti-humanist. Nor do I think repressive societies inevitably fail — just look at China&#39;s economic dominance combined with increasing totalitarian control. In fact, China&#39;s use of new technology to build a new kind of digital totalitarianism is <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-super-scary-theory-of-the-21st">presenting a stern challenge</a> to my techno-optimism. But I suppose things are still much better there than during the Cultural Revolution or the centuries before.</p><p> I also worry that humanity&#39;s collective choices will hurt those who don&#39;t get a voice — namely, animals. We may ultimately become good stewards of the natural world, and there are definite moves in that direction in rich countries. But so far, our expansion of population and production has <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-is-the-sixth-mass-extinction-and-what-can-we-do-about-it">brought destruction</a> upon most of our fellow animals, because <em>our</em> choices are not the same as <em>their</em> choices. So that&#39;s something that tempers my techno-optimism, and it&#39;s something I think we need to fix.</p><p> But anyway, at its core, techno-optimism is a belief that humanity deserves to have more collective control over the Universe. And despite some reservations, overall I do believe that. I would not return the planet to the conditions of the year 1000, or 1800, or 1971. (As for whether I&#39;d return it to 2012, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">ask me in a few years</a> .)</p><h4> Why there&#39;s lots of technology left to discover</h4><p> I&#39;m also a techno-optimist of the “positive” variety — I think we have a <em>lot</em> more useful stuff left to discover. The reason I believe this is because <em>the nature of technology itself discourages humans from discovering it</em> .</p><p> Let me explain what that means. When one person makes a scientific discovery or invents a new manufacturing technique or whatever, they usually get some credit for it — a promotion and a raise, or some intellectual recognition. Sometimes they even get a huge monetary reward, if they build a successful company around their innovation. But in general, most of the benefit of a new innovation goes to other people who didn&#39;t spend any effort or money on discovering it. It goes to copycats and “fast followers” who copy or reverse-engineer or steal the new technology. It goes to other innovators who build on that discovery. And so on.</p><p> This is called a “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">positive externality</a> ”. In fact, science itself is very close to what economists would call a “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">pure public good</a> ”, except in wartime. And one thing economics teaches us is that <em>public goods are under-provided</em> ; the incentive for innovation isn&#39;t as strong as it should be. (And this is true for anything that has a positive externality, not just public goods!) Why should I spend my life in a lab discovering things that someone else will monetize? And so not enough people spend their life in a lab.</p><p> (This is what Marc means when he says that technological innovation is “philanthropy”. Obviously, philanthropy is wildly insufficient to solve most social ills, and by the same token, innovation for the love of innovation is wildly insufficient to propel technological progress as fast as it ought to go.)</p><p> Our society has developed a number of mechanisms to combat the problem of insufficient innovation. We give innovators patent monopolies to increase their financial reward (though this also harms some innovation by creating <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25713">patent trolls</a> ). We use the government to fund basic research — not just basic science, but <a href="https://www.itpro.com/technology/34730/10-amazing-darpa-inventions">applied stuff</a> as well. We give tax credits for corporate R&amp;D.</p><p> The reason I&#39;m an optimist about the opportunities for future progress is that I believe <em>these measures are still wildly insufficient</em> . <a href="https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/ijugr2h6/release/11">Plausible models suggest</a> that the economic return to increased R&amp;D spending, in terms of increased GDP, is still very high. Which means that if we spent more — or incentivized innovation in other ways — we would discover and invent a lot more stuff, a lot faster.</p><p> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">The evidence</a> that new technologies are getting harder to find is fairly plausible. In the 1600s, one person tinkering in a fairly rudimentary lab could discover fundamental laws of the Universe; that might still be possible now, but it doesn&#39;t happen much these days. Some new fields, like synthetic biology, are somewhat amenable to cheap innovation in a lone hobbyist&#39;s <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/bio2.0/the_promises_demands_and_risks/">garage</a> , but others, like AI, require vast physical <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-data-center-costs-linked-to-ai-demands-fc6adc0e">resources</a> in order to push the envelope.</p><p> But as new discoveries have gotten more expensive on average, our society has gotten richer, and is better able to afford the increasing expenditures required for continued innovation. That&#39;s why in the short term at least, I&#39;m optimistic that there&#39;s lots left to discover.</p><p> Of course, <em>this requires that we get the policies right</em> — the very same externality that assures me that there&#39;s lots left to discover is also the reason why <em>we might not discover it</em> . In particular, there are two things I&#39;m worried about here. First, I worry that political chaos and division in rich countries (especially the US) will make us less willing to fund R&amp;D — already there are worrying signs, such as Congress <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/chips-manufacturing-congress-subsidy">stalling the science funding</a> of the bipartisan CHIPS Act. And second, I worry that China&#39;s theft of intellectual property has reached such <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/five-eyes-intelligence-chiefs-warn-chinas-theft-intellectual-property-2023-10-18/">enormous proportions</a> that other countries&#39; return to innovation has fallen.</p><p> So I&#39;m a techno-optimist of the will, but we will need the will, and that&#39;s not a trivial thing to muster. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:285365,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/terrorproforma/status/1710130515477684610">@terrorproforma</a></figcaption></figure></div><h4> The “all hands on deck” approach to technological progress</h4><p> Because sustaining technological progress is so hard, it needs a whole-of-society approach in order to get it right. It&#39;s not something that can be adequately handled only by big corporations, or only by VC-funded startups, or only by universities, or only by the government, etc. etc. These different innovators all focus on different areas of technology and have different incentive structures, so <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25893">we need them all</a> .</p><p> And the <em>implementation</em> of technology requires <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPinkston/status/1714088788237180947">an even broader set</a> of institutions. It doesn&#39;t matter if green energy technologies get fabulously cheap if we can&#39;t get past <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-big-nepa-roundup">NEPA</a> in order to build them. The USSR was first in space, but their space program didn&#39;t really help their people (unlike America&#39;s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies">which did</a> ).</p><p> The array of institutions we need to propel technology forward is surprisingly broad. In his manifesto, Marc lists various “enemies” — not people, but ideas and institutions that he thinks restrict the growth of technology. Some of these, like degrowth, belong on the list. But some of his “enemies” aren&#39;t enemies at all, but important institutions that need to be co-opted in the drive for faster innovation. These include:</p><ul><li><p> statism and central planning</p></li><li><p> bureaucracy</p></li><li><p> monopolies</p></li></ul><p> I&#39;ve already talked about why important government is for accelerating technological progress, and if you think about this concretely, it&#39;s hard to think of a major technological breakthrough that didn&#39;t involve public-private partnerships. The Covid vaccines and the wave of mRNA innovation they unleashed are only the most recent example, but the Manhattan Project began the nuclear age (and government funding has been crucial for nuclear power), the Human Genome Project launched the genetics revolution, DARPA helped create the internet, and so on. The NSF, the NIH, DARPA, BARDA, NASA, the national laboratories…all have a storied history of propelling forward the march of innovation (often to the US&#39; great benefit). This is not “central planning” in the traditional Soviet sense, but it&#39;s certainly statist.</p><p> As for bureaucracy, this certainly can be harmful to technological progress, but if done right, it can be a great help. For example, look at what NEPA — a law that allows private citizens to tie projects in court for years doing cumbersome paperwork even if they already satisfy all environmental laws — <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-build-nothing-country">has done to our ability</a> to build physical technology in the United States. The alternative to things like NEPA is a <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brinkpaper.pdf">competent, efficient bureaucracy</a> that can quickly determine whether projects satisfy environmental laws, and approve them rapidly if they do. That&#39;s why more <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html">libertarians</a> are <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/08/state-capacity-as-an-organizational-problem.html">recognizing</a> the crucial importance of state capacity.</p><p> Finally, monopolies can certainly choke off economic activity. But it&#39;s hard to ignore the fact that many of our most important scientific discoveries and technological innovations — including the transistor and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf">generative AI</a> , two essential pillars of the information technology revolution — came from the corporate laboratories of big monopoly companies. Bell Labs&#39; history of innovation <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-dream-of-bringing-back-bell-labs">is legendary</a> , and someday Google&#39;s <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-industry-now-dominates-ai-research">dominance</a> of basic AI research will be legendary as well. Importantly, neither Bell nor Google, monopolies though they were, ended up reaping most of the benefits of the discoveries they made; because they were monopolies, and had a huge cushion of profit with which to fund research, they were able to temporarily ignore the externality problem of technological innovation, acting more like a government lab or a university than a profit-seeking company.</p><p> So anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by scrappy inventors in their garages, while government and big business merely parasitizes off of their labors, is deeply wrong. And anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by government planners, while the private sector merely parasitizes off of government&#39;s efforts, is also deeply wrong. The externality problem of technology is deep enough and complex enough where society needs an “all hands on deck” approach to innovation — our various institutions have to supplement and complement each other, each pushing the boundaries of technology in a different direction, and working together when applicable. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg" width="900" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:344405,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/terrorproforma">@terrorproforma</a></figcaption></figure></div><h4> Society is a UX for technology</h4><p> A depressingly large number of people seem to see technology and society as fundamentally in competition — a battle between amoral scientists and greedy techbros on one hand, and the forces of social responsibility and the greater good on the other. This worldview sees technologists as fundamentally a type of pirate, sailing the high seas in search of plunder while the navy of social responsibility chases them around.</p><p> To my mind, this way of seeing things is wrongheaded and highly counterproductive. The reason is that technology, as I said before, is a fundamentally <em>humanistic</em> enterprise — it increases the collective options available to human societies.</p><p> This means two things. First of all, it means that the fundamental purpose of creating new technologies is to empower society. If you&#39;re working on a new cancer drug or a new image recognition AI or a new semiconductor manufacturing process, what you&#39;re doing is giving society more choices — how much more cancer treatment to give people, whether to build better image search systems or implement universal surveillance, how much more compute to manufacture and what to use it for, etc. Which of these choices society makes is up to society; if you&#39;re an innovator, you&#39;re not putting power in your own hands, <em>you&#39;re putting power in society&#39;s hands</em> .</p><p> All the famous arguments for scientists and engineers refusing to build certain technologies — nuclear weapons, AI, etc. — were based on the idea that society doesn&#39;t have the ability to make good choices about how to use these things, and that individuals (the scientists and inventors themselves) are better equipped to decide. Once you invent or discover something, how it gets used is out of your hands, so the only way technologists can actually buck the will of society is by <em>refusing to innovate</em> . Innovation requires faith in society, while it&#39;s lack of faith ultimately leads to decelerationist impulses.</p><p> The second reason society and technology aren&#39;t separable is that <em>society is itself a technology</em> in the more general sense that I laid out earlier. Specifically, society is the user experience (UX) of other technologies; it determines how individual humans experience the power that technology yields.</p><p> To understand this, consider digital surveillance technologies. The United States and China have chosen to use these technologies in very different ways. In the US, you&#39;re likely to use webcams to keep track of your pet rabbit, or to film fun videos, or to stream yourself playing video games, or for various other enjoyable pursuits. In China you can do these things as well, but there&#39;s much less privacy when you do them, because the state is always watching. And on top of those individual fun uses, China has employed networked cameras to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1118105165/surveillance-state-explores-chinas-tech-and-social-media-control-systems">create a digital panopticon</a> where citizens are never free of the state&#39;s prying eyes. For the country&#39;s minorities, this panopticon is as terrifying as anything out of a George Orwell novel.</p><p> In other words, it&#39;s society&#39;s responsibility to use technologies for good instead of for evil. Sometimes this can take a long time to figure out — print media technologies like the printing press caused a lot of disruption and conflict when they were first introduced, and only with time did we learn how to use them responsibly. I expect something similar is happening with social media right now. It took many years to implement the labor regulations that make factory work tolerable instead of hellish, the consumer protections that made meat and cars and air travel safe for the general public, and the environmental regulations that cleaned up our air and water. And along the way our societies made many missteps (eg NEPA) that we&#39;re now having to fix.</p><p> But although this is a difficult process, it&#39;s an utterly necessary one. Technology&#39;s purpose is to benefit humans (and hopefully someday, animals and other sentient beings as well), and society&#39;s role is to figure out how to distribute those benefits widely. This is, of course, in addition to society&#39;s role in supporting innovation.</p><p> In other words, there is no boundary between technology and society.

In his manifesto, Marc identifies “sustainability”, in quotes, as one of the enemies of techno-optimism. But while he might be referring to people who cloak degrowth ideas under a false banner of sustainability, actual sustainability is <em>not</em> an enemy of techno-optimism. Indeed, it&#39;s a core part of it. Being able to sustain technological society into the indefinite future is, itself, a fundamental goal of innovation. And the way to accomplish that sustenance is almost always <em>more</em> innovation, not less.</p><p> Consider an imaginary simple little example — an economy that&#39;s just a small band of people and a grove of fruit trees that sustains them. The people can&#39;t digest the seeds, so the seeds either get thrown away or pass through their digestive tract and end up fertilizing new fruit trees, and the little cycle sustains itself. But then the people invent a technology that allows them to cook the seeds and digest them. This increases their caloric intake in the short term; if we were measuring GDP and consumption, we&#39;d see both go up. But because cooking the seeds prevents the fruit trees from reproducing, eventually the fruit tries die out and the people go hungry.哎呀！</p><p> What&#39;s the solution to this problem? Well, one fairly unhappy solution is <em>degrowth</em> ; people could simply not cook the seeds, so that they stay in the old equilibrium. But a better solution is <em>more technology</em> . If the people invent a way to intensively cultivate seeds into new trees, they can cook and eat <em>some</em> of the seeds today, and plant the rest in a controlled manner so that they can still sustain the orchard indefinitely. Technology got them into trouble, but eventually technology gets them out of trouble too.</p><p> In fact, this kind of innovation is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Surprising-Learned-Resources_and/dp/1982103574">very common</a> , and you can see a pretty close analogy here with fossil fuels. Nature gifted humanity with an abundance of coal, oil, and natural gas, but eventually these fuels get more expensive to extract — and that&#39;s not even considering the impact of climate change. Technology can keep extraction cheap for a while, but eventually that runs out. But if we use the industrial society enabled by fossil fuels to create more stable alternatives — solar power and eventually fusion power — then we&#39;ll be able to sustain and grow that industrial society for far longer than if we stuck with fossil fuels forever.</p><p> More generally, technological progress is all about tomorrow being better than today. If there&#39;s no tomorrow, today matters much less; the promise of an incomprehensibly bright future is a major reason we struggle so hard to innovate and push the envelope today. This is a point made forcefully and persuasively by Tyler Cowen&#39;s book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a></em> . We don&#39;t innovate only for ourselves; <em>we innovate for ourselves and our posterity</em> .</p><p> The enemy of techno-optimism isn&#39;t sustainability; it&#39;s <em>short-termism</em> . Humanity should not build new things to pump up quarterly earnings; we should build them so that our descendants, in whatever form they come, will own the worlds and the stars. And if we are to own the worlds and the stars in perpetuity, we must take care not to despoil them, starting with the one we now sit upon.</p><p> Techno-optimism is thus much more than an argument about the institutions of today or the resource allocations of today. It&#39;s a faith in humanity — and all sentient beings — propelling ourselves forward into the infinite tomorrow. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

Few people seem to care much about the 2 million people of Gaza — <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/what-israel-didnt-understand-about-hamas.html">not Hamas</a> , who tries to provoke brutal reprisals to win international support for their cause, not Israel, which talks of collective punishment and has blockaded Gaza for decades, and not Egypt or other Arab countries, who have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/palestinian-jordan-egypt-israel-refugee-502c06d004767d4b64848d878b66bd3d">refused to take in Gazan refugees</a> . The Gazans are isolated and alone, stateless and forsaken by basically the entire planet.</p><p> At a time like this, some people might see it as dismissive or callous to talk about the long-term economic future of Gaza. Perhaps it takes a terminal case of Economist Brain to look at a land in the grip of endless war and say “You know what this place needs? Some GDP!”. But I think it&#39;s an important exercise, because economic development provides a nation with a purpose other than <a href="https://criticallegalthinking.com/2016/01/20/fanon-on-violence-and-the-person/">the catharsis of violence</a> . And having that long-term vision fixed in place helps to make decisions about leadership in the present, too, because it allows people to ask “Which leaders will get us closer to that bright, prosperous future?”.</p><p> Nor is it unrealistic to think that in half a century&#39;s time, Gaza might be an economically flourishing place. Large swathes of Hanoi were <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/12/11/the-christmas-bombing-of-1972--and-why-that-misremembered-vietnam-moment-matters/">flattened by American bombs</a> in the 1960s and 70s, but fifty years later it looks like this: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg" width="694" height="462.892578125" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:694,&quot;bytes&quot;:234297,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F528a8495-7724-44a7-9258-09f839143b2e_1024x683.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> &quot; <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=112824732">Hanoi skyline at night</a> &quot; by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ntml4507&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Ntml4507</a> , <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=openverse">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></figcaption></figure></div><p> In fact, many of today&#39;s rich countries had periods in their history over the last century where they were laid waste by war and hobbled by repressive governments. They escaped those bad times, and perhaps Gaza can too.</p><p> Of course, that sort of development requires national self-determination, an end to major external conflicts, and long-term political stability. I&#39;m not sure anyone knows how to get those things for Gaza right now. But I think it&#39;s important to have a picture in mind of what the benefits might look like.</p><p> So here&#39;s a quick sketch of a vision for the economic future of Gaza. It starts with a quantitative goal: raising per capita GDP to $10,000 in PPP terms. I then speculate on a few industries that Gaza could target, using some other countries as comparisons. And I talk a bit about how migration could play a significant role. I don&#39;t mean to present this vision as an exclusive one — there are plenty of alternative approaches and goals, and this is far from a detailed road map in any case. But I hope this post will be enough to jump-start some thinking about better days.</p><h4> A concrete goal: Raise Gazan per capita GDP (PPP) to $10,000</h4><p> A lot of people, especially on the left of the political spectrum, criticize GDP&#39;s usefulness as a measure of human welfare. And sure, there are plenty of important things GDP leaves out (leisure, inequality, political freedom, life expectancy, education, and so on). But GDP is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/augmented-hdi-vs-gdp-per-capita">strongly correlated</a> with broader measures of well-being like the Human Development Index, and with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-daily-per-capita-expenditure-vs-gdp-per-capita">median levels of consumption</a> . If you increase GDP, your country is highly likely to be healthier, longer-lived, better-fed, better-educated, happier, and so on.</p><p> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/economic-possibilities-for-gaza">Read more</a></p> ]]>; </content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[At least five interesting things for the middle of your week (#17)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Techno-optimism, the mighty U.S. economy, Chinese real estate, slavery's economic effects, and the danger of hate on social media.

I&#39;ve been working on my epic review of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Progress-Thousand-Year-Technology-Prosperity/dp/1541702530">Power and Progress</a></em> , and it&#39;s getting…long. I also wanted to take an extra day to let people read <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/were-not-ready-for-the-big-one">my post</a> from Sunday. But anyway, there are a lot of things I wanted to blog about, so I&#39;ll do another roundup.</p><p> No new podcasts yet this week, but I do have one unusual request. As regular readers of this blog know, one thing I care a lot about in life is <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-rabbits">taking care of rabbits</a> . I like cats and dogs just as much, but rabbits don&#39;t get nearly as much attention, and as a result they often get treated very badly. My own rabbits were rescued back in 2016 from some guy who was trying to breed rabbits illegally in his garage, in absolutely horrible conditions.</p><p> Anyway, there was <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/evicted-backyard-breeder-abandoned-dozens-of-bunnies-rescue-group-says/">another similar rescue</a> in the Bay Area recently, in Petaluma — dozens of rabbits saved from very cruel living conditions. The rabbit rescue that originally rescued my own rabbits, SaveABunny, reached out and asked if I knew anyone who might be able to help. So if you&#39;re in the Bay Area, and you also like rabbits, and you think you might want to help take care of one, please email them at rescue@saveabunny.org, or go to <a href="https://saveabunny.org/">their website</a> , or respond to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SaveABunny/posts/pfbid02xBrjJC9BM5uNrpkgMLoKKD5ta2EdFXgarUGn2r23TiowMLNwEmyipcKQwgWNVmGNl">their Facebook post</a> .</p><p> Anyway, on to this week&#39;s Five Interesting Things.</p><h4> 1. Techno-optimism resurgent</h4><p> As you know, I&#39;m a dogged <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/techno-optimism-for-2023">techno-optimist</a> . I think we consistently underrate the power of science and technology to change our world for the better, and we underinvest in both. (You can expect my review of <em>Power and Progress</em> , whose central thesis is that techno-optimist ideas have deeply damaged our economy, to be a feisty one.) But there are people out there whose techno-optimism is so intense that it puts my own in the shade. One of these is <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/interview-marc-andreessen-vc-and">Marc Andreessen</a> .</p><p> In a new essay/rant called “ <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a> ” over at a16z&#39;s website, Marc lays out his vision. Here are a few points I&#39;d like to highlight.</p><p> First, Marc focuses squarely on technology&#39;s ability to bring <em>abundance</em> . And he appropriately frames abundance not just as “more stuff”, but as more <em>choice</em> in general for human beings, and more <em>control</em> over our world.</p><blockquote><p> We are materially focused, for a reason – to open the aperture on how we may choose to live amid material abundance.</p><p> A common critique of technology is that it removes choice from our lives as machines make decisions for us. This is undoubtedly true, yet more than offset by the freedom to create our lives that flows from the material abundance created by our use of machines.</p><p> Material abundance from markets and technology opens the space for religion, for politics, and for choices of how to live, socially and individually.</p><p> We believe technology is liberatory. Liberatory of human potential. Liberatory of the human soul, the human spirit. Expanding what it can mean to be free, to be fulfilled, to be alive.</p><p> We believe technology opens the space of what it can mean to be human.</p></blockquote><p> I couldn&#39;t agree more, and I think this is extremely well-put.</p><p> This is also a very important paragraph:</p><blockquote><p> We believe there is no conflict between capitalist profits and a social welfare system that protects the vulnerable. In fact, they are aligned – the production of markets creates the economic wealth that pays for everything else we want as a society.</p></blockquote><p> Degrowthers — whom Marc correctly identifies as an enemy of human progress — believe that there&#39;s an inherent tradeoff between human abundance and nature. This is a story of technology as fundamentally extractive, which fits neatly into a zero-sum worldview where prosperity is all about the extraction of resources rather than the creation of novelty. But Marc correctly realizes that technology is what allows humanity to <em>reduce</em> our natural footprint even as we create abundance for ourselves:</p><blockquote><p> Natural resource utilization has sharp limits, both real and political…And so the only perpetual source of growth is technology…We believe technology is a lever on the world – the way to make more with less.</p></blockquote><p> I also agree with Marc that culture matters. The last ten years have been a decade of unrest in American society, in which existing status hierarchies were unsettled and challenged across our entire culture. Because technologists and tech companies often make a lot of money and are thus high on the status totem pole, a fair amount of ire was directed their way. (The highest intellectual expression of that ire is the book <em>Power and Progress</em> , which I&#39;m currently in the middle of reviewing.) Marc&#39;s essay lashes out at these critics:</p><blockquote><p> Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”.</p></blockquote><p> Here I take a more balanced view, but still ultimately come down on Marc&#39;s side. Some of the ideas and institutions he lists as the “enemy” are useless, but many of them have some value. Sustainability, for example, is actually a goal of technological progress — as Marc himself acknowledges earlier. Existential risk is an important thing to worry about, which is why <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2052:_Stanislav_Petrov_Day">nerds celebrate the day</a> that Stanislav Petrov&#39;s judgement saved us from a nuclear war.</p><p> But Marc is right that most of the forces and institutions that have set themselves up as enemies of techno-capital were given extra force and virulence by the general climate of unrest in America (the unsettling of status hierarchies being what Marc, referencing Nietzsche, refers to as “ressentiment”). So Marc is right that it&#39;s time for a useful corrective — a general social refocusing on technological progress, abundance, and optimism.</p><p> There is one area where I might disagree with Marc, though. While he&#39;s right that markets are a crucial engine of innovation, I do think he underestimates the role of government in pressing science and technology forward:</p><blockquote><p> We believe central planning is a doom loop; markets are an upward spiral.</p><p> The economist William Nordhaus has shown that creators of technology are only able to capture about 2% of the economic value created by that technology. The other 98% flows through to society in the form of what economists call social surplus. <em>Technological innovation in a market system is inherently philanthropic</em> , by a 50:1 ratio. Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives? QED.</p></blockquote><p> But in fact, the second paragraph explains exactly why the first sentence in this quote isn&#39;t quite right. It&#39;s precisely because innovators don&#39;t capture most of the monetary benefits of the innovations they create that we need some other force to propel technology forward. Yes, invention is philanthropy, and philanthropy isn&#39;t enough!</p><p> That&#39;s where government comes in. There are plenty of ways that government can and does encourage accelerated innovation — through R&amp;D tax credits, through the patent system (sometimes), though funding of basic research at universities and national labs, through DARPA, and so on. Much of our technological innovation has been driven by this support, which works in harmony with markets instead of replacing them. In fact, Marc himself created the first widely usable graphical web browser while working at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> , a state-funded research center! And Marc correctly lists Paul Romer as a patron saint of techno-optimism; Romer has fought tirelessly for more government funding for science and technology.</p><p> If you don&#39;t want to call that “central planning”, fine. But don&#39;t forget the important role of government in pushing progress forward!</p><p> Here&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPinkston/status/1714088788237180947">a good thread by Nick Pinkston</a> making the same point.</p><p> Anyway, Marc is just one of a whole new crop of techno-optimists that has popped up in recent years. The <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeff">e/acc movement</a> — basically an online reboot of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/1994/10/extropians/">extropian movement</a> from the 1990s — is extremely fun. My favorite e/acc account is <a href="https://twitter.com/terrorproforma/status/1713082035932209393">@terrorproforma</a> .</p><p> Meanwhile, Packy McCormick, who writes the excellent Substack <a href="https://www.notboring.co/">Not Boring</a> , has a new series called “Age of Miracles” where he explores new technologies: </p><div id="youtube2-sNrtMnPsctU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;sNrtMnPsctU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sNrtMnPsctU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p> And of course there&#39;s no shortage of actual technological miracles happening all around us. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malaria-vaccine-oxford-approval/">Malaria vaccines</a> — created using the same technology that we deployed to fight Covid — are now being deployed, threatening to free humanity (and especially Africa) from one of our most terrible and deadly endemic diseases.</p><p> And that turbulence you hate whenever you fly on a plane? Well, that might soon be mostly a thing of the past, thanks to AI: </p><div id="youtube2-9qydsN_acDs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;9qydsN_acDs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qydsN_acDs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p> (Update: This may actually be done <em>without</em> AI! If so, that&#39;s pretty amazing in and of itself.)</p><p> In fact, the combination of AI and physical technology promises to create a whole new era of innovation in “atoms”.</p><p> It&#39;s a pretty great time to be alive. Time to shake off the malaise of the 2010s and dream big again.</p><h4> 2. The US economy remains undefeated</h4><p> Usually you wouldn&#39;t think of a US economic boom as the type of story to fly under the radar…right? And yet the US&#39; economic outperformance during the post-pandemic years, and especially over the last year, feels very underappreciated. Let&#39;s look at a few charts.</p><p> First, there&#39;s growth. Even as China and Europe have decelerated since the pandemic, the US has grown faster than pre-pandemic forecasts expected: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

This follows the pattern of Evergrande, which was the first domino to fall and is now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-17/country-garden-evergrande-set-up-two-tense-weeks-for-creditors?sref=R8NfLgwS">facing liquidation</a> . The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/distressed-debt-funds-have-lost-big-on-china-property-bets-c94011df?st=jvg6oirpip49bjp">points out</a> that lots of investors thought the crisis was over and that they could scoop up Chinese real estate bonds on the cheap, only to get burned when it turned out that the bonds were worth even less than the pessimists thought. Meanwhile, it looks like a number of dominoes are still left to fall; Bloomberg&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-15/china-property-private-equity-s-role-is-the-new-hot-potato?sref=R8NfLgwS">Shuli Ren writes</a> about private equity companies that are set to take big losses from the real estate implosion.</p><p> But the biggest loser is likely to be local governments. These governments financed much of their expenditure with land sales for years, and now with the property sector crashing, that revenue has dried up. So they&#39;re largely surviving by borrowing. The problem is that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-15/china-s-local-governments-feel-the-sting-of-supply-deluge?sref=R8NfLgwS">no one wants to lend to the local governments</a> , since they realize that the long real estate boom is probably never coming back, and thus the local governments are not going to have the money to pay back their loans.</p><p> So the central government is stepping in, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-instructs-banks-roll-over-local-government-debt-sources-2023-10-17/">telling state-controlled banks to keep lending money</a> to the local governments at cheap interest rates. This is called “evergreening”, and it&#39;s what <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.98.5.1943">Japanese banks did</a> with failed companies after the bust of 1989-91. It basically amounts to a bailout by the central government, but with one added negative characteristic. If their lending is directed toward local governments (which are basically non-productive borrowers), state-controlled banks won&#39;t be able to lend as much to the private sector, which could lower productivity and prolong the downturn — just like zombie lending did in Japan.</p><p> That said, China&#39;s government will certainly try very hard to push banks to lend to non-real-estate-related sectors.

Time will tell how much of that manufacturing is actually anything people want to buy, or whether it&#39;s setting China up for a glut of overcapacity and waste.</p><h4> 4. Slavery wasn&#39;t just evil, it was bad for the economy</h4><p> In the 2010s, it became fashionable to claim that the Industrial Revolution was enabled, or even caused, by American slavery. This idea served a number of rhetorical purposes, such as some socialists&#39; desire to equate capitalism with slavery, or some progressives&#39; urge to characterize everything about the American way of life as “stamped from the beginning” with the stain of slavery. This theory, which was part of the so-called “New History of Capitalism” and was largely promoted by historians rather than economists,</p><p> There was <a href="https://pseudoerasmus.com/tag/slavery/">never a ton of evidence</a> to back up this theory, but “not a ton” is not the same as “nothing”. <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/slavery-and-british-industrial-revolution">One paper by actual economists</a> estimated that the cheaper inputs from slavery did increase Britain&#39;s national income by 3.5% — not quite “started the industrial revolution” levels, but not nothing either.</p><p> But there&#39;s also a lot of evidence that slavery <em>hurt</em> the economy of the American South. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31758">A new paper</a> by Richard Hornbeck and Trevon Logan describes why this was the case, and tries to quantify how much emancipation helped boost the economy. Here are some useful excerpts:</p><blockquote><p> Characterizations of slavery as efficient and productive reflect the benefits and costs for slave owners, with market transactions oriented around extracting value from enslaved people. In this paper, we challenge this view. We re-characterize slavery as economically inefficient because there was a massive externality whose implications have been underexplored: enslavers considered their own private marginal benefits and private marginal costs of slave labor when making production decisions in the antebellum era, but they did not internalize the costs slavery imposed on enslaved people. When including costs incurred by enslaved people themselves, the tremendous inefficiency of slavery becomes readily apparent because the value extracted by enslavers was substantially less than the costs imposed on enslaved people. Focusing on the cost of enslavement to the enslaved shows that <strong>slavery was a market failure in addition to a moral failure</strong> .</p><p> Since American slavery was economically inefficient, in this aggregate sense, emancipation generated substantial aggregate economic gains. While output declined after emancipation, input costs declined substantially more, which increased aggregate economic surplus: the total value of output minus total costs incurred…Emancipation reduced input costs that were not paid under slavery, due to coercion, but were still incurred by enslaved people and reduced aggregate surplus in the US economy…[W]e calculate that emancipation generated economic gains that exceed estimated costs of the Civil War…Emancipation generated aggregate economic gains worth 7 – 60 years of technological innovation in the 19th century[.]</p></blockquote><p> The argument here is actually a subtle but powerful one. Because slavers basically got to ignore many of the costs they foisted on slaves, they made poor decisions about how to spend slaves&#39; time and effort and skills — and the slaves were also forced to make bad decisions. As the authors write, “slavery was not only a substantial transfer of value from enslaved people to enslavers, it was also an inefficient mechanism of transferring value.”</p><p> (And as an aside, there are other, more complex distortions that this paper doesn&#39;t even take into account, like <em>investment decisions</em> . Because slavers faced the wrong prices for their investment decisions — slave labor was artificially cheap — the slave states over-invested in agriculture instead of manufacturing. Which is why when William T. Sherman showed up to kick their butts, he<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10178834-you-people-of-the-south-don-t-know-what-you-are">lambasted them</a> by saying “hardly a yard of cloth or pair of shoes can you make”. This was one reason the Union won so decisively.)</p><p> Hornbeck and Logan&#39;s result stands in contrast to the paper that found that slavery made Britain a little bit richer. Future research should focus on harmonizing the methodologies in these models — combining natural experiments from emancipation with the theory of externalities. But in any case, this is a blow to the idea that slavery was a boon for the overall economy.</p><p> Which doesn&#39;t mean, of course, that the modern American economy is free from the stain of slavery. It just means that that stain is probably making us poorer rather than richer. Extractive labor policies like <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/us-prison-labor-programs-violate-fundamental-human-rights-new-report-finds">low-paid prison labor</a> , commonly used in the American South, under-invest in human capital and are probably thus inefficient, for many of the same reasons that Hornbeck and Logan cite. In addition to being a human rights violation, of course.</p><h4> 5. The platform is the enemy</h4><p> This past week on the platform formerly known as Twitter has been a tough one.

But many of us have been <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/twitters-problems-a-roundup">warning for years</a> that social media, and Twitter in particular, inherently rewarded divisive, extremist discourse, and elevated the worst people. There was no shortage of <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-shouting-class-2-last-refuge">social science research</a> supporting this finding, but more evidence continues to pile up all the time.</p><p> For example, here&#39;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16941">a new paper by Milli et al.</a> about Twitter&#39;s recommendation algorithm, which finds that the algorithm shoves divisive content in users&#39; faces that they would actually rather not see:</p><blockquote><p> In a pre-registered randomized experiment, we found that, relative to a reverse-chronological baseline, Twitter&#39;s engagement-based ranking algorithm may amplify emotionally charged, out-group hostile content and contribute to affective polarization. Furthermore, we critically examine the claim that the algorithm shows users what they want to see, discovering that users do *not* prefer the political tweets selected by the algorithm.</p></blockquote><p> But you don&#39;t need a fancy recommendation algorithm to elevate the worst people; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad325/7293179?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=pnasnexus&amp;utm_content=3912da00-269d-4ea9-8b25-ac125fe7417c&amp;utm_campaign=hootsuite&amp;login=false">a new paper by Mamakos and Finkel</a> finds that Reddit does this as well:</p><blockquote><p> Toxic people are especially likely to opt into discourse in partisan contexts…[W]e analyzed hundreds of millions of comments from over 6.3 million users and found robust evidence that: (1) the discourse of people whose behavior is especially toxic in partisan contexts is also especially toxic in non-partisan contexts (ie, people are not politics-only toxicity specialists); and (2) when considering only non-partisan contexts, the discourse of people who also comment in partisan contexts is more toxic than the discourse of people who do not. These effects were not driven by socialization processes whereby people overgeneralized toxic behavioral norms they had learned in partisan contexts.</p></blockquote><p> This is not a causal study, and the effect is not incredibly strong, but it still shows that the tendency is there.</p><p> This doesn&#39;t mean I think these new social media technologies were a bad invention (though Twitter&#39;s algorithm certainly needs to be tweaked). It&#39;s hard to imagine a world without even as simple and rudimentary an online discussion platform as Reddit! But what it does mean is that our society needs to adapt to the presence of these technologies. We need to start realizing that we have another enemy besides our traditional political opponents, and that enemy is the social media platform where we we get our news. Social media has taught itself to exploit natural human tendencies toward enmity and division, monetizing hate for engagement and profit. It&#39;s a dark mirror to the worst parts of our souls, and it&#39;s up to us to find ways to resist. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-b4e?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-b4e?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a> </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg" width="900" height="523" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:523,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div> ]]>;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
