href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm">发布了消费者财务调查 (SCF) 的 2022 年数据</a>，这是他们每三年进行一次的一项大型调查，询问家庭的财务状况。家庭调查很重要，因为它们使我们能够计算中<em>位数</em>之类的东西 - 如果你想知道处于国民收入或财富分配中间的家庭的表现如何，你需要与大量家庭交谈以了解其分布情况好像。家庭调查的缺点是需要很长时间（这就是为什么 SCF 每三年才发布一次），因此它们无法为您提供最新信息。另一个缺点是，您必须非常小心调查哪些家庭，才能获得具有代表性的样本。但即使有这些限制，调查数据仍然提供了大量信息。</p><p>基本上，2022 年的数据（您可以在<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf">美联储的报告</a>中看到总结）讲述了一个非常令人鼓舞的故事。简而言之：</p><ul><li><p>自大流行之前以来，美国人的财富大幅增加。</p></li><li><p>整体增长非常均匀，处于分布底部的人比处于顶部的人获得的收益比例要高。</p></li><li><p>不平等现象下降，包括种族不平等、教育不平等、城乡不平等、总体财富不平等。</p></li><li><p>债务不再是一个问题。</p></li><li><p>甚至还有一些关于收入和财富的令人惊讶的好消息。</p></li></ul><p>换句话说，水涨船高。我知道很难相信这一点，因为你在媒体上看到的所有厄运和悲观情绪，但数字不言而喻。正如您所知，我在这篇文章中给出的所有数字都根据通货膨胀进行了调整，所以不必担心。</p><h4>首先，好消息</h4><p>最大的好消息是，2019

万美元，考虑到利率上升（导致债券价格下跌），这一数字令人惊讶。一定发生的事情是，美国人存了太多钱，<em>以至于尽管</em>加息，他们的债券持有量仍然增加。这意味着，如果利率回落，财富将会进一步增加。</p><p> （旁注：债券是否真正代表社会的净财​​富是一个复杂的问题；有人要承担这种责任。但这是另一天的话题；从家庭的角度来看，债券就是财富。）</p><p>事实上，尽管利率上调，但财富仍在增加，这是一个令人难以置信的好兆头。请记住，任何资产的价值部分取决于<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp">贴现率</a>，即您希望今天拥有一美元与明天拥有一美元的金额。当利率上升时，贴现率上升，这意味着资产价值下降。还记得 2021 年底和 2022 年初的股市大崩盘吗？这可能是由加息推动的。较高的利率也会降低债券的价值，最重要的是降低房屋的价值。</p><p>然而，尽管 2022 年利率从 0% 左右上升到 4% 以上，<em>但财富仍在增加</em>。这意味着这次财富繁荣与前几十年的增长截然不同，当时利率被无情降低。还记得多年来我们如何听到美联储通过降低利率和实行量化宽松来“通胀”或“支撑”股票、房屋和债券吗？嗯，2022 年的情况恰恰相反。然而财富的增长并没有停止。</p><p>这对未来来说是一个很好的迹象，因为这意味着如果利率下降，美国人的财富将会增加<em>更多</em>。尤其是房价上涨，显然是由利率以外的因素推动的——<a href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/el2022-26.pdf">向远程工作的转变</a>是最大的推动因素，但千禧一代<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/17/millennial-home-ownership">最终购买了住房</a>。</p><p>现在，请注意一点。财富增长的一部分—— <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf/dataviz/scf/chart/#series:Owned_Vehicles;demographic:all;population:all;units:median">中位家庭约为 8300 美元</a>——来自二手车价值的增长。很多人质疑二手车的价值有多少实际上是财富，因为如果你卖掉你的车，你要么必须乘坐公共汽车，这是一种更慢、更糟糕的体验，要么使用一些非常昂贵的服务就像优步一样。 （与汽车相比，房屋的问题要小得多，因为如果你卖掉房子，你可以租一套非常好的房子。）因此，如果你不认为汽车是财富，那么中位数家庭的收益会低一些比我上面引用的数字。但基本的故事并没有改变。</p><p>哦，顺便说一句，还有一个好消息。 SCF不仅询问人们的财富情况，还询问他们的收入情况。您通常在媒体上看到的人口普查局的数据显示，2019 年至 2022 年间，<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N#0">实际家庭收入中位数</a>下降了约 4.7%。但 SCF 发现，这一数字在此期间<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf/dataviz/scf/chart/#series:Before_Tax_Income;demographic:all;population:1;units:median">上升了约 3%</a> 。我不确定为什么会存在这种差异（我会检查一下并回复您），但 SCF 是一项非常广泛、详细、仔细的调查，所以我在这里倾向于更信任它。</p><p>因此，无论如何，这里的基本情况似乎是，自 2019 年以来，美国人存了很多钱，尽管加息，但他们的房屋和退休账户的价值仍然上涨。这是个好消息，它表明<a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/households-less-optimistic-about-finances">美国人对其财务状况的悲观情绪</a>实际上更多是由于美国社会的普遍动荡和新闻中的可怕内容。</p><p>但同样值得注意的是，不断增长的财富确实遗漏了一个重要的群体——那些想要购买该系统的人。</p><h4>广泛财富的微妙挑战</h4><p>社会中基础广泛的金融财富的概念有些微妙。大多数人认为资产——股票、住房、债券等——是你可以通过<em>将其卖给别人来</em>赚钱的东西。但这如何在整个社会层面发挥作用呢？如果每个人都拥有一些相同的资产——如果每个人都有先锋退休账户、房子等——那么<em>他们可以把这些资产卖给谁？</em>你如何通过出售每个人都已经拥有的东西来赚钱？<em> </em></p><p>事实上，这个问题是有一些答案的。他们可以将资产出售给外国人，或者出售给出生和长大时没有任何资产的年轻人。但更根本的答案是，资产通常确实有办法让你赚钱，即使你不出售它们。这就是所谓的“基本价值”。股票支付股息，债券支付利息，出租房产支付租金。即使你住的房子也能给你带来收入流，尽管很难看到——这是<em>你不用付房租就能保留的收入</em>。该收入流被称为“业主等价租金”，它代表了业主自用住房的基本价值。</p><p>当我们考虑房价和住房负担能力时，这一点很重要。</p><p>很多人指出，当房价上涨时，首次购房者买房变得更加困难。美联储的报告也指出了这一点，指出现在中位住房的成本相当于中位家庭收入的 4.6 年，而 20 世纪 90 年代末还不到 3 年。 </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"

href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US">8%左右的抵押贷款利率</a>让它变得更加困难。</p><p>现在，成本的增加<em>可能</em>是由于基本价值的提高。毕竟，房子<a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/living/article/column-home-size-america-17738749.php">越来越大</a>，设施也越来越好。这些改进增加了您愿意支付的租房费用，因此它们增加了您通过居住在房子中节省的金额 - 因此，您支付更多，但这是因为您获得了更多的基本价值。位于正确的城市的房子也可以变得更有价值——如果你的城镇成为科技中心，房子代表了一个方便的找工作的地方，这使得它从根本上更有价值（尽管理想情况下，<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Land-Big-Deal-wages-about-ebook/dp/B0BL8H6Y9S">这个价值应该征税）离开</a>并花在公共物品上或作为现金返还给公众……但那是另一天的故事了）。</p><p>因此，无论如何，可以想象一个住房负担能力下降并不是坏事的世界，因为住房正在变得越来越好。但在现实世界中，可能会出现一些导致负担能力下降的问题。</p><p>首先，想要买房的年轻人不一定有足够<em>的流动性</em>（即首付）来买房，尤其是在旧金山这样的昂贵市场。这可能会推迟年轻人开始积累住房财富的那一天，从而导致<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-there-be-a-millennial-big-chill">几代人的挫败感</a>和低生育率。</p><p>更糟糕的是，如果住房因为<em>人为稀缺</em>而变得更加昂贵——邻避者利用当地政府的监管和诉讼来阻止新的建设——那么住房存量所提供的总价值实际上并没有增加。在这种情况下，老一辈人实际上正在形成一个事实上的卡特尔，向年轻人收取过高的住房费用，迫使年轻人牺牲更多年的工作寿命，以便让老年人过上富裕的生活。人为地制造房屋稀缺意味着可供使用的住房减少，这会损害整个经济。</p><p>这确实是利用自有住房作为社会广大中产阶级财富的工具所面临的问题。如果你像<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-08/behind-the-design-of-singapore-s-low-cost-housing?sref=R8NfLgwS">新加坡那样</a>管理全国范围内的房价和供应，那么可能没问题，但这很难做到。在美国，从年轻一代那里榨取越来越多的钱往往是老年中产阶级房主最快捷、最容易的致富途径。这就是为什么有些人对不断增长的中产阶级住房财富感到矛盾甚至惶恐。</p><p>但这次我不那么担心了。首先，今天<em>购买</em>房产的年轻人将会获益匪浅——如果利率下降，他们的财富将会飙升，而且他们还能够为抵押贷款再融资。即使全国范围内大规模推动新住房建设——你已经听过很多次的 YIMBY 运动——成功地消除了人为住房短缺的影响，情况也是如此。</p><p>换句话说，新的SCF数据让我对美国人的财政状况感到非常乐观。我知道这个国家正处于不安、分裂的状态，世界上正在发生可怕的事情。但无论如何，大多数美国人转向更安全的财务基础是值得庆祝的。 </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper"

href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/western-leftists-have-lost-the-plot">我写了一篇非常沮丧的文章，</a>内容是西方左翼人士（其中许多人急于表达对哈马斯的声援）如何丧失了美国社会的大部分道德制高点。该帖子现已成为该博客历史上最受欢迎的帖子之一。但这让一些人感到困惑。谁是“左派”？当然是 DSA，但是 BLM 呢？或者伯尼·桑德斯或 AOC？拜登是“左派”吗？当这么多著名的民主党和进步领导人站出来谴责哈马斯时，我到底在谴责谁？</p><p>这是一个公平的问题。如果你不密切关注在线政治辩论（老实说，你为什么要关注？），“左派”这个词可能看起来与“进步”甚至“自由派”这个词没有什么不同。甚至一些关注这些辩论的人也不知道像我这样的作家到底在哪里划清界限。如果您要抱怨整个群体，那么明确该群体中的成员很重要。</p><p>事实上，对于谁是“左派”并没有官方定义——他们自己当然不会使用这个词。但自从 2016 年伯尼·桑德斯的运动在全国舞台上爆发以来，我直观地清楚地看到，他的许多最热心的支持者关心的是一系列不同的问题，以不同的方式谈论政治，并从不同的人那里获取信息。与大多数进步主义者相比，其来源有些不同。他们对民主党建制派深恶痛绝，总是谈论推翻民主党并接管该党。他们似乎更关心<a href="https://twitter.com/fedtanyl/status/1716231703587414422">学生贷款</a>和取消自付费用的医疗费用。他们经常<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-left-nimby-canon">反对</a>新住房建设。他们更有可能称自己为“社会主义者”，并对<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bernies-new-speechwriter-applauded-chavezs-economic-miracle">乌戈·查韦斯</a>怀有钦佩之情。他们似乎更加关注外交政策（尤其是在拜登在经济问题上<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/biden-is-triangulating-the-left">抢了他们的风头</a>之后）。他们经常称美国为“帝国”。</p><p>最重要的是，他们似乎比普通进步主义者更痴迷于<em>巴勒斯坦</em>。巴勒斯坦事业本质上并不是社会主义，而且还有很多其他民族也受到压迫，他们也应该拥有自己的国家。但在我眼中的“西方左派”中，巴勒斯坦问题在他们的事业万神殿中远远高于其他所有国家。这是他们与进步主义者最明显的区别之一。我一直不太明白为什么。</p><p>现在我想我开始更好地理解了。在<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/quit-dsa-gaza-israel/">一篇关于他为何退出 DSA 的帖子</a>中，莫里斯·伊瑟曼 (Maurice Isserman) 解释说，巴勒斯坦已成为一个楔子问题，极端主义“进入者”用来排挤更温和的成员：</p><blockquote><p>随着新的强硬派核心小组获得影响力，巴勒斯坦问题在 DSA 的内部政治文化中变得越来越重要……[以色列对巴勒斯坦人的镇压]并没有说明巴勒斯坦在 DSA 相当短的国际关切清单中所扮演的极其重要的角色，完全掩盖了对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰或库尔德穆斯林或中国维吾尔穆斯林等其他受压迫人民权利的关注。对巴勒斯坦的关心本身是完全合理的，也为 DSA 新的宗派领导层服务于其他目的，如果 DSA 的温和派不愿意在巴勒斯坦问题上采取最极端的立场，甚至包括否认，那么它就可以提供便利的大棒来打击 DSA 的温和派。以色列继续存在的权利……</p><p>早在 2017 年全国代表大会上，DSA 集会上就开始响起“从河流到海洋，巴勒斯坦将自由”的口号，对针对以色列的抵制、撤资和制裁（BDS）运动的支持成为组织内政治纯洁性的试金石。对于宗派主义者来说，抹黑那些未通过测试的民选民主社会主义者有助于使该组织更接近与民主党的理想决裂。</p></blockquote><p>这很有意义。巴勒斯坦不仅仅是一场因美国与以色列结盟而被民主党建制派淡化的解放斗争；它也是一场解放斗争。这也是一个完美的楔子问题，因为有原则的（因此温和的）社会主义者会因哈马斯明确的种族灭绝意图而感到厌烦。</p><p>但即使在 10 月 7 日哈马斯发动袭击之前，我就已经清楚地意识到西方左派的世界观中有些东西被打破了。许多小事加起来——他们愿意将俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的责任归咎于北约，他们痴迷于不可行的经济政策，这些政策似乎是为了激起建制派民主党人的抵制，他们坚持认为美国是寡头政治而不是真正的民主国家，他们的拥抱邻避主义，他们对去增长和边缘经济理论的调情，等等。 2022 年 4 月，<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-american-socialist-worldview">我写了一篇文章</a>，表达了对整个美国左派项目的愤怒。我什至没有提到巴勒斯坦。但我已经知道有些事情不对劲了。</p><p>无论如何，这是那篇文章，我认为它已经相当陈旧了。</p><div><hr></div><p>我非常恼火地看到诺姆·乔姆斯基在<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/04/noam-chomsky-on-how-to-prevent-world-war-iii">《时事》最近的一次采访中</a>敦促乌克兰向俄罗斯让步：</p><blockquote><p>我并不是在批评泽连斯基；我只是在批评他。他是一个值得尊敬的人，并且表现出了极大的勇气。你可以同情他的立场。但你也可以关注世界的现实。这就是它的含义。我回到之前所说的：基本上有两种选择。一个选择是奉行我们现在所遵循的政策，再次引用弗里曼大使的话，与俄罗斯战斗到底。是的，我们可以在可能发生核战争的情况下推行这一政策。或者我们可以面对现实，唯一的选择是外交解决，这将是丑陋的——它将给普京和他的小圈子一个逃生口……我们知道基本框架是中立乌克兰，对顿巴斯地区进行某种形式的包容，具有高度自治权，可能在乌克兰的某些联邦结构内。</p></blockquote><p>这种纸上谈兵的傲慢令人震惊——美国公共知识分子在领土和外交上向乌克兰做出让步。乔姆斯基用“我们”这个词来形容他想象中将对俄罗斯做出这些让步的各方，但第一人称代词是完全没有根据的——乌克兰100%决定向侵略者投降多少领土和人民。在其占领的地区进行<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html">大规模屠杀</a>、 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/rape-weapon-ukraine-war-crime-sexual-violence">大规模强奸</a>和大规模转移到<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/reports-russians-deporting-ukrainians-camps-troubles-stalin-survivors-rcna21456">集中营</a>。这是 0% 诺姆·乔姆斯基的决定。</p><p>想到乔姆斯基已经很老了（他已经 93 岁了！），那就太好了。但可悲的是，这比他过去所做的事情要温和。早在 1977 年，他就一直<a href="https://chomsky.info/19770625/">在淡化红色高棉在柬埔寨种族灭绝中的罪责</a>：</p><blockquote><p>美国公众看到的是现有证据的严重扭曲版本，强调所谓的红色高棉暴行，淡化或忽视美国在柬埔寨遭受的痛苦中直接和间接发挥的关键作用。</p></blockquote><p>与此同时，接受乔姆斯基采访的《时事》杂志编辑内森·J·罗宾逊 (Nathan J. Robinson) 对外交政策的看法甚至更加令人反感。在<a href="https://twitter.com/NathanJRobinson/status/1514970849677541382/retweets/with_comments">最近的一条推文</a>中，他断言美国的国防开支构成了“策划对俄罗斯和中国人民的种族灭绝”： </p><div

href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/30/zelenskyy-inspires-widespread-confidence-from-u-s-public-as-views-of-putin-hit-new-low/">民主党选民非常强烈地反对</a>普京、俄罗斯和入侵。）</p><p>当然，这并不是说社会主义左翼在这一事件中与特朗普右翼一样糟糕。但事实并非如此。但我对社会主义者的期望比对右派的期望更好——或者也许我应该说我会<em>希望</em>更好。事实上，同情社会主义的人可能比同情特朗普主义的人更有可能阅读我的博客，这就是为什么我花时间发泄对社会主义者的愤怒，而不是不停地咆哮为什么塔克卡尔森公司很糟糕。</p><p>在战争爆发之前，社会主义者在某种程度上<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/biden-is-triangulating-the-left?s=w">转向了外交政策</a>。他们的国内经济议程大部分已被拜登政府的大胆举措所取代——而当这些大胆举措被乔·曼钦拒绝并在民意调查中只得到冷淡支持时，这表明桑德斯总统的情况也不会更好。然而，外交政策是主流自由派和保守派之间存在更多共识的领域，因此提出了一个更具吸引力的楔子问题，社会主义者可以利用它来谴责民主党建制派。反对伊拉克战争的战斗是复兴美国社会主义运动的主要事情之一，因此发挥他们的优势是有意义的。</p><p>然后有两件事使这一转变脱轨。首先是拜登从阿富汗撤军，结束了美国在9/11之后在穆斯林国家的“永远的战争”。接下来，乌克兰战争让美国和北约坚定地扮演了好人的角色，突然介入，为勇敢的乌克兰人提供了抵御帝国主义侵略和暴行的工具。突然之间，社会主义者伪乔姆斯基式的外交政策框架——世界战争是美帝国主义造成的，而美帝国主义是由人为的同意和贪婪的军工联合体驱动的——看起来与现实脱节，<a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/1503758826461409287">甚至对欧洲的社会主义者来说也是如此</a>。</p><p>而且它与现实<em>脱节</em>。但自伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)总统竞选为社会主义运动注入新活力以来，这并不是社会主义世界观中唯一危险地转向幻想之地的部分。</p><p>美国社会主义新世界观的核心是“变革理论”。 2016 年至 2020 年间，几乎不可能不与社会主义者交谈而不听到这句话。从纯粹的选举角度来看，社会主义“变革理论”似乎是，伯尼·桑德斯拥有独特的能力，能够将传统的进步选民与从奥巴马转向特朗普的白人工人阶级选民团结起来，同时激励年轻人站出来并投票。</p><p>但伯尼根本无法做到这一点。 2020 年，<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/how-bernie-sanders-lost-white-working-class/">他失去了 2016 年曾与他调情的白人工人阶级选民</a>，而<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/insiders-recount-how-sanders-lost-the-black-vote--and-the-nomination-slipped-away/2020/03/24/2b7b8b8e-685e-11ea-b313-df458622c2cc_story.html">从未真正设法与构成民主党初选核心的黑人选民建立联系</a>。年轻人也没有出来投票。当大多数初选选民在“超级星期二”及之后聚集在乔·拜登周围时，伯尼的支持者<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/bernie-sanders-anti-establishment-lost-voters.html">试图编造一个故事</a>，说他们被建制派阴谋从<a href="https://ifunny.co/meme/RD7m2uXT7">背后捅了一刀</a>，而不是简单地被选民拒绝。叙述没有采取。</p><p> “变革理论”的另一部分是“移动奥弗顿之窗”的想法。社会主义者没有将其传统定义为公共讨论的界限，而是将奥弗顿窗口重新想象为公众对什么是温和合理政策的看法。 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/26/745034477/the-practical-reasons-candidates-talk-about-improbable-policies">这个想法是</a>，通过提出非常引人注目和极端的计划，如伯尼的“全民医疗保险”计划——该计划将有效地废除私人医疗保险并消除一切形式的费用分摊，这些措施远​​远超出了欧洲社会民主国家使用的制度——社会主义者然后可以得到一个更温和的单一支付者或公共选择系统作为妥协。一些社会主义者将奥巴马医改——自医疗保险本身创建以来最重要的医疗改革—— <a href="https://www.wonkette.com/hey-remember-when-nancy-pelosi-killed-45-000-americans-by-passing-obamacare">描述为大规模谋杀</a>，仅仅因为这不是伯尼的计划。这是一种<em>谈判</em>理论——预先要求更多，最终你会得到更多，即使你没有得到你所要求的一切。</p><p>这个理论也失败了。 “全民医疗保险”一词的民意调查一直很好，但当该计划的具体细节被解释后，民意调查数字<a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/428958-poll-voters-want-the-government-to-provide-healthcare-for/">往往会急剧下降</a>。最终，社会主义者既没有得到他们喜欢的医疗保健计划，也没有任何妥协——拜登政府和民主党国会只是简单地不再强调医疗保健，除了社会主义者之外，似乎没有人关心这一点。简单的事实是，民主党已经在一项重大的医疗改革上花费了大量政治资本，而国家没有心情重蹈覆辙。社会主义者要月亮却什么也得不到。</p><p>美国社会主义者“变革理论”的第三部分是权力理论。社会主义者声称美国的民主是<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Takeover-Corruption-Conquered-Government/dp/0307237354">由富人购买和支付的</a>，因此我们生活在寡头政治而不是真正的民主中。 （这更像是 20 世纪初美国的进步反腐败运动，而不是基于阶级的马克思主义分析，表明美国社会主义运动的真正根源是融合的，但我离题了。）</p><p>这可能是真的，也可能不是，但到目前为止，美国是寡头政治的观点是一种基于信仰的信念，而不是任何基于证据的信念。这个想法经常被吹捧为一个科学事实，但事实上，实证支持完全依赖于吉伦斯和佩奇一篇相当平庸的政治科学论文，该<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study">论文实际上并没有说出人们认为它所说的内容</a>，并且与其余大部分内容相矛盾。文学。我<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/yes-the-us-is-still-a-flawed-democracy?s=w">在十二月写过这个</a>：</p><blockquote><p>这篇论文还有很多问题，所以你可以<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study">去阅读马修斯的整篇文章</a>，以及三篇评论论文。但上面摘录中引用的统计数据对于吉伦斯/佩奇的结果来说已经是完全毁灭性的了。整个模型几乎没有任何解释力——对于一个有这么多变量的模型来说，R 平方 0.074 根本不算什么。吉伦斯和佩奇的数据表明，政策结果往往与中产阶级一致，就像与富人一致一样，这一事实完全推翻了上面推文中的主张——即“民选官员制定政策是为了让最富有的 10% 的人受益”。这个国家排除了其他所有人的需求。”</p></blockquote><p>当伯尼被拜登击败时，尽管伯尼拥有更大的战争资金，但这一理论开始显示出其局限性。但这个信息并没有穿透信仰之墙。当社会党候选人尼娜·特纳(Nina Turner)在民主党初选中以2比1的比分输给对手时，<a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1422755974050291712">她声称自己并没有真正输掉，</a>因为选举是被“黑钱”“操纵”的。</p><p>换句话说，这种关于权力和寡头政治的理论看起来主要像是在找借口——一种将社会主义者缺乏民众吸引力解释为富有的权力掮客在想象中的烟雾缭绕的密室里的阴谋的一种方式。像这样的借口可能会缓解受伤的自尊心，但它们往往不会导致自我反省。</p><p>但被打破的不仅仅是社会主义者的变革和权力理论。在具体的公共政策问题上，他们太渴望接受那些提供神奇解决方案的时尚知识分子崇拜。</p><p>其中一个例子就是“去生长”。尽管在欧洲比在美国更受欢迎，但世界必须通过大幅降低生活水平来应对气候变化的想法在这里也获得了一些认可。正如越来越多的<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth?s=w">左翼评论家开始意识到的</a>那样，这种想法是危险的胡言乱语。没有任何规划结构可以管理全球去增长议程。但即使有可能，所需的人类福利牺牲也会使其在所有重要国家中成为不可能的事。 （而且，支持去增长的“科学”文献<a href="https://twitter.com/simardcasanova/status/1507343225408872448">质量极低</a>。） 实际上，去增长的唯一功能就是让环保主义受到憎恨和谩骂。</p><p>第二个更令人担忧的例子是左翼邻避主义。为了应对全国范围内的住房负担能力危机，全国各地的许多社会主义者都接受了这样的理论：建造更多住房会增加租金并导致中产阶级化。在全国范围内应用这显然是一个愚蠢的想法——如果你不为人们建造房屋，他们将没有地方住。但即使在地方层面，<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-left-nimby-canon?s=w">证据也强烈反对左翼邻避主义</a>——建造更多住房会压低租金，通常会减少低收入租房者离开时尚社区的情况。 But as in so many things, evidence doesn&#39;t dent the socialist worldview — in a recent article, Nathan J. Robinson made the farcical argument that instead of building new housing we should <a href="https://twitter.com/tiredgenerally/status/1503836326117838851?t=xaeZklz6RAPK_2IiALxk5w&amp;s=19">simply build new cities</a> .</p><p> Now the Left-NIMBYism is beginning to extend to alternative energy as well. Although the Sunrise Movement — a darling of America&#39;s new socialists — started out as a promoter of the pro-growth Green New Deal, the organization&#39;s local chapters <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlcooper/status/1507052236618317824?t=glnD_Szvr1im9nR5-zxX1g&amp;s=19">now routinely oppose clean energy projects</a> . It&#39;s possible that Sunrise is beginning to follow in the footsteps of older legacy environmental organizations like the Sierra Club, who tend to <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/americas-top-environmental-groups?s=w">equate environmentalism with a lack of development</a> . This is, of course, extremely deleterious to the fight against climate change, which requires rapid deployment of green energy everywhere in the country. The organization&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1506331119171551244">foray into decrying high gasoline prices</a> certainly isn&#39;t a good sign.</p><p> This has become a pattern; time and again, America&#39;s socialists spend their intellectual and political capital on these vials of snake oil. It was only through <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/modern-monetary-theory-isnt-helping">the timely intervention</a> of more sensible socialist writers that the movement was saved from going all-in on <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-nyt-article-on-mmt-is-really">the pseudo-economics cult called MMT</a> . As for the opposition to Ukraine&#39;s self-defense, it smacks of <a href="https://fightback.org.nz/2015/11/05/against-campism-what-makes-some-leftists-support-putin/">pure anti-American “campism”</a> — the idea that anyone who opposes America can&#39;t be all that bad, even if it&#39;s a rightist dictator like Putin.</p><p> Sure, there are some good ideas in the new socialist movement, but they too often get lost and drowned out by the cacophony of fantasy. It feels like America&#39;s socialists are piecing together a sort of extended universe — a fantasy worldview as potent and immersive as anything dished up by Fox News, which offers the illusion of internal consistency but is actually just an outgrowth of what historian Richard Hoftstadter called “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics">the paranoid style in American politics</a> ”.</p><p> Which is a shame, for several reasons. Most importantly, the US <em>needs</em> a movement dedicated to fighting economic inequality, which has <a href="https://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2020JEP.pdf">gotten utterly out of control</a> . Within my lifetime it feels like we&#39;ve become far more of a class society, and socialism was traditionally the movement that fought for the rights and power of the working class. Even beyond that narrow imperative, socialist movements in Western societies have often provided important sources of dissent and independent thought. Even the subcultures I love, like punk rock, owe much to the (sometimes sublimated or submerged) dream of socialism.</p><p> I would like to think that the new American socialist movement&#39;s forays into the ridiculous and the reprehensible are simply growing pains. But looking at the even starker failures of Corbyn&#39;s movement in the UK and Melenchon&#39;s movement in France, it&#39;s difficult to be optimistic about this. Yes, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/axios-capitalism-update/">about half of young Americans say they like socialism</a> , but this won&#39;t necessarily stop the movement from turning into a kooky fringe over time — as an example, libertarian views in America <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-few-libertarians-but-many-americans-have-libertarian-views/">are quite common</a> , but almost no Americans identify as political libertarians. I can easily envision socialism following a similar path. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-american-socialist-worldview-4aa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-american-socialist-worldview-4aa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p> ]]>;

Increasingly, when I read about this war, it feels less like a typical Israel-Palestine blowup and more like an extension of <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-the-us-should-fight-cold-war">Cold War 2</a> .</p><p> But what does that even mean? I think of a “cold war” as basically a <em>model</em> — a framework for understanding world events. Think about the original Cold War. We say that things like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, or the US-supported coup against Salvador Allende, or Soviet spying, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinating_Committee_for_Multilateral_Export_Controls">CoCOM</a> , or the movie Rocky IV were “part of the Cold War”, but there&#39;s no hard-and-fast definition of what that means. Nobody declared the Cold War, or made policies that used that name. Instead, the competition between the US and the USSR was just a <em>mental framework</em> that writers and politicians and regular people used to make sense of what they saw happening in the world around them — a way to view many small events as part of one overarching big event.</p><p> In the same way, I think of “Cold War 2” as a model for how to think about a lot of the geopolitical happenings in the world today — and some of the economic and cultural ones as well. The Israel-Gaza war, and the bizarre and toxic discourse on both <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/western-leftists-have-lost-the-plot">the far left</a> and the far right in America, the sudden return of industrial policy and the reshaping of supply chains, and so on — can be understood as being at least partly outgrowths of the great-power contest between the US and its democratic allies and an authoritarian bloc led by China and Russia. (If you prefer not to think of these blocs in ideological terms, I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcVSgYz5SJ8">Sarah CM Paine&#39;s framework</a> of “maritime” vs. “continental” powers works just as well.)</p><p> This is one reason I&#39;ve been writing a fair amount about geopolitics over the last three years, and especially since Russia invaded Ukraine. So many of the economic changes we&#39;re seeing now, and which are being planned for the next two decades, are either being driven by Cold War 2 concerns or will have an impact on the outcome of Cold War 2. In a world where the economy becomes a key tool that great powers use to prosecute their conflicts, it&#39;s completely impossible to just “stick to the economics”.</p><p> Now, if the power of models is to simplify, the danger of models is that they can easily be over-applied (as <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-failed-economic-theory-of-everything">some macroeconomists have discovered</a> ). It&#39;s tempting to become so obsessed with Cold War 2 that you see a spy behind every tree, or a foreign propaganda message behind every bad take on Twitter. So I want to draw connections between seemingly disparate events while being careful not to accidentally prod people into conspiracy thinking.</p><p> Anyway, that having been said, let&#39;s talk a bit about why the big topic that&#39;s occupying the nation&#39;s mind these days is really about Cold War 2 — as is a lot of the other dire stuff we&#39;re seeing in the news.</p><h4> The Israel-Gaza war as a Cold War 2 proxy conflict</h4><p> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-lot-of-what-you-see-in-the-news">Read more</a></p> ]]>; </content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[America needs a bigger, better bureaucracy]]></title><description><![CDATA[They're from the government, and they really are here to help.]]></description><link/> https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/america-needs-a-bigger-better-bureaucracy<guid ispermalink="true"> https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/america-needs-a-bigger-better-bureaucracy</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Noah Smith]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 01:03:39 GMT</pubDate> <enclosure length="0" type="image/jpeg" url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg"></enclosure><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure> <a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg" width="975" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:139770,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8107f8e-c986-417f-899d-ce7c11df461c_975x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a> <polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></figure></div><p> This is a picture of Deirdre Beaubeirdre, a character from the comedy sci-fi movie <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em> — an IRS auditor who hounds the immigrant protagonists mercilessly. I loved that movie, but I also thought Deirdre&#39;s character was emblematic of a common and unhelpful way that Americans tend to think about the civil service. Ronald Reagan famously said that “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I&#39;m from the Government, and I&#39;m here to help.” I think that antipathy toward government workers has filtered through to much of American society — not just to libertarians or conservatives, but to many progressives as well.</p><p> I believe that the US suffers from a distinct lack of <em>state capacity</em> . We&#39;ve outsourced many of our core government functions to nonprofits and consultants, resulting in cost bloat and the waste of taxpayer money. We&#39;ve farmed out environmental regulation to the courts and to private citizens, resulting in paralysis for industry and infrastructure alike. And we&#39;ve left ourselves critically vulnerable to threats like pandemics and — most importantly — war.</p><p> It&#39;s time for us to bring back the bureaucrats.</p><p> Aggregate numbers give a decent general impression of how the United States&#39; civil service has withered over the decades. This process began in the 1970s, before Reagan ever took power, and has continued to this day. The percent of American workers employed by the government rose through 1975 and fell thereafter, interrupted only by recessions (in which government employees were less likely to be laid off): </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png" width="1318" height="450" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:1318,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:78969,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa96c32dc-a88a-49b1-9145-4c05997fd2f9_1318x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> It&#39;s worth noting that much of this decline was at the federal level.

More recently, Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Center put out <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brinkpaper.pdf">a great report in 2021</a> called “State Capacity: What Is It, How We Lost It, And How to Get It Back”. A few excerpts from the executive summary:</p><blockquote><p> A series of calamities during the 21st century—the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, the financial crisis, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic—have made it painfully clear that American state capacity is not what it once was…On the right, healthy suspicion of rapid government expansion has given way to a toxic contempt for government and public service per se. On the left, efforts to expand “citizen voice” in government as a check on abusive power have produced a sclerotic “vetocracy” that makes effective governance all but impossible…</p><p> [The Niskanen Center is] taking on five new issues that we see as critical arenas for the struggle to rebuild state capacity: (1) expanding and upgrading the federal workforce, (2) improving tax collection and closing the tax gap, (3) overhauling how the federal government acquires and uses information technology, (4) streamlining environmental review to reduce delays and cost overruns in infrastructure projects, and (5) revitalizing the country&#39;s sclerotic public health institutions to better prepare for the next pandemic.</p></blockquote><p> This is in concert with Tyler Cowen&#39;s concept of “state capacity libertarianism”, which <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html">he outlined in January 2020</a> as an alternative to traditional libertarianism or classical liberalism.</p><p> Meanwhile, on the progressive side of the aisle, writers like Ezra Klein have begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/29/opinion/biden-liberalism-infrastructure-building.html">focus on low state capacity</a> as a reason why it&#39;s hard for progressives to accomplish their objectives.

Here are just a few of the reasons why.</p><h4> Bureaucrats vs. NEPA</h4><p> Maybe this is just my personal experience, but I find that when Americans say the word “bureaucracy”, they tend to mean “a bunch of regulations and red tape”, rather than “the civil service”. This sets up an implicit dichotomy between private-sector individuals and companies that just want to do their thing, and civil servants who work tirelessly to enforce rules that prevent them from doing their thing.</p><p> For example, this is the depiction of environmental regulation in the movie <em>Ghostbusters</em> (another of my favorites). Our heroes have set up a private business trapping and imprisoning dangerous ghosts. Then Walter Peck, a bureaucrat from the Environmental Protection Agency, shows up and tells them that the rules forbid them from doing this, eventually managing to shut them down (which causes a citywide catastrophe). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg" width="1000" height="563" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:563,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72751,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89c7fa04-bf97-4951-8697-6b9a5c1e694c_1000x563.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> This is also <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Agency">the depiction</a> of environmental regulation in <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> , in which the EPA tries to stop pollution by sending an army to take over Springfield and encasing it in a giant dome.</p><p> But in fact, this is not actually how the most cumbersome environmental regulation works in America! Instead, we have <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-big-nepa-roundup">laws like NEPA</a> and its stronger state-level equivalents like CEQA, which farm out the job of environmental regulation to citizens and the courts. <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-nepa-works">The way it works</a> is this: A developer starts work on a project, like a solar plant or an apartment complex. Then private citizens who don&#39;t want that project in their backyards — because of concern over scenic views, or property values, or “neighborhood character”, or whatever — sue the developer in court. Even if the project satisfies all relevant environmental laws from day 1, citizens can sue the developer under NEPA or CEQA to force it to stop the project and complete a cumbersome environmental review — basically, a ton of paperwork. This often delays the project for years, and drives up costs immensely — which of course discourages many developers from even trying to build anything in the first place.</p><p> Enforcing environmental regulation via judicialized procedural review has had devastating consequences on <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-build-nothing-country">America&#39;s ability to build the thing we need</a> . Housing projects are routinely <a href="https://twitter.com/drvolts/status/1699274424854401281">held up by NIMBYs</a> using environmental review laws to sue developers, often under the most ridiculous of pretexts (such as labeling human noise from apartment complexes <a href="https://calmatters.org/housing/2023/08/ceqa-noise-pollution/">a form of pollution</a> ). The solar plants and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1704574665568498082?t=xePZeWVvwSihO7L6WpCDNw&amp;s=19">battery factories</a> and <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31377/w31377.pdf">transmission lines</a> that we need to decarbonize our economy <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1700240332070244609">aren&#39;t getting built</a> nearly as fast as they should, because they&#39;re getting held up by these review laws. And remember that most of these projects aren&#39;t violating any environmental review laws in the first place — the NIMBYs have the right to sue and hold up development <em>regardless of whether any regulation is actually being violated!</em></p><p> Which raises an obvious question: How can we <em>know</em> if no environmental regulation is being violated, other than waiting for a lawsuit and a multi-year environmental review? The answer is: <strong>bureaucrats.</strong> The answer is that you have a bunch of government workers examine the project and make sure it checks all the relevant regulatory boxes, and then if it does, you simply allow the project to go ahead, without lawsuits or multi-year studies. This is called “ <a href="https://www.citystructure.com/blog/what-is-ministerial-approval-process">ministerial approval</a> ” or “ministerial review”. This is how Japan does things, which is why they&#39;ve been able to <a href="https://jamesjgleeson.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/how-tokyo-built-its-way-to-abundant-housing/">build enough housing</a> to keep rent affordable.</p><p> NIMBYs are absolutely <em>terrified</em> of ministerial review. I strongly encourage you to read <a href="https://twitter.com/cafedujord/status/1715778140595970228">this thread</a> by Jordan Grimes, detailing the dismay of a NIMBY pressure group at a raft of new pro-housing laws in California. The <a href="https://twitter.com/cafedujord/status/1715783029975859585">most terrifying prospect</a> , for the opponents of new housing, turns out to be “as-of-right” development, which means a bureaucrat gets to decide whether to allow a housing project rather than a lawsuit and a judge.</p><p> In other words, environmental regulation doesn&#39;t threaten America&#39;s economy via a sea of red tape enforced by an army of punctilious bureaucrats. It threatens America&#39;s economy via a plague of lawsuits and pointless paperwork that we implemented <em><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article-abstract/32/3/610/6380787">as an alternative</a> to hiring an army of punctilious bureaucrats</em> . If we scrapped this legalistic permitting regime and replaced it with an army of bureaucrats, we would still be able to protect the environment just fine, but we would be able to do it without causing insane multi-year delays and driving costs to the moon.</p><p> The nine most terrifying words in the English language are not “I&#39;m from the Government and I&#39;m here to help”. Nine far more terrifying words are: “Please spend four years completing your Environmental Impact Statement.”</p><h4> Bureaucrats vs. nonprofits and consultants</h4><p> Even as environmental regulation has been outsourced to the courts, a huge variety of other government functions have been outsourced to nonprofits. In a post back in May, I argued that this represented a toxic compromise between anti-government conservatives who wanted to shrink the state and progressives who wanted to increase community input into policymaking: </p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;be4837ba-d71f-4ff8-aebe-03b9130a96cb&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;This Friday, the internet was treated to a highly amusing spectacle: &#8220;La Sombrita&#8221;, a new piece of infrastructure created by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the nonprofit Kounkuey Design Initiative:&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nonprofits are sapping the progressive project &quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:8243895,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Noah Smith&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Econ blogger&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89fd964a-586f-461a-9f5a-ea4587d45728_397x441.png&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:10000}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2023-05-20T22:22:25.120Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe46358f-37f5-4e27-b83d-a6070206ff1a_1200x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/nonprofits-are-sapping-the-progressive&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:122705995,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:268,&quot;comment_count&quot;:98,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Noahpinion&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04281755-2cd6-42e5-a496-e69153abebb2_281x281.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p> Some excerpts from that post:</p><blockquote><p> We do know that <a href="https://learning.candid.org/resources/knowledge-base/how-are-nonprofits-funded/">about a third of nonprofit funding</a> comes from government purchases and grants, and that nonprofit revenue <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/nonprofit-statistics/">rose by about 70% in inflation-adjusted terms</a> from 1998 to 2016. A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation — $2.62 trillion in nonprofit revenue in 2016, 32.3% from government — says that this would equate to <strong>around $850 billion in government spending on nonprofits</strong> in the US</p><p> That&#39;s about 13% of all government spending, including state and local, spent via nonprofits. Compare that to about 18.4% of government spending spent on actual government workers as of 2022. We&#39;ve outsourced a significant amount of our government to nonprofits. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2022/07/06/nonprofits-critical-role-in-deploying-federal-investments-observations-from-the-transforming-cities-lab/">Here&#39;s a brief overview</a> of some of the ways this work is outsourced. Of course the number includes things like public university funding (universities are also nonprofits). But a lot of it is just paying organizations to administer government spending.</p></blockquote><p> Outsourcing government functions to nonprofits — which is definitely a form of privatization, even if no one is officially making a profit — has a number of problems. First there&#39;s the obvious danger of corruption, in which <a href="https://sfstandard.com/politics/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">nonprofits line their pockets</a> by using taxpayer money to help elect leaders who give them more taxpayer money. Of course this money is paid out in executive salaries rather than “profit”, but it amounts to the same thing.</p><p> But even more important is what economists call an “agency problem”. Nonprofits would rather get the government to give them as much money as possible; they would love to rip the government off. And if all the expertise involved in building housing or providing social services resides in the nonprofits instead of the government itself, the government <em>doesn&#39;t have the ability to judge whether it&#39;s getting ripped off</em> . Here&#39;s how I put it in my earlier post:</p><blockquote><p> When the government controls the purse strings but only the contractors know how much things should really cost, you get the worst of both worlds — a government that doesn&#39;t know how to save taxpayer money, paying contractors who don&#39;t <em>want</em> to save taxpayer money.</p></blockquote><p> This problem is especially acute in San Francisco, which <a href="https://twitter.com/bilalmahmood/status/1700549247979176134">makes it extremely difficult</a> to hire workers for the civil service, and has taken nonprofit-outsourcing to an extreme. (In fact, if you want to read a fun satire about nonprofit-outsourcing in SF in the late 60s and 70s, check out Tom Wolfe&#39;s essay “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Chic_%26_Mau-Mauing_the_Flak_Catchers">Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers</a> ”.) Investigations have shown that oversight of SF nonprofits has been <a href="https://sfstandard.com/politics/city-records-show-sf-failed-to-properly-monitor-nonprofits-that-got-millions/">extremely poor</a> — in part because the city got rid of the bureaucrats who could have done that monitoring effectively. Massive inefficiencies are allowed to fester for years, only coming to light after elected officials discover the problems and raise the alarm. <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/09/05/san-francisco-drug-treatment-audit/">The most recent blowup</a> I&#39;ve seen is over an addiction treatment nonprofit:</p><blockquote><p> A San Francisco supervisor is calling for an audit of the city&#39;s largest addiction treatment nonprofit after word leaked that a staffing shortage forced the organization&#39;s detox program to pause intakes last week…</p><p> HealthRight 360 is the largest drug treatment provider in San Francisco and is slated to receive more than $200 million from the city this fiscal year, according to a city database.</p><p> “This is not to cast aspersions on anyone, but I am truly concerned that we are paying for a service that they&#39;re not able to provide,” Stefani said at Tuesday&#39;s hearing.</p></blockquote><p> Of course this doesn&#39;t mean that bureaucrats always have the right incentives. With the wrong funding incentives, civil service agencies can fall into a trap in which they try to maximize the amount they spend each year in order to increase their budgets for future years. An efficient bureaucracy requires avoiding perverse incentives like that. But when the funds are being spent via nonprofits instead of government workers, the incentives are much harder to get right, because the government lacks most of the levers of control that it has over its own workforce.</p><p> Of course, the agency problems doesn&#39;t just apply to nonprofits, but to any government contractors. And when it comes to transportation planning, a huge problem is the amount that governments have come to rely on consultants. The <a href="https://transitcosts.com/">Transit Cost Project</a> has been looking into the question of why it costs so much more to build each mile of train in the US than in other rich countries (most of which have stronger unions). Their <a href="https://transitcosts.com/Final-Report/">big report</a> , released earlier this year, found that state and local governments&#39; excessive reliance on outside consultants rather than in-house bureaucratic expertise was a huge driver of excess cost. Here are some excerpts from <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/02/subway-costs-us-europe-public-transit-funds.html">a great writeup</a> by Henry Grabar:</p><blockquote><p> [M]any of the [transit cost] problems can be traced to a larger philosophy: outsourcing government expertise to a retainer of consultants…</p><p> For example, when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority got to work on the Green Line Extension, the agency only had a <em>half-dozen</em> full-time employees managing the largest capital project the MBTA had ever undertaken. On New York&#39;s Second Avenue subway, the most expensive mile of subway ever built, consultant contracts were more than 20 percent of construction costs—more than double what&#39;s standard in France or Italy. By 2011, the MTA had trimmed its in-house capital projects management group of 1,600 full-time employees (circa 1990) to just 124, tasked with steering $20 billion in investment. Perhaps the most notorious case in this business is the debacle of the California High-Speed Rail project, which in its early years had a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-high-speed-rail-consultants-20190426-story.html">tiny full-time staff managing hundreds of millions of dollars in consulting contracts</a> …</p><p> It&#39;s that lack of institutional know-how, of which consultants are both a symptom and a cause, that really hampers projects…It means staff are overwhelmed by change orders as projects evolve. In the case of New York&#39;s Second Avenue subway, the lack of a powerful, effective team of civil servants may also explain some inexplicable conflicts and mistakes: misunderstandings and feuds with local agencies, hugely overbuilt stations, and so little standardization that the escalators in the three new stops were built by three different companies.</p></blockquote><p> Would replacing some of these consultants with government bureaucrats really lower costs? <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4522676">A recent paper</a> by Zachary Liscow, William Nober, and Cailin Slattery suggests that it would:</p><blockquote><p> [W]e find evidence that state capacity correlates inversely with costs in a several ways. States with (perceived) higher quality DOT employees have lower costs. A state with a neutral rating has almost 30% higher costs per mile than one that rates the DOT employees as “moderately high quality”, all else equal. Consistent with the capacity hypothesis, states that flag concerns about consultant costs have higher costs. States where contractors and procurement officials expect more change orders have significantly higher costs. Frequent change orders could directly lead to higher costs through delays and costly renegotiation; they could also be a downstream symptom of poor administrative capacity at a state DOT—many contractors reference poor-quality project plans made by third-party consultants. Moreover, when we measure capacity using external data we show that states with higher DOT capacity have lower infrastructure costs. A one standard deviation increase in capacity is correlated with 16% lower costs.</p></blockquote><p> And <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31559">a recent paper</a> by Maggie Shi finds that when the government monitors Medicare spending more closely, it reduces waste by a huge amount:</p><blockquote><p> Every dollar Medicare spent on monitoring generated $24–29 in government savings. The majority of savings stem from the deterrence of future care, rather than reclaimed payments from prior care. I do not find evidence that the health of the marginal patient is harmed, indicating that monitoring primarily deters low-value care. Monitoring does increase provider administrative costs, but these costs are mostly incurred upfront and include investments in technology to assess the medical necessity of care.</p></blockquote><p> And guess who&#39;s responsible for monitoring Medicare spending? Bureaucrats. So that&#39;s at least a <em>2300% return on investment</em> in bureaucracy!</p><p> In sum, the years since the 1970s have been a massive experiment in whether a government, by outsourcing core functions to private actors like nonprofits and consultants, can increase the efficiency with which public funds are spent. <em>That experiment has failed</em> , and it needs to be reversed.</p><h4> Preparing for the next threat</h4><p> I became painfully aware of the problems of a weak bureaucracy during the early days of the Covid pandemic. I started a group to help encourage state public health agencies to improve contact tracing — an approach that ultimately proved futile due to hyper-infectious mutations. But back when the virus was less contagious and we still thought contact tracing might work, my partners and I had some meetings with government workers at the CDC. It was clear that they had absolutely no resources to commit to our project, and that they were overwhelmed with other demands.</p><p> Perhaps that&#39;s to be expected in the middle of a massive pandemic. But it was also clear that the CDC workers we talked to didn&#39;t know a lot of basic facts about how their organization worked; there was lots of data that they had no idea how to find, or even who was responsible for collecting it, and they had little concept of who was responsible for contact tracing at the state level. Those are things they should have known long before the pandemic even started.</p><p> In fact, the pathetic crisis performance of the CDC — which before the pandemic was often believed to be one of our most competent government agencies — is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/briefing/monkeypox-cdc-walensky-covid.html">the stuff of legend</a> . Most damningly, the agency was unable to collect even the most basic data on the spread of the virus — data that private individuals were <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">forced to collect</a> in its stead. In addition, it made numerous bad recommendations that were later reversed, issued confusing guidance, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2020-03-04/coronavirus-might-make-americans-miss-big-government">failed to develop Covid tests</a> in the early days of the pandemic. The agency is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02354-6/fulltext">now being reformed</a> , but it&#39;s not yet clear how deep the reforms go.</p><p> But what I&#39;m most afraid of is not another pandemic; it&#39;s a major war. In <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/were-not-ready-for-the-big-one">a widely-read post</a> last week, I warned that a war with China over Taiwan is a lot more likely than most Americans seem to realize, and that we need to be preparing for that grim possibility right now. China&#39;s state apparatus is famously effective in building large amounts of stuff very quickly — in the space of just a few years, while the US was failing to build even a small amount of high-speed rail, China <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/where-china-is-beating-the-world">built a high-speed rail network</a> that dwarfed American transit advocates&#39; wildest dreams. In a war situation, China&#39;s massive production advantage means that the US will be at a dramatic disadvantage in a protracted conflict. We do not have the equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Production_Management">effective bureaucracies</a> that we created in the runup to World War 2.</p><p> But even beyond military production, the US needs to do lots of preparation for the possibility of a China conflict. Private companies need to audit their supply chains to make sure they can sustain production in the event of a war. The US government needs to ensure that critical minerals can be accessed without reliance on Chinese processing facilities. And the government needs to revive the defense-industrial base, so we don&#39;t see bottlenecks of the kind we encountered when we tried to produce Covid masks, tests, and ventilators in the early days of the pandemic.</p><p> All of this requires a large, competent, well-funded bureaucracy. Yet I worry that neither progressives nor conservatives understand this need. Progressives still seem <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1700240330363228601">wedded to the idea of defending NEPA</a> , while conservatives still seem wedded to the idea of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/09/trump-desantis-republicans-dismantle-deep-state/675378/">slashing and burning any government agency they can</a> . It&#39;s a toxic equilibrium in which one side wants to drown the government in a bathtub and the other wants to outsource it to every NIMBY and nonprofit in the country.</p><p> To reestablish US state capacity, we have to sail between the rocks of both of these disastrous approaches. We have to rebuild the civil service, with sufficient long-term funding guarantees, talent, and size. For all our sake, we need to bring back the bureaucrats. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper"

<em>“No! Quite wrong! Open the gates!” — Baron von Munchausen</em></p><p> In <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-b4e">my roundup this week</a> , I endorsed Marc Andreessen&#39;s “ <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a> ”. I noted a couple points of disagreement, but overall I think this sort of uncompromising blast of techno-accelerationism is exactly the kind of extropian enthusiasm we need to shake us out of the doldrums of the gloomy 2010s.</p><p> But still, Marc&#39;s manifesto doesn&#39;t quite articulate how <em>I</em> think about techno-optimism; there&#39;s a good deal of overlap, sure, but I think there&#39;s a lot to be gained from reformulating the idea in my own words, so that when I say I&#39;m a “techno-optimist”, people know exactly what that means.</p><p> Well, here is what I mean.</p><h4> Different types of optimism: Positive vs. normative, active vs. passive</h4><p> When people use the word “optimism”, they can mean various things, so I think it&#39;s good to start with a taxonomy. First, when it comes to technological progress, there are basically two things you can be optimistic about:</p><ol><li><p> You can think that there&#39;s a lot of useful technology out there <strong>left to discover</strong> .</p></li><li><p> You can think that new technology will <strong>make the world better</strong> .</p></li></ol><p> Borrowing a term from economics, I could call these “positive” and “normative” techno-optimism.</p><p> It&#39;s obvious that these aren&#39;t the same thing. For example, I often say I&#39;m “optimistic” that there will be huge advances in autonomous drone technology over the next decade. But I also think that this will <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-u-s-test-intelligent-drone-swarms-in-race-for-military-ai-dominance-db361265">mostly be used for war</a> , rather than for civilian applications like delivering packages. Now that isn&#39;t necessarily bad news for humanity — a future where war evolves into robots fighting other robots in the skies could mean a lot fewer dead human beings. I&#39;m just not very <em>confident</em> that powerful new military technologies will lead to improvements in human welfare. What I am confident about is my prediction that these technologies are <em>possible</em> .</p><p> Positive techno-optimism is basically the opposite of <em>stagnationism</em> . In recent years, a number of thinkers have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728">started to say</a> that humanity has basically picked the low-hanging fruit of what the Universe can do, and that future innovation will <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">get a lot more expensive</a> — or even slow to a trickle. Positive techno-optimism says that no, there&#39;s still a lot of low-hanging fruit, and relative to our total GDP it&#39;s still not that expensive to find it.</p><p> Normative techno-optimism is different. It says that more technology will make the world a better place for humanity. In fact, this kind of techno-optimism is surprisingly rare — even some of my favorite science fiction stories are implicitly or explicitly built around the idea that no matter how our capabilities improve, humans&#39; fundamental brutish nature will never change. As far as I can tell, this very prevalent attitude comes from the World Wars in the 20th century, in which the industrial technologies that were deployed to improve living standards before 1914 were turned to destructive purposes. There are a few people who argue that more technology makes us better people — Steve Pinker made this argument in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a></em> , and I think it&#39;s the implicit premise of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barrayar-Vorkosigan-Saga-McMaster-Bujold-ebook/dp/B005BFIH7M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MX3BSKOH04L2&amp;keywords=barrayar&amp;qid=1697823068&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=barraya%2Cstripbooks%2C149&amp;sr=1-1">Lois McMaster Bujold&#39;s science fiction</a> .</p><p> So that&#39;s one distinction. For both of these, you can then define both <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em> forms of optimism. Passive optimism is basically just the belief that technology either <em>will</em> keep progressing at a rapid clip, and/or that it <em>will</em> improve human life, no matter what we do. Active optimism is the idea that technology will keep progressing and/or improve human life <em>only if</em> we humans take the appropriate actions to make sure this happens. Active optimism is what Gramsci and others have called “optimism of the will”. You could also call these “unconditional” and “conditional” optimism.</p><p> So you could define a little two-by-two chart: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg" width="778" height="594" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:594,&quot;width&quot;:778,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:67084,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08bed4a3-f82c-4890-ac62-e504b55e3c1f_778x594.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> Obviously these aren&#39;t all mutually exclusive. For example, you could think that technological progress is inevitable, but that it&#39;ll only benefit humanity if we choose the right policies. Or you could believe that technological progress will only continue if we choose the right policies, but that if it does continue, it&#39;ll automatically be good for the world. Etc.</p><p> Personally, I subscribe to both positive and normative techno-optimism, but with reservations in both cases. I think there are plenty of new important discoveries out there to be made, but I do think it&#39;s likely that they&#39;ve become more expensive to find. I also think technology <em>usually</em> ends up making life better for most people, but that this isn&#39;t <em>always</em> the case.</p><p> In both cases, though, I&#39;m more of an active than a passive optimist. Whether it comes to sustaining the rate of innovation or making sure that innovations benefit humankind, I think that choosing the right policies is very important.</p><p> So let me unpack why I think these things.</p><h4> Techno-optimism is humanism </h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg" width="644" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:644,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:161274,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2038b52-af78-4e1b-9eb2-c416a99e9f44_644x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/emikusano">@emikusano</a></figcaption></figure></div><p> When Americans think of “technology” they tend to imagine some complicated piece of machinery — maybe something with a screen. But I prefer to think of it in the sense of the Japanese word 技術, which can also mean “technique” or “skill”. This is a much more general definition, and it&#39;s basically the way economists think about technology.</p><p> In economics, what technology does is to expand the set of things society can consume — in other words, it expands our collective set of choices. This doesn&#39;t mean it always expands <em>individual</em> choice — for example, in the age of the internet and cell phones, it&#39;s a lot harder to go off the grid. But if humanity collectively wanted it, we could return to a world where it&#39;s easy to go off the grid; the internet and cell phones give us the <em>option</em> to do this or not, whereas in 1960 we didn&#39;t have that choice.</p><p> The idea of increasing humanity&#39;s collective set of choices is closely related to the economic concept of GDP. GDP is defined by how much people choose to pay, in total, for the things we produce; in other words, it&#39;s just a measure of human choice. It&#39;s not a perfect correspondence, because there&#39;s stuff that GDP leaves out (leisure, inequality, and so on). But it&#39;s pretty closely related. This is why a lot of people talk about the benefits of technology by pointing to a graph like this: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg" width="1020" height="710" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:710,&quot;width&quot;:1020,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:85931,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26197-767f-469e-a87e-eda090f06a73_1020x710.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div><p> Of course, total GDP represents two things: <em>how much each person pays</em> for stuff, and <em>how many people there are</em> to pay.

And in fact, these choices may change over time. As technology has progressed, humans have chosen to have fewer and fewer kids, and world population <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/humanity-is-going-to-shrink">looks likely to shrink</a> in the not-too-distant future. If that&#39;s what we decide we want, then so be it.</p><p> The main reason I think technological progress is usually good for humanity — why I&#39;m a techno-optimist of the “normative” variety — is that I fundamentally believe that humans should be given as much choice as possible. This isn&#39;t something I can prove with facts — it&#39;s just a moral intuition. I am a humanist. I see human beings wanting things, and I want to give them what they want. This doesn&#39;t always mean humans will be <em>happier</em> when they get what they want; sometimes we make choices that make us unhappy. But as a humanist, I believe my species has the right to choose.</p><p> But remember, <em>collective</em> choice is not the same as <em>individual</em> choice. Many choices that societies make go against the choices that individuals make — such as when society throws you in jail for committing a crime. Techno-optimism of the normative, humanist variety requires a belief that on average, over the long run, societies will make choices that result in greater individual choice as well — that some sort of liberalism will eventually prevail. So it&#39;s a bit of <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/is-the-end-of-history-back-on-track">a Fukuyaman idea</a> as well. It entails a belief that society — generally, eventually — does what&#39;s right for the individual.</p><p> That belief often doesn&#39;t pan out. The USSR invented quite a lot of important technologies, but it impoverished its people in pursuit of an ideology that ultimately proved itself to be anti-humanist. Nor do I think repressive societies inevitably fail — just look at China&#39;s economic dominance combined with increasing totalitarian control. In fact, China&#39;s use of new technology to build a new kind of digital totalitarianism is <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-super-scary-theory-of-the-21st">presenting a stern challenge</a> to my techno-optimism. But I suppose things are still much better there than during the Cultural Revolution or the centuries before.</p><p> I also worry that humanity&#39;s collective choices will hurt those who don&#39;t get a voice — namely, animals. We may ultimately become good stewards of the natural world, and there are definite moves in that direction in rich countries. But so far, our expansion of population and production has <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-is-the-sixth-mass-extinction-and-what-can-we-do-about-it">brought destruction</a> upon most of our fellow animals, because <em>our</em> choices are not the same as <em>their</em> choices. So that&#39;s something that tempers my techno-optimism, and it&#39;s something I think we need to fix.</p><p> But anyway, at its core, techno-optimism is a belief that humanity deserves to have more collective control over the Universe. And despite some reservations, overall I do believe that. I would not return the planet to the conditions of the year 1000, or 1800, or 1971. (As for whether I&#39;d return it to 2012, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">ask me in a few years</a> .)</p><h4> Why there&#39;s lots of technology left to discover</h4><p> I&#39;m also a techno-optimist of the “positive” variety — I think we have a <em>lot</em> more useful stuff left to discover. The reason I believe this is because <em>the nature of technology itself discourages humans from discovering it</em> .</p><p> Let me explain what that means. When one person makes a scientific discovery or invents a new manufacturing technique or whatever, they usually get some credit for it — a promotion and a raise, or some intellectual recognition. Sometimes they even get a huge monetary reward, if they build a successful company around their innovation. But in general, most of the benefit of a new innovation goes to other people who didn&#39;t spend any effort or money on discovering it. It goes to copycats and “fast followers” who copy or reverse-engineer or steal the new technology. It goes to other innovators who build on that discovery. And so on.</p><p> This is called a “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">positive externality</a> ”. In fact, science itself is very close to what economists would call a “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">pure public good</a> ”, except in wartime. And one thing economics teaches us is that <em>public goods are under-provided</em> ; the incentive for innovation isn&#39;t as strong as it should be. (And this is true for anything that has a positive externality, not just public goods!) Why should I spend my life in a lab discovering things that someone else will monetize? And so not enough people spend their life in a lab.</p><p> (This is what Marc means when he says that technological innovation is “philanthropy”. Obviously, philanthropy is wildly insufficient to solve most social ills, and by the same token, innovation for the love of innovation is wildly insufficient to propel technological progress as fast as it ought to go.)</p><p> Our society has developed a number of mechanisms to combat the problem of insufficient innovation. We give innovators patent monopolies to increase their financial reward (though this also harms some innovation by creating <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25713">patent trolls</a> ). We use the government to fund basic research — not just basic science, but <a href="https://www.itpro.com/technology/34730/10-amazing-darpa-inventions">applied stuff</a> as well. We give tax credits for corporate R&amp;D.</p><p> The reason I&#39;m an optimist about the opportunities for future progress is that I believe <em>these measures are still wildly insufficient</em> . <a href="https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/ijugr2h6/release/11">Plausible models suggest</a> that the economic return to increased R&amp;D spending, in terms of increased GDP, is still very high. Which means that if we spent more — or incentivized innovation in other ways — we would discover and invent a lot more stuff, a lot faster.</p><p> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">The evidence</a> that new technologies are getting harder to find is fairly plausible. In the 1600s, one person tinkering in a fairly rudimentary lab could discover fundamental laws of the Universe; that might still be possible now, but it doesn&#39;t happen much these days. Some new fields, like synthetic biology, are somewhat amenable to cheap innovation in a lone hobbyist&#39;s <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/bio2.0/the_promises_demands_and_risks/">garage</a> , but others, like AI, require vast physical <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-data-center-costs-linked-to-ai-demands-fc6adc0e">resources</a> in order to push the envelope.</p><p> But as new discoveries have gotten more expensive on average, our society has gotten richer, and is better able to afford the increasing expenditures required for continued innovation. That&#39;s why in the short term at least, I&#39;m optimistic that there&#39;s lots left to discover.</p><p> Of course, <em>this requires that we get the policies right</em> — the very same externality that assures me that there&#39;s lots left to discover is also the reason why <em>we might not discover it</em> . In particular, there are two things I&#39;m worried about here. First, I worry that political chaos and division in rich countries (especially the US) will make us less willing to fund R&amp;D — already there are worrying signs, such as Congress <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/chips-manufacturing-congress-subsidy">stalling the science funding</a> of the bipartisan CHIPS Act. And second, I worry that China&#39;s theft of intellectual property has reached such <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/five-eyes-intelligence-chiefs-warn-chinas-theft-intellectual-property-2023-10-18/">enormous proportions</a> that other countries&#39; return to innovation has fallen.</p><p> So I&#39;m a techno-optimist of the will, but we will need the will, and that&#39;s not a trivial thing to muster. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:285365,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b5d47c5-6dff-480f-80df-16497de000b8_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/terrorproforma/status/1710130515477684610">@terrorproforma</a></figcaption></figure></div><h4> The “all hands on deck” approach to technological progress</h4><p> Because sustaining technological progress is so hard, it needs a whole-of-society approach in order to get it right. It&#39;s not something that can be adequately handled only by big corporations, or only by VC-funded startups, or only by universities, or only by the government, etc. etc. These different innovators all focus on different areas of technology and have different incentive structures, so <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25893">we need them all</a> .</p><p> And the <em>implementation</em> of technology requires <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPinkston/status/1714088788237180947">an even broader set</a> of institutions. It doesn&#39;t matter if green energy technologies get fabulously cheap if we can&#39;t get past <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-big-nepa-roundup">NEPA</a> in order to build them. The USSR was first in space, but their space program didn&#39;t really help their people (unlike America&#39;s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies">which did</a> ).</p><p> The array of institutions we need to propel technology forward is surprisingly broad. In his manifesto, Marc lists various “enemies” — not people, but ideas and institutions that he thinks restrict the growth of technology. Some of these, like degrowth, belong on the list. But some of his “enemies” aren&#39;t enemies at all, but important institutions that need to be co-opted in the drive for faster innovation. These include:</p><ul><li><p> statism and central planning</p></li><li><p> bureaucracy</p></li><li><p> monopolies</p></li></ul><p> I&#39;ve already talked about why important government is for accelerating technological progress, and if you think about this concretely, it&#39;s hard to think of a major technological breakthrough that didn&#39;t involve public-private partnerships. The Covid vaccines and the wave of mRNA innovation they unleashed are only the most recent example, but the Manhattan Project began the nuclear age (and government funding has been crucial for nuclear power), the Human Genome Project launched the genetics revolution, DARPA helped create the internet, and so on. The NSF, the NIH, DARPA, BARDA, NASA, the national laboratories…all have a storied history of propelling forward the march of innovation (often to the US&#39; great benefit). This is not “central planning” in the traditional Soviet sense, but it&#39;s certainly statist.</p><p> As for bureaucracy, this certainly can be harmful to technological progress, but if done right, it can be a great help. For example, look at what NEPA — a law that allows private citizens to tie projects in court for years doing cumbersome paperwork even if they already satisfy all environmental laws — <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-build-nothing-country">has done to our ability</a> to build physical technology in the United States. The alternative to things like NEPA is a <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brinkpaper.pdf">competent, efficient bureaucracy</a> that can quickly determine whether projects satisfy environmental laws, and approve them rapidly if they do. That&#39;s why more <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html">libertarians</a> are <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/08/state-capacity-as-an-organizational-problem.html">recognizing</a> the crucial importance of state capacity.</p><p> Finally, monopolies can certainly choke off economic activity. But it&#39;s hard to ignore the fact that many of our most important scientific discoveries and technological innovations — including the transistor and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf">generative AI</a> , two essential pillars of the information technology revolution — came from the corporate laboratories of big monopoly companies. Bell Labs&#39; history of innovation <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-dream-of-bringing-back-bell-labs">is legendary</a> , and someday Google&#39;s <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-industry-now-dominates-ai-research">dominance</a> of basic AI research will be legendary as well. Importantly, neither Bell nor Google, monopolies though they were, ended up reaping most of the benefits of the discoveries they made; because they were monopolies, and had a huge cushion of profit with which to fund research, they were able to temporarily ignore the externality problem of technological innovation, acting more like a government lab or a university than a profit-seeking company.</p><p> So anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by scrappy inventors in their garages, while government and big business merely parasitizes off of their labors, is deeply wrong. And anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by government planners, while the private sector merely parasitizes off of government&#39;s efforts, is also deeply wrong. The externality problem of technology is deep enough and complex enough where society needs an “all hands on deck” approach to innovation — our various institutions have to supplement and complement each other, each pushing the boundaries of technology in a different direction, and working together when applicable. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg" width="900" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:344405,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09625848-cc1d-420d-82ad-b881fbfeff73_900x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/terrorproforma">@terrorproforma</a></figcaption></figure></div><h4> Society is a UX for technology</h4><p> A depressingly large number of people seem to see technology and society as fundamentally in competition — a battle between amoral scientists and greedy techbros on one hand, and the forces of social responsibility and the greater good on the other. This worldview sees technologists as fundamentally a type of pirate, sailing the high seas in search of plunder while the navy of social responsibility chases them around.</p><p> To my mind, this way of seeing things is wrongheaded and highly counterproductive. The reason is that technology, as I said before, is a fundamentally <em>humanistic</em> enterprise — it increases the collective options available to human societies.</p><p> This means two things. First of all, it means that the fundamental purpose of creating new technologies is to empower society. If you&#39;re working on a new cancer drug or a new image recognition AI or a new semiconductor manufacturing process, what you&#39;re doing is giving society more choices — how much more cancer treatment to give people, whether to build better image search systems or implement universal surveillance, how much more compute to manufacture and what to use it for, etc. Which of these choices society makes is up to society; if you&#39;re an innovator, you&#39;re not putting power in your own hands, <em>you&#39;re putting power in society&#39;s hands</em> .</p><p> All the famous arguments for scientists and engineers refusing to build certain technologies — nuclear weapons, AI, etc. — were based on the idea that society doesn&#39;t have the ability to make good choices about how to use these things, and that individuals (the scientists and inventors themselves) are better equipped to decide. Once you invent or discover something, how it gets used is out of your hands, so the only way technologists can actually buck the will of society is by <em>refusing to innovate</em> . Innovation requires faith in society, while it&#39;s lack of faith ultimately leads to decelerationist impulses.</p><p> The second reason society and technology aren&#39;t separable is that <em>society is itself a technology</em> in the more general sense that I laid out earlier. Specifically, society is the user experience (UX) of other technologies; it determines how individual humans experience the power that technology yields.</p><p> To understand this, consider digital surveillance technologies. The United States and China have chosen to use these technologies in very different ways. In the US, you&#39;re likely to use webcams to keep track of your pet rabbit, or to film fun videos, or to stream yourself playing video games, or for various other enjoyable pursuits. In China you can do these things as well, but there&#39;s much less privacy when you do them, because the state is always watching. And on top of those individual fun uses, China has employed networked cameras to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1118105165/surveillance-state-explores-chinas-tech-and-social-media-control-systems">create a digital panopticon</a> where citizens are never free of the state&#39;s prying eyes. For the country&#39;s minorities, this panopticon is as terrifying as anything out of a George Orwell novel.</p><p> In other words, it&#39;s society&#39;s responsibility to use technologies for good instead of for evil. Sometimes this can take a long time to figure out — print media technologies like the printing press caused a lot of disruption and conflict when they were first introduced, and only with time did we learn how to use them responsibly. I expect something similar is happening with social media right now. It took many years to implement the labor regulations that make factory work tolerable instead of hellish, the consumer protections that made meat and cars and air travel safe for the general public, and the environmental regulations that cleaned up our air and water. And along the way our societies made many missteps (eg NEPA) that we&#39;re now having to fix.</p><p> But although this is a difficult process, it&#39;s an utterly necessary one. Technology&#39;s purpose is to benefit humans (and hopefully someday, animals and other sentient beings as well), and society&#39;s role is to figure out how to distribute those benefits widely. This is, of course, in addition to society&#39;s role in supporting innovation.</p><p> In other words, there is no boundary between technology and society. They are part of a single unified entity — one whose scope is even broader than <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/interview-kevin-kelly-editor-author">the “technium”</a> itself. They are components of the organism of humankind. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg" width="960" height="1200" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:371943,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51633709-0b33-4e85-a407-bb690a71c993_960x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/enterlinkart/status/1708875119022497958">@enterlinkart</a></figcaption></figure></div><h4> Sustainability is technology</h4><p> Finally, I&#39;d like to say a word about sustainability. In his manifesto, Marc identifies “sustainability”, in quotes, as one of the enemies of techno-optimism. But while he might be referring to people who cloak degrowth ideas under a false banner of sustainability, actual sustainability is <em>not</em> an enemy of techno-optimism. Indeed, it&#39;s a core part of it. Being able to sustain technological society into the indefinite future is, itself, a fundamental goal of innovation. And the way to accomplish that sustenance is almost always <em>more</em> innovation, not less.</p><p> Consider an imaginary simple little example — an economy that&#39;s just a small band of people and a grove of fruit trees that sustains them. The people can&#39;t digest the seeds, so the seeds either get thrown away or pass through their digestive tract and end up fertilizing new fruit trees, and the little cycle sustains itself. But then the people invent a technology that allows them to cook the seeds and digest them. This increases their caloric intake in the short term; if we were measuring GDP and consumption, we&#39;d see both go up. But because cooking the seeds prevents the fruit trees from reproducing, eventually the fruit tries die out and the people go hungry. Oops!</p><p> What&#39;s the solution to this problem? Well, one fairly unhappy solution is <em>degrowth</em> ; people could simply not cook the seeds, so that they stay in the old equilibrium. But a better solution is <em>more technology</em> . If the people invent a way to intensively cultivate seeds into new trees, they can cook and eat <em>some</em> of the seeds today, and plant the rest in a controlled manner so that they can still sustain the orchard indefinitely. Technology got them into trouble, but eventually technology gets them out of trouble too.</p><p> In fact, this kind of innovation is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Surprising-Learned-Resources_and/dp/1982103574">very common</a> , and you can see a pretty close analogy here with fossil fuels. Nature gifted humanity with an abundance of coal, oil, and natural gas, but eventually these fuels get more expensive to extract — and that&#39;s not even considering the impact of climate change. Technology can keep extraction cheap for a while, but eventually that runs out. But if we use the industrial society enabled by fossil fuels to create more stable alternatives — solar power and eventually fusion power — then we&#39;ll be able to sustain and grow that industrial society for far longer than if we stuck with fossil fuels forever.</p><p> More generally, technological progress is all about tomorrow being better than today. If there&#39;s no tomorrow, today matters much less; the promise of an incomprehensibly bright future is a major reason we struggle so hard to innovate and push the envelope today. This is a point made forcefully and persuasively by Tyler Cowen&#39;s book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a></em> . We don&#39;t innovate only for ourselves; <em>we innovate for ourselves and our posterity</em> .</p><p> The enemy of techno-optimism isn&#39;t sustainability; it&#39;s <em>short-termism</em> . Humanity should not build new things to pump up quarterly earnings; we should build them so that our descendants, in whatever form they come, will own the worlds and the stars. And if we are to own the worlds and the stars in perpetuity, we must take care not to despoil them, starting with the one we now sit upon.</p><p> Techno-optimism is thus much more than an argument about the institutions of today or the resource allocations of today. It&#39;s a faith in humanity — and all sentient beings — propelling ourselves forward into the infinite tomorrow. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

href="https://twitter.com/Nrg8000/status/1714535497958334678">turned out not to be true</a> . But <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/the-undisputed-facts-in-gaza-are-enough.html">it</a> <em><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/the-undisputed-facts-in-gaza-are-enough.html">is</a></em> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/the-undisputed-facts-in-gaza-are-enough.html">true</a> that Israel is dropping many bombs on the territory, and that many innocents have already been killed, and many more will be killed in the days to come. Few people seem to care much about the 2 million people of Gaza — <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/what-israel-didnt-understand-about-hamas.html">not Hamas</a> , who tries to provoke brutal reprisals to win international support for their cause, not Israel, which talks of collective punishment and has blockaded Gaza for decades, and not Egypt or other Arab countries, who have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/palestinian-jordan-egypt-israel-refugee-502c06d004767d4b64848d878b66bd3d">refused to take in Gazan refugees</a> . The Gazans are isolated and alone, stateless and forsaken by basically the entire planet.</p><p> At a time like this, some people might see it as dismissive or callous to talk about the long-term economic future of Gaza. Perhaps it takes a terminal case of Economist Brain to look at a land in the grip of endless war and say “You know what this place needs? Some GDP!”. But I think it&#39;s an important exercise, because economic development provides a nation with a purpose other than <a href="https://criticallegalthinking.com/2016/01/20/fanon-on-violence-and-the-person/">the catharsis of violence</a> . And having that long-term vision fixed in place helps to make decisions about leadership in the present, too, because it allows people to ask “Which leaders will get us closer to that bright, prosperous future?”.</p><p> Nor is it unrealistic to think that in half a century&#39;s time, Gaza might be an economically flourishing place.

They escaped those bad times, and perhaps Gaza can too.</p><p> Of course, that sort of development requires national self-determination, an end to major external conflicts, and long-term political stability. I&#39;m not sure anyone knows how to get those things for Gaza right now. But I think it&#39;s important to have a picture in mind of what the benefits might look like.</p><p> So here&#39;s a quick sketch of a vision for the economic future of Gaza. It starts with a quantitative goal: raising per capita GDP to $10,000 in PPP terms. I then speculate on a few industries that Gaza could target, using some other countries as comparisons. And I talk a bit about how migration could play a significant role. I don&#39;t mean to present this vision as an exclusive one — there are plenty of alternative approaches and goals, and this is far from a detailed road map in any case. But I hope this post will be enough to jump-start some thinking about better days.</p><h4> A concrete goal: Raise Gazan per capita GDP (PPP) to $10,000</h4><p> A lot of people, especially on the left of the political spectrum, criticize GDP&#39;s usefulness as a measure of human welfare. And sure, there are plenty of important things GDP leaves out (leisure, inequality, political freedom, life expectancy, education, and so on). But GDP is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/augmented-hdi-vs-gdp-per-capita">strongly correlated</a> with broader measures of well-being like the Human Development Index, and with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-daily-per-capita-expenditure-vs-gdp-per-capita">median levels of consumption</a> . If you increase GDP, your country is highly likely to be healthier, longer-lived, better-fed, better-educated, happier, and so on.</p><p> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/economic-possibilities-for-gaza">Read more</a></p> ]]>; </content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[At least five interesting things for the middle of your week (#17)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Techno-optimism, the mighty U.S. economy, Chinese real estate, slavery's economic effects, and the danger of hate on social media.

I&#39;ve been working on my epic review of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Progress-Thousand-Year-Technology-Prosperity/dp/1541702530">Power and Progress</a></em> , and it&#39;s getting…long. I also wanted to take an extra day to let people read <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/were-not-ready-for-the-big-one">my post</a> from Sunday. But anyway, there are a lot of things I wanted to blog about, so I&#39;ll do another roundup.</p><p> No new podcasts yet this week, but I do have one unusual request. As regular readers of this blog know, one thing I care a lot about in life is <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-rabbits">taking care of rabbits</a> . I like cats and dogs just as much, but rabbits don&#39;t get nearly as much attention, and as a result they often get treated very badly. My own rabbits were rescued back in 2016 from some guy who was trying to breed rabbits illegally in his garage, in absolutely horrible conditions.</p><p> Anyway, there was <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/evicted-backyard-breeder-abandoned-dozens-of-bunnies-rescue-group-says/">another similar rescue</a> in the Bay Area recently, in Petaluma — dozens of rabbits saved from very cruel living conditions. The rabbit rescue that originally rescued my own rabbits, SaveABunny, reached out and asked if I knew anyone who might be able to help. So if you&#39;re in the Bay Area, and you also like rabbits, and you think you might want to help take care of one, please email them at rescue@saveabunny.org, or go to <a href="https://saveabunny.org/">their website</a> , or respond to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SaveABunny/posts/pfbid02xBrjJC9BM5uNrpkgMLoKKD5ta2EdFXgarUGn2r23TiowMLNwEmyipcKQwgWNVmGNl">their Facebook post</a> .</p><p> Anyway, on to this week&#39;s Five Interesting Things.</p><h4> 1. Techno-optimism resurgent</h4><p> As you know, I&#39;m a dogged <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/techno-optimism-for-2023">techno-optimist</a> . I think we consistently underrate the power of science and technology to change our world for the better, and we underinvest in both. (You can expect my review of <em>Power and Progress</em> , whose central thesis is that techno-optimist ideas have deeply damaged our economy, to be a feisty one.) But there are people out there whose techno-optimism is so intense that it puts my own in the shade. One of these is <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/interview-marc-andreessen-vc-and">Marc Andreessen</a> .</p><p> In a new essay/rant called “ <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a> ” over at a16z&#39;s website, Marc lays out his vision. Here are a few points I&#39;d like to highlight.</p><p> First, Marc focuses squarely on technology&#39;s ability to bring <em>abundance</em> . And he appropriately frames abundance not just as “more stuff”, but as more <em>choice</em> in general for human beings, and more <em>control</em> over our world.</p><blockquote><p> We are materially focused, for a reason – to open the aperture on how we may choose to live amid material abundance.</p><p> A common critique of technology is that it removes choice from our lives as machines make decisions for us. This is undoubtedly true, yet more than offset by the freedom to create our lives that flows from the material abundance created by our use of machines.</p><p> Material abundance from markets and technology opens the space for religion, for politics, and for choices of how to live, socially and individually.</p><p> We believe technology is liberatory. Liberatory of human potential. Liberatory of the human soul, the human spirit. Expanding what it can mean to be free, to be fulfilled, to be alive.</p><p> We believe technology opens the space of what it can mean to be human.</p></blockquote><p> I couldn&#39;t agree more, and I think this is extremely well-put.</p><p> This is also a very important paragraph:</p><blockquote><p> We believe there is no conflict between capitalist profits and a social welfare system that protects the vulnerable. In fact, they are aligned – the production of markets creates the economic wealth that pays for everything else we want as a society.</p></blockquote><p> Degrowthers — whom Marc correctly identifies as an enemy of human progress — believe that there&#39;s an inherent tradeoff between human abundance and nature. This is a story of technology as fundamentally extractive, which fits neatly into a zero-sum worldview where prosperity is all about the extraction of resources rather than the creation of novelty. But Marc correctly realizes that technology is what allows humanity to <em>reduce</em> our natural footprint even as we create abundance for ourselves:</p><blockquote><p> Natural resource utilization has sharp limits, both real and political…And so the only perpetual source of growth is technology…We believe technology is a lever on the world – the way to make more with less.</p></blockquote><p> I also agree with Marc that culture matters. The last ten years have been a decade of unrest in American society, in which existing status hierarchies were unsettled and challenged across our entire culture. Because technologists and tech companies often make a lot of money and are thus high on the status totem pole, a fair amount of ire was directed their way. (The highest intellectual expression of that ire is the book <em>Power and Progress</em> , which I&#39;m currently in the middle of reviewing.) Marc&#39;s essay lashes out at these critics:</p><blockquote><p> Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”.</p></blockquote><p> Here I take a more balanced view, but still ultimately come down on Marc&#39;s side. Some of the ideas and institutions he lists as the “enemy” are useless, but many of them have some value. Sustainability, for example, is actually a goal of technological progress — as Marc himself acknowledges earlier. Existential risk is an important thing to worry about, which is why <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2052:_Stanislav_Petrov_Day">nerds celebrate the day</a> that Stanislav Petrov&#39;s judgement saved us from a nuclear war.</p><p> But Marc is right that most of the forces and institutions that have set themselves up as enemies of techno-capital were given extra force and virulence by the general climate of unrest in America (the unsettling of status hierarchies being what Marc, referencing Nietzsche, refers to as “ressentiment”). So Marc is right that it&#39;s time for a useful corrective — a general social refocusing on technological progress, abundance, and optimism.</p><p> There is one area where I might disagree with Marc, though. While he&#39;s right that markets are a crucial engine of innovation, I do think he underestimates the role of government in pressing science and technology forward:</p><blockquote><p> We believe central planning is a doom loop; markets are an upward spiral.</p><p> The economist William Nordhaus has shown that creators of technology are only able to capture about 2% of the economic value created by that technology. The other 98% flows through to society in the form of what economists call social surplus. <em>Technological innovation in a market system is inherently philanthropic</em> , by a 50:1 ratio. Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives? QED.</p></blockquote><p> But in fact, the second paragraph explains exactly why the first sentence in this quote isn&#39;t quite right. It&#39;s precisely because innovators don&#39;t capture most of the monetary benefits of the innovations they create that we need some other force to propel technology forward. Yes, invention is philanthropy, and philanthropy isn&#39;t enough!</p><p> That&#39;s where government comes in. There are plenty of ways that government can and does encourage accelerated innovation — through R&amp;D tax credits, through the patent system (sometimes), though funding of basic research at universities and national labs, through DARPA, and so on. Much of our technological innovation has been driven by this support, which works in harmony with markets instead of replacing them. In fact, Marc himself created the first widely usable graphical web browser while working at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> , a state-funded research center! And Marc correctly lists Paul Romer as a patron saint of techno-optimism; Romer has fought tirelessly for more government funding for science and technology.</p><p> If you don&#39;t want to call that “central planning”, fine. But don&#39;t forget the important role of government in pushing progress forward!</p><p> Here&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPinkston/status/1714088788237180947">a good thread by Nick Pinkston</a> making the same point.</p><p> Anyway, Marc is just one of a whole new crop of techno-optimists that has popped up in recent years. The <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeff">e/acc movement</a> — basically an online reboot of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/1994/10/extropians/">extropian movement</a> from the 1990s — is extremely fun. My favorite e/acc account is <a href="https://twitter.com/terrorproforma/status/1713082035932209393">@terrorproforma</a> .</p><p> Meanwhile, Packy McCormick, who writes the excellent Substack <a href="https://www.notboring.co/">Not Boring</a> , has a new series called “Age of Miracles” where he explores new technologies: </p><div id="youtube2-sNrtMnPsctU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;sNrtMnPsctU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sNrtMnPsctU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p> And of course there&#39;s no shortage of actual technological miracles happening all around us. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malaria-vaccine-oxford-approval/">Malaria vaccines</a> — created using the same technology that we deployed to fight Covid — are now being deployed, threatening to free humanity (and especially Africa) from one of our most terrible and deadly endemic diseases.</p><p> And that turbulence you hate whenever you fly on a plane? Well, that might soon be mostly a thing of the past, thanks to AI: </p><div id="youtube2-9qydsN_acDs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;9qydsN_acDs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qydsN_acDs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p> (Update: This may actually be done <em>without</em> AI! If so, that&#39;s pretty amazing in and of itself.)</p><p> In fact, the combination of AI and physical technology promises to create a whole new era of innovation in “atoms”.</p><p> It&#39;s a pretty great time to be alive. Time to shake off the malaise of the 2010s and dream big again.</p><h4> 2. The US economy remains undefeated</h4><p> Usually you wouldn&#39;t think of a US economic boom as the type of story to fly under the radar…right? And yet the US&#39; economic outperformance during the post-pandemic years, and especially over the last year, feels very underappreciated. Let&#39;s look at a few charts.</p><p> First, there&#39;s growth. Even as China and Europe have decelerated since the pandemic, the US has grown faster than pre-pandemic forecasts expected: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

But right now we just need to realize that despite a two-year burst of inflation, the US economy has been doing <em>really, really well</em> since the pandemic.</p><h4> 3. China&#39;s real estate woes continue</h4><p> A major economy that has <em>not</em> been doing really, really well since the pandemic is China. The <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-chinas-economy-ran-off-the-rails">basic pattern</a> we all described two months ago — the inevitable crash of a bloated real estate sector, exacerbated by a dysfunctional local government financing system — is still in place. But it&#39;s useful to check back and see that things are still largely playing out as forecasted.

Meanwhile, it looks like a number of dominoes are still left to fall; Bloomberg&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-15/china-property-private-equity-s-role-is-the-new-hot-potato?sref=R8NfLgwS">Shuli Ren writes</a> about private equity companies that are set to take big losses from the real estate implosion.</p><p> But the biggest loser is likely to be local governments. These governments financed much of their expenditure with land sales for years, and now with the property sector crashing, that revenue has dried up. So they&#39;re largely surviving by borrowing. The problem is that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-15/china-s-local-governments-feel-the-sting-of-supply-deluge?sref=R8NfLgwS">no one wants to lend to the local governments</a> , since they realize that the long real estate boom is probably never coming back, and thus the local governments are not going to have the money to pay back their loans.</p><p> So the central government is stepping in, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-instructs-banks-roll-over-local-government-debt-sources-2023-10-17/">telling state-controlled banks to keep lending money</a> to the local governments at cheap interest rates. This is called “evergreening”, and it&#39;s what <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.98.5.1943">Japanese banks did</a> with failed companies after the bust of 1989-91. It basically amounts to a bailout by the central government, but with one added negative characteristic. If their lending is directed toward local governments (which are basically non-productive borrowers), state-controlled banks won&#39;t be able to lend as much to the private sector, which could lower productivity and prolong the downturn — just like zombie lending did in Japan.</p><p> That said, China&#39;s government will certainly try very hard to push banks to lend to non-real-estate-related sectors.

Time will tell how much of that manufacturing is actually anything people want to buy, or whether it&#39;s setting China up for a glut of overcapacity and waste.</p><h4> 4. Slavery wasn&#39;t just evil, it was bad for the economy</h4><p> In the 2010s, it became fashionable to claim that the Industrial Revolution was enabled, or even caused, by American slavery. This idea served a number of rhetorical purposes, such as some socialists&#39; desire to equate capitalism with slavery, or some progressives&#39; urge to characterize everything about the American way of life as “stamped from the beginning” with the stain of slavery. This theory, which was part of the so-called “New History of Capitalism” and was largely promoted by historians rather than economists,</p><p> There was <a href="https://pseudoerasmus.com/tag/slavery/">never a ton of evidence</a> to back up this theory, but “not a ton” is not the same as “nothing”. <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/slavery-and-british-industrial-revolution">One paper by actual economists</a> estimated that the cheaper inputs from slavery did increase Britain&#39;s national income by 3.5% — not quite “started the industrial revolution” levels, but not nothing either.</p><p> But there&#39;s also a lot of evidence that slavery <em>hurt</em> the economy of the American South. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31758">A new paper</a> by Richard Hornbeck and Trevon Logan describes why this was the case, and tries to quantify how much emancipation helped boost the economy. Here are some useful excerpts:</p><blockquote><p> Characterizations of slavery as efficient and productive reflect the benefits and costs for slave owners, with market transactions oriented around extracting value from enslaved people. In this paper, we challenge this view. We re-characterize slavery as economically inefficient because there was a massive externality whose implications have been underexplored: enslavers considered their own private marginal benefits and private marginal costs of slave labor when making production decisions in the antebellum era, but they did not internalize the costs slavery imposed on enslaved people. When including costs incurred by enslaved people themselves, the tremendous inefficiency of slavery becomes readily apparent because the value extracted by enslavers was substantially less than the costs imposed on enslaved people. Focusing on the cost of enslavement to the enslaved shows that <strong>slavery was a market failure in addition to a moral failure</strong> .</p><p> Since American slavery was economically inefficient, in this aggregate sense, emancipation generated substantial aggregate economic gains. While output declined after emancipation, input costs declined substantially more, which increased aggregate economic surplus: the total value of output minus total costs incurred…Emancipation reduced input costs that were not paid under slavery, due to coercion, but were still incurred by enslaved people and reduced aggregate surplus in the US economy…[W]e calculate that emancipation generated economic gains that exceed estimated costs of the Civil War…Emancipation generated aggregate economic gains worth 7 – 60 years of technological innovation in the 19th century[.]</p></blockquote><p> The argument here is actually a subtle but powerful one. Because slavers basically got to ignore many of the costs they foisted on slaves, they made poor decisions about how to spend slaves&#39; time and effort and skills — and the slaves were also forced to make bad decisions. As the authors write, “slavery was not only a substantial transfer of value from enslaved people to enslavers, it was also an inefficient mechanism of transferring value.”</p><p> (And as an aside, there are other, more complex distortions that this paper doesn&#39;t even take into account, like <em>investment decisions</em> . Because slavers faced the wrong prices for their investment decisions — slave labor was artificially cheap — the slave states over-invested in agriculture instead of manufacturing. Which is why when William T. Sherman showed up to kick their butts, he<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10178834-you-people-of-the-south-don-t-know-what-you-are">lambasted them</a> by saying “hardly a yard of cloth or pair of shoes can you make”. This was one reason the Union won so decisively.)</p><p> Hornbeck and Logan&#39;s result stands in contrast to the paper that found that slavery made Britain a little bit richer. Future research should focus on harmonizing the methodologies in these models — combining natural experiments from emancipation with the theory of externalities. But in any case, this is a blow to the idea that slavery was a boon for the overall economy.</p><p> Which doesn&#39;t mean, of course, that the modern American economy is free from the stain of slavery. It just means that that stain is probably making us poorer rather than richer. Extractive labor policies like <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/us-prison-labor-programs-violate-fundamental-human-rights-new-report-finds">low-paid prison labor</a> , commonly used in the American South, under-invest in human capital and are probably thus inefficient, for many of the same reasons that Hornbeck and Logan cite. In addition to being a human rights violation, of course.</p><h4> 5. The platform is the enemy</h4><p> This past week on the platform formerly known as Twitter has been a tough one.

Furthermore, we critically examine the claim that the algorithm shows users what they want to see, discovering that users do *not* prefer the political tweets selected by the algorithm.</p></blockquote><p> But you don&#39;t need a fancy recommendation algorithm to elevate the worst people; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad325/7293179?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=pnasnexus&amp;utm_content=3912da00-269d-4ea9-8b25-ac125fe7417c&amp;utm_campaign=hootsuite&amp;login=false">a new paper by Mamakos and Finkel</a> finds that Reddit does this as well:</p><blockquote><p> Toxic people are especially likely to opt into discourse in partisan contexts…[W]e analyzed hundreds of millions of comments from over 6.3 million users and found robust evidence that: (1) the discourse of people whose behavior is especially toxic in partisan contexts is also especially toxic in non-partisan contexts (ie, people are not politics-only toxicity specialists); and (2) when considering only non-partisan contexts, the discourse of people who also comment in partisan contexts is more toxic than the discourse of people who do not. These effects were not driven by socialization processes whereby people overgeneralized toxic behavioral norms they had learned in partisan contexts.</p></blockquote><p> This is not a causal study, and the effect is not incredibly strong, but it still shows that the tendency is there.</p><p> This doesn&#39;t mean I think these new social media technologies were a bad invention (though Twitter&#39;s algorithm certainly needs to be tweaked). It&#39;s hard to imagine a world without even as simple and rudimentary an online discussion platform as Reddit! But what it does mean is that our society needs to adapt to the presence of these technologies. We need to start realizing that we have another enemy besides our traditional political opponents, and that enemy is the social media platform where we we get our news. Social media has taught itself to exploit natural human tendencies toward enmity and division, monetizing hate for engagement and profit. It&#39;s a dark mirror to the worst parts of our souls, and it&#39;s up to us to find ways to resist. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-b4e?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-b4e?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a> </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg" width="900" height="523" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:523,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb602bf6-4a91-4629-8053-6174a90aa357_900x523.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></figure></div> ]]>;

In 2022 we saw a nuclear-armed great power invade and try to conquer a neighboring country. Now Iran is <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/14/iran-warning-israel-hezbollah-hamas-war-gaza">threatening to go to war</a> with Israel, and the US is <a href="https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1713313643247329568">sending carrier strike groups</a> to the region to deter it. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan may be <a href="https://twitter.com/Caucasuswar/status/1712973669150990690">getting ready to invade</a> Armenia, Serbia <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-builds-up-forces-kosovo-prime-minister-albin-kurti-banjska-tensions-serbia-rise/">might invade</a> Kosovo, and other wars and atrocities are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/18/sudan-darfur-genocide-refugees/">breaking out</a> in various corners of the world.</p><p> In <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/youre-not-going-to-like-what-comes">a post last week</a> , I hypothesized that the waning of American deterrence is a big reason the world seems to be slipping into a more warlike, anarchic state. I am not an expert in foreign policy, but <a href="https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/israel-palestinian-conflict-global-security/">Paul Poast</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-09/israel-hamas-war-us-faces-global-conflict-instability-terrorism?sref=R8NfLgwS">Hal Brands</a> both are, and they offered the same hypothesis. In particular, I think many Americans fail to realize the extent to which the war between Israel and Hamas is in part an extension of a larger great-power struggle, pitting the Russia-Iran-China axis against the US and its allies. This “ <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-war-economy-sizing-up-the-new">New Axis</a> ”, as I&#39;ve called it, is on the march, emboldened by the growth of Chinese economic power and by America&#39;s internal division and shriveled defense-industrial base.</p><p> But the final shoe has yet to drop. Russia&#39;s dysfunction has bogged it down in Ukraine, and Iran&#39;s military power is limited, so these wars are unlikely to spread and lay waste to whole regions. Nor will the global economy be upended, since Russia and Iran are both petrostates. The real cataclysmic event will be a war between the US and China over Taiwan.</p><p> If this ends up taking us by surprise, we&#39;ll have only ourselves to blame. Xi Jinping constantly says <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/xi-jinping-says-he-preparing-china-war">he&#39;s preparing China for war</a> . Chinese state media is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/china-releases-tv-documentary-showcasing-armys-ability-attack-102053758">airing programs</a> about how an attack on Taiwan would proceed, and the Chinese military has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-military-posted-animated-video-090720673.html">released an animation</a> depicting an attack plan. China&#39;s near-constant air and naval exercises around Taiwan <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/chinas-fighter-jets-arent-just-flying-around-taiwan-theyre-practicing-d6e56cc5">look an awful lot like practice</a> . And the country&#39;s economic slowdown just gives it a further <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/chinas-slowdown-and-the-incentives">incentive for military adventures</a> .</p><p> I don&#39;t think most regular Americans are mentally prepared for a US-China war, or have thought deeply about what it would entail. Most of us — myself included — were surprised by Putin&#39;s willingness to invade Ukraine, and by the ferocity and escalation potential of the Israel-Hamas war. This doesn&#39;t seem atypical; when I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Americas-Fightingest-Helped-World/dp/1439190887">personal accounts</a> of World War 2, I&#39;m always astonished by how the narrators discounted the possibility of America entering the war all the way up until they minute the bombs started falling on Pearl Harbor.</p><p> But the Roosevelt administration anticipated the war years in advance, and took action to prepare. Similarly, whether a war with China eventually comes or not — and I fervently hope it will never come — we ought to start preparing now. The wars that have erupted in Europe and the Middle East should serve as a warning, which we ignore at our grave peril. We shouldn&#39;t concentrate so much on the wars that are happening today that we forget to think about the war that could happen tomorrow.</p><p> Anyway, I&#39;ll talk about how I think business and government can prepare, but first I think I should address the skepticism I commonly encounter when I warn people about the chances of this war actually happening.</p><h4> “But America wouldn&#39;t really go to war with China over Taiwan…would we?”</h4><p> My favorite character in <em>Lord of the Rings</em> was always Gandalf — not just because he&#39;s a melodramatic, bumbling old wizard who somehow always comes through when the chips are down, but because he sees danger coming that others miss. One of the most memorable scenes in <em>The Two Towers</em> is when Gandalf is telling King Theoden that Saruman&#39;s armies are about to sweep down and wipe him out. Theoden&#39;s traitorous adviser, Wormtongue, scoffs at Gandalf&#39;s warnings, but eventually Gandalf manages to convince Theoden that the danger is real. I was always impressed that Gandalf managed to succeed where Cassandra failed.</p><p> Sometimes when I talk to Americans, especially in the tech industry, about a war over Taiwan, I feel a little of the frustration Gandalf must have felt. I often encounter a look of horrified disbelief, as people ask me: “We wouldn&#39;t really go to war over Taiwan, would we?”</p><p> But as comforting as it might be to imagine America sitting serenely to the side while people in Asia fight their wars, this is highly unlikely to happen. The reason is not that TSMC is essential to the global semiconductor supply chain, or really anything intrinsic to Taiwan itself. It&#39;s that if China attacks Taiwan, <em>it&#39;ll probably attack US bases first.</em></p><p> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/were-not-ready-for-the-big-one">Read more</a></p> ]]>; </content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[At least five interesting things for the end of your week (#16)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Michael Lewis and SBF, how to win Cold War 2, American manufacturing, Target and shoplifting, and yet more on housing supply]]></description><link/> https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-0c8<guid ispermalink="true"> https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/at-least-five-interesting-things-0c8</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Noah Smith]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 09:15:37 GMT</pubDate> <enclosure length="0" type="image/jpeg" url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cbf3a23-19c9-496d-a1e1-4a769b6100e0_1024x683.jpeg"></enclosure><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="image3" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8cbf3a23-19c9-496d-a1e1-4a769b6100e0_1024x683.jpeg&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;\&quot;FTX Bankruptcy\&quot; by Bybit.com, CC BY 2.0&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;100%&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;auto&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;}"></div><p> I&#39;m a bit overdue for a roundup, and lots of interesting stuff has been piling up!</p><p> First, podcasts. I have a new episode of <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/Econ102">Econ 102</a> with Erik Torenberg, all about the Israel-Gaza war.

This was our most listened-to episode of Econ 102 so far, probably because people were paying so much attention to the new war. Anyway, the views I expressed on the podcast were a bit more wide-ranging and nuanced than the posts I wrote on the topic this week.</p><p> Meanwhile, on our latest episode of Hexapodia, Brad DeLong and I didn&#39;t talk about the war at all. Instead we talked with our guest Brian Beutler, writer of the substack <a href="https://www.offmessage.net/">Off Message</a> , about whether Democrats have been too wimpy and wonkish in recent years: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:137880712,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/podcast-hexapodia-liv-we-go-off-message&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffde2453e-9c18-4560-82ca-8b77ae62ef5b_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;PODCAST: Hexapodia LIV: We Go Off Message with Special Guest Brian Beutler&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Listen now (54 mins) | The SubStackLand community gains another valuable member.

Michael Lewis was too nice to SBF</h4><p> Michael Lewis has always been one of my favorite authors; I can only wish I had his generational talent for entertaining readers entertained with lifelike characters and gripping stories even as he teaches them actual useful information. <em>Liar&#39;s Poker</em> was the quintessential story of the cynical, greedy turn in the US finance industry, while <em>The Big Short</em> was the best chronicle of the madness leading up to the 2008 crisis.</p><p> But Lewis is now <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/10/sam-bankman-fried-going-infinite-book-michael-lewis/675609/">taking a lot of heat</a> for being the closest thing that Sam Bankman-Fried has to a defender in the financial press. I haven&#39;t read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Going-Infinite-Rise-Fall-Tycoon/dp/1324074337">Lewis&#39; SBF book</a> yet, but in recent interviews, Lewis certainly says things about SBF that are less negative than anything else I&#39;ve read. For example, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-book-60-minutes/">talking to 60 Minutes</a> , Lewis said that he doesn&#39;t believe that SBF knowingly stole his customers&#39; money. And in <a href="https://time.com/6321668/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-going-infinite/">a recent Time interview</a> , he asserted that the money was lost due to SBF&#39;s “catastrophic sloppiness” rather than to deliberate malfeasance. When asked if SBF is a serial liar, Lewis hedges, calling him a “serial withholder” instead. When challenged to respond to criticisms that he got to close to the subject of his book, Lewis shot back:</p><blockquote><p> This is what happens when you address a mob, is what it feels like…The anger seems, to me, to be like a separate force and part of American life right now, rather than something that&#39;s rational…Lord knows the very easy, lazy thing to do right now would be to throw Sam under every bus you could, and try to make him seem as bad as possible, because people respond to that. But it just wouldn&#39;t be true. It&#39;s not the character I knew. It&#39;s not the situation I knew…There&#39;s a long history of people getting in trouble for books that are right, and the books end up being extremely valuable...And in this case, again, it felt like there&#39;s a tribe waiting that were natively hostile to the truth of the story I experienced.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t have enough information to say Lewis is wrong here, but I expect when all is said and done, there will be solid evidence that SBF knowingly stole from his customers. In fact, I kind of doubt the standard story that SBF gave the money to his hedge fund and gambled it all away; I suspect he just embezzled most of it for himself, and still has most of it stashed in various places.</p><p> So my bet is that Michael Lewis is just being way way too nice to SBF here. But why? Lewis didn&#39;t hold back when criticizing the bond traders at Salomon Bros. or the creators of mortgage-backed CDOs; why would he lob such a softball at a guy whose finance empire was infinitely more scammy than those others?</p><p> Maybe Lewis did get too close to his subject, or maybe the magic spell of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/yxxihq/sbf_calls_ethics_a_dumb_game_we_woke_westerners/">cynical “effective altruism”</a> that SBF and his cronies used to get on so many people&#39;s good side. But I suspect that the deeper thing that&#39;s going on here is that SBF, like so many crypto barons, presented himself as an anti-financier — a good guy taking finance back from the cynical Wall Street banksters who hustled everyone in the 80s and 90s and blew up the world in the 00s. In other words, SBF set himself up to be the antithesis of everything that Michael Lewis spent his early career bashing, when in fact he was just a far scammier version of the same.</p><p> The truth about the finance industry, I think, is that it&#39;s been humbled significantly since the days of <em>Liar&#39;s Poker</em> and <em>The Big Short</em> . The Dodd-Frank reforms and the tight regulation of systemically important banks, along with the aftermath of 2008 itself, really did make it harder to engage in financial shenanigans. Finance still makes a ton of money, of course, but its profit as a share of the total has fallen from over 30% in the early 2000s to around 18% today — barely higher than it was in the early 1960s. </p><div class="image3" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cf59558c-3f95-4e42-98eb-372b40299c32_1318x450.png&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;100%&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;auto&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;}"></div><p> The old Wall Street “masters of the Universe” have been humbled, and we don&#39;t need the likes of SBF to rebel against them.</p><h4> 2. A great interview on national security threats</h4><p> I don&#39;t usually post video links, because they usually don&#39;t have the high density of information that I prefer. But if you have the time, I highly recommend this video interview of <a href="https://usnwc.edu/Faculty-and-Departments/Directory/Sarah-CM-Paine">Sarah CM Paine</a> , a professor of strategy and policy at the US Naval War College: </p><div id="youtube2-YcVSgYz5SJ8" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;YcVSgYz5SJ8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YcVSgYz5SJ8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p> I have never seen someone speak so lucidly about such a wide range of national security topics. Paine knows her history incredibly well, and does an amazing job of boiling down the key principles for the audience. Dwarkesh Patel is an excellent interviewer, challenging Paine and pushing her to defend her ideas in a well-informed, thoughtful way.</p><p> Paine&#39;s main message is that the US and its allies possess very little power to affect the internal decision-making processes of Russia and China. We can influence their calculus from outside, but we can&#39;t really persuade them to change their ideology or alter the structure of their internal politics. Thus, we must be prepared for Putin and Xi to make mistakes and to do things that hurt their own people, because these are the kind of leaders who sometimes do things like that.</p><p> Paine is also very explicit about what wins big wars like WW2 and conflicts like the Cold War: <strong>allies</strong> . No matter how powerful one country is, it can be beaten by a sufficiently large gang of other countries. So in preparing to resist Xi and Putin, yes we need military strength of our own, but it&#39;s absolutely crucial that we get the rest of the world on our side. The Biden administration needs to hear this message, and the GOP <em>really, really</em> needs to hear this message.</p><p> Anyway, like I said, if you have a couple hours to spare, watch the whole thing.</p><h4> 3. America isn&#39;t building enough, but we are building</h4><p> I&#39;ve repeatedly lambasted America for being the “ <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-build-nothing-country">build-nothing country</a> ”. Our lack of state capacity, our insane permitting system that allows NIMBYs to block everything, our complacent acceptance of cost overruns and delays, and other factors threaten to prevent us from building the green energy we need to decarbonize our economy and the high-tech factories we need to compete militarily with China. And we still see lots of stories coming out about how difficult it is to build things in America. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/not-made-in-america-factory-shortage-stalls-offshore-wind/">the latest hair-pulling tale of woe</a> :</p><blockquote><p> A factory shortage is threatening the future of offshore wind in the United States, and few places illustrate the challenge better than an unfinished facility in upstate New York…Trees have been cleared for the facility, but almost three years after the factory was announced, construction on its five buildings has yet to begin. And the cost of the project has more than doubled from $350 million to $700 million.</p></blockquote><p> There are <a href="https://fasterplease.substack.com/p/do-you-want-to-build-a-factory">various factors</a> that contributed to this problem, but the main villain, as usual, is NEPA, the law that lets people sue any project to force it to complete cumbersome paperwork:</p><blockquote><p> Progress has proceeded in fits and starts. Tree clearing prompted objections from some neighbors. A group of residents filed a lawsuit claiming the port had not adequately notified the public of its plans. It was later dismissed. While the project eventually succeeded in obtaining all the necessary environmental permits, costs have soared.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s becoming every clearer that it&#39;s going to be very hard to revive US industry — or accomplish progressives&#39; goal of decarbonization — without throwing NEPA under the bus.</p><p> But that said, America has thrown a lot of money at industrial policy, and it&#39;s not all going to cost overruns or legal challenges. Battery manufacturing is up by almost 40% in real terms since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed: </p><div class="image3" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6221e715-a67a-4f05-8e0b-a38f2356943f_900x575.png&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Source: Joey Politano&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/JosephPolitano/status/1708114976152674387&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;100%&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;auto&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;}"></div><p> My hope is that America&#39;s initial struggles with industrial policy will cause us to course-correct, to find and eliminate the bottlenecks and roadblocks and inefficiencies, rather than to throw up our hands and retreat back to laissez-faire economics. If we can use the impetus of green industrial policy to reform laws like NEPA that block abundance on a wide variety of fronts, then so much the better.</p><h4> 4. Did shoplifting make Target close a bunch of stores?</h4><p> Target made a big stir a few weeks ago <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/26/target-stores-closing-list-2023-theft-crime">when it announced</a> that it was closing a bunch of stores because of excessive shoplifting. The cities where stores were closed include San Francisco, Oakland, New York City, Seattle, and Portland. The reports fed a growing anxiety that tolerance of property crime is hollowing out retail in America&#39;s progressive cities.</p><p> The blogger Judd Legum <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1709913774206169375">challenged Target&#39;s claims</a> , however. Analyzing police data, Legum found that there were fewer reports of shoplifting at and around the stores that were closing, as compared with other Target stores in the same cities. </p><div class="image3" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27f4b907-7da9-4eb6-96d6-ea3bb4b188d3_723x781.jpeg&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:612,&quot;height&quot;:661.40625,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;}"></div><p> Legum concluded that Target had other reasons for closing the stores, and was using shoplifting as a convenient excuse.</p><p> But while that might be true, critics were <a href="https://twitter.com/hspter/status/1710359704193429990?t=QadXyPg9B3IxlWhQ81-HGg&amp;s=19">quick to point out</a> that Legum&#39;s data isn&#39;t really reliable. Areas with lots and lots of shoplifting probably <a href="https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/seattle-businesses-fatigued-by-reporting-shoplifting-cases-with-no-end-in-sight.amp">tend to report it less</a> . In addition to “reporting fatigue” from huge numbers of incidents, there&#39;s the fact that the stores that are closing tend to be in poorer neighborhoods, where police are less likely to care enough to respond to reports of petty crime. If the cops don&#39;t care, why even report?</p><p> So Legum&#39;s investigation should have also investigated the reliability of these reporting numbers. Data matters, but data quality also matters.</p><p> On top of that issue, there are at least two other reasons why Legum&#39;s conclusion might miss the mark. First, there&#39;s <strong>mitigation costs</strong> . Stores in high-shoplifting areas might put all their merchandise behind plastic cases and hire a bunch of security guards. That might prevent shoplifting, but at the cost of massively increased labor costs — security guard salaries, plus the fact that store employees are now required to assist customers with every purchase. If every store in an area is forced to resort to such costly measures, shoplifting might decline in the entire area, but the cost to some of the businesses might be ruinous.</p><p> Second, there&#39;s a store&#39;s <strong>ex ante profit margins</strong> to take into account. If a store in a poor area charges lower prices and makes lower margins, then it might not take as much shoplifting to force that store to close. In fact, shoplifting <em>at other stores far away</em> might even force a low-margin store in a poor neighborhood to close, simply by reducing the profitability of the entire company and forcing a round of cost-cutting that hit the stores in the poor areas first.</p><p> In other words, there are tons of limitations in the case Judd Legum is making here. He might be right, but there are a lot of things he didn&#39;t take into account, so I&#39;m not sure we learned a lot from his data-gathering exercise.</p><h4> 5. More anecdotal evidence on market-rate housing construction</h4><p> As you know, I love citing evidence that building market-rate housing lowers rents. I would also love citing evidence to the contrary, if it existed, but there&#39;s just not a lot of it — pretty much every careful scientific study and anecdotal urban experiment reiterates the conclusion that supply is effective in lowering rent.</p><p> First, we have <a href="https://twitter.com/jayparsons/status/1712110658601255211">a report from Jay Parsons</a> , an economist who studies rental housing. He finds that in areas with lots housing supply, rents for mid-market apartments go down the most, even if it&#39;s high-end apartments that are mostly getting built. The reason is that when you build fancy luxury apartments, a lot of people from the mid-market move to those nicer, newer apartments, leaving a glut of supply that pushes rent down. Here&#39;s his chart: </p><div class="image3" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/baefb362-9c75-4794-b1be-258c9d118aeb_900x504.jpeg&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Source: Jay Parsons&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/jayparsons/status/1712110658601255211&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;100%&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;auto&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;}"></div><p> This is pretty much exactly what I predicted in my post about “yuppie fishtanks”. When you build nice apartments for yuppies, they move into those nice apartments, and stop trying to outbid regular middle-class folks for the older mid-market units. </p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:null,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;In 2018, I wrote a post about why building market-rate housing in gentrifying cities helps relieve rent pressure on long-time working-class residents.

This could be caused by other factors, of course, such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/us/oakland-crime-increase-naacp-residents/index.html">Oakland&#39;s crime wave</a> , which could be making the city less desirable to live in. But similar crime waves in other Bay Area towns haven&#39;t led to similar drops in price, so maybe it was all the housing Oakland built.

I can&#39;t say I&#39;m particularly surprised to see Goldin get the nod, here. Economists generally recognize Goldin as one of the key pioneers of the “credibility revolution” in empirical economics.</p><p> The main thing you have to understand about the Econ Nobel (or, if you prefer, the Bank of Sweden Prize in Memory of Alfred Nobel) is that it&#39;s typically a methods prize; instead of specific discoveries, like in chemistry or medicine, the Econ Nobel is typically awarded to researchers who invent <em>new ways of making discoveries</em> . In recent years, the prize has been awarded more and more to researchers whose primary focus is empirical analysis rather than pure theory.</p><p> This largely just reflects the direction of the overall field. Over the past three decades the econ profession <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-02/how-economics-went-from-philosophy-to-science">has shifted</a> in a decidedly empirical direction, relative to the theory-heavy stuff that prevailed in the 70s and 80s. A big part of that shift has been something called the “ <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.3">credibility revolution</a> ” — a movement toward using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment">natural experiments</a> to test simple hypotheses instead of trying to fit the data to complicated theories. In other words, econ is getting more scientific, and it&#39;s doing it in a way that expands the capabilities of science as a whole, because it&#39;s finding new ways to do science on things that can&#39;t be controlled in a lab. That&#39;s pretty cool.</p><p> Anyway, the prize in 2021 went to <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-econ-nobel-we-were-all-waiting">Card, Angrist, and Imbens</a> , three pioneers of the credibility revolution. Goldin was an obvious choice for another prize in the same vein. A number of her key papers, including <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2624453/Goldin_PowerPill.pdf">her famous 2002 paper</a> with Lawrence Katz on the effects of birth control technology on women&#39;s careers, used and improved the natural experiment technique.</p><p> To see how this works, let&#39;s consider <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2624453/Goldin_PowerPill.pdf">that paper</a> , which is entitled “The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women&#39;s Career and Marriage Decisions”. In general, if you see a correlation between A) increased birth control use, and B) women getting more education and getting married later, you might wonder which way the causation ran. Maybe women started using birth control because of feminist cultural values, and started getting more education and getting married later for the same reasons? Maybe education would make women want to use birth control more? How do we know that adoption of a <em>technological</em> innovation led to <em>social</em> changes, rather than vice versa?</p><p> Goldin and Katz figured out how to identify which way the causation ran. They looked at state-level differences in laws that made it easier or harder for women to get the new birth control pill after the technology came out. This allowed the economists to figure out that the impact of the new invention was crucially important.</p><p> I sometimes jokingly refer to myself as a “technological determinist”, and this kind of thing is exactly why. Of course I recognize that social movements and cultural factors are important. But I think there&#39;s a tendency in our society to attribute everything to culture and activism, ignoring the fact that technology sets the boundaries of what cultures and movements can accomplish. Goldin and Katz&#39; paper on the birth control pill is an important reminder of the indispensable power of technological innovation.</p><p> But in any case, back to Goldin&#39;s Nobel. It would be wrong to see this award as purely a sequel to the 2021 prize, because Goldin did a lot more than just analyzing natural experiments. Her real strength lay in weaving together a wide variety of theories and facts to create a coherent story about an important phenomenon — the changing role of women in the workforce.</p><p> If you want an overview of how Goldin wove together these disparate threads, I recommend this post by Alice Evans: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:137798081,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://draliceevans.substack.com/p/claudia-goldin-nobel&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:1385611,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Great Gender Divergence&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc82fa3f9-aadb-4fd3-8c05-1764ff19858b_495x495.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Claudia Goldin: Nobel&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Patriarchy has persisted for over ten thousand years.

She considers theories of female workers as rational decision-makers responding to market demand, but she also considers <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282806777212350">cultural norms</a> and <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31762">politics</a> and the spread of ideas. She uses natural experiments, survey research, and economic history. She created whole new data sets, uncovering trends in women&#39;s employment back to the 19th century. This was what allowed her to figure out that women haven&#39;t recently entered the workforce for the first time, but <em>re-entered</em> it.

There&#39;s the impact of broad “structural” shifts in the economy — the change from agriculture to manufacturing to service industries. There are policy changes like expanded education that affect women&#39;s opportunities in the workplace, and there technological innovations like the birth control pill and home appliances that affect the tradeoff between work and family life. There are social movements like feminism and political changes like anti-discrimination law. All of these things happen at the same time, and they all interact.</p><p> If there&#39;s a simple story that emerges from Goldin&#39;s body of work, it&#39;s that the main thing that affects women&#39;s economic situation is the tradeoff between the workplace and the family. If the economy is one that forces people to choose one or the other, it&#39;s going to be harder for women to work. The industrial age, when working meant long hours in a factory far away from home, housework was a huge chore, family planning was difficult, education was rare, and families passed on traditions of separated gender roles, made it uniquely difficult for women to go out and earn a living in the marketplace. The new service economy, with all the new technological and cultural innovations of the past century, has made it more possible to take care of a family and still go out and have a job. And thus it is that we live in a much more gender-equal age.</p><p> But “more gender-equal” doesn&#39;t mean that inequality has been conquered. One of Goldin&#39;s most famous papers, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.3.228">a 2010 study</a> with Katz and Marianne Bertrand, found that women still face somewhat of a choice between child-rearing and careers. Following the careers of MBAs from a top business school, they found that motherhood was correlated with interrupted careers and shorter working hours — factors that statistically explain most of the remaining gender wage gap. The key is that women are the “on-call parent” within most families, which requires them to have more flexible work arrangements — and thus less high-powered careers.</p><p> When I look at this research result, it immediately suggests two ways to close the remaining gender wage gap. The first is a preference shift to get men to care more about childcare. As Goldin found, those cultural shifts can matter a lot. But being a technological determinist, I&#39;m more optimistic about a new innovation: remote work.</p><p> In a 2014 paper, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.4.1091">Goldin writes</a> that the key to advancing gender equality is to make work more flexible:</p><blockquote><p> But what must the &quot;last&quot; chapter contain for there to be equality in the labor market? The answer may come as a surprise. The solution does not (necessarily) have to involve government intervention and it need not make men more responsible in the home (although that wouldn&#39;t hurt). But it must involve changes in the labor market, especially how jobs are structured and remunerated to enhance <strong>temporal flexibility</strong> . The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked <strong>particular hours</strong> . Such change has taken off in various sectors, such as technology, science, and health, but is less apparent in the corporate, financial, and legal worlds. (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote><p> Goldin wasn&#39;t quite sure how flexible workplace hours could be achieved. But that was in 2014, before the pandemic, before Zoom and Slack and Google Docs came together in a time of need to produce the remote work revolution. Like birth control or the dishwasher, remote work is a technological innovation that appears to be here to stay. Its productivity benefits are <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/08/29/nicholas-bloom-predicts-a-working-from-home-nike-swoosh">becoming more apparent</a> over time, as companies learn ways to profitably restructure their production processes around more geographically distributed, asynchronous teams.</p><p> On top of its other benefits, Goldin&#39;s research seems to me to imply that remote work will be yet another boon for working women. Norms change, but slowly and with difficulty. Women shouldn&#39;t have to be the “on-call parent”, but if they want to be, then remote work will make it much easier for them to do that while still holding down a high-powered career. I think that countries that want to improve gender equality — I&#39;m looking at you, Japan and Korea! — should try to encourage remote work.</p><p> In any case, Claudia Goldin&#39;s Nobel is richly deserved. She demonstrated a new way to do economics — bringing together a large number of different methods, theories, and data sources to attack one very big, very difficult question. As she puts it, this is <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/goldin/interview/">economics as detective work</a> .</p><p> But Goldin&#39;s research is about more than just understanding the past; it&#39;s about changing the future. There&#39;s a pretty universal tendency to attack social problems like gender inequality head-on — to shout about them and lament them and march in the street. Sometimes this works very well, sometimes not. Goldin showed that this direct approach can be complemented by a coolly intellectual one that attempts to understand social problems at their functional level. By understanding how that technology and supply and demand and incentives complement things like social norms and laws, we can improve our ability to reshape the world to our liking. Knowledge, after all, is power. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-nobel-for-the-story-of-women-in?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-nobel-for-the-story-of-women-in?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p> ]]>;

But first there&#39;s one more thing about the Israel-Hamas war that I have to get off my chest.</p><p> The above image is from <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/08/nyc-pro-palestinian-rally-slammed-as-abhorrent-as-hamas-attacks-israel/">a rally</a> by the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America in support of the Palestinian cause. The rally was on October 8, one day after over a thousand Hamas gunmen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2023_Gaza%E2%88%92Israel_conflict">attacked Israel</a> . It was one of many similar <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnecticutDSA/status/1710977718798397584">rallies</a> by local DSA <a href="https://twitter.com/Nowooski/status/1711228710127624514">chapters</a> around the country, as well as on various college campuses. The woman in the picture reportedly flashed the swastika at pro-Israel counter-protesters.</p><p> In case you haven&#39;t already read all about it, the Hamas gunmen <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/08/israel-festival-attack-gaza-militants/">attacked a music festival</a> , killing <a href="https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1711091011982623125">at least 260</a> festival attendees and taking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-hamas-explained.html">scores of others</a> hostage. The gunmen then proceeded to attack surrounding Israeli towns, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewFeinberg/status/1711444450512159006">massacring</a> random civilians indiscriminately. The total body count of the Hamas attack is estimated at up to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3237210/hundreds-dead-israel-hamas-war-lebanons-hezbollah-launches-attacks">1000 Israelis</a> so far, though this number might rise as more bodies are discovered. <a href="https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/1711784332543627549">Babies</a> were found <a href="https://twitter.com/hxhassan/status/1711828903210209448">burned</a> . Videos have shown Hamas <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/10/09/israel-hamas-hostage-death/">massacring</a> some of the hostages it took. Hamas <a href="https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1711513305854943442">posted</a> some of the livestreamed execution videos to the victims&#39; Facebook pages. There are also numerous <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/girls-raped-next-to-their-dead-friends-at-rave-massacre-4OQOewv0ezTxkKPOCxVzTV">reports of rape</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/10/kidnappings-israel-hamas-photographs/675593/">other abuses</a> by the Hamas fighters. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/politics/americans-israel-gaza/index.html">Eleven Americans</a> were among the victims, as well as citizens of <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-latest-foreigners-killed-in-israel-hamas-war-include-us-french-thai-citizens-101696866423018.html">various other countries</a> who had attended or worked at the festival.</p><p> This is the kind of action that would be rightfully denounced as a war crime in any war. I&#39;m a big supporter of Ukraine, but if Ukrainian commandos massacred a Russian music festival, I would condemn it harshly and demand that the Ukrainian government make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again. But many of the American leftists holding pro-Palestinian rallies gleefully celebrated the targeting of civilians as an act of liberation, even joking about the murders. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1711145162657673347">you can watch a video</a> where one of the speakers at the NYC rally says:</p><blockquote><p> And as you might have seen, there was some sort of rave or desert party where they were having a great time, until the resistance came in electrified hang gliders and took at least several dozen hipsters.</p></blockquote><p> The audience cheers his description of the atrocities, whooping with delight. Meanwhile, posters for other rallies <a href="https://twitter.com/bswagspeare/status/1711528099954012636">were decorated</a> with heroic images of the paragliders that the Hamas attackers used to attack the festival. Some chapters <a href="https://twitter.com/Nowooski/status/1711624199830462965">explicitly praised</a> the attacks.</p><p> In other countries, meanwhile, the rallies were even more bloodthirsty. <a href="https://twitter.com/AustralianJA/status/1711501583295680694">Here&#39;s a video</a> of one from Sydney, Australia, where people are chanting “Gas the Jews!”</p><p> Online, leftist rhetoric in

Elizabeth Warren, who has been consistently pro-Palestinian over the years, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshKraushaar/status/1711420664622592272">broke down in tears</a> at the reports of Hamas&#39; violence and said “I&#39;m here today to say unequivocally there is no justification for terrorism ever.” And so on.

It&#39;s one thing to believe that Israel is an apartheid regime and that war against it is justified; it&#39;s another to believe that massacring random festival goers is an acceptable way to prosecute that war. And even if you do think that our modern definition of “war crime” is too restrictive, and that killing large numbers of enemy civilians is an acceptable way to force a belligerent to throw in the towel, it&#39;s still repugnant to joyfully <em>cheer</em> that slaughter, and to march side by side with those who advocate genocide.</p><p> And especially galling is the fact that many of the same leftists now celebrating Hamas&#39; massacre as a righteous blow against occupation refuse to give similar support to Ukraine&#39;s defense against Russian occupation.

There is absolutely no moral consistency here. It&#39;s just that one occupation is by a power that&#39;s more-or-less aligned with the West, while the other occupation is by a power that&#39;s opposed to the West. It&#39;s pure unadulterated <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/02/28/campism-and-the-war-in-ukraine/">campism</a> .</p><p> Now, some of you who really dislike leftists are going to respond “See, Noah? This is who they are. This is who they&#39;ve always been!” And maybe you&#39;re right. After all, during the 20th century, a decent number of Western leftists defended Stalin, idolized Mao, and denied the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. But at least those 20th century apologists could tell themselves that those regimes were building a utopian society, and they had to break a few heads…er, eggs…to get there. Hamas, in contrast, is a religious right-wing group, and its supporters explicitly use Nazi stylings. Leftists have fallen pretty low if that&#39;s the best team they can find to cheer for.</p><p> In fact, I think “fallen pretty low” is actually the key here. The communist project of the 20th century failed spectacularly, as did follow-up efforts like Hugo Chavez. Decolonization happened, and the European empires vanished. Democratic socialism succeeded in Europe, but that success — which was ultimately driven by reformist progressive types rather than by revolution — doesn&#39;t seem to admit much room for improvement. Swedish workers are not going to start a revolution, because Swedish social democracy is pretty damn nice.</p><p> This leaves Western leftists without much to fight for. Sure, some claim that African and Latin American countries are still “colonized” because they don&#39;t get paid enough for their natural resource exports, but very few people actually believe that, and even fewer care enough to march in the street. Nor do most people think that climate change is going to force a dramatic reordering of society — we&#39;re just going to build some solar panels and electric cars and stuff. Most <em>actual</em> imperialism in the world is now done by countries like China and Russia that are opposed to the West (and Western leftists only ever oppose the West). And despite continuous leftist shrieking that neoliberalism has left both the world and America impoverished, on some level everyone knows that global poverty has plunged and that most Americans are materially secure.</p><p> The Palestinian cause was different; it was an exception to this end-of-history ennui. Here was real obvious oppression instead of some hand-wavey theory. Here was a liberation struggle that could be (somewhat) plausibly depicted as decolonial. Israel&#39;s alliance with the US makes it plausibly part of the West, meaning Western leftists feel OK opposing it. And because most mainstream progressives instinctively support Israel&#39;s continued existence, this was an issue that allowed Western leftists to draw a bright distinction between themselves and the left-of-center establishment.</p><p> Thus, Western leftists began to lean ever harder on the Palestinian cause, making it ever more central to their view of geopolitics. While everyone else was arguing about the Ukraine war, tensions with China, genocide in Myanmar, or whatever, for Western leftists it often seems like it&#39;s all Palestine, all day long.</p><p> (Obviously I am speaking in broad generalizations here, subject to all the usual caveats.)</p><p> So when their chosen heroes — the freedom fighters in whom they invested so much moral cachet — showed up at a concert and started beheading raver kids and Asian workers and abducting grandmas and God knows what else, what were Western leftists supposed to do? In situations like that there are really only two things you <em>can</em> do, without switching your whole ideology — you either tell yourself that your team&#39;s inhumanity is justified in the name of higher goals, and march shoulder to shoulder in the streets with the most belligerent elements, or you pull back and call on both sides to avoid killing civilians. Left-leaning leaders chose the latter, but many on the grassroots chose the former.</p><p> In any case, don&#39;t let my analytical tone hide my moral disgust here. People always have a choice whether to cheer for atrocities or to refuse to cheer for them. When your rallies end up with swastikas and “Gas the Jews” and people making fun of dead innocents, well, you made the wrong choice. This episode is going to show a lot of Americans that the leftist movement contains, at the grassroots level, a lot of very inhumane, bloodthirsty people. Ultimately that revelation will hurt the movement in the eyes of progressive Americans, draining some of the goodwill it built up over the last decade. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/western-leftists-have-lost-the-plot?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"> <a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/western-leftists-have-lost-the-plot?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p> ]]>;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
