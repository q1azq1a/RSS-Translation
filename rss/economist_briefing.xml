data-caps="initial">没有</span><small>哪个国家的</small>邻国比中国多，有14条陆地边界。它的街区不仅拥挤，而且喧闹。有一个流氓国家，朝鲜；饱受战争蹂躏的国家，例如缅甸；与其存在日益严重的领土争端的国家，例如印度；其他与它有重叠海事主张的国家，例如日本；还有一个国家——台湾——它不断威胁要入侵。这是一个在任何情况下都难以相处的群体，但中国有缺陷的外交使这一任务变得更加困难。</p><p class="article__body-text">几个世纪以来，中国领导人认为世界是由龙王座延伸出来的一系列同心圆。里面的代表的是皇帝直接统治的领土。随后日本、越南和朝鲜等邻国也通过进贡承认天皇的最高权威。最外面的是外国人，他们与中国的贸易也常常被视为贡品。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">中国当今的统治者习近平对这一世界观进行了21世纪的诠释。在国内，他使自己成为共产党的“核心”并镇压异见，特别是在边境地区。在全球范围内，他使中国成为一个更加自信的大国。但正如他在2013年指示官员那样，他将中国的邻国与中国更紧密地联系在一起的努力——“温暖民心，增强我们的亲和力、感召力和影响力”——并没有按计划进行。</p><p class="article__body-text">一些邻国现在正在与美国更加紧密地结盟，以对抗中国日益增强的自信。大多数对中国最友好的国家都不稳定。其他人担心它的意图。在<small>联合国</small>最近的投票中，一半的中国近邻与中国分道扬镳，谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，只有五人支持最近拒绝批评其新疆政策的声明。这一切都表明中国外交政策的弱点可能会损害习近平的雄心。简而言之，如果中国不能让自己的邻国加入进来，它真的能挑战美国在世界上的领导地位吗？</p><p class="article__body-text">强国常常试图通过在经济、军事、政治和文化方面主导其地区来增强自身的繁荣和安全。近代以来，法国、德国、日本、俄罗斯等都曾以武力谋求局部霸权，并造成了毁灭性的后果。欧盟已经和平扩张，但在国防和安全方面仍然处于边缘地位。只有美国能够长期统治该地区。</p><p class="article__body-text">这在一定程度上是由于地理因素，它帮助美国将其他大国拒之门外。但它也通过互惠互利的安排与邻国建立了联系，包括与墨西哥和加拿大的自由贸易协定、与两国（特别是加拿大）的密切防务关系以及相对开放的边界。美国的软实力也有帮助。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

class="article__body-text">中国的周边地区更具挑战性。它有22,800公里的陆地边界，比任何其他国家都多。此外，其所有八条海上边界都存在争议。中国的邻国包括印度和俄罗斯等经济和军事大国，它们都有自己的地区野心。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">毗邻国家现在大致分为三个阵营（见地图）：脆弱或失败国家（阿富汗、老挝、缅甸、尼泊尔、朝鲜和巴基斯坦）；关系密切但又害怕中国统治的亦敌亦敌（蒙古、俄罗斯和中亚国家）；以及与美国签订防务条约或进行军事合作的国家（印度、日本、菲律宾、韩国、越南和台湾，尽管中国不认为它是一个国家）。</p><p class="article__body-text">中国官员否认寻求地区霸权。在他们的说法中，中国只想收回其合法边界，而不是扩大边界或主宰邻国。他们指责美国挫败了中国的野心。 “以<small>美国</small>为首的西方国家对我们实行全方位遏制、围剿，”习近平在三月份的一次讲话中抱怨道。</p><p class="article__body-text">白宫最近确实在努力改善与中国周边国家的关系。然而，习近平与其邻国之间的许多问题可以追溯到他们感到被美国忽视（巴拉克·奥巴马担任总统期间）或对此感到震惊（唐纳德·特朗普担任总统期间）的时期。邻国的官员和学者表示，对中国的保留实际上源于其自身的失误。他们特别提到了在领土问题上的过度强硬、随意或胁迫性的经济政策以及根植于中国帝国历史和对其未来的宏大假设的高压外交方式。大多数人对中国的保证不相信，特别是考虑到中国支持俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，并暗示强权就是正确的。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 1979年与越南打了一场没有结果的战争后的三十年里，中国对领土争端采取了和解的态度，在专注于经济改革的同时选择了稳定。 1991年至2002年间，它解决了与哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、老挝、塔吉克斯坦和越南的陆地边界分歧。也许最引人注目的是，2008年，它签署了一系列协议中的最后一个，巩固了俄罗斯对19世纪从中国吞并的一块乌克兰大小领土的控制。</p></div><p class="article__body-text">对抗的倾向在习近平上台之前就已经开始，但他此后强调了这种做法，使领土问题成为他“民族复兴”承诺的核心。毫无疑问，中国在短期内成功地改变了领土现状，使其对自己有利。现在，中国的船只和飞机定期在东海与日本主张重叠的岩石点周围巡逻。中国在南海有争议的岛礁上建造了七个坚固的人工岛屿，增强了其在那里执行其主张的能力。在一些有争议的边境地区，印度军队不再巡逻。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">然而，这些成果的代价是让中国的邻国感到震惊。日本去年12月通过了一项新的安全战略，承诺到2027年将国防开支增加一倍，并建立新的反击能力，背离其自二战以来所信奉的和平主义原则。日本还在防务领域与美国进行更密切的合作，包括在台湾问题上的合作，并加强与美国盟友和其他中国邻国的安全合作。</p><p class="article__body-text">习近平对南海的态度也引发了菲律宾的巨大变化，菲律宾是与中国主张重叠的五个国家中唯一的美国正式盟友。其前任总统罗德里戈·杜特尔特 (Rodrigo Duterte) 于 2016 年宣布与美国“分离”，并承诺与中国的“意识形态潮流”保持一致。但在中国继续骚扰菲律宾船只且未能建设承诺的基础设施后，两国关系恶化。</p><p class="article__body-text">新总统小费迪南德·马科斯现在重新强调与美国的关系。今年二月，他允许其使用四个新的军事基地，其中三个位于北部，这些基地可能在台湾战争中发挥作用。 4月，双方举行了有史以来最大规模的联合军事演习，共有12,000名美军士兵参加。他们计划恢复在南海的联合海军巡逻。与此同时，中国警告菲律宾，它正在陷入“地缘政治冲突的深渊”。</p><p class="article__body-text">越南也对南海拥有主权，并在 2010 年代与中国发生了几次海上对峙。它在军事上也向美国靠拢。 2018年，它允许一艘美国航母访问其港口，这是40多年来的首次。此后又有两人来访，其中一位是今年六月。美国还向越南提供了国防装备，如飞机、无人机和海岸警卫队快艇。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度是另一个重新评估关系的邻国，过去四年来，印度与中国在有争议的喜马拉雅边境地区发生了一系列冲突，其中一次冲突造成至少 20 名印度士兵和 4 名中国士兵死亡。这是自 1962 年中国赢得短暂边境战争以来最致命的此类冲突之一。双边贸易持续增长（去年增长 8.6%），但印度限制​​来自中国的投资，禁止了数十款中国应用程序，并对几家公司发起了税务搜查。中国企业。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度现在还与美国及其盟国在国防方面进行更密切的合作，包括双边合作以及作为包括美国、日本和澳大利亚在内的四方机制的一部分。在六月对华盛顿进行国事访问期间，印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪签署了一系列国防工业协议，这些协议最终可能使印度成为西方设计武器的联合制造基地。</p><p class="article__body-text">中国不安的邻国也在更加密切地相互合作。印度训练了越南潜艇兵，向越南提供了12艘高速巡逻艇，并同意为其提供一艘导弹护卫舰。印度最近还向菲律宾出售巡航导弹。日本为越南提供了巡逻艇，为菲律宾提供了雷达，自 2020 年以来，菲律宾还从韩国接收了三艘海军舰艇，并且还在接收更多舰艇。</p><p class="article__body-text">经济形势不太明朗。中国是所有邻国不可或缺的合作伙伴，包括那些有领土主张冲突的国家。到 2022 年，与 20 个陆地和海上邻国的双边货物贸易额略高于 2 万美元，在过去十年中增长了 74%。这比美国和<small>欧盟</small>与同一国家的贸易总额还要多。对于较贫穷的国家来说，中国也是一个重要的投资来源国。一项名为“区域全面经济伙伴关系”的贸易协定于 2022 年生效，涉及中国及其八个邻国，将进一步促进跨境贸易。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">但与中国的贸易是不平衡的：中国向邻国出售的产品多于从邻国购买的产品。反过来，他们向美国和<small>欧盟的</small>销售量总和超过了向中国的销售量（见图表）。更重要的是，中国有一个令人不安的习惯，即利用其经济影响力来惩罚激怒其的邻国。这也不是从习近平开始的。一个早期的例子发生在2010年，当时中国在东海发生冲突后禁止向日本出口稀土矿物。然而，习近平上任后扩大了这种做法。</p><p class="article__body-text">蒙古是他的首要目标之一。 2016年接待达赖喇嘛后，中国暂停了贷款和通关。此后，蒙古变得更加依赖与中国的贸易，其出口商品的约 84%（主要是煤炭）都来自中国。但蒙古政府通过与<small>北约</small>的合作来进行对冲，北约正在帮助其建立网络防御，用英语培训军官，并与<small>北约</small>部队一起更有效地行动（蒙古军队曾在科索沃和阿富汗服役）。</p><p class="article__body-text">围绕达赖喇嘛的争吵也加剧了这个国家的反华情绪，许多人对中国内蒙古地区的少数民族亲属的待遇感到不满。禁止在那里教授蒙古语尤其不受欢迎。蒙古前总统查希亚吉·额勒贝格道尔吉称这是“旨在解散和消灭蒙古人作为一个独立民族的暴行”。</p><p class="article__body-text">但韩国是中国施压的错误例子。 2013年朴槿惠就任总统后，寻求与中国建立更密切的关系，甚至参加了北京的阅兵式。但2017年，在韩国允许美国部署反导弹电池后，中国发起了经济抵制，表面上是为了威慑朝鲜，但中国也认为这是一种威胁。在那之前，韩国牙山研究所对其他国家的公众看法进行的定期调查显示，十分之五的人对中国的评价始终高于中国。去年得分为2.7。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">韩国现在正在加强与美国的联盟，并搁置与其前殖民统治者日本的长期分歧。两国还联手以美国为首的努力，减少中国在两国供应链中的作用。这为中国周边国家创造了新的机遇。韩国汽车制造商现代汽车今年 5 月表示，未来 10 年将在印度投资 25 亿美元。越南（韩国已经是越南最大的外国投资者）去年 12 月表示，两家韩国电子产品制造商三星和<small>LG</small>将另外投资 60 亿美元。</p><p class="article__body-text">对于较贫穷的邻国来说，中国的“一带一路”项目有助于弥补其强制倾向。成功案例包括一条横跨中亚的货运铁路，目前承载着中欧贸易的 8%；一条从中国到老挝的新铁路于四月份开始提供客运服务，据世界银行称，这将使老挝的<small>GDP</small>增长21%；能源项目使易发生停电的巴基斯坦发电能力增加了 8<small>吉瓦</small>。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，此类举措往往因过度承诺和忽视当地情绪的倾向而受到损害。在尼泊尔，中国尚未完成任何承诺的“一带一路”项目。马来西亚已经放弃了其中几个项目，声称成本过高。 “一带一路”相关债务问题已将巴基斯坦和老挝推向违约边缘。缅甸内战推迟了中国的几个大型项目，并进一步削弱了公众对中国的支持，中国支持广受憎恨的军政府。</p><p class="article__body-text">中国也未能阻止中国企业和犯罪团伙利用“一带一路”。老挝、缅甸和菲律宾都见证了中国资金和工人大量涌入赌博业，导致犯罪率上升。他们和其他较贫穷的邻国仍然渴望发展援助。但随着中国面临经济放缓和“一带一路”建设规模缩减，许多人将目光投向了日本，因为日本的援助负担较轻。</p><p class="article__body-text">新加坡<small>尤索夫伊萨</small>研究所最近的一项调查显示，东南亚邻国对中国存在疑虑。在马来西亚、缅甸、越南和菲律宾，对它表示不信任的人多于信任的人。日本对中国在该地区的所有六个邻国的信任度更高，美国对其中五个邻国的信任度更高。中国的旅游或留学目的地排名也低于美国、澳大利亚和<small>欧盟</small>。</p><p class="article__body-text">即使在与中国关系良好的哈萨克斯坦，人们也持谨慎态度。霍尔果斯是一个边境口岸，边境上有一个五平方公里的免税区，局势紧张。中国一侧像海市蜃楼一样从草原上拔地而起，有两打多层购物中心，出售从皮夹克到平板电视等各种商品。这里挤满了哈萨克斯坦购物者，中国防暴警察手持盾牌和警棍严密监视着他们。与此同时，哈萨克斯坦方面只有几座半建的低层购物中心，顾客稀少，员工大多是中国人。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 22岁的哈萨克斯坦法律系学生卡纳特·阿吉巴耶夫很喜欢刚从中国这边买的便宜的冬衣和背包。但当问及中国在哈萨克斯坦的投资，或者最近达成的免签证协议时，他呼应了其他受访者的担忧：“我们会被淹没。”俄罗斯的宣传煽动这种恐华情绪。但中国也做出了贡献，尤其是最近将包括哈萨克族在内的多达一百万中国穆斯林关押在再教育营中。 2022 年，中亚晴雨表的一项调查发现，只有 35% 的哈萨克斯坦人支持中国参与能源和基础设施项目，低于 2018 年的近一半。</p><p class="article__body-text">还有中国“战狼”外交官的捶胸顿足的宣言。仅在四月，中国驻马尼拉大使似乎就威胁了在台湾的菲律宾工人，而驻巴黎大使则质疑前苏联国家的合法性。一个月后，习近平在一次峰会上接待了五位中亚领导人，充满了唐朝的景象，当时中国统治着中亚大部分地区。</p><p class="article__body-text"> “这看起来就像一位皇帝在接待部落首领，”哈萨克斯坦活动家别克扎特·马克苏图利 (Bekzat Maqsutuly) 说，他因计划抗议峰会上签署的允许中国和哈萨克斯坦之间免签旅行的协议而被拘留。一名哈萨克斯坦官员驳斥了他的抱怨，称其“不合理”。政府数据显示，在哈萨克斯坦工作的中国公民仅有 3,412 名。这项签证协议将使哈萨克斯坦卡车司机和商人以及中国游客受益。即便如此，这位官员补充道，哈萨克斯坦的未来不在于从属于俄罗斯或中国，而在于与许多大国的密切关系，包括美国、日本和<small>欧盟</small>（哈萨克斯坦最大的贸易伙伴和外国投资者）以及土耳其是<small>北约</small>成员国，在哈萨克斯坦联合生产武器。</p><p class="article__body-text">这并不意味着中国的邻国会背弃它。考虑到其经济影响力，这是不可想象的。但这预示着未来习近平的霸权野心将受挫，因为与他接壤的较稳定和有活力的国家要么抵制他的倡议，要么两面下注，而最不稳定、前景最黯淡的国家则越来越依赖中国的支持。美国及其盟国面临的挑战是为中国的邻国提供更多的对冲手段。对习近平来说，这个问题更为关乎生存：中国能否接受自己在与邻国的关系中表现不佳的情况？

class="article__body-text">如果通胀继续恶化，金融市场将很快感受到其影响。持续的价格上涨不会平等地影响所有资产类别，因此需要相对重新定价。但那些一次性的利润和损失并不是唯一的后果。在<a href="https://www.economist.com/economy">实体经济</a>中，通货膨胀通过不断、任意地重新分配财富来腐蚀信任。在金融领域，这种腐蚀性动力不那么明显，但同样真实。</p><p class="article__body-text">央行行长们仍然坚定地表示，他们将把通胀率恢复到目标水平， <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/04/04/the-fed-may-not-get-inflation-down-to-2-says-richard-clarida">通常是 2%</a> 。不过，华尔街的许多人对此表示怀疑。全球最大资产管理公司贝莱德研究部门的负责人让·博伊文 (Jean Boivin) 直言不讳地表达了自己的观点。 “如果央行真的愿意的话，总能将通胀率拉回2%，但现在需要的需求压缩太大，难以承受。”他相信这一数字将稳定在 3-4% 左右。 2018年至2022年担任美联储副主席的理查德·克拉里达(Richard Clarida)也有类似的观点。 “鲍威尔先生领导的美联储……最终将达到它想要的通胀率，”他最近为本报写道。 “但它可能更像是‘两点某物’而不是‘两点零’。”当被问及“某事”是什么意思时，他回答道：“当他们开始考虑降息时，可能是 2.8% 或 2.9%。” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div

的情况下，将立即损害美联储的信誉：如果目标可以被忽略一次，为什么不能再忽略一次呢？</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，反对央行行长的各种力量将通过限制供应和刺激需求来推高价格，这是令人恐惧的。人口趋势正在导致许多富裕国家的劳动力减少，这可能会导致劳动力短缺。新冠肺炎 (covid-19) 大流行、乌克兰战争和中美贸易破裂暴露了全球供应链的脆弱性，这促使各国在当地复制这种脆弱性。在需求方面，增加国防开支、减少温室气体排放所需的投资以及支持人口老龄化的成本都越来越被视为至关重要。</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text">阅读我们有关通货膨胀的一揽子计划的更多内容：<br> <a

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">年通货膨胀率增加一两个百分点可能看起来并不多。然而，这对投资回报的影响是巨大的。当通货膨胀率为2%时购买十年期国债，最终返还的本金将是其原值的82%。当通货膨胀率为 4% 时，该数字降至 68%（见图 1）。从长远来看，差距会更大。如果在此期间通货膨胀率平均为 2%，则 30 年期债券的本金在返还时将价值其原始价值的 55%。如果通货膨胀率为 4%，则价值 31%。</p><p class="article__body-text">但本金和固定利息支付价值的侵蚀并不是通胀上升影响债券投资的唯一方式。价格上涨引发了人们对央行将加息的预期，进而推高债券市场的收益率以符合这些预期。债券价格是收益率的反函数：当收益率上升时，价格下跌。</p><p class="article__body-text">第二个效应的规模取决于债券的期限。如果市场认为央行准备好容忍通胀小幅上升，他们就会认为近期加息的幅度会更少，而不是更多。这种预期将推低短期收益率并推高价格。与此同时，除了最终利率上升的预期之外，通胀上升带来的波动性和不确定性也会提高“期限溢价”（金融术语，指长期贷款人要求额外收益，以换取承担更多风险）。总体效果是，在初始调整期间，期限较短的债券投资组合会比期限较长的债券投资组合表现得更好。</p><p class="article__body-text">通胀挂钩债券能否提供更多保护？理论上是的，但实际上并没有足够的数量可供使用。例如，与通胀挂钩的国债仅占总数的 8%。如果这种不稳定导致实际收益率大幅波动，那么即使这些资产在通胀高企、不稳定且不可预测的情况下也可能表现不佳。去年就是一个很好的例子。实际收益率随着通货膨胀而飙升，损害了与通货膨胀挂钩的债券和普通债券的价值。数据提供商彭博社编制的通胀挂钩国债指数年内下跌了 12%。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

class="article__body-text">从表面上看，股票非常适合抵御高通胀时期。它们的价值来自于相关公司的盈利，如果整个经济体的价格上涨，那么这些盈利总体上也应该上涨。曼集团资产管理公司埃德·科尔表示，假设通胀保持在高位但稳定，而经济则在其他方面蓬勃发展。管理者应该能够控制成本并相应地调整价格。无论如何，“股票是名义上的野兽。如果数字上升，每个人都会沾沾自喜。”</p><p class="article__body-text">从长远来看，埃尔罗伊·迪姆森（Elroy Dimson）、保罗·马什（Paul Marsh）和迈克·斯汤顿（Mike Staunton）三位学者为瑞士信贷<i>全球投资回报年鉴编制</i>的数据支持了这一点。从全球范围来看，1900 年至 2022 年间，股票轻松跑赢了通胀，年化实际回报率为 5%。</p><p class="article__body-text">但有一个障碍：通胀率越高，其稳定性就越不稳定。以美国消费者价格通胀回溯到 1913 年，当时官方数据就已开始出现。在经历了价格上涨 0% 至 5% 的年份后，随后 12 个月的平均通胀率与第一个月份的平均通胀率相差不到 1.8 个百分点。 （因此，通货膨胀率平均为 2% 的一年，紧随其后的是 0.2% 至 3.8% 之间的通货膨胀率。）当价格上涨 5% 至 10% 之间时，下一年的平均变化跃升至 3.8 个百分点。 4%的通货膨胀率几乎没有犯错的余地。</p><h2>一旦被咬，价格羞涩</h2><p class="article__body-text">对于企业来说，这种波动性更难应对。科尔先生指出， <small>IT</small>外包、商业服务和建筑等固定成本较高的行业，在这些行业中，企业在维持业务的同时几乎无法削减工资。如果这些成本随着通货膨胀而上升，但收入的调整速度较慢，那么不稳定的通货膨胀可能会导致利润和收益大幅波动。</p><p class="article__body-text">此外，在个别高通胀时期，历史记录并不能让股东感到安慰。 1900 年至 2022 年间，通货膨胀率升至 7.5% 左右，股票平均实际回报率从正转为负。即使通货膨胀低于此水平，股票的实际回报也往往会减少。换句话说，尽管从长期来看，股票往往会跑赢通胀，但在短期内，它们并不能提供真正的对冲通胀的手段。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">如果通胀居高不下，实物资产的表现将会好得多（见图 2）。房地产和基础设施以租金和使用费的形式产生收入流，这些收入通常可以根据通货膨胀而提高，甚至可以通过合同与通货膨胀挂钩。由于此类资产的供应受到限制，随着投资者寻找具有一定抵御通胀能力的资产，其实际价格也可能上涨。</p><p class="article__body-text">大宗商品也是如此。以商品期货（让投资者无需购买实际铁矿石或牛的麻烦和费用即可接触商品的金融合约）回报来衡量，此类资产的实际表现历来甚至优于股票。在通胀高于平均水平的年份，商品期货多元化投资组合相对于现金的超额实际回报平均为 11.4%。当高通胀与低增长或负增长相结合时，该资产类别往往表现良好，在这种“滞胀”年份，超额回报平均为 10%。</p><p class="article__body-text">所有这些实物资产的问题在于投资它们的困难。所有商品期货的总价值不到 5000 亿美元，仅相当于美国股票市场的 1%。如果投资者大量涌入，他们就会推高价格，使这一举措徒劳无功。与此同时，基础设施领域由私人投资经理主导，他们往往专注于向养老基金和大学捐赠基金等大型机构投资者出售产品。相比之下，尽管此类资产在高通胀的世界中很有吸引力，但个人却很难购买这些资产。</p><p class="article__body-text">其他准备利用金融市场动荡的供应商是活跃的资产管理公司。在2007-09年金融危机之后的宽松货币政策中，他们度过了一段痛苦的时光。经纪和研究公司Strategas

或更多），这会降低他们的平均业绩，因此总的来说，他们的表现可能会不佳。不过，即使考虑到这一点，多年来的最低利率和持续繁荣的市场对选股者来说仍然是艰难的。 “如果一切都齐头并进，那么无论你拥有多少技能都无关紧要，”英仕曼集团的老板卢克·埃利斯 (Luke Ellis) 说。</p><p class="article__body-text">相比之下，高通胀的回归及其带来的波动性使得熟练的投资者能够跑赢大盘。特别是“分散”，即不同资产之间业绩的巨大差异，为主动型基金经理提供了证明其价值的机会。 “很多人经历了困难时期并不意味着机会不好，”埃利斯先生说。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">然而，即使是埃利斯先生也不认为“你会突然看到 70% 的主动型基金经理的表现跑赢指数”。许多人会因宏观经济状况而措手不及，而他们以前从未遇到过这种状况。更阴险的是，他们的客户只会逐渐适应通货膨胀破坏财富的影响。资深基金经理杰里米·格兰瑟姆 (Jeremy Grantham) 最近写道，令他惊讶的是，基金经理尚未开始像 20 世纪 70 年代和 1980 年代那样，根据通货膨胀定期调整股价表现图表。</p><p class="article__body-text">这样做的话，数字看起来会更糟。名义上，<small>标</small><small>普</small>500指数在2022年下跌了19%，但今年需要上涨30%以上才能收复实际损失。随着投资者看到自己的大部分储蓄被通货膨胀吞噬，向基金经理再支付几个百分点将变得更加难以接受。正如在实体经济中，通货膨胀促使消费者怀疑企业在谋取暴利一样，在金融经济中，通货膨胀将使散户和机构投资者与那些管理资金的人对立起来。</p><h2>糖及价格</h2><p class="article__body-text">贝莱德 (BlackRock) 的马丁·贾吉提斯 (Martin Jaugietis) 认为，持续高通胀的令人惊讶的赢家可能是固定福利养老金计划，该计划在美国持有价值约 17 万亿美元的资产。此类计划投资于工人及其雇主的定期付款，以换取退休时固定收入的承诺（通常是工人最终工资的固定百分比）。 The financial health is determined by their “funding ratio”, or the value of their assets relative to the present value of the future payments they must make to retirees. As interest rates rise, this present value shrinks, since schemes can buy higher-yielding bonds, locking in cash flows that will help pay future liabilities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Provided their assets do not fall too much, the higher nominal interest rates brought on by persistent inflation would therefore be a fillip for defined-benefit schemes. This is especially true for American ones, says Mr Jaugietis, since they do not typically raise payouts to pensioners in line with inflation. Sure enough, in 2022 the funding ratios of American schemes improved markedly as inflation and interest rates rose, despite plunging asset prices. Even in Britain, where retirement payouts tend to be linked more closely to inflation, funding ratios shot up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet, as in the real economy, each winner from inflation creates a loser. In this case, the workers who have contributed to defined-benefit schemes that are not inflation-linked will lose out. After ten years of 4% inflation, someone who expected to retire with an income of $50,000 a year would see the purchasing power of that income fall by around a third. In effect the boon for defined-benefit schemes would be paid for by an arbitrary reduction in their members&#39; wealth. Many pensioners would be in the same position as workers who struggle to secure pay rises that keep pace with inflation, and just as aggrieved.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The final category of participants in financial markets that might welcome higher inflation is governments. The world over, their debt burdens have ballooned—first in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-09 and then during the covid-19 pandemic, on which the rich world spent 10% of its <small>GDP</small> . Europe&#39;s energy crisis has triggered yet more spending. Six of the <small>G</small> 7 group of large, developed economies have gross government-debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratios above 100%; only Germany&#39;s is below.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The only ways to chip away at these vast piles of debt other than inflation are turbocharged growth, tax rises or spending cuts. The first is unlikely; the others are politically painful. So governments may quietly rejoice as the real value of their debt is inflated away.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet in doing so, they risk falling foul of two groups. One is voters, whose savings lose purchasing power at the same time. The more immediate danger comes from the bond market. Investors in sovereign debt will be acutely aware that inflation is eating into their returns. Expect them to rake through governments&#39; fiscal statements with ever finer-toothed combs for signs that worse is to come.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Emerging-market countries are used to this treatment, and to the wild swings in borrowing costs and exchange rates it can bring. But for the rich world the adjustment would be painful. Britain&#39;s flirtation with disaster in September, when an irresponsibly inflationary budget sent gilt yields soaring and the pound through the floorboards, may offer a taste of things to come. Governments that lose the trust of lenders are in for a rough ride.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The idea that central banks might quietly allow inflation to fester, taking a chunk of society&#39;s stability and trust with it, may seem speculative. But look back at the past century and you will struggle to find an instance of inflation rising as far as it did in 2022, then immediately coming back under control. The trade-offs required to get it there look nightmarish. The generation of investors that is learning for the first time how to deal with elevated inflation may have plenty of time to study it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8k3epir6ho28rqm9q8euf2t5f9ibhnh7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/21/inflation-is-as-corrosive-to-investing-as-it-is-to-the-real-economy </item><item><title><![CDATA[Pretending that everything is under control in Russia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Founder of Wagner private mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin makes a statement in Bakhmut" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Editor&#39;s note:</b> On June 23rd Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner, launched an open revolt against the Kremlin, accusing the Russian army of killing his troops.

A mixture of fierce repression and unrelenting propaganda have kept the public largely quiescent. But in recent weeks the war has been seeping into everyday life. In an affluent area in south-western Moscow military trucks roar past Teslas. Recruiters stationed outside supermarkets try to enlist passers-by in the army. At a speed-dating event young women complain of the difficulty of maintaining a steady relationship—because their boyfriends have been called up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> On May 30th a swarm of drones attacked Moscow. None hit its target: they were all either shot down or disabled by jamming. Some fell close to Barvikha Luxury Village, a posh suburb. Villages close to the border with Ukraine in Belgorod province have been shelled. A few have been briefly occupied by pro-Ukrainian militias making forays across the border. These incursions met little initial resistance: many of the troops who used to guard the border had been redeployed to Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-war">Ukraine war</a> .</i></p></aside><h2> Lieutenants at loggerheads</h2><p class="article__body-text"> There are also growing signs of disarray among Russia&#39;s elite. For months Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, a mercenary force fighting on Russia&#39;s behalf, has been denouncing Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, and Valery Gerasimov, Russia&#39;s top general, as incompetent foot-draggers. But his complaints are becoming steadily shriller. He recently claimed that Russian soldiers had laid mines behind Wagner&#39;s positions. Wagner has also released a video of a Russian officer, who looked as if he had been beaten, confessing that he had shot at a vehicle used by Wagner&#39;s forces while drunk. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The incursions in Belgorod have especially incensed Mr Prigozhin (pictured). “Why are tens of thousands of people, our Russian guys, dying advancing towards the West? So that we could start giving away, step by step, pieces of Belgorod province, our native Russian land? Why is everyone silent about the deaths of these civilians? Where is their explanation to the Russian people that we are handing over our territories and civilians to be devoured?”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has a habit of provoking conflict among his subordinates to reinforce his role as an indispensable arbiter. Mr Prigozhin also serves as a useful spur to the Russian army and as a scold for rich Russians unenthused by the war. But these conflicts typically do not spill into public view. Some speculate that Mr Prigozhin could be attacking the top brass in anticipation of territorial losses in Ukraine. By denigrating the generals, he may help deflect blame from Mr Putin. Alternatively, the bickering could be a reflection of infighting between powerful factions who sense weakness on the part of the arbiter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has been keeping a low profile of late, presumably to avoid any association with military setbacks. A visit to a children&#39;s clinic and meetings with regional officials have been his only recent public appearances. His apparent lack of interest in the war and the noisy squabbling in the top ranks, whatever the reason for them, are likely to have a demoralising effect on Russia&#39;s soldiers and civilians alike. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAPBBeHQy_o?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Russia&#39;s propagandists have been trying to reassure the public, insisting that Russia had thwarted the Ukrainian counter-offensive before it had even begun. But their jaunty footage of destroyed Ukrainian tanks has been scorned by Mr Prigozhin and military bloggers. Big territorial losses will presumably lead to further tension within the Russian elites. A weakened Mr Putin, in turn, would probably resort to even greater repression to compensate for losses at the front. Mr Prigozhin is calling for martial law, a general mobilisation and the restoration of the death penalty.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What comes next will depend not just on the progress of the counter-offensive, but on the pliability of the elite and the mood of the broader public. Mr Putin has had little trouble suppressing dissent so far. But the many military setbacks and the public disagreements among his own henchmen make that job harder. “We are moving into uncharted waters,” an American official says. “And it is not just Ukraine that needs liberation, so does Russia.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:48:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

In both countries the fertility rate (the number of children a typical woman will have over her lifetime) fell below 2.1 in the 1970s. That level is known as the replacement rate, since it keeps a population stable over time. Anything lower will eventually lead to a declining population, something both Italy and Japan have suffered for about a decade. The median Italian is now 47; the median<!-- --> Japanese 49. Earlier this year, Kishida Fumio, Japan&#39;s prime minister, warned that the country is “on the brink of being unable to maintain social functions” because of its baby bust.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But Italy and Japan are no longer the most extreme examples of demographic decline. In 2022 South Korea had a fertility rate of just 0.8. A rate below one means that the next generation will be less than half the size of its parents&#39;. As recently as 2012 the <small>UN</small> projected that South Korea&#39;s population would shrink by only a fifth or so by the end of the century, from 52m today to 41m by 2100. More recent forecasts, however, suggest that the population will fall by more than half over the same period, to just 24m (see chart 1).</p><p class="article__body-text"> South Korea may be an exceptional case, but demographic decline is becoming commonplace. In 2010 98 countries and territories recorded fertility rates below 2.1. By 2021 the number had grown to 124, more than half of the places for which the <small>UN</small> collects data (see map). By 2030 it expects the tally to reach 136. </p></div><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/828/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="828" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/828/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/129/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/194/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/259/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/388/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/414/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/518/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/647/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/828/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Matthias Doepke, an economist who studies the financial causes and effects of changes in fertility, notes that falling birth rates are no longer limited to richer countries or to wealthier families within a given country. “There&#39;s a global convergence in women&#39;s aspirations for careers and family life,” says Mr Doepke. Fertility rates for women with fewer years of formal education have fallen towards the levels of their more educated peers. In fact, women in America with exactly 16 years of schooling (mostly those with undergraduate degrees) have marginally fewer children on average than those with more schooling. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> By the same token, low fertility rates have spread from rich countries such as Italy and Japan to middle-income ones such as Thailand (1.3) and Brazil (1.6). Even more notably, India&#39;s fertility rate recently fell below 2.1 and is expected to keep falling. Since it accounts for a fifth of the world&#39;s population, that will have global repercussions. The 15 biggest economies in the world, including Brazil, China, India and Mexico, all have fertility rates below 2.1.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In 2021 there were 782m people aged between 21 and 30 in countries where fertility is below the replacement rate. By 2050 this group, in effect the potential number of home-grown entrants to the workforce, is expected to have dropped by a fifth, to 619m. This fall is not some subjective and questionable forecast: most members of that generation have already been born, and fertility rates do not tend to change rapidly. In countries in which the fertility rate is below 1.5, which includes almost all of East Asia and much of Europe, the decline will be more extreme, with the same cohort contracting by 37%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Instead of a population structure shaped like a pyramid, with each new generation bigger than the one that preceded it, or even a pillar, with all generations similar in size, these countries will become inverted pyramids, with older generations replaced by smaller and smaller cohorts. In parts of the world this has already happened: the number of Chinese aged between 21 and 30 has already fallen from 232m at its peak in 2012 to 181m in 2021. The decline will accelerate rapidly in the 2040s, leaving China with fewer than 100m people in the same pool in the mid-2050s. The population of Europe in the same age category will fall from around 85m to below 60m over the same period. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The obvious way to compensate for dwindling birth rates is <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/28/a-new-wave-of-mass-migration-has-begun">immigration</a> , which is on the rise in much of the rich world, despite the political tensions it has generated in recent years. But as demographic decline affects more and more countries, educated migrants will become harder to find, even as the shrinking of the native-born population accelerates in many rich countries. For China, with a population of some 1.4bn, the notion that enough immigrants could be found to reverse the effects of dwindling birth rates is fanciful. Although India&#39;s population is still growing, it will peak in the 2060s, if not sooner. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region of the world that seems likely to be a big source of potential migrants for many years to come. But even there, birth rates are falling more quickly than past projections predicted. Although immigration will continue to temper demographic decline in many countries for decades, in the long run, it cannot fully compensate for the baby bust in big economies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some of the consequences of these demographic shifts are well known. An ever greyer population will mean higher spending on public pensions and health care, but there will be fewer people of working age to pay the taxes required. The rich world currently has around three people between 20 and 64 years old for every one over 65. By 2050 this ratio will shrink to less than two to one. That will necessitate later retirement ages, higher taxes or both.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The economic consequences of demographic decline are not only fiscal, however. Labour is one of the three main determinants of growth, along with capital and the efficiency with which both are used (productivity). Shrinking workforces, other things being equal, automatically lead to lower economic growth. But demographic decline also has knock-on effects on capital and productivity that are much less well understood.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Many economists believe that a smaller working population will push down interest rates in real terms (meaning, after accounting for inflation), because there will be fewer investment opportunities and a large stock of savings accumulated by those in or near retirement. But others, such as Charles Goodhart, a former official at the Bank of England, believe the effect will be the opposite. As more people enter retirement and so stop saving but continue to consume, there will be less funding for investment, pushing real interest rates up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Both sides agree that an ageing population will reduce both savings and investment, but disagree about which will decline more quickly. But the balance of evidence points towards lower real interest rates: many developing economies still have decades of savings accumulation ahead of them, and retirees often cling to their savings rather than running them down. Either way, demographic changes will have huge implications for markets. Broadly speaking, low real interest rates are good for those who have already accumulated assets but bad for those still trying to save, including the increasing numbers of workers approaching retirement with inadequate nest eggs.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But it is on productivity that demographic decline may have the most troubling effect. Younger people have more of what psychologists call “fluid intelligence”, meaning the ability to solve new problems and engage with new ideas. Older people have more “crystallised intelligence”—a stock of knowledge about how things work built up over time. There are no precise cut-offs, but most studies suggest that fluid intelligence tends to peak in early adulthood and to begin to decline in people&#39;s 30s. Both types of intelligence are useful: companies, industries and economies need both youngsters able to respond to new challenges and seasoned veterans with a detailed understanding of their trade. But the two are not of equivalent value when it comes to innovation. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> In research published in 2021, Mary Kaltenberg and Adam Jaffe, both economists, and Margie Lachman, a psychologist, used a database of 3m patents filed over more than 40 years to explore the relationship between innovation and age. Depending on the scientific discipline, the authors note that patenting rates peak in a researcher&#39;s late 30s and early 40s. The rates of patenting then decline only gradually through their 40s and 50s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But for disruptive innovations, which fundamentally change a scientific field, the picture is very different. The researchers used<!-- --> a measure of disruptiveness based on the number of citations of a given invention in future patents. If a particular patent is cited by subsequent inventors, but that patent&#39;s technological predecessors are not, it is categorised as a disruptive rather than an incremental innovation. For instance, the work of Kary Mullis, a Nobel-prize-winning biochemist, on polymerase chain reactions underpins much modern genetic and medical testing. After Mullis published his work, citations of prior technologies in the same field nosedived. Mr Jaffe, Ms Kaltenberg and Ms Lachman find that patents filed by the very youngest inventors are much more likely to be completely novel, discipline-changing innovations, and that as inventors age the patents they file become increasingly incremental.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This matters, because innovation raises productivity. Improvements to existing processes and the invention of entirely new ways of doing things enable more to be produced with the same amount of labour and capital. In the long term, it is only by raising productivity that standards of living can be lifted. Demographic decline will chip away at that contribution over time by reducing the number of novel ideas stemming from the fluidly intelligent minds of young workers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even a fractionally lower rate of productivity growth will compound over the years to make an economy significantly smaller. During the particularly rapid post-war boom in economic growth in the rich world, between 1947 and 1973, productivity growth accounted for about 60% of the rise in output per worker in America, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany. America has grown much faster than the rest of the rich world since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, thanks in large part to its bigger gains in productivity.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If the decline in fertility was confined to a few countries, or a particular region, the impact on innovation might not be so severe. Technologies invented in one country eventually spread to others. The spinning jenny and the computer chip didn&#39;t have to be reinvented in every corner of the world to improve productivity globally. But the fact that fertility is declining simultaneously in a large proportion of countries means that the consequences in terms of reduced innovation will be felt globally.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some researchers believe such a demographically driven reduction in innovation is already under way in parts of the world. James Liang, a Chinese economist and demographer, notes that entrepreneurship is markedly lower in older countries: an increase of one standard deviation in the median age in a country, equivalent to about 3.5 years, leads to a decrease of 2.5 percentage points<!-- --> in the entrepreneurship rate (the proportion of adults who start their own business). That is a huge effect, considering the global entrepreneurship rate was around 6.1% in 2010.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What is more, this relationship does not seem to be simply a function of the relative lack of young people in ageing societies. Young people in such countries also seem to start businesses at lower rates than their peers in less wizened societies. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> This phenomenon, according to Mr Liang, may be the cause of Japan&#39;s “entrepreneur vacuum”.

Once-leading roles in hydrogen storage, self-driving vehicles and computer vision (a form of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret images) have been reduced to supporting roles behind America, China or both (see chart 2).</p></div><h2> Needling nabobs of natalism</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Governments are largely powerless to reverse declining birth rates. Attempts in various countries to prod women to have more children have typically yielded meagre results. Research on the expensive support provided by governments in Hungary and Poland, in the form of income-tax credits and flat payments respectively, suggests a limited effect on fertility. Singapore offers large grants to the parents of new children, which now run to S$11,000 ($8,300) for the first two children, and S$13,000 for any more, on top of tax rebates and child-care subsidies. Parents are given priority over other buyers in subsidised apartment sale schemes. But Singapore&#39;s total fertility rate is just 1.0: whatever the effect of the policies, it is nowhere near big enough to avert demographic decline. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Of course, birth rates are not the only, or even the main determinant of productivity. If they were, some of sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s poorest economies would be the world&#39;s most dynamic. Levels of education, the reliability of legal and financial systems and the existence of networks of innovators interacting with one another all matter. Japan is still more innovative than many rich countries with a lower average age. But demography can magnify or muffle a country&#39;s underlying potential.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That suggests ways to counteract the effects of demographic decline on innovation, by focusing on other factors that increase productivity. The most obvious is education, which allows ageing societies to make better use of the dwindling pool of young people. Especially in middle-income countries such as Brazil and China, there are millions who do not receive proper schooling, and whose contribution to the economy is therefore small. The same is true, albeit to a lesser extent, in much of the rich world. No matter how intelligent they are, uneducated workers cannot hope to come up with groundbreaking ideas in medicine or computing, say. As the potential workforce shrinks, maximising the output of everyone in it will become essential, and could help offset the effects of an ageing population for some time, at least in the realm of innovation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Technology can also provide ways to cope with demographic change, from telemedicine to the increased use of robots in service industries. Such innovations can undoubtedly ease the difficulties presented by an ageing society, whether by directly contributing to the care of the elderly or by automating the roles of young workers. But the shrinking number of innovative young thinkers will, ironically, reduce the number of such valuable new ideas.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A shortfall in human innovation may also be less damaging if offset by new ideas conceived by artificial intelligence. There seems no doubt that machines will soon be working out how to make incremental improvements in existing processes—indeed, in some spheres, they already are. Whether machines will ever learn how to generate disruptive new ideas, however, remains a matter of debate.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Plasmon&#39;s film, about the last child in Italy, ends with a discussion of children as a symbol of hope.

In November he won re-election in Florida by a resplendent 19-point margin. In damning contrast, Mr Trump&#39;s attempts to play kingmaker in the midterm elections went disastrously wrong, with many of the candidates he endorsed losing races that the Republican Party had considered in the bag. Mr Trump appeared suitably deflated when he launched his presidential campaign on November 15th at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Back then some opinion polls put the two candidates neck-and-neck among primary voters. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZ8j_CZLFm8?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Six months later it is Mr DeSantis who has been stumbling. He has been criticised as an isolationist for dismissing the war in Ukraine as a mere “territorial dispute”, as an anti-corporatist for picking fights with Disney and as an extremist for signing a ban on abortion beyond six weeks of pregnancy. Mr Trump, meanwhile, has recovered his step, making a triumphant return to the campaign trail. He and his team have spent months pummelling Mr DeSantis. In retrospect, the governor&#39;s decision to wait until Florida&#39;s legislature had completed its annual session earlier this month before announcing his candidacy looks like a miscalculation, although the delay was in part to allow lawmakers to pass a bill permitting him to run for president without resigning as governor. During the long interlude he has endured a protracted beating on the airwaves without offering much defence. It is as if Brutus had overslept on the Ides of March, giving Julius Caesar a chance to put on his armour, but had tried to proceed with his hit job all the same. The plot to overthrow Mr Trump, which once seemed plausible, now looks forlorn.</p><h2> Lend me your cheers</h2><p class="article__body-text"> In 2016 Mr Trump ran as an insurgent. In 2020 he ran as the incumbent. For 2024, he is running as a hybrid of the two—insurrectionist and institutionalist all at once. It is proving to be a potent combination, which has helped to build a huge lead in the early polling. Among likely voters in the primary, Mr Trump retains the stature of a former president, but is also seen as the put-upon underdog, owing to his claims that the election of 2020 was stolen, his bans from social media and his <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/25/how-donald-trumps-trials-and-the-republican-primary-will-intersect" data-tegid="tc50p4ub3qvuq8tedqkquurcoq9ubbhu">many legal troubles</a> . Early stumbles, such as his lacklustre campaign launch and an embarrassing dinner with a white supremacist, have been righted by a new campaign operation that is more professional than the chaotic family affairs of Mr Trump&#39;s past runs. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> What is more, the Republican Party has been thoroughly Trumpified. This is especially true at the state level, where most of the rules for primaries are set. Unlike 2016, when the party establishment shunned Mr Trump, today he dominates the race for elite endorsements. Many big donors have defected to alternatives such as Mr DeSantis, but this is not as damaging as it sounds. Mr Trump will have no trouble raising money from his army of small-dollar donors and will again be able to portray himself as the authentic tribune of the people, assailed by the henchmen of the out-of-touch elite. Among the Republican base, he has universal name recognition and near-universal admiration.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This reverence for Mr Trump makes it difficult for his competitors to attack him. Most of them come not to bury Trumpism, but to praise it. But the resulting muddle blunts their appeal. Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, puts it this way, “Why would you go to see a Rolling Stones tribute band, when the Rolling Stones themselves are still on tour?”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Are the primaries over before they have begun? Some think so. “Hope is not a strategy,” says Rick Wilson, a former Republican operative who now runs the Lincoln Project, an anyone-but-Trump outfit. He thinks Mr Trump would have to be incapacitated to lose. “Donald Trump will start taking DeSantis&#39;s head off in debates and kicking it around like a soccer ball. And the Republican base voters want that show,” he says. Ask closeted anti-Trump Republicans around Washington how the primary will go, and many conjure scenes of brutality worthy of the Gallic wars.</p><p class="article__body-text"> More optimistic sorts, however, point out that there is still a long way to go, even if Mr Trump&#39;s chariot is building speed. “We&#39;re still months and months and months away from voting. National polls are pretty meaningless—they are going to mean something once voting has started,” says David Kochel, a Republican consultant based in Iowa (the first state to vote) who previously worked with Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush. Consultants for struggling campaigns swap Cinderella stories about late-breaking candidates who went from 2% in Iowa to 20% in the space of a month. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Early polls, it is true, do not predict the final results as well as later ones. But that does not mean they are useless. There is a correlation between early strength and the final results (see chart 1). At present, Mr Trump commands the support of almost 55% of primary voters according to a polling average constructed by FiveThirtyEight, a data-journalism outfit. That is more than 30 percentage points more than Mr DeSantis&#39;s average. In contested primaries over the past 40 years, six of the eight candidates who have polled above 30% this far ahead of the voting went on to capture their party&#39;s nomination. The two candidates who failed to capitalise on such big leads were Ted Kennedy, who ran against an incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, in 1980, and Hillary Clinton, who was eventually upstaged in 2008 by the charismatic Barack Obama. The Republican candidate who comes closest to both Carter-like incumbency and Obama-like magnetism this year is, of course, Mr Trump.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem is not simply one of a divided field. Although there are already six declared, halfway plausible candidates, with more to come in all likelihood, even a two-horse race would favour Mr Trump. Recent polling conducted for <i>The Economist</i> by YouGov finds that, in a head-to-head contest, Republican primary voters prefer Mr Trump to Mr DeSantis by 58% to 25%. And the former president&#39;s support is not at all reluctant or half-hearted. Fully 64% of Republicans want Mr Trump to run again, despite the many alternatives. Democrats, by contrast, are much less energised about Joe Biden, their presumptive nominee: only 53% of them want the president to run again.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In 2016 Mr Trump&#39;s opponents thought his outrageous statements and chaotic campaign would inevitably lead to political failure. That proved hopelessly Pollyannaish. Most now assume there is little that Mr Trump could say or do to alienate his base. But some opponents still hope that his campaign will implode because of the sort of messy infighting that characterised his entire time in the White House.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The hitch is that the chaos candidate is a bit more orderly this time. In 2016 Mr Trump&#39;s campaign attracted a fair number of charlatans. Current management is more stable. Susie Wiles, one of its leaders, ran Mr Trump&#39;s successful operation in Florida in both 2016 and 2020. She also headed Mr DeSantis&#39;s run for governor in 2018, when he was Mr Trump&#39;s protégé. There is little family involvement: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president&#39;s daughter and son-in-law, who served as senior advisers when he was in the White House, are not expected to play any part in the campaign. Mr Trump also has much more personal experience: this is his third run for president (fourth if you count his abortive campaign with the Reform Party in 2000). His Republican opponents are all running for the first time. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump&#39;s team is assiduous. “Shortly after I got elected, the next day or a couple of days later, I received a voicemail from President Trump congratulating me,” says Mike Brown, the chairman of the Republican Party in Kansas. The Trump campaign has been “exceptional” in communicating about the primary in the state, he says. The rules that will translate the results of individual state primaries and caucuses (in effect, decentralised party conferences) into votes for contenders for the nomination at the party&#39;s national convention are arcane and ever-changing. Unlike the Democratic primaries, in which a state&#39;s votes are typically split among the candidates in proportion to their share of the vote, many Republican primaries follow a winner-take-all system. That can turn a relatively narrow lead in terms of the share of the vote into a crushing dominion over delegates. While Mr Trump was president, he encouraged states to adopt such systems or other rules that help the front-runner. And the dates of the primaries keep moving even further forward, giving insurgent candidates ever less time to build momentum (see chart 2).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump&#39;s team has been seizing a march on its adversaries in other respects, too, diligently soliciting endorsements from senior figures in the party with calls and invitations to the imperial court at Mar-a-Lago. Such support was not forthcoming in 2016, but has been flooding in ahead of next year&#39;s contest. Mr Trump has already racked up the endorsements of 51 of the 222 Republicans in the House of Representatives and ten of the 49 Republican senators. His opponents have just seven representatives and two senators among them all. The Trump campaign takes particular pride in its success with Florida&#39;s delegation to Congress, who have largely spurned their state&#39;s governor. Eleven of Florida&#39;s 20 Republican representatives have endorsed Mr Trump, compared with just one for Mr DeSantis. Mr DeSantis and Mr Scott could not expect many endorsements before entering the race, of course, but they have a lot of catching up to do.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Operationally, at least, Mr DeSantis can certainly hope to catch up. He is a prodigious fundraiser, taking in an astounding $217m during his gubernatorial run in 2022, much of which went unspent. Because Mr DeSantis is the favourite among deep-pocketed donors (though his stances on abortion, Disney and Ukraine have irked some), he will rely heavily on an organisation called “Never Back Down”, a so-called super <small>PAC</small> that can take unlimited donations as long as it does not co-ordinate with the official campaign. A person familiar with Mr DeSantis&#39;s thinking says he could raise $250m between his official campaign and the super <small>PAC</small> . The mastermind of Never Back Down is Jeff Roe, the founder of a consultancy called Axiom Strategies, which worked on both the failed presidential campaign in 2016 of Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, and Glenn Youngkin&#39;s successful bid for governor in Virginia in 2021. Never Back Down is expected to carpet-bomb television with advertisements and also pay for the canvassers and organisers who must traipse around early-voting states for months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The official campaign will be run by members of Mr DeSantis&#39;s inner circle in Florida. The likely campaign manager, Generra Peck, headed his most recent campaign for governor. His polling guru will probably be another homegrown talent, Ryan Tyson. Mr DeSantis is the favourite to win the arms race for donations. He will have plenty of campaign veterans who know how to spend his takings.</p></div><h2> I came, I saw, I squandered</h2><p class="article__body-text"> If cash were all it took to become president, America would be midway through the first term of Michael Bloomberg, a tycoon and former mayor of New York who lavished $1.1bn on a failed campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Persuading Republican voters to defect from Mr Trump, as Mr DeSantis must now do, is a difficult task. Many obvious avenues of attack, the ones that might appeal to swing voters in a general election, are non-starters in the primary. Mr Trump&#39;s encouragement of the mob that stormed Congress on January 6th 2021 hardly imperils his standing in the party, most of which believes that the election of 2020 was stolen. Nor can his opponents make hay from the inquiries, investigations and lawsuits that have dogged the president since he left office, from the <small>FBI</small> ’s search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago to his recent indictment by Manhattan&#39;s district attorney for fraudulent book-keeping. These indignities, far from diminishing Mr Trump in Republicans&#39; eyes, have turned him into a martyr. Even political rivals like Mr DeSantis have felt obliged to come to his defence. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Florida Governor Ron DeSantis listensduring a press conference to sign several bills related to public education and teacher pay, in Miami, Tuesday, May 9, 2023.

The old neoconservative and business-friendly order has been swept away. The other candidates&#39; failure to present a “value proposition”, says Mr Miller of the Trump campaign, “will impede their ability to build coalitions and actually go and challenge the president…Saying that you&#39;re Trump without the drama, which is kind of where it seems Ron DeSantis is going—that just doesn&#39;t work.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Presidential primaries are often popularity contests more than they are policy debates—and this one will be little different. All the candidates agree that Mr Biden is intentionally wrecking the country, that wokeness has run amok and that the southern border must be sealed. There are only modest signs of disagreement. Mr Trump is attacking Mr DeSantis from the left on fiscal matters, arguing that he will endanger Social Security (the state pension) and Medicare (free health care for the elderly), two sacrosanct programmes among older voters. Mr Scott is calling for less confrontational politics. More internationalist candidates such as Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, argue that continuing to back Ukraine is vital for America&#39;s national security. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Others are more isolationist than Mr Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy Indian-American entrepreneur from Ohio, says, “We&#39;ve got to be willing to ban most <small>US</small> businesses from doing business in China until the <small>CCP</small> [Chinese Communist Party] falls or until the <small>CCP</small> radically reforms itself.” That is a harder decoupling than the other candidates have proposed. He also wants to ban affirmative action, shut down the <small>FBI</small> and use the army to dismantle Mexican cartels that ship fentanyl across the border. Early polls show some success in peeling off Trump voters, but it is a delicate operation. “We rally behind America first for a reason. It&#39;s not Trump first,” says Mr Ramaswamy. “I&#39;m running against him, but to be clear, I still recoil at the idea that the nominee should somehow be the product of some plot of Republican donors.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the conspirators must at some point coalesce if they are to be rid of Caesar. In 2016 the fractured field, combined with winner-take-all primary rules, helped Mr Trump triumph. Whereas Democrats united behind Mr Biden in 2020 when it became apparent that Bernie Sanders, a left-wing ideologue, might secure the nomination, Republicans may be hard to corral. At the moment, Mr DeSantis certainly looks like the strongest rival to Mr Trump. But the other candidates seem much keener to attack him than the former president, for fear of alienating the base. Ms Haley has taken to denouncing Mr DeSantis for feuding with Disney, for instance. Other prominent Republicans, such as Kari Lake, a failed candidate for governor of Arizona last year, and Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, have taken to swiping at Mr DeSantis as well. They may be auditioning for the job of vice-president to Mr Trump, and see such attacks as a quick way into his good graces.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Despite his stumbles in recent months, Mr DeSantis is a clever and driven man. He may regain his lean and hungry look and let slip the dogs of war. Many voters will pay close attention to the televised debates, the first of which will be held in August in Wisconsin (although the former president may not participate). Mr DeSantis could point out that the national debt soared by $8trn during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency; that crime and illegal immigration both increased despite all the former president&#39;s big talk on both scores; that covid-19 was poorly contained and that another epidemic, of wokeness, became more rather than less contagious during his presidency. It might help to point out that Mr Trump, a man famous for peremptory sackings, failed to dismiss Anthony Fauci, the public face of efforts to repress covid, who is about as popular in conservative circles as gun seizures and sharia law.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such barbs could draw some blood. If wielded with enough force and frequency, they might even fell a man as mighty as Caesar. Luckily for Mr Trump, he is facing a fractious, squabbling and timid bunch. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Editor&#39;s note (May 25th 2023):</b> This article was updated after Ron DeSantis&#39;s announcement.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 24 May 2023 18:57:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rl58dgle0sccdmq1um7jogm86d0fcdjt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/24/ron-desantis-has-little-chance-of-beating-donald-trump </item><item><title><![CDATA[Henry Kissinger explains how to avoid world war three]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="亨利·基森格 (Henry Kissenger) 为《经济学人》拍摄，2023 年纽约。图片来源：《经济学人》/Vincent Tullo" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>N BEIJING THEY</small> have concluded that America will do anything to keep China down.

Nobody alive has more experience of international affairs, first as a scholar of 19th-century diplomacy, later as America&#39;s national security adviser and secretary of state, and for the past 46 years as a consultant and emissary to monarchs, presidents and prime ministers. Mr Kissinger is worried. “Both sides have convinced themselves that the other represents a strategic danger,” he says. “We are on the path to great-power confrontation.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the end of April <i>The Economist</i> spoke to Mr Kissinger for over eight hours about how to prevent the contest between China and America from descending into war. These days he is stooped and walks with difficulty, but his mind is needle-sharp. As he contemplates his next two books, on artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> ) and the nature of alliances, he remains more interested in looking forward than raking over the past. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger is alarmed by China&#39;s and America&#39;s intensifying competition for technological and economic pre-eminence. Even as Russia tumbles into China&#39;s orbit and war overshadows Europe&#39;s eastern flank, he fears that <small>AI</small> is about to supercharge the Sino-American rivalry. Around the world, the balance of power and the technological basis of warfare are shifting so fast and in so many ways that countries lack any settled principle on which they can establish order. If they cannot find one, they may resort to force. “We&#39;re in the classic pre-world war one situation,” he says, “where neither side has much margin of political concession and in which any disturbance of the equilibrium can lead to catastrophic consequences.”</p><h2> Study war some more</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger is reviled by many as a warmonger for his part in the Vietnam war, but he considers the avoidance of conflict between great powers as the focus of his life&#39;s work. After witnessing the carnage caused by Nazi Germany and suffering the murder of 13 close relatives in the Holocaust, he became convinced that the only way to prevent ruinous conflict is hard-headed diplomacy, ideally fortified by shared values. “This is the problem that has to be solved,” he says. “And I believe I&#39;ve spent my life trying to deal with it.” In his view, the fate of humanity depends on whether America and China can get along. He believes the rapid progress of <small>AI</small> , in particular, leaves them only five-to-ten years to find a way.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>More on this:</b></p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/kissinger-highlights">Eight highlights of the conversation</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/kissinger-transcript">A full transcript</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/05/20/henry-kissinger-on-averting-world-war" data-tegid="d627nbqe60ospoqtvd42npr5unob63al">Our daily podcast on the interview</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger has some opening advice to aspiring leaders: “Identify where you are. Pitilessly.” In that spirit, the starting-point for avoiding war is to analyse China&#39;s growing restlessness. Despite a reputation for being conciliatory towards the government in Beijing, he acknowledges that many Chinese thinkers believe America is on a downward slope and that, “therefore, as a result of an historic evolution, they will eventually supplant us.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> He believes that China&#39;s leadership resents Western policymakers&#39; talk of a global rules-based order, when what they really mean is America&#39;s rules and America&#39;s order. China&#39;s rulers are insulted by what they see as the condescending bargain offered by the West, of granting China privileges if it behaves (they surely think the privileges should be theirs by right, as a rising power). Indeed, some in China suspect that America will never treat it as an equal and that it&#39;s foolish to imagine it might.</p><p class="article__body-text"> However, Mr Kissinger also warns against misinterpreting China&#39;s ambitions. In Washington, “They say China wants world domination…The answer is that they [in China] want to be powerful,” he says. “They&#39;re not heading for world domination in a Hitlerian sense,” he says. “That is not how they think or have ever thought of world order.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> In Nazi Germany war was inevitable because Adolf Hitler needed it, Mr Kissinger says, but China is different. He has met many Chinese leaders, starting with Mao Zedong. He did not doubt their ideological commitment, but this has always been welded onto a keen sense of their country&#39;s interests and capabilities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger sees the Chinese system as more Confucian than Marxist. That teaches Chinese leaders to attain the maximum strength of which their country is capable and to seek to be respected for their accomplishments. Chinese leaders want to be recognised as the international system&#39;s final judges of their own interests. “If they achieved superiority that can genuinely be used, would they drive it to the point of imposing Chinese culture?” he asks. “I don&#39;t know. My instinct is No…[But] I believe it is in our capacity to prevent that situation from arising by a combination of diplomacy and force.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> One natural American response to the challenge of China&#39;s ambition is to probe it, as a way to identify how to sustain the equilibrium between the two powers. Another is to establish a permanent dialogue between China and America. China “is trying to play a global role. We have to assess at each point if the conceptions of a strategic role are compatible.” If they are not, then the question of force will arise. “Is it possible for China and the United States to coexist without the threat of all-out war with each other? I thought and still think that it [is].” But he acknowledges success is not guaranteed. “It may fail,” he says. “And therefore, we have to be militarily strong enough to sustain the failure.” </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/513/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/769/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/820/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1025/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1281/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1640/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The urgent test is how China and America behave over Taiwan. Mr Kissinger recalls how, on Richard Nixon&#39;s first visit to China in 1972, only Mao had the authority to negotiate over the island. “Whenever Nixon raised a concrete subject, Mao said, &#39;I&#39;m a philosopher. I don&#39;t deal with these subjects. Let Zhou [Enlai] and Kissinger discuss this.&#39;…But when it came to Taiwan, he was very explicit. He said, &#39;They are a bunch of counter-revolutionaries. We don&#39;t need them now. We can wait 100 years. Someday we will ask for them. But it&#39;s a long distance away.&#39;” </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/01-china.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger believes that the understanding forged between Nixon and Mao was overturned after only 50 of those 100 years by Donald Trump. He wanted to inflate his tough image by wringing concessions out of China over trade. In policy the Biden administration has followed Mr Trump&#39;s lead, but with liberal rhetoric.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger would not have chosen this path with respect to Taiwan, because a Ukrainian-style war there would destroy the island and devastate the world economy. War could also set back China domestically, and its leaders&#39; greatest fear remains upheaval at home.</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite><i>“</i> It is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text"> The fear of war creates grounds for hope. The trouble is that neither side has much room to make concessions. Every Chinese leader has asserted his country&#39;s connection to Taiwan. At the same time, however, “the way things have evolved now, it is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s way out of this impasse draws on his experience in office. He would start by lowering the temperature, and then gradually build confidence and a working relationship. Rather than listing all their grievances, the American president would say to his Chinese counterpart, “Mr President, the two greatest dangers to peace right now are us two. In the sense that we have the capacity to destroy humanity.” China and America, without formally announcing anything, would aim to practise restraint. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Never a fan of policymaking bureaucracies, Mr Kissinger would like to see a small group of advisers, with easy access to each other, working together tacitly. Neither side would fundamentally change its position on Taiwan, but America would take care over how it deploys its forces and try not to feed the suspicion that it supports the island&#39;s independence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s second piece of advice to aspiring leaders is: “Define objectives that can enlist people. Find means, describable means, of achieving these objectives.” Taiwan would be just the first of several areas where the superpowers could find common ground and so foster global stability.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In a recent speech Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, suggested that these should include climate change and the economy. Mr Kissinger is sceptical about both. Although he is “all for” action on the climate, he doubts it can do much to create confidence or help establish a balance between the two superpowers. On the economy, the danger is that the trade agenda is hijacked by hawks who are unwilling to give China any room to develop at all.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That all-or-nothing attitude is a threat to the broader search for detente. If America wants to find a way to live with China, it should not be aiming for regime change. Mr Kissinger draws on a theme present in his thought from the very beginning. “In any diplomacy of stability, there has to be some element of the 19th-century world,” he says. “And the 19th-century world was based on the proposition that the existence of the states contesting it was not at issue.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some Americans believe that a defeated China would become democratic and peaceful. Yet, however much Mr Kissinger would prefer China to be a democracy, he sees no precedent for that outcome. More likely, a collapse of the communist regime would lead to a civil war that hardened into ideological conflict and only added to global instability. “It&#39;s not in our interest to drive China to dissolution,” he says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Rather than digging in, America will have to acknowledge China has interests. A good example is Ukraine.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s president, Xi Jinping, only recently contacted Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Many observers have dismissed Mr Xi&#39;s call as an empty gesture designed to placate Europeans, who complain that China is too close to Russia. By contrast, Mr Kissinger sees it as a declaration of serious intent that will complicate the diplomacy surrounding the war, but which may also create precisely the sort of opportunity to build the superpowers&#39; mutual trust. </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/02-inevitable.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger begins his analysis by condemning Russia&#39;s president, Vladimir Putin. “It was certainly a catastrophic mistake of judgment by Putin at the end,” he says. But the West is not without blame. “I thought that the decision to…leave open the membership of Ukraine in <small>NATO</small> was very wrong.” That was destabilising, because dangling the promise of <small>NATO</small> protection without a plan to bring it about left Ukraine poorly defended even as it was guaranteed to enrage not only Mr Putin, but also many of his compatriots.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The task now is to bring the war to an end, without setting the stage for the next round of conflict. Mr Kissinger says that he wants Russia to give up as much as possible of the territory that it conquered in 2014, but the reality is that in any ceasefire Russia is likely to keep Sevastopol (the biggest city in Crimea and Russia&#39;s main naval base on the Black Sea), at the very least. Such a settlement, in which Russia loses some gains but retains others, could leave both a dissatisfied Russia and a dissatisfied Ukraine. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/513/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/769/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/820/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1025/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1281/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1640/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In his view, that is a recipe for future confrontation. “What the Europeans are now saying is, in my view, madly dangerous,” he says. “Because the Europeans are saying: &#39;We don&#39;t want them in <small>NATO</small> , because they&#39;re too risky. And therefore, we&#39;ll arm the hell out of them and give them the most advanced weapons.&#39;” His conclusion is stark: “We have now armed Ukraine to a point where it will be the best-armed country and with the least strategically experienced leadership in Europe.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> To establish a lasting peace in Europe requires the West to take two leaps of imagination. The first is for Ukraine to join <small>NATO</small> , as a means of restraining it, as well as protecting it. The second is for Europe to engineer a rapprochement with Russia, as a way to create a stable eastern border. </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/03-weird-position.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Plenty of Western countries would understandably balk at one or other of those aims. With China involved, as an ally of Russia&#39;s and an opponent of <small>NATO</small> , the task will become even harder. China has an overriding interest to see Russia emerge intact from the war in Ukraine. Not only does Mr Xi have a “no-limits” partnership with Mr Putin to honour, but a collapse in Moscow would trouble China by creating a power vacuum in Central Asia that risks being filled by a “Syrian-type civil war”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Following Mr Xi&#39;s call to Mr Zelensky, Mr Kissinger believes that China may be positioning itself to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. As one of the architects of the policy that pitted America and China against the Soviet Union, he doubts that China and Russia can work together well. True, they share a suspicion of the United States, but he also believes that they have an instinctive distrust of one another. “I have never met a Russian leader who said anything good about China,” he says. “And I&#39;ve never met a Chinese leader who said anything good about Russia.” They are not natural allies. </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/04-russia.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The Chinese have entered diplomacy over Ukraine as an expression of their national interest, Mr Kissinger says. Although they refuse to countenance the destruction of Russia, they do recognise that Ukraine should remain an independent country and they have cautioned against the use of nuclear weapons. They may even accept Ukraine&#39;s desire to join <small>NATO</small> . “China does this, in part, because they do not want to clash with the United States,” he says. “They are creating their own world order, in so far as they can.” </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pz8qsDw5DX4?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> The second area where China and America need to talk is <small>AI</small> . “We are at the very beginning of a capability where machines could impose global pestilence or other pandemics,” he says, “not just nuclear but any field of human destruction.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He acknowledges that even experts in <small>AI</small> do not know what its powers will be (going by the evidence of our discussions, transcribing a thick, gravelly German accent is still beyond its capabilities). But Mr Kissinger believes that <small>AI</small> will become a key factor in security within five years. He compares its disruptive potential to the invention of printing, which spread ideas that played a part in causing the devastating wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite>“There are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable…[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text"> “[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness,” Mr Kissinger warns. Despite the doctrine that a human should be in the loop, automatic and unstoppable weapons may be created. “If you look at military history, you can say, it has never been possible to destroy all your opponents, because of limitations of geography and of accuracy. [Now] there are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AI</small> cannot be abolished. China and America will therefore need to harness its power militarily to a degree, as a deterrent. But they can also limit the threat it poses, in the way that arms-control talks limited the threat of nuclear weapons. “I think we have to begin exchanges on the impact of technology on each other,” he says. “We have to take baby steps towards arms control, in which each side presents the other with controllable material about capabilities.” Indeed, he believes that the negotiations themselves could help build mutual trust and the confidence that enables the superpowers to practise restraint. The secret is leaders strong and wise enough to understand that <small>AI</small> must not be pushed to its limits. “And if you then rely entirely on what you can achieve through power, you&#39;re likely to destroy the world.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s third piece of advice for aspiring leaders is to “link all of these to your domestic objectives, whatever they are.” For America, that involves learning how to be more pragmatic, focusing on the qualities of leadership and, most of all, renewing the country&#39;s political culture.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s model for pragmatic thinking is India. He recalls a function at which a former senior Indian administrator explained that foreign policy should be based on non-permanent alliances geared to the issues, rather than tying up a country in big multilateral structures.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such a transactional approach will not come naturally to America. The theme running through Mr Kissinger&#39;s epic history of international relations, “Diplomacy”, is that the United States insists on depicting all its main foreign interventions as expressions of its manifest destiny to remake the world in its own image as a free, democratic, capitalist society.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem for Mr Kissinger is the corollary, which is that moral principles too often override interests—even when they will not produce desirable change. He acknowledges that human rights matter, but disagrees with putting them at the heart of your policy. The difference is between imposing them, or saying that it will affect relations, but the decision is theirs. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="2300" height="1536" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/134/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/401/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/534/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/668/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/855/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> “We tried [imposing them] in Sudan,” he notes. “Look at Sudan now.” Indeed, the knee-jerk insistence on doing the right thing can become an excuse for failing to think through the consequences of policy, he says. The people who want to use power to change the world, Mr Kissinger argues, are often idealists, even though realists are more typically seen as willing to use force.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is an essential counterweight to China&#39;s growing power. Yet it also has a worsening record of religious intolerance, judicial bias and a muzzled press. One implication—though Mr Kissinger did not directly comment—is that India will therefore be a test of whether America can be pragmatic. Japan will be another. Relations will be fraught if, as Mr Kissinger predicts, Japan takes moves to secure nuclear weapons within five years. With one eye on the diplomatic manoeuvres that more or less kept the peace in the 19th century, he looks to Britain and France to help the United States think strategically about the balance of power in Asia.</p><h2> Big-shoe-fillers wanted</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership will matter, too. Mr Kissinger has long been a believer in the power of individuals. Franklin D. Roosevelt was far-sighted enough to prepare an isolationist America for what he saw as an inevitable war against the Axis powers. Charles de Gaulle gave France a belief in the future. John F. Kennedy inspired a generation. Otto von Bismarck engineered German unification, and governed with dexterity and restraint—only for his country to succumb to war-fever after he was ousted.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger acknowledges that 24-hour news and social media make his style of diplomacy harder. “I don&#39;t think a president today could send an envoy with the powers that I had,” he says. But he argues that to agonise about whether a way ahead is even possible would be a mistake. “If you look at the leaders whom I&#39;ve respected, they didn&#39;t ask that question. They asked, &#39;Is it necessary?&#39;”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He recalls the example of Winston Lord, a member of his staff in the Nixon administration. “When we intervened in Cambodia, he wanted to quit. And I told him, &#39;You can quit and march around this place carrying a placard. Or you can help us solve the Vietnam war.&#39; And he decided to stay… What we need [is] people who make that decision—that they&#39;re living in this time, and they want to do something about it, other than feel sorry for themselves.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership reflects a country&#39;s political culture. Mr Kissinger, like many Republicans, worries that American education dwells on America&#39;s darkest moments. “In order to get a strategic view you need faith in your country,” he says. The shared perception of America&#39;s worth has been lost.</p><p class="article__body-text"> He also complains that the media lack a sense of proportion and judgment. When he was in office the press were hostile, but he still had a dialogue with them. “They drove me nuts,” he says. “But that was part of the game…they weren&#39;t unfair.” Today, in contrast, he says that the media have no incentive to be reflective. “My theme is the need for balance and moderation. Institutionalise that. That&#39;s the aim.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Worst of all, though, is politics itself. When Mr Kissinger came to Washington, politicians from the two parties would routinely dine together. He was on friendly terms with George McGovern, a Democratic presidential candidate. For a national security adviser from the other side that would be unlikely today, he believes. Gerald Ford, who took over after Nixon resigned, was the sort of person whose opponents could rely on him to act decently. Today, any means are considered acceptable.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think Trump and now Biden have driven [animosity] over the top,” Mr Kissinger says. He fears that a situation like Watergate could lead to violence and that America lacks leadership. “I don&#39;t think Biden can supply the inspiration and…I&#39;m hoping that Republicans can come up with somebody better,” he says. “It&#39;s not a great moment in history,” he laments, “but the alternative is total abdication.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> America desperately needs long-term strategic thinking, he believes. “That&#39;s our big challenge which we must solve. If we don&#39;t, the predictions of failure will be proved true.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> If time is short and leadership lacking, where does that leave the prospects for China and the United States finding a way to live together in peace?</p><p class="article__body-text"> “We all have to admit we&#39;re in a new world,” Mr Kissinger says, “for whatever we do can go wrong. And there is no guaranteed course.” Even so he professes to feel hope. “Look, my life has been difficult, but it gives ground for optimism. And difficulty—it&#39;s also a challenge. It shouldn&#39;t always be an obstacle.” </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/05-kant.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> He stresses that humanity has taken enormous strides. True, that progress has often occurred in the aftermath of terrible conflict—after the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic wars and the second world war, for example, but the rivalry between China and America could be different. History suggests that, when two powers of this type encounter each other, the normal outcome is military conflict. “But this is not a normal circumstance,” Mr Kissinger argues, “because of mutually assured destruction and artificial intelligence.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think it&#39;s possible that you can create a world order on the basis of rules that Europe, China and India could join, and that&#39;s already a good slice of humanity. So if you look at the practicality of it, it can end well—or at least it can end without catastrophe and we can make progress.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is the task for the leaders of today&#39;s superpowers. “Immanuel Kant said peace would either occur through human understanding or some disaster,” Mr Kissinger explains. “He thought that it would occur through reason, but he could not guarantee it. That is more or less what I think.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> World leaders therefore bear a heavy responsibility. They require the realism to face up to the dangers ahead, the vision to see that a solution lies in achieving a balance between their countries&#39; forces, and the restraint to refrain from using their offensive powers to the maximum. “It is an unprecedented challenge and great opportunity,” Mr Kissinger says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The future of humanity depends on getting it right. Well into the fourth hour of the day&#39;s conversation, and just weeks before his birthday celebrations, Mr Kissinger adds with a characteristic twinkle, “I won&#39;t be around to see it either way.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 17 May 2023 14:41:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ljr6qha8c5njtiqbn0u45vjmrjjcduc6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/17/henry-kissinger-explains-how-to-avoid-world-war-three </item><item><title><![CDATA[China learns to manage decline]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">T</span> <small>HE DEMOGRAPHIC</small> milestones come thick and fast in “My Home in the Forest”, the official tourism anthem of Yichun, a sprawling city in China&#39;s far north-east.

Its focus on ecotourism reflects hopes and fears that are specific to Yichun, a city trying to reinvent itself after its vast state-owned timber mills closed about a decade ago. Its boosterism shows off the entrepreneurial side of Chinese bureaucrats, who for several decades now have earned bonuses and promotions by presiding over local economic growth. When Chaguan visited recently, city officials tirelessly showed off Yichun&#39;s attractions, from tasty blueberries to its dinosaur museum. By way of emphasis, officials unexpectedly interrupted an interview to break into “My Home in the Forest”, clapping and swaying as they sang. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Still, the ballad&#39;s wistful evocation of family life should haunt Communist Party bosses all across China. Chaguan was not in Yichun to talk about berries, but because the city is at the leading edge of a demographic crisis that will soon hit the whole country. Birth rates are falling in China. The most recent national census, in 2020, revealed a total fertility rate (births per woman) of 1.3. The <small>UN</small> put the number at 1.2 last year. That is among the world&#39;s lowest and far below that needed to maintain a stable population, namely, just over two children per woman.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/is-chinese-power-about-to-peak">Is Chinese power about to peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak">At what height will China&#39;s economy peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap">How Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power">How China measures national power</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/the-fall-of-empires-preys-on-xi-jinpings-mind">The fall of empires preys on Xi Jinping&#39;s mind</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> The census found an extreme situation in Yichun. No Chinese city has as few children, as a share of its population. Just 7.4% of its 879,000 residents are under 14. For comparison, children in the same age range account for almost 18% of the Chinese population as a whole. Even in some of the greyest cities in Japan or South Korea, children are more common than in Yichun. The latest numbers are grim. In 2021 just 2,321 babies were born there, against 8,817 deaths. A generation earlier, in 2000, the city&#39;s overall population was about a third larger than today. Yichun saw over 17,000 births that year, or eight times as many babies as now.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Though exceptionally bad, Yichun&#39;s baby bust reflects demographic woes across China&#39;s north-east rustbelt. The total fertility rate in the province of Heilongjiang, of which Yichun is part, is just 0.76 babies per woman of child-bearing age. One cause is working adults heading south. Marriage rates are also falling among those who stay.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A shrinking population will test China&#39;s growth-orientated political system. On May 5th President Xi Jinping signalled new realism about this challenge at a meeting of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs, a powerful body that he chairs. The commission heard that lower birth rates, an ageing population and demographic disparities between regions are a “new normal” to which policymakers must adapt. Officials were told to focus on education, on building a “childbirth-friendly society” and on helping the old to lead active lives. Rather than growth, the talk is of “high-quality population development”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Few cities like to admit to shrinking. That is in part because officials are rewarded for <small>GDP</small> growth, and in part because land sales are a big source of local-government revenue. As long as cities kept expanding, officials could easily justify auctioning new plots to developers. But the latest census leaves less room for denial.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yichun is a good place to see these trends. In 2001 the city published a plan predicting that the population would grow to 1.4m by 2020: a spectacular overestimate. In person, officials still dodge questions about birth statistics, preferring to offer anecdotes about friends having babies. Wang Hao, head of the city&#39;s Communist Youth League branch, enthuses about Yichun supporting new jobs that appeal to the young, such as tagging traffic lights on maps and street-view images for makers of autonomous cars. Tellingly, though, Mr Wang admits that he has only one child, murmuring that he and his wife are too busy for more.</p><h2> The politics of contraction</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, Yichun has quietly merged some urban districts and combined some schools. In January it shed a series of outlying subdistricts, turning them into rural townships: a rare example of de-urbanisation. Dusty, apparently deserted housing estates are not hard to spot on the edge of town. Long Ying, an urban planner at Tsinghua University, co-wrote a recent study that used satellite images of night-time lighting to identify over 750 cities in China that shrank between 2013 and 2018. He describes different causes. Some cities lose people because natural resources run out. Others shed working-age adults to nearby big cities. Remote border towns are a third category. Not all are economic laggards. Professor Long wonders if China will see a fourth category in the near-future: coastal cities that lose workers to robots while still booming. Managing decline is very new for Chinese officials, he says. But he sees examples of pragmatism, pointing to north-eastern cities that turned derelict neighbourhoods into large parks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s one-child policy limited births from 1980 to 2016. It left a heavy mark on cities like Yichun, with large state employers that enforced family-planning rules strictly. Now Heilongjiang offers subsidies to promote second and even third births. The money offered does not offset the economic pain of losing Yichun&#39;s timber industry, says a man collecting his only grandchild from primary school. Before, he scoffs, “people wanted to have children but weren&#39;t allowed. Now they allow it but people can&#39;t afford children”. Politically, expansion is an easier sell than squeezing more from less. Party bosses are becoming more open about the task ahead. Do not expect them to sing about it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more from Chaguan, our columnist on China:</b><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/04/chinas-new-top-gun-normalises-war-with-america">China&#39;s new “Top Gun” normalises war with America</a> (May 4th)</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/27/chinas-rulers-play-the-law-and-order-card-and-lose" data-tegid="fk0q22c84m8jn5hrgkbgvn9h3n1i8t1i">China&#39;s rulers play the law-and-order card, and lose</a> (Apr 27th)</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/20/why-china-wants-to-be-a-risk" data-tegid="mtt5pupasojrfrq4d50i3pl59krm8789">Why China wants to be a risk</a> (Apr 20th)</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Also: How the Chaguan column <a href="https://www.economist.com/column-names">got its name</a></i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 11:16:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ps7r7oq04g1i13qdbn5pbii8unp5iut4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/china-learns-to-manage-decline</item></channel></rss>
