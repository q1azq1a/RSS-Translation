“女性对事业和家庭生活的渴望在全球范围内趋于一致，”多普克先生说。受正规教育年限较少的女性的生育率已下降到受教育程度较高的同龄人的水平。事实上，在美国，受过 16 年教育的女性，通常是那些拥有本科学位的女性，平均生育的孩子比受过 16 年以上教育的女性要少。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">同样的道理，低出生率已经从意大利和日本等富裕国家蔓延到泰国和巴西等中等收入国家。他们的生育率分别为 1.3 和 1.6。更引人注目的是，印度的生育率已降至2.1以下，并有望继续下降。这将产生全球影响，因为仅印度就占世界人口的五分之一。世界上所有 15 个最大的经济体，包括巴西、中国、印度和墨西哥，生育率都低于 2.1。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 2021 年，生育率低于替代率的国家有 7.82 亿人年龄在 21 岁至 30 岁之间。到 2050 年，这一群体，实际上是本土进入劳动力市场的潜在人数，预计将减少五分之一，至 6.19 亿。今年秋天并不是什么主观和有问题的预测：那一代人中的大多数人已经出生，生育率不会迅速变化。在生育率低于 1.5 的国家（几乎包括整个东亚和欧洲大部分地区），降幅将更为极端，同一群体将收缩 37%。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些国家将不再是金字塔形的人口结构，每一代都比之前的一代更大，甚至成为支柱，所有世代的规模都差不多，这些国家将变成倒金字塔，老一代被越来越小的群体所取代.在世界部分地区，这种情况已经发生：中国 21 岁至 30 岁的人口数量已经从 2012 年高峰期的 2.32 亿下降到 2021 年的 1.81 亿。到 2040 年代，下降速度将迅速加快，使中国人口不足 1 亿在 2050 年代中期的同一个游泳池中。同期，欧洲同一年龄段的人口将从 8500 万左右下降到 6000 万以下。</p><p class="article__body-text">补偿不断下降的出生率的明显方法是<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/28/a-new-wave-of-mass-migration-has-begun">移民</a>，尽管近年来它造成了政治紧张局势，但在大部分富裕国家，移民人数都在增加。但随着人口下降开始影响越来越多的国家，受过教育的移民将变得更难找到，即使许多富裕国家的本土出生人口正在加速萎缩。对于拥有约 14 亿人口的中国来说，可以找到足够多的移民来扭转出生率下降的影响的想法纯属天方夜谭，即使可以说服当局相信这是个好主意。尽管印度的人口仍在增长，但它将在 2060 年代达到顶峰，甚至更早。撒哈拉以南非洲地区是世界上唯一一个在未来许多年内可能成为潜在移民重要来源的地区。但即使在那里，出生率的下降速度也比过去预测的要快。尽管移民将在未来几十年继续缓解许多国家的人口下降，但从长远来看，它无法完全弥补大经济体的婴儿潮。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些剧烈的人口变化的一些后果是众所周知的。日益老龄化的人口将意味着更高的公共养老金和医疗保健支出。更重要的是，将有更少的工作年龄的人纳税来支付这些费用。富裕国家目前大约有 3 个 20 至 64 岁的人与 1 个 65 岁以上的人相对应。到 2050 年，这一比例将缩小到不到 2 比 1。这将需要推迟退休年龄、提高税收或两者兼而有之。

class="article__body-text">但人口下降的经济后果不仅仅是财政方面的。劳动力是增长的三个主要决定因素之一，另外两个是资本和两者的使用效率（生产率）。在其他条件相同的情况下，劳动力缩减会自动导致经济增长放缓。但人口下降也会对资本和生产力产生连锁反应，而这种影响却鲜为人知。</p><p class="article__body-text">许多经济学家认为，工作人口减少将压低实际利率（即在考虑通货膨胀后），因为投资机会将减少，而那些已退休或即将退休的人将积累大量储蓄。但其他人，例如英格兰银行前官员查尔斯·古德哈特 (Charles Goodhart)，认为效果会适得其反。随着越来越多的人退休并停止储蓄但继续消费，投资资金将会减少，从而推高实际利率。</p><p class="article__body-text">双方都同意人口老龄化会同时减少储蓄和投资，但对于哪一个下降得更快，双方意见不一。但证据的平衡表明实际利率较低：许多发展中经济体仍需积累数十年的储蓄，退休人员往往会紧握储蓄而不是耗尽储蓄。无论哪种方式，人口变化都将对市场产生巨大影响：从广义上讲，低实际利率对那些已经积累了资产的人有利，但对那些仍在努力储蓄的人不利，包括越来越多的退休人员储备金不足。</p><p class="article__body-text">但人口下降可能对生产力产生最令人不安的影响。年轻人拥有更多心理学家所说的“流体智力”，即解决新问题和接受新想法的能力。老年人拥有更多的“结晶智力”，这是基于随着时间的推移积累的关于事物如何运作的知识储备。没有精确的界限，但大多数研究表明，流体智力往往在成年初期达到顶峰，并在 30 多岁时开始下降。两种类型的情报对公司、行业和整个经济体都有用。他们也广泛互补：大多数公司既需要能够应对新挑战的年轻人，也需要对他们的行业有详细了解的经验丰富的老手。但在创新方面，它们的价值并不相同。</p><p class="article__body-text">在 2021 年发表的研究中，经济学家 Mary Kaltenberg 和 Adam Jaffe 以及心理学家 Margie Lachman 使用一个包含 40 多年来提交的 300 万项专利的数据库来探索创新与年龄之间的关系。根据科学学科的不同，作者指出，专利申请率在研究人员 30 多岁和 40 多岁时达到顶峰。然后专利申请率只会在他们 40 多岁和 50 多岁时逐渐下降。</p><p class="article__body-text">但对于从根本上改变科学领域的颠覆性创新，情况就大不相同了。研究人员使用<!-- -->一种基于特定发明在未来专利中被引用次数的颠覆性衡量标准。如果一项特定专利被后续发明人引用，但该专利的技术前辈没有引用，则该专利被归类为破坏性创新，而不是渐进式创新。例如，获得诺贝尔奖的生物化学家 Kary Mullis 在聚合酶链反应方面的工作构成了许多现代基因和医学测试的基础。在 Mullis 发表他的作品后，同一领域中对现有技术的引用急剧下降。 Jaffe 先生、Kaltenberg 女士和 Lachman 女士发现，最年轻的发明家申请的专利更有可能是全新的、颠覆性的创新形式，而且随着发明家年龄的增长，他们申请的专利也越来越多。</p><p class="article__body-text">这很重要，因为创新可以提高生产力。改进现有流程并发明全新的做事方式，可以用相同数量的劳动力和资本生产更多产品。从长远来看，只有提高生产力才能提高生活水平。随着时间的推移，人口下降将削弱这种贡献，因为年轻工人灵活的头脑所产生的新颖想法的数量会减少。</p><p class="article__body-text">即使生产率增长率稍微低一点，多年来也会复合，从而使经济规模显着缩小。 1947 年至 1973 年间，在富裕国家战后经济增长特别迅速的繁荣时期，美国、英国、法国、意大利、日本和西德的生产率增长约占人均产出增长的 60%。自 2007-09 年全球金融危机以来，美国的增长速度远远快于其他发达国家，这在很大程度上要归功于其生产力的更大提高。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果生育率的下降仅限于少数国家或特定地区，那么对创新的影响可能不会那么严重。一个国家发明的技术最终会传播到其他国家。纺纱珍妮和计算机芯片不必在世界每个角落都重新发明来提高全球生产力。但事实上，大部分国家的生育率同时下降，这意味着全球都会感受到创新减少的后果。</p><p class="article__body-text">一些研究人员认为，这种由人口驱动的创新减少现象已经在世界部分地区发生。中国经济学家和人口学家梁建章指出，老龄国家的创业精神明显较低：一个国家的中位年龄每增加一个标准差，相当于大约 3.5 岁，会导致下降 2.5 个百分点<!-- -->在创业率（成年人创业的比例）中。考虑到 2010 年全球创业率约为 6.1%，这是一个巨大的影响。

class="article__body-text">更重要的是，这种关系似乎不仅仅是老龄化社会中年轻人相对缺乏的结果。这些国家的年轻人开办企业的比率似乎也低于不那么发达的社会中的同龄人。</p><p class="article__body-text">梁先生认为，这种现象可能是日本“企业家真空”的原因。就在 2010 年，日本发明家<!-- -->35 个国家的领先专利生产商<!--

class="article__body-text">只关注最有可能出现激进创新的最新颖的领域，情况也好不到哪里去。在伦敦经济学院经济绩效中心发表的一份分析报告中，Antonin Bergeaud 和 Cyril Verluise 指出，日本对基因组编辑和区块链技术的贡献几乎缩水为零。曾经在储氢、自动驾驶汽车和计算机视觉（一种训练计算机解读图像的人工智能）领域处于领先地位的国家已经沦为落后于美国、中国或两者的配角（见图 2）。</p><p class="article__body-text">政府基本上无力扭转出生率下降的趋势。各国试图鼓励妇女生育更多孩子的努力通常收效甚微。对匈牙利和波兰政府分别以所得税抵免和固定付款形式提供的昂贵支持的研究表明，对生育率的影响有限。新加坡向新孩子的父母提供大笔补助，现在头两个孩子的补助金为 11,000 新加坡元（8,300 美元），超过 13,000 新加坡元，此外还有退税和儿童保育补贴。在补贴公寓销售计划中，父母优先于其他买家。但新加坡的总生育率仅为 1.0：无论政策的影响如何，它都远未大到足以避免人口下降的程度。</p><p class="article__body-text">当然，出生率只是对创新和生产力的众多贡献之一。如果人口是唯一因素，那么撒哈拉以南非洲一些最贫穷的经济体将是最具活力的。教育水平、法律和金融体系的可靠性以及创新者互动网络的存在都很重要。与平均年龄低得多的许多富裕国家相比，日本仍然是一个具有显着创新精神的国家。但人口结构可以放大或抑制一个国家的潜在潜力。</p><p class="article__body-text">这指出了通过改善提高生产力的其他因素来抵消人口下降对创新的影响的方法。最明显的是教育，它让老龄化社会能够充分利用日益减少的年轻人群体。特别是在巴西和中国等中等收入国家，有数以百万计的年轻人没有接受适当的教育，因此他们对经济的贡献很小。在大部分富裕国家，情况也是如此，尽管程度较轻。例如，无论他们多么聪明，未受过教育的工人都不能指望在医学或计算机领域提出突破性的想法。随着潜在劳动力的减少，最大限度地提高其中每个人的产出将变得至关重要，并且可能有助于在一段时间内抵消人口老龄化的影响，至少在创新领域是如此。</p></div><p class="article__body-text">技术是应对人口变化的另一种潜在手段，从远程医疗到机器人在服务行业的使用增加。这些创新无疑可以缓解老龄化社会带来的困难，无论是通过直接为老年人的护理做出贡献，还是通过自动化年轻工人的角色。但具有讽刺意味的是，具有创新精神的年轻思想家数量的减少将减少此类有价值的新想法的数量。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果被人工智能构想的新想法所抵消，人类创新的不足也可能会减少破坏性。毫无疑问，机器很快就会研究出如何对现有流程进行渐进式改进——事实上，在某些领域，它们已经在这样做了。然而，机器是否会学习如何产生颠覆性的新想法仍然是一个有争议的问题。</p><p class="article__body-text"> Plasmon 的电影讲述了意大利最后一个孩子的故事，结尾讨论了孩子是希望的象征。它将观众引导至一个网站，该网站建议可能有助于促进更大家庭的政策。该网站反过来要求读者签署一份呼吁采取行动的请愿书。只有不到 8,000 人这样做了。随着意大利人口的持续减少，尤其是年轻人的数量，供应短缺的不仅仅是婴儿食品的买家。 Plasmon 将很难找到创意人才来设计巧妙的广告活动，更不用说制定新政策来扭转婴儿潮。 <span

class="article__body-text">就在不久前，德桑蒂斯先生似乎成功地设计了一种没有特朗普的特朗普主义形式。 11 月，他以 19 个百分点的优势在佛罗里达州赢得连任。与此形成鲜明对比的是，特朗普先生试图在中期选举中扮演拥王者的角色却大错特错，他支持的许多候选人都输掉了共和党原本认为包揽的竞选。特朗普先生于 11 月 15 日在他位于佛罗里达州棕榈滩的庄园 Mar-a-Lago 开始他的总统竞选活动时显得有些泄气。当时一些民意调查显示这两位候选人在初选选民中势均力敌。 </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZ8j_CZLFm8?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">六个月后，一直跌跌撞撞的是德桑蒂斯先生。他因将乌克兰战争视为纯粹的“领土争端”而被批评为孤立主义者，因与迪士尼挑起争端而被批评为反社团主义者，并因签署禁止怀孕六周以上的堕胎而被批评为极端主义者。与此同时，特朗普先生恢复了他的步伐，凯旋而归。他和他的团队花了几个月的时间来抨击德桑蒂斯先生。回想起来，州长决定等到佛罗里达州立法机构本月早些时候完成年度会议后再宣布参选，这看起来像是一个误判，尽管推迟的部分原因是为了让立法者能够通过一项法案，允许他在不辞职的情况下竞选总统。省长。在漫长的间歇中，他忍受了长时间的电视广播攻击，却没有提供太多的防御。就好像布鲁图斯在三月十五日睡过头，给了尤利乌斯凯撒穿上盔甲的机会，但他仍然试图继续他的打击工作。曾经看似合理的推翻特朗普的阴谋现在看起来毫无希望。</p><h2>把你的欢呼借给我</h2><p class="article__body-text">2016 年，特朗普以叛乱分子的身份参选。 2020年，他以现任总统身份参选。到 2024 年，他将作为两者的混合体——叛乱主义者和制度主义者同时参选。事实证明，这是一个强有力的组合，有助于在早期投票中建立巨大的领先优势。在初选中的可能选民中，特朗普先生保留了前总统的地位，但也被视为被人欺负的失败者，因为他声称 2020 年的选举被窃取，他被禁止使用社交媒体以及他的<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/25/how-donald-trumps-trials-and-the-republican-primary-will-intersect" data-tegid="tc50p4ub3qvuq8tedqkquurcoq9ubbhu">许多法律问题</a>.早期的失误，例如他的竞选启动乏善可陈，以及与白人至上主义者的尴尬晚餐，已经被新的竞选行动所纠正，该行动比特朗普过去竞选时混乱的家庭事务更专业。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">更有什者，共和党已经彻底特朗普化了。在州一级尤其如此，那里设置了大部分初选规则。与 2016 年党内建制派避开特朗普不同，如今他在精英代言竞赛中占据主导地位。许多大捐助者已经转投德桑蒂斯先生等替代方案，但这并不像听起来那么具有破坏性。特朗普先生将毫不费力地从他的小额捐助者大军中筹集资金，并将再次将自己描绘成真正的人民保民官，遭到与世隔绝的精英追随者的攻击。在共和党基地中，他享有普遍的知名度和近乎普遍的钦佩。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种对特朗普先生的崇敬使得他的竞争对手很难攻击他。他们中的大多数人不是来埋葬特朗普主义，而是来赞美它。但由此产生的混乱削弱了他们的吸引力。特朗普竞选团队的发言人贾森·米勒这样说：“当滚石乐队还在巡演时，你为什么还要去看滚石乐队的致敬乐队呢？”</p><p class="article__body-text">初选还没开始就结束了吗？有些人是这么认为的。 “希望不是一种策略，”里克威尔逊说，他是前共和党特工，现在负责林肯计划，这是一个除了特朗普之外的任何人的组织。他认为特朗普先生必须失去能力才能失败。 “唐纳德·特朗普将开始在辩论中砍下德桑蒂斯的头，然后像踢足球一样踢它。共和党基础选民想要那个节目，”他说。询问华盛顿周围的秘密反特朗普共和党人，初选将如何进行，许多人会联想到值得高卢战争的野蛮场面。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，更乐观的人指出，还有很长的路要走，即使特朗普的战车正在加速。 “我们距离投票还有几个月又几个月的时间。全国民意调查毫无意义——一旦投票开始，它们就会有意义，”爱荷华州（第一个投票的州）的共和党顾问大卫科切尔说，他曾与米特罗姆尼和杰布布什共事。苦苦挣扎的竞选活动的顾问交换了灰姑娘的故事，讲述了最新候选人的支持率在一个月内从爱荷华州的 2% 上升到 20%。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">诚然，早期的民意测验并不能像后来的那样预测最终结果。但这并不意味着它们没有用。早期强度与最终结果之间存在相关性（见图 1）。根据数据新闻机构 FiveThirtyEight 构建的民调平均值，目前特朗普先生获得了近 55% 的初选选民的支持。这比德桑蒂斯先生的平均水平高出 30 个百分点以上。在过去 40 年竞争激烈的初选中，八位候选人中有六位在投票前获得超过 30% 的支持率，最终获得了本党的提名。未能利用如此大的领先优势的两位候选人是泰德肯尼迪，他在 1980 年与现任总统吉米卡特竞争，而希拉里克林顿最终在 2008 年被魅力四射的巴拉克奥巴马抢了风头。今年最接近卡特式在位和奥巴马式吸引力的共和党候选人当然是特朗普先生。</p><p class="article__body-text">问题不仅仅是一个分裂的领域。尽管已经宣布了六位半途而废的候选人，而且很可能还会有更多候选人，但即使是两匹马的比赛也会对特朗普有利。 YouGov 最近为<i>《经济学人》</i>进行的民意调查发现，在一场正面交锋中，共和党初选选民更喜欢特朗普先生，而不是德桑蒂斯先生，比例为 58% 对 25%。而这位前总统的支持，一点也不勉强，也不三心二意。尽管有很多选择，但仍有 64% 的共和党人希望特朗普再次参选。相比之下，民主党人对他们的推定候选人乔·拜登的热情要低得多：只有 53% 的人希望总统再次参选。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 2016 年，特朗普的反对者认为他的离谱言论和混乱的竞选活动将不可避免地导致政治失败。这被证明是无可救药的盲目乐观。大多数人现在认为，特朗普先生可以说或做的事情很少能疏远他的支持者。但一些反对者仍然希望他的竞选活动会因为他在白宫期间的那种混乱的内斗而破裂。</p><p class="article__body-text">难点在于这次混乱的候选者更加有序了。 2016 年，特朗普先生的竞选活动吸引了相当多的江湖骗子。目前的管理比较稳定。其领导人之一苏西·威尔斯 (Susie Wiles) 在 2016 年和 2020 年成功领导了特朗普先生在佛罗里达州的行动。她还在 2018 年领导了德桑蒂斯先生竞选州长，当时他是特朗普先生的门徒。几乎没有家庭参与：伊万卡·特朗普和前总统的女儿兼女婿贾里德·库什纳预计不会在竞选活动中发挥任何作用，后者曾在白宫担任高级顾问。特朗普先生也有更多的个人经历：这是他第三次竞选总统（如果算上他在 2000 年与改革党的失败竞选，则是第四次）。他的共和党对手都是第一次参选。 </p></div><div

“在我当选后不久，第二天或几天后，我收到了特朗普总统发来的祝贺我的语音邮件，”堪萨斯州共和党主席迈克布朗说。他说，特朗普竞选团队在宣传该州的初选方面一直“非常出色”。将各州初选和党团会议（实际上是权力下放的政党会议）的结果转化为党的全国代表大会提名竞争者投票的规则是神秘且不断变化的。与民主党初选不同，在民主党初选中，一个州的选票通常按候选人的选票份额分配给候选人，许多共和党初选遵循赢者通吃的制度。这可以将在选票份额方面相对微弱的领先优势转变为对代表的压倒性优势。在特朗普担任总统期间，他鼓励各州采用此类系统或其他有助于领先者的规则。初选的日期不断向前推进，给叛乱候选人建立势头的时间越来越少（见图表 2）。</p><p class="article__body-text">特朗普的团队也一直在其他方面赶超对手，通过打电话和邀请前往海湖庄园的宫廷，努力征求党内高层人物的支持。这种支持在 2016 年没有出现，但在明年的比赛之前已经大量涌入。特朗普先生已经获得众议院 222 名共和党议员中的 51 名和 49 名共和党参议员中的 10 名的支持。他的对手只有七名代表和两名参议员。特朗普竞选团队对佛罗里达州国会代表团的成功感到特别自豪，他们基本上拒绝了他们州的州长。佛罗里达州的 20 名共和党代表中有 11 名支持特朗普，而只有一名支持德桑蒂斯。当然，德桑蒂斯先生和斯科特先生在参加竞选之前不可能期望获得很多支持，但他们还有很多工作要做。</p><p class="article__body-text">至少在运营上，德桑蒂斯先生当然有希望迎头赶上。他是一位了不起的筹款人，在 2022 年担任州长期间筹集了惊人的 2.17 亿美元，其中大部分都没有花掉。因为德桑蒂斯先生是财力雄厚的捐助者的最爱（尽管他在堕胎、迪士尼和乌克兰问题上的立场让一些人感到恼火），他将严重依赖一个名为“永不退缩”的组织，这是一个所谓的超级<small>PAC</small> ，可以不受限制地接受捐款，只要它不与官方活动相协调。一位熟悉德桑蒂斯先生想法的人士表示，他可以在他的正式竞选活动和超级<small>政治行动委员会</small>之间筹集 2.5 亿美元。 Never Back Down 的策划人是 Jeff Roe，他是一家名为 Axiom Strategies 的咨询公司的创始人，该公司参与了德克萨斯州共和党参议员特德克鲁兹 2016 年失败的总统竞选和 2021 年格伦杨金成功竞选弗吉尼亚州州长. Never Back Down 预计将用广告铺天盖地地轰炸电视，并为必须在提前投票的州游荡数月的拉票员和组织者支付费用。</p><p class="article__body-text">官方竞选活动将由德桑蒂斯先生在佛罗里达州的核心圈子成员主持。可能的竞选经理佩克将军领导了他最近的州长竞选活动。他的民意调查大师可能是另一位本土人才瑞恩泰森。德桑蒂斯先生是赢得捐赠军备竞赛的热门人选。他将拥有大量知道如何使用他的收入的竞选老手。</p></div><h2>我来，我见，我挥霍</h2><p class="article__body-text">如果只需要现金就可以成为总统，那么美国将在迈克尔·布隆伯格的第一个任期中途完成，迈克尔·布隆伯格是纽约大亨和前市长，他在 2020 年民主党提名失败的竞选活动中挥霍了 11 亿美元。说服共和党选民叛逃像德桑蒂斯先生现在必须做的那样，从特朗普先生那里接手是一项艰巨的任务。许多明显的攻击途径，可能会在大选中吸引摇摆不定的选民，在初选中是不可能的。特朗普先生对 2021 年 1 月 6 日袭击国会的暴民的鼓励几乎没有危及他在党内的地位，其中大多数人认为 2020 年的选举被偷走了。他的反对者也无法从总统离任以来一直困扰着总统的质询、调查和诉讼中获益，从<small>联邦调查局</small>在海湖庄园搜索机密文件到他最近被曼哈顿地方检察官起诉欺诈书——保持。这些侮辱不仅没有削弱特朗普在共和党人眼中的地位，反而把他变成了烈士。甚至像德桑蒂斯先生这样的政治对手也觉得有必要为他辩护。 </p><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">总统初选与其说是政策辩论，不如说更像是一场人气竞赛——这次也略有不同。所有候选人都同意，拜登先生是在故意破坏这个国家，觉醒已经失控，必须封锁南部边境。只有适度的分歧迹象。特朗普先生在财政问题上从左翼攻击德桑蒂斯先生，认为他将危及社会保​​障（国家养老金）和医疗保险（老年人免费医疗），这两个在老年选民中是神圣不可侵犯的计划。斯科特先生呼吁减少对抗性政治。更多的国际主义候选人，如南卡罗来纳州前州长妮基·黑利 (Nikki Haley)，认为继续支持乌克兰对美国的国家安全至关重要。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">其他人比特朗普更孤立。来自俄亥俄州的富有的印裔美国企业家维韦克·拉马斯瓦米 (Vivek Ramaswamy) 说：“我们必须愿意禁止大多数<small>美国</small>企业在中国开展业务，直到<small>中共</small>[中国共产党] 垮台或<small>中共</small>彻底改革自身。”这比其他候选人提议的脱钩更难。他还想禁止平权行动，关闭<small>联邦调查局</small>，并动用军队摧毁将芬太尼运往边境的墨西哥卡特尔。早期的民意调查显示，在剥离特朗普选民方面取得了一些成功，但这是一个微妙的操作。 “我们首先团结起来支持美国是有原因的。首先不是特朗普，”拉马斯瓦米先生说。 “我在竞选他，但要明确的是，我仍然对被提名人应该以某种方式成为共和党捐助者阴谋的产物的想法感到反感。”</p><p class="article__body-text">但是，如果阴谋者要摆脱凯撒，他们必须在某个时候联合起来。 2016 年，分裂的领域，加上赢者通吃的初选规则，帮助特朗普先生获胜。 2020 年，当左翼理论家伯尼·桑德斯 (Bernie Sanders) 显然可能获得提名时，民主党人团结起来支持拜登先生，而共和党人可能难以控制。目前，德桑蒂斯先生无疑是特朗普先生最强大的竞争对手。但其他候选人似乎比前总统更热衷于攻击他，因为他们害怕疏远基本盘。例如，黑莉女士开始谴责德桑蒂斯先生与迪士尼不和。其他著名的共和党人，例如去年竞选亚利桑那州州长失败的卡里莱克和南达科他州州长克里斯蒂诺姆，也开始抨击德桑蒂斯先生。他们可能正在为特朗普先生的副总统职位试镜，并将此类攻击视为博取他好感的捷径。</p><p class="article__body-text">尽管最近几个月他跌跌撞撞，但德桑蒂斯先生是一个聪明而有进取心的人。他可能会恢复瘦削和饥饿的样子，让战犬溜走。许多选民将密切关注电视辩论，首场辩论将于 8 月在威斯康星州举行（尽管前总统可能不会参加）。德桑蒂斯先生可以指出，在特朗普担任总统期间，国家债务飙升了 8 万亿美元；尽管前总统在这两个问题上大谈特谈，但犯罪和非法移民都在增加； covid-19 的控制不力，另一种流行病，觉醒，在他担任总统期间变得更具传染性，而不是更少。这可能有助于指出，以专横解雇而闻名的特朗普先生未能解雇安东尼·福奇 (Anthony Fauci)，他是抗击新冠肺炎的公众代言人，在保守派圈子里，安东尼·福奇与没收枪支和伊斯兰教法一样受欢迎。</p><p class="article__body-text">这样的倒钩可能会吸血。如果以足够的力量和频率挥动它们，它们甚至可能使像凯撒这样强大的人倒下。对特朗普先生来说幸运的是，他面对的是一群脾气暴躁、争吵不休且胆小的人。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i><b>编者注（2023 年 5

岁生日。在世的人在国际事务方面的经验比他多，先是作为 19 世纪外交学者，后来担任美国国家安全顾问和国务卿，在过去 46 年中担任顾问和特使给君主、总统和首相。基辛格先生很担心。 “双方都相信对方代表着战略危险，”他说。 “我们正走在大国对抗的道路上。”</p><p class="article__body-text"> 4 月底， <i>《经济学人》</i>就如何防止中美之间的竞争演变成战争与基辛格先生进行了八个多小时的交谈。这些天他弯着腰走路很吃力，但他的头脑却很敏锐。在他思考接下来的两本书时，关于人工智能 ( <small>AI</small> ) 和联盟的本质，他仍然对展望未来比回顾过去更感兴趣。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

class="article__body-text">基辛格先生对中国和美国在技术和经济优势方面日益激烈的竞争感到震惊。即使俄罗斯陷入中国的轨道，战争笼罩着欧洲的东翼，他仍然担心<small>人工智能</small>即将加剧中美竞争。在世界范围内，力量平衡和战争的技术基础正在以如此多的方式快速变化，以至于各国缺乏建立秩序的既定原则。如果找不到，他们可能会诉诸武力。 “我们正处于第一次世界大战前的经典局面，”他说，“双方都没有多少政治让步余地，任何对平衡的干扰都可能导致灾难性后果。”</p><h2>多研究战争</h2><p class="article__body-text">基辛格先生因参与越南战争而被许多人斥为好战分子，但他认为避免大国之间的冲突是他一生工作的重点。在目睹了纳粹德国造成的大屠杀和 13 名近亲在大屠杀中被谋杀后，他开始相信，防止毁灭性冲突的唯一方法是冷静的外交，最好是通过共同的价值观来加强。 “这是必须解决的问题，”他说。 “而且我相信我一生都在努力应对它。”在他看来，人类的命运取决于美中能否和睦相处。他认为，尤其是<small>人工智能</small>的快速发展，只留给他们五到十年的时间来寻找出路。</p><aside

class="article__body-text">基辛格先生对有抱负的领导人提出了一些开放性建议：“确定你的位置。无情的。本着这种精神，避免战争的出发点是分析中国日益增长的不安情绪。尽管他以对北京政府和解着称，但他承认，许多中国思想家认为美国正在走下坡路，“因此，作为历史演变的结果，他们最终将取代我们。” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

class="article__body-text">他认为，中国领导层对西方政策制定者谈论基于规则的全球秩序表示不满，而他们真正的意思是美国的规则和美国的秩序。中国的统治者被他们认为是西方提出的居高临下的讨价还价所侮辱，即如果中国表现良好就给予中国特权（他们当然认为这些特权理应属于他们，作为一个崛起的大国）。事实上，中国的一些人怀疑美国永远不会平等对待它，而且想象它可能会是愚蠢的。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，基辛格先生也警告不要曲解中国的野心。在华盛顿，“他们说中国想要统治世界……答案是他们（在中国）想要变得强大，”他说。 “他们并没有走向希特勒意义上的世界统治，”他说。 “这不是他们对世界秩序的看法，也从来没有这样想过。”</p><p class="article__body-text">基辛格说，在纳粹德国，战争是不可避免的，因为阿道夫·希特勒需要战争，但中国不同。从毛泽东开始，他会见了许多中国领导人。他并不怀疑他们的意识形态承诺，但这始终植根于对他们国家利益和能力的敏锐感知。</p><p class="article__body-text">基辛格先生认为中国制度更像儒家而非马克思主义。这教会了中国领导人在他们的国家能力范围内发挥最大的力量，并寻求因他们的成就而受到尊重。中国领导人希望被承认为国际体系对自身利益的最终裁决者。 “如果他们取得了真正可以利用的优势，他们会把它推向强加中国文化的地步吗？”他问。 “我不知道。我的直觉是不……[但]我相信我们有能力通过外交和武力的结合来防止这种情况的发生。”</p><p class="article__body-text">面对中国野心挑战，美国的一个自然反应是探究它，以此作为确定如何维持两个大国之间平衡的一种方式。另一个是在中美之间建立永久性对话。中国“正在努力发挥全球作用。我们必须在每一点上评估战略角色的概念是否兼容。”如果不是，那么就会出现武力问题。 “中国和美国有可能在没有全面战争威胁的情况下共存吗？我认为并且仍然认为它 [是]。”但他承认并不能保证成功。 “它可能会失败，”他说。 “因此，我们必须有足够的军事实力来承受失败。” </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">紧迫的考验是中国和美国在台湾问题上的表现。基辛格回忆说，在理查德尼克松 1972 年首次访华时，只有毛泽东有权就该岛进行谈判。 “每当尼克松提出一个具体的话题时，毛泽东都会说，‘我是一个哲学家。我不处理这些主题。让周[恩来]和基辛格讨论这个问题。&#39;......但谈到台湾时，他非常直率。他说：‘他们是一帮反革命分子。我们现在不需要它们。我们可以等100年。总有一天我们会要求他们。但它距离很远。&#39;” </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/01-china.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">基辛格先生认为，尼克松和毛泽东之间形成的谅解在这 100 年中的 50 年后就被唐纳德特朗普推翻了。他想通过迫使中国在贸易问题上让步来夸大自己的强硬形象。在政策上，拜登政府效仿特朗普，但措辞自由。</p><p class="article__body-text">基辛格先生不会在台湾问题上选择这条道路，因为乌克兰式的战争会摧毁台湾并摧毁世界经济。战争也可能使中国在国内受挫，其领导人最大的恐惧仍然是国内的动荡。</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite><i>“</i>美国放弃台湾而不损害其在其他地方的地位不是一件简单的事情”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">对战争的恐惧为希望创造了条件。麻烦的是双方都没有太多让步的余地。每一位中国领导人都宣称自己的国家与台湾有联系。但与此同时，“事态发展到现在，美国要在不损害其在其他地方的地位的情况下放弃台湾并不是一件简单的事情。”</p><p class="article__body-text">基辛格先生摆脱这种僵局的方式借鉴了他在任期间的经验。他会从降低温度开始，然后逐渐建立信心和工作关系。美国总统不会罗列他们所有的不满，而是会对他的中国同行说：“总统先生，现在和平面临的两个最大威胁是我们两个。从某种意义上说，我们有能力毁灭人类。”中国和美国在没有正式宣布任何事情的情况下，将力求保持克制。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">基辛格先生从不喜欢决策官僚主义，他希望看到一小群顾问，他们可以很容易地接触到彼此，默契地一起工作。双方都不会从根本上改变其在台湾问题上的立场，但美国会注意其如何部署自己的力量，并尽量避免让人怀疑它支持台湾独立。</p><p class="article__body-text">基辛格先生给有抱负的领导者的第二条建议是：“定义可以吸引人们的目标。找到实现这些目标的方法，可描述的方法。”台湾将只是几个超级大国可以找到共同点从而促进全球稳定的几个领域中的第一个。</p><p class="article__body-text">在最近的一次演讲中，美国财政部长珍妮特耶伦建议这些应该包括气候变化和经济。基辛格先生对两者都持怀疑态度。尽管他“完全赞成”在气候问题上采取行动，但他怀疑这对建立信心或帮助建立两个超级大国之间的平衡有多大作用。在经济方面，危险在于贸易议程被不愿给中国任何发展空间的鹰派所劫持。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种孤注一掷的态度威胁到更广泛的缓和局势。如果美国想找到与中国共存的方式，它不应该以政权更迭为目标。基辛格先生从一开始就借鉴了他思想中的一个主题。 “在任何稳定外交中，都必须有一些 19 世纪世界的元素，”他说。 “而 19 世纪的世界是基于这样一个命题，即与之竞争的国家的存在不成问题。”</p><p class="article__body-text">一些美国人认为，一个战败的中国将变得民主与和平。然而，无论基辛格多么希望中国成为一个民主国家，他都认为这种结果没有先例。更有可能的是，共产主义政权的垮台将导致一场内战，内战加剧为意识形态冲突，只会加剧全球不稳定。 “驱使中国解体不符合我们的利益，”他说。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国将不得不承认中国有利益，而不是深陷其中。一个很好的例子是乌克兰。</p><p class="article__body-text">中国国家主席习近平最近才与乌克兰总统泽伦斯基取得联系，这是自去年 2 月俄罗斯入侵乌克兰以来的首次联系。许多观察家认为习近平的呼吁是旨在安抚抱怨中国与俄罗斯过于亲近的欧洲人的空洞姿态。相比之下，基辛格先生认为这是一份严肃的意图宣言，将使围绕战争的外交复杂化，但也可能恰恰创造出建立超级大国互信的那种机会。 </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/02-inevitable.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">基辛格首先谴责俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔普京，开始他的分析。 “最终，这肯定是普京的一个灾难性判断错误，”他说。但西方并非没有责任。 “我认为决定……开放乌克兰在<small>北约</small>的成员资格是非常错误的。”这是不稳定的，因为在没有计划实现<small>北约</small>保护的情况下悬而未决的承诺使乌克兰的防御不力，尽管这肯定会激怒普京先生和他的许多同胞。</p><p class="article__body-text">现在的任务是结束战争，而不是为下一轮冲突埋下伏笔。基辛格先生表示，他希望俄罗斯尽可能多地放弃它在 2014 年征服的领土，但现实情况是，在任何停火协议中，俄罗斯很可能会保留塞瓦斯托波尔（克里米亚最大的城市和俄罗斯在该地区的主要海军基地）黑海），至少。这样的解决方案，俄罗斯失去了一些收益，但保留了其他收益，可能会让俄罗斯和乌克兰都不满意。

“因为欧洲人说：‘我们不希望他们加入<small>北约</small>，因为他们太冒险了。因此，我们要把他们武装起来，给他们最先进的武器。&#39;”他的结论很明确：“我们现在已经把乌克兰武装到了一个地步，它将成为武装最精良的国家，而战略上最少的国家在欧洲经验丰富的领导。”</p><p class="article__body-text">要在欧洲建立持久和平，西方需要进行两次想象力飞跃。首先是乌克兰加入<small>北约</small>，作为一种制约和保护它的手段。第二个是欧洲与俄罗斯建立和解，作为建立稳定东部边界的一种方式。 </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN"

class="article__body-text">许多西方国家对这些目标中的一个或另一个犹豫不决是可以理解的。有中国作为俄罗斯的盟友和<small>北约</small>的反对者参与其中，任务将变得更加艰巨。中国最关心的是看到俄罗斯从乌克兰战争中完好无损。不仅习近平与普京建立了“无限制”的伙伴关系，而且莫斯科的垮台会给中国带来麻烦，因为它会在中亚造成权力真空，并有可能被“叙利亚式内战”填补。</p><p class="article__body-text">在习近平致电泽连斯基之后，基辛格认为中国可能将自己定位为在俄罗斯和乌克兰之间进行调解。作为让美国和中国对抗苏联的政策的设计者之一，他怀疑中国和俄罗斯能否很好地合作。诚然，他们对美国抱有共同的怀疑，但他也认为他们对彼此有一种本能的不信任。 “I have never met a Russian leader who said anything good about China,” he says. “And I&#39;ve never met a Chinese leader who said anything good about Russia.” They are not natural allies. </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN"

diplomacy over Ukraine as an expression of their national interest, Mr Kissinger says. Although they refuse to countenance the destruction of Russia, they do recognise that Ukraine should remain an independent country and they have cautioned against the use of nuclear weapons. They may even accept Ukraine&#39;s desire to join <small>NATO</small> . “China does this, in part, because they do not want to clash with the United States,” he says. “They are creating their own world order, in so far as they can.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> The second area where China and America need to talk is <small>AI</small> . “We are at the very beginning of a capability where machines could impose global pestilence or other pandemics,” he says, “not just nuclear but any field of human destruction.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He acknowledges that even experts in <small>AI</small> do not know what its powers will be (going by the evidence of our discussions, transcribing a thick, gravelly German accent is still beyond its capabilities). But Mr Kissinger believes that <small>AI</small> will become a key factor in security within five years. He compares its disruptive potential to the invention of printing, which spread ideas that played a part in causing the devastating wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite>“There are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable…[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text"> “[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness,” Mr Kissinger warns. Despite the doctrine that a human should be in the loop, automatic and unstoppable weapons may be created. “If you look at military history, you can say, it has never been possible to destroy all your opponents, because of limitations of geography and of accuracy. [Now] there are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AI</small> cannot be abolished. China and America will therefore need to harness its power militarily to a degree, as a deterrent. But they can also limit the threat it poses, in the way that arms-control talks limited the threat of nuclear weapons. “I think we have to begin exchanges on the impact of technology on each other,” he says. “We have to take baby steps towards arms control, in which each side presents the other with controllable material about capabilities.” Indeed, he believes that the negotiations themselves could help build mutual trust and the confidence that enables the superpowers to practise restraint. The secret is leaders strong and wise enough to understand that <small>AI</small> must not be pushed to its limits. “And if you then rely entirely on what you can achieve through power, you&#39;re likely to destroy the world.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s third piece of advice for aspiring leaders is to “link all of these to your domestic objectives, whatever they are.” For America, that involves learning how to be more pragmatic, focusing on the qualities of leadership and, most of all, renewing the country&#39;s political culture.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s model for pragmatic thinking is India. He recalls a function at which a former senior Indian administrator explained that foreign policy should be based on non-permanent alliances geared to the issues, rather than tying up a country in big multilateral structures.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such a transactional approach will not come naturally to America. The theme running through Mr Kissinger&#39;s epic history of international relations, “Diplomacy”, is that the United States insists on depicting all its main foreign interventions as expressions of its manifest destiny to remake the world in its own image as a free, democratic, capitalist society.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem for Mr Kissinger is the corollary, which is that moral principles too often override interests—even when they will not produce desirable change. He acknowledges that human rights matter, but disagrees with putting them at the heart of your policy. The difference is between imposing them, or saying that it will affect relations, but the decision is theirs. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="2300" height="1536" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/134/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/401/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/534/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/668/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/855/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> “We tried [imposing them] in Sudan,” he notes. “Look at Sudan now.” Indeed, the knee-jerk insistence on doing the right thing can become an excuse for failing to think through the consequences of policy, he says. The people who want to use power to change the world, Mr Kissinger argues, are often idealists, even though realists are more typically seen as willing to use force.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is an essential counterweight to China&#39;s growing power. Yet it also has a worsening record of religious intolerance, judicial bias and a muzzled press. One implication—though Mr Kissinger did not directly comment—is that India will therefore be a test of whether America can be pragmatic. Japan will be another. Relations will be fraught if, as Mr Kissinger predicts, Japan takes moves to secure nuclear weapons within five years. With one eye on the diplomatic manoeuvres that more or less kept the peace in the 19th century, he looks to Britain and France to help the United States think strategically about the balance of power in Asia.</p><h2> Big-shoe-fillers wanted</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership will matter, too. Mr Kissinger has long been a believer in the power of individuals. Franklin D. Roosevelt was far-sighted enough to prepare an isolationist America for what he saw as an inevitable war against the Axis powers. Charles de Gaulle gave France a belief in the future. John F. Kennedy inspired a generation. Otto von Bismarck engineered German unification, and governed with dexterity and restraint—only for his country to succumb to war-fever after he was ousted.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger acknowledges that 24-hour news and social media make his style of diplomacy harder. “I don&#39;t think a president today could send an envoy with the powers that I had,” he says. But he argues that to agonise about whether a way ahead is even possible would be a mistake. “If you look at the leaders whom I&#39;ve respected, they didn&#39;t ask that question. They asked, &#39;Is it necessary?&#39;”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He recalls the example of Winston Lord, a member of his staff in the Nixon administration. “When we intervened in Cambodia, he wanted to quit. And I told him, &#39;You can quit and march around this place carrying a placard. Or you can help us solve the Vietnam war.&#39; And he decided to stay… What we need [is] people who make that decision—that they&#39;re living in this time, and they want to do something about it, other than feel sorry for themselves.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership reflects a country&#39;s political culture. Mr Kissinger, like many Republicans, worries that American education dwells on America&#39;s darkest moments. “In order to get a strategic view you need faith in your country,” he says. The shared perception of America&#39;s worth has been lost.</p><p class="article__body-text"> He also complains that the media lack a sense of proportion and judgment. When he was in office the press were hostile, but he still had a dialogue with them. “They drove me nuts,” he says. “But that was part of the game…they weren&#39;t unfair.” Today, in contrast, he says that the media have no incentive to be reflective. “My theme is the need for balance and moderation. Institutionalise that. That&#39;s the aim.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Worst of all, though, is politics itself. When Mr Kissinger came to Washington, politicians from the two parties would routinely dine together. He was on friendly terms with George McGovern, a Democratic presidential candidate. For a national security adviser from the other side that would be unlikely today, he believes. Gerald Ford, who took over after Nixon resigned, was the sort of person whose opponents could rely on him to act decently. Today, any means are considered acceptable.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think Trump and now Biden have driven [animosity] over the top,” Mr Kissinger says. He fears that a situation like Watergate could lead to violence and that America lacks leadership. “I don&#39;t think Biden can supply the inspiration and…I&#39;m hoping that Republicans can come up with somebody better,” he says. “It&#39;s not a great moment in history,” he laments, “but the alternative is total abdication.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> America desperately needs long-term strategic thinking, he believes. “That&#39;s our big challenge which we must solve. If we don&#39;t, the predictions of failure will be proved true.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> If time is short and leadership lacking, where does that leave the prospects for China and the United States finding a way to live together in peace?</p><p class="article__body-text"> “We all have to admit we&#39;re in a new world,” Mr Kissinger says, “for whatever we do can go wrong. And there is no guaranteed course.” Even so he professes to feel hope. “Look, my life has been difficult, but it gives ground for optimism. And difficulty—it&#39;s also a challenge. It shouldn&#39;t always be an obstacle.” </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/05-kant.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> He stresses that humanity has taken enormous strides. True, that progress has often occurred in the aftermath of terrible conflict—after the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic wars and the second world war, for example, but the rivalry between China and America could be different. History suggests that, when two powers of this type encounter each other, the normal outcome is military conflict. “But this is not a normal circumstance,” Mr Kissinger argues, “because of mutually assured destruction and artificial intelligence.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think it&#39;s possible that you can create a world order on the basis of rules that Europe, China and India could join, and that&#39;s already a good slice of humanity. So if you look at the practicality of it, it can end well—or at least it can end without catastrophe and we can make progress.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is the task for the leaders of today&#39;s superpowers. “Immanuel Kant said peace would either occur through human understanding or some disaster,” Mr Kissinger explains. “He thought that it would occur through reason, but he could not guarantee it. That is more or less what I think.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> World leaders therefore bear a heavy responsibility. They require the realism to face up to the dangers ahead, the vision to see that a solution lies in achieving a balance between their countries&#39; forces, and the restraint to refrain from using their offensive powers to the maximum. “It is an unprecedented challenge and great opportunity,” Mr Kissinger says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The future of humanity depends on getting it right. Well into the fourth hour of the day&#39;s conversation, and just weeks before his birthday celebrations, Mr Kissinger adds with a characteristic twinkle, “I won&#39;t be around to see it either way.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 17 May 2023 14:41:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ljr6qha8c5njtiqbn0u45vjmrjjcduc6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/17/henry-kissinger-explains-how-to-avoid-world-war-three </item><item><title><![CDATA[China learns to manage decline]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">T</span> <small>HE DEMOGRAPHIC</small> milestones come thick and fast in “My Home in the Forest”, the official tourism anthem of Yichun, a sprawling city in China&#39;s far north-east.

Its focus on ecotourism reflects hopes and fears that are specific to Yichun, a city trying to reinvent itself after its vast state-owned timber mills closed about a decade ago. Its boosterism shows off the entrepreneurial side of Chinese bureaucrats, who for several decades now have earned bonuses and promotions by presiding over local economic growth. When Chaguan visited recently, city officials tirelessly showed off Yichun&#39;s attractions, from tasty blueberries to its dinosaur museum. By way of emphasis, officials unexpectedly interrupted an interview to break into “My Home in the Forest”, clapping and swaying as they sang. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Still, the ballad&#39;s wistful evocation of family life should haunt Communist Party bosses all across China. Chaguan was not in Yichun to talk about berries, but because the city is at the leading edge of a demographic crisis that will soon hit the whole country. Birth rates are falling in China. The most recent national census, in 2020, revealed a total fertility rate (births per woman) of 1.3. The <small>UN</small> put the number at 1.2 last year. That is among the world&#39;s lowest and far below that needed to maintain a stable population, namely, just over two children per woman.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/is-chinese-power-about-to-peak">Is Chinese power about to peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak">At what height will China&#39;s economy peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap">How Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power">How China measures national power</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/the-fall-of-empires-preys-on-xi-jinpings-mind">The fall of empires preys on Xi Jinping&#39;s mind</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> The census found an extreme situation in Yichun. No Chinese city has as few children, as a share of its population. Just 7.4% of its 879,000 residents are under 14. For comparison, children in the same age range account for almost 18% of the Chinese population as a whole. Even in some of the greyest cities in Japan or South Korea, children are more common than in Yichun. The latest numbers are grim. In 2021 just 2,321 babies were born there, against 8,817 deaths. A generation earlier, in 2000, the city&#39;s overall population was about a third larger than today. Yichun saw over 17,000 births that year, or eight times as many babies as now.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Though exceptionally bad, Yichun&#39;s baby bust reflects demographic woes across China&#39;s north-east rustbelt. The total fertility rate in the province of Heilongjiang, of which Yichun is part, is just 0.76 babies per woman of child-bearing age. One cause is working adults heading south. Marriage rates are also falling among those who stay.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A shrinking population will test China&#39;s growth-orientated political system. On May 5th President Xi Jinping signalled new realism about this challenge at a meeting of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs, a powerful body that he chairs. The commission heard that lower birth rates, an ageing population and demographic disparities between regions are a “new normal” to which policymakers must adapt. Officials were told to focus on education, on building a “childbirth-friendly society” and on helping the old to lead active lives. Rather than growth, the talk is of “high-quality population development”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Few cities like to admit to shrinking. That is in part because officials are rewarded for <small>GDP</small> growth, and in part because land sales are a big source of local-government revenue. As long as cities kept expanding, officials could easily justify auctioning new plots to developers. But the latest census leaves less room for denial.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yichun is a good place to see these trends. In 2001 the city published a plan predicting that the population would grow to 1.4m by 2020: a spectacular overestimate. In person, officials still dodge questions about birth statistics, preferring to offer anecdotes about friends having babies. Wang Hao, head of the city&#39;s Communist Youth League branch, enthuses about Yichun supporting new jobs that appeal to the young, such as tagging traffic lights on maps and street-view images for makers of autonomous cars. Tellingly, though, Mr Wang admits that he has only one child, murmuring that he and his wife are too busy for more.</p><h2> The politics of contraction</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, Yichun has quietly merged some urban districts and combined some schools. In January it shed a series of outlying subdistricts, turning them into rural townships: a rare example of de-urbanisation. Dusty, apparently deserted housing estates are not hard to spot on the edge of town. Long Ying, an urban planner at Tsinghua University, co-wrote a recent study that used satellite images of night-time lighting to identify over 750 cities in China that shrank between 2013 and 2018. He describes different causes. Some cities lose people because natural resources run out. Others shed working-age adults to nearby big cities. Remote border towns are a third category. Not all are economic laggards. Professor Long wonders if China will see a fourth category in the near-future: coastal cities that lose workers to robots while still booming. Managing decline is very new for Chinese officials, he says. But he sees examples of pragmatism, pointing to north-eastern cities that turned derelict neighbourhoods into large parks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s one-child policy limited births from 1980 to 2016. It left a heavy mark on cities like Yichun, with large state employers that enforced family-planning rules strictly. Now Heilongjiang offers subsidies to promote second and even third births. The money offered does not offset the economic pain of losing Yichun&#39;s timber industry, says a man collecting his only grandchild from primary school. Before, he scoffs, “people wanted to have children but weren&#39;t allowed. Now they allow it but people can&#39;t afford children”. Politically, expansion is an easier sell than squeezing more from less. Party bosses are becoming more open about the task ahead. Do not expect them to sing about it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more from Chaguan, our columnist on China:</b><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/04/chinas-new-top-gun-normalises-war-with-america">China&#39;s new “Top Gun” normalises war with America</a> (May 4th)</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/27/chinas-rulers-play-the-law-and-order-card-and-lose" data-tegid="fk0q22c84m8jn5hrgkbgvn9h3n1i8t1i">China&#39;s rulers play the law-and-order card, and lose</a> (Apr 27th)</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/20/why-china-wants-to-be-a-risk" data-tegid="mtt5pupasojrfrq4d50i3pl59krm8789">Why China wants to be a risk</a> (Apr 20th)</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Also: How the Chaguan column <a href="https://www.economist.com/column-names">got its name</a></i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 11:16:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ps7r7oq04g1i13qdbn5pbii8unp5iut4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/china-learns-to-manage-decline </item><item><title><![CDATA[The fall of empires preys on Xi Jinping’s mind]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="苏联。俄罗斯。莫斯科。 Near the Red Square.

It was not about the crisis at hand, but about history. </p><style data-emotion="css 1lm38nn">.css-1lm38nn{margin:1.3125rem 0 2.1875rem;}.css-1lm38nn figure{margin:0;min-width:100%;}.css-1lm38nn figure figcaption{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-weight:500;}.css-1lm38nn audio{display:block;margin-top:0.75rem;width:100%;}.css-1lm38nn +figure,.css-1lm38nn +.g-fallback+figure{margin-top:0;}</style><div class="css-1lm38nn e1lug06p0"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。 </figcaption><style data-emotion="css 1fs0t47">.css-1fs0t47{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-border-link);}.css-1fs0t47 a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;-webkit-transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);}.css-1fs0t47 a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);}.css-1fs0t47 a:focus{text-decoration-color:transparent;box-shadow:0 0 0 0.125rem var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);outline:solid transparent;}.css-1fs0t47 a:active{text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);box-shadow:none;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}</style><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0">享受更多音频和播客</span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0"><a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a></span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0">或者</span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0"><a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">安卓</a>。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/015%20Briefing%20-%20The%20fear%20of%20collapse-80ee9f0869945ad022455e032701cadd.mp3" title="The fall of empires preys on Xi Jinping’s mind" controlslist="nodownload"><p>您的浏览器不支持 &lt;audio>; 元素。 </p></audio><style data-emotion="css 1h1me4y">.css-1h1me4y{text-align:center;height:0;}.css-1h1me4y>div{top:-0.625rem;}</style><div class="css-1h1me4y e1lug06p1"><style data-emotion="css vu6x35">.css-vu6x35{position:relative;display:inline-block;text-align:left;}</style><div class="css-vu6x35 e5tfikp0"></div></div></figure></div><p class="article__body-text"> Long before foreign analysts began their recent musings on whether “peak China”—the height of the country&#39;s power—has been reached or is imminent, Mr Xi had been urging China&#39;s citizens to reflect on the peaks and troughs of the country&#39;s past. He insists that China&#39;s “great rejuvenation”, to be achieved by the 100th anniversary of Communist rule in 2049, is “irreversible”. That is, the country will, by then, become even stronger and more influential. But he has stressed the need to avoid mistakes that caused the fall of dynasties during the country&#39;s 2,100-year-long imperial era, which ended in 1911, as well as those that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union 80 years later. Since he took power more than a decade ago, he has often mused on the inconstancy of national greatness and threats to the party&#39;s rule. History clearly haunts him. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi talks of the “cyclical nature of history”, whereby strong and prosperous regimes sooner or later unravel. The speech he gave a year ago, to the party&#39;s chief enforcers of internal discipline, was about how China must “jump out” of this historical pattern. State media summarised Mr Xi&#39;s remarks shortly after he delivered them, but the (still only partial) text that was published in January was fuller and more dramatic. In it, Mr Xi&#39;s anxiety is clear. He told the officials that the cyclical tendency was a “major issue”, relating to “the life and death of the party, and the rise or fall or success or failure of our country&#39;s socialist system”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Discussion of this cycle has a long history in China. Official literature traces it back to the party&#39;s days as a guerrilla force at the end of the second world war when its leader, Mao Zedong, was reportedly asked by an inquisitive visitor to his base how the party would avoid the trap. His (disingenuous) answer was “democracy—only if people are allowed to supervise the government will it dare not to relax”. Mr Xi insists that China has become democratic already, far more so than Western countries. But state media credit him with another means of avoiding decline. He calls it “self-revolution”, a euphemism for endless purges of officials who are corrupt or disloyal.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/is-chinese-power-about-to-peak">Is Chinese power about to peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak">At what height will China&#39;s economy peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap">How Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power">How China measures national power</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/china-learns-to-manage-decline">China learns to manage decline</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi dwells on the collapse of the Soviet Union even more than his predecessors did. In his view, its causes were chiefly political: ideological laxity and a lack of discipline within its ruling party. In his published speeches, he does not spend much time on other problems that may have played a part, such as the financial burden of military competition with the West, or the costs of having swathes of the economy under the control of inefficient state-owned enterprises. To Mr Xi, the simple moral is that China&#39;s Communist Party needs to be much tougher. As he puts it, nobody in the Soviet Union was “man enough” to crush opposition when the crunch came. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Statue of KGB founder Feliks Dzerzhinsky falls in front of KGB Lubyanka headquarters.

But he also warns of mounting perils ahead. “At present and in the future, we are facing many contradictions, risks and challenges at home and abroad, and we must not take it lightly,” he said in 2016, even before Donald Trump was elected as president and tensions with America began to escalate. If China were to fail to respond effectively, he added, problems in areas such as the economy, society and the environment could “evolve into political contradictions, risks and challenges that will ultimately endanger the party&#39;s ruling status and national security”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> As more difficult years loom—with an ageing society, shrinking population and slowing growth—logic might seem to prod Mr Xi to consider economic and social reforms. Useful ones would include scaling back state-owned firms, giving private businesses freer rein in critical parts of the economy and providing rural migrants with fairer access to state-funded health care and education in cities. But his end-of-dynasty fears will complicate decision-making. He views state enterprises as a bulwark of party rule and big private firms, notably those in the tech industry, with suspicion. He sees the middle class as another pillar of support: he may not want to alienate it by appearing to splurge on urban society&#39;s underdogs.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The dilemma is captured in a mid-19th-century book by Alexis de Tocqueville: “The Old Regime and the Revolution”. Translations of the French historian&#39;s classic work about his country&#39;s revolution in 1789 have been hot sellers in China since the months before Mr Xi took over. It owes its popularity to an unexplained recommendation by Wang Qishan, a party bigwig who became Mr Xi&#39;s chief enforcer of discipline and, later, vice-president (he stepped down in March). Readers comb Tocqueville&#39;s analysis of France&#39;s turmoil for insights into China&#39;s future.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One clause is usually highlighted. It is that “experience teaches that the most critical moment for bad governments is the one which witnesses their first steps toward reform.” It is unlikely that Mr Wang meant to imply that the party was ruling badly, or that reforms should cease. But he could have been suggesting that a period of relative prosperity, such as France experienced before the revolution, can be fraught with political danger. The party must be on its guard.</p><h2> Learning from Tacitus</h2><p class="article__body-text"> There is little sign of regime-threatening discontent brewing in China. But Mr Xi is certainly watchful. In 2019 China&#39;s head of public security said that preventing a “colour revolution” in China was a priority for the police. Protests in November against the zero-covid policy, though small and scattered, will have reinforced Mr Xi&#39;s concerns. Such open displays of dissent are rare. Even more unusually, some demonstrators called on Mr Xi to step down.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As economic growth slows in the years ahead, unease over living standards is likely to grow, and with it Mr Xi&#39;s anxiety. In 2014 he referred to what Chinese scholars call the “Tacitus trap”. This is the idea, taken from the Roman historian&#39;s writings, that “when a ruler once becomes unpopular, all his acts, be they good or bad, tell against him.” Mr Xi said: “Of course, we haven&#39;t got to this stage yet, but the problems we face can&#39;t be described as unserious. We must use huge energy to resolve them.” Since then, his warnings have become more strident. “The more we proceed, the harder and more dangerous it gets,” he said in 2018. Mr Xi has yet to refer publicly to the Peak China concept, but the risks of stalling are clearly on his mind. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Subscribers can sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">Drum Tower</a> , our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China—and what China makes of the world.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 11:16:37 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/bhma0j6088tai5o65e5pcgv54u68rla0</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/the-fall-of-empires-preys-on-xi-jinpings-mind </item><item><title><![CDATA[How China measures national power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="XI'AN, CHINA - APRIL 12: A general view of the Terracotta Warriors are seen on April 12, 2017 in Xi'an, China (Ian Hitchcock/Getty Images)" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>N “GUANZI”,</small> a text from the seventh century <small>BC</small> , a statesman thought to be called Guan Zhong lays out the “eight views” needed to assess a country&#39;s status. “Tour its mountains and lakes,” he says, “observe its agriculture, and calculate its production of six types of livestock.

A formula devised by Ray Cline, a <small>CIA</small> analyst, was dismissed for being too narrow in scope and too subjective. Deng Xiaoping, China&#39;s reformist leader, had stated: “In measuring a country&#39;s national power, one must look at it comprehensively and from all sides.” To cater to these demands, Chinese experts started to design their own models.</p><p class="article__body-text"> They ran into some problems. One is that the more complete the range of variables, the harder it is to allocate weights to them. In a paper from 2002, Hu Angang and Men Honghua, then of Tsinghua University, listed eight categories of resources, taking in everything from farmland to computers. <small>CNP</small> is calculated as a weighted average of these resources as a share of the world&#39;s total. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has a similar model, but uses different indicators and weightings. Who is right? Some indexes rely for their weightings on polls of experts, but that&#39;s just a sophisticated version of the conventional wisdom. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1156/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1156/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/380/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/570/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/761/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1141/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1217/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1521/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1901/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2434/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Another problem is that the calculation of <small>CNP</small> produces a single number, but the components that make it up are not interchangeable.

Drawing inspiration from an article by Michael Beckley of Tufts University, we zoom in on the three essential ingredients of national power: economic heft, productive efficiency and military might.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A country cannot be powerful if its economy is inefficient. In the 19th century China lost two opium wars to Britain, despite having a <small>GDP</small> twice the size.

That, in turn, would allow China to become the world&#39;s pre-eminent military power, and so supplant America as the world&#39;s most powerful country. This remains a common view. Yao Yang, a respected economist at Peking University, believes China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> can overtake America&#39;s by 2029.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But others believe China&#39;s economic clout relative to that of its rivals is nearing a peak.

No peak was in sight. At the end of last year the bank revisited its calculations. It now thinks China&#39;s economy will not overtake America&#39;s until 2035 and at its high point will be only 14% bigger (see chart).</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s peak looks similar in an influential forecast from last year by Roland Rajah and Alyssa Leng of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. Others see an even lower summit. Capital Economics, a research firm, argues that China&#39;s economy will never be number one. It will reach 90% of America&#39;s size in 2035 and then lose ground. In so far as the Peak China thesis can be captured in a single projection, this is it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What accounts for the lower expectations for China&#39;s economy? And how much of a reduction is warranted? The answers hinge on three variables: population, productivity and prices. Start with population. China&#39;s workforce has already peaked, according to official statistics. It has 4.5 times as many 15- to 64-year-olds as America. By mid-century it will have only 3.4 times as many, according to the <small>UN</small> ’s “median” forecast. By the end of the century the ratio will drop to 1.7.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But China&#39;s demographic prospects have not changed much over the past decade, even as forecasts for economic growth have shrunk. In fact, Goldman Sachs&#39;s new predictions assume a gentler decline in China&#39;s workforce than the old ones, because improvements in health may keep older workers at the grindstone for longer. The bank believes the labour supply in China will drop by about 7% from 2025 to 2050. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The biggest swing in sentiment relates not to population but to productivity. Back in 2011 Goldman Sachs thought labour productivity would grow by about 4.8% a year on average over the next 20 years. Now the bank thinks it will grow by about 3%. Mark Williams of Capital Economics takes a similar view. China will fall “off the path of an Asian outperformer onto the path of a solidly respectable emerging economy”, he says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are good reasons to be gloomy about Chinese workers&#39; productivity. As China ages, it will have to devote more of its economic energies to serving the elderly, leaving less to invest in new kit and capacity. What is more, after decades of rapid capital accumulation, the returns to new investments are diminishing. A new high-speed rail line across mountainous Tibet yields far smaller benefits at much greater cost than connecting Beijing and Shanghai, for instance.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s rulers are trying to impose more discipline on local governments, which build much of China&#39;s questionable infrastructure. Unfortunately, they seem equally keen to impose their will on China&#39;s private enterprises. In China, unlike elsewhere, firms earn a smaller return on their assets as they grow bigger, points out Capital Economics: “Get to a certain size and companies have to give as much thought to meeting the needs of officials as those of consumers.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> It is not just their own government that is hobbling Chinese businesses. In October America imposed controls on sales of advanced computer chips to China. This will hurt Chinese firms making products like mobile phones, medical equipment and cars. Goldman Sachs has not incorporated this damage into its long-term forecasts, but estimates that China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> towards the end of this decade could be about 2% smaller than it would otherwise have been.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The tech war could go further. Diego Cerdeiro of the <small>IMF</small> and his co-authors have examined a scenario in which America curtails its own technology trade with China, persuades other <small>OECD</small> members to follow suit, and forces countries outside this club to pick sides in the battle. Under this extreme scenario, China&#39;s economy could be about 9% smaller in ten years&#39; time than it otherwise would be. The idea that China&#39;s productivity growth might be closer to 3% than 5%, in other words, is not far-fetched.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Any predictions of the economic future must, of course, be taken with a pinch of salt. Forecasts often go awry. Small differences in the evolution of productivity or population when combined and compounded over many years can yield starkly different outcomes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Forecasts are also sensitive to prices—especially the relative price of currencies. Unexpected shifts in exchange rates can make a mockery of predictions of relative economic heft. At the moment, a basket of goods and services that costs $100 in America costs only about $60 in China. That suggests its currency, the yuan, is undervalued. Capital Economics thinks this undervaluation will persist. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, believes it will narrow, either because the yuan strengthens or because prices rise faster in China than in America. This process will, in Goldman&#39;s view, add about 20% to China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> by mid-century. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> If China&#39;s prices or exchange rate fail to rise as Goldman Sachs expects, then China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> might never overtake America&#39;s. If China&#39;s labour productivity grows just half a percentage point slower than Goldman Sachs envisages, its <small>GDP</small> , everything else constant, will also never surpass America&#39;s (see chart). The same is true if America grows half a point faster (as Capital Economic projects). If China&#39;s fertility rate declines further (to 0.85 children per woman by mid-century), it might eke out a lead in the 2030s only to lose it in the 2050s. Even if China&#39;s economy does become the biggest in the world, its lead is likely to remain small. It is unlikely to establish an edge over America equivalent to the 40% lead America now enjoys over it, Mr Rajah and Ms Leng argue.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It also seems safe to say that China and America will remain in a position of near-parity for decades. In Goldman Sachs&#39;s scenario, China maintains a small but persistent lead over America for more than 40 years. Even in Capital Economics&#39;s projection, China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> will still be over 80% of America&#39;s as late as 2050. China will remain a geopolitical rival to be reckoned with. That is crucial: if China&#39;s peak is more Table Mountain than <small>K</small> 2, its leaders will have little incentive to rush to confrontation before decline sets in. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Subscribers can sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">Drum Tower</a> , our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China—and what China makes of the world.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 10:37:50 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/gnrpiemprbp0a4nps2vir4luvk15nhmf</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak </item><item><title><![CDATA[China v America: how Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="(230331)——青岛，2023年3月31日（新华社）——2023年1月31日，一名士兵在中国人民解放军海军第42舰队实战训练中射击。中国海军编队返回东部中国港口城市青岛周四完成了在亚丁湾和索马里海域护送民用船只的任务。 （马玉斌摄/新华社）新华社/eyevine联系eyevine了解更多关于使用该图片的信息：T：+44 (0) 20 8709 8709E：info@eyevine.comhttp://www.eyevine.com" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_CNP501.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">E</span> <small>VER SINCE</small> British troops vanquished Qing dynasty forces in the Opium Wars of the 19th century, Chinese modernisers have dreamed of building world-class armed forces with a strong navy at their core.

It has risen by an average of over 9% annually since Chinese leaders launched an ambitious military modernisation programme in the late 1990s. In 2023 China&#39;s official military budget is projected to be $224bn, second only to America&#39;s, which is about four times bigger. Increasing defence spending at such a pace is harder with a slowing economy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Nonetheless defence spending is budgeted to rise this year by 7.2%, roughly in line with China&#39;s forecast rate of nominal <small>GDP</small> growth. The military budget excludes some key items such as weapons development. Still, it is a useful trend indicator, suggesting that Mr Xi is ring-fencing core defence spending at 1.6-1.7% of <small>GDP</small> —roughly the same as for the past decade.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If he can maintain that, based on the <small>IMF</small> ’s current <small>GDP</small> forecasts, China&#39;s annual military spending will still be far smaller than America&#39;s by 2030, according to the Asia Power Index compiled by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. But China will narrow the gap substantially by then, it predicts, increasing military expenditure in purchasing-power-parity terms by $155bn, compared with America&#39;s $123bn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even if his economy grows slower than forecast, Mr Xi has considerable leeway to divert resources to the armed forces from the civilian economy. And within the armed forces, he can prioritise areas that he considers more strategically important, for example by downsizing the army, which accounts for almost half of the <small>PLA</small> ’s 2.2m active-duty personnel.</p></div><h2> <b>Naval gazing</b></h2><p class="article__body-text"> Defence spending does not always translate into military power. That depends on many other factors, including technology, alliances and goals. But in China&#39;s case, another useful indicator is the navy. It uses lots of different equipment, including missiles and aircraft, and would spearhead any effort to take Taiwan or project power globally. Building ships is costly and needs a strong industrial base, so it reflects economic health. It is also possible to compare China&#39;s naval shipbuilding plans with America&#39;s, which are made public.</p><p class="article__body-text"> So what do the numbers show? China&#39;s navy has grown in the past two decades from a puny coastal force of outdated ships to a largely modern, home-made one that can conduct some missions far from China&#39;s shores, such as evacuating its citizens from Sudan in April. But it still falls short of Mr Xi&#39;s needs in several key ways—in particular by not having enough large amphibious ships to guarantee a successful invasion of Taiwan. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> That will change over this decade, the Pentagon predicts, as the Chinese navy retires the last of its older ships and adds larger, modern, multi-role ones. It now has about 340 “battle force” vessels (ones that can contribute to combat), including carriers, submarines, frigates and destroyers. That number is likely to reach 400 by 2025 and 440 by 2030, according to the Pentagon. Among the new ships will be about a dozen more large amphibious ships.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even assuming low defence-budget growth, China&#39;s navy would still grow to an estimated 356 ships by 2033, adding three carriers and nine big amphibious ships, according to the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments ( <small>CSBA</small> ), a think-tank in Washington that has designed a digital tool for assessing China&#39;s military procurement choices. “I don&#39;t think the resource constraints are so formidable that Chinese leaders will begin to think that their relative power advantages are eroded,” says Jack Bianchi of <small>CSBA</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> America&#39;s navy, by comparison, had a battle force of 296 ships in April (about half its cold-war peak) and expects that number to drop to about 290 by the end of this decade. Thereafter, America may start to narrow the gap. Its navy still has an official goal of 355 ships. But budget constraints, political changes and other factors could make that difficult to achieve even by 2040. And while China is focusing its military build-up on Taiwan, America has to maintain a global presence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ship numbers can be misleading. America&#39;s vessels are still bigger and more capable. Yet China is likely to catch up on those counts too in the coming decade. It is already “largely composed of modern multi-role platforms featuring advanced anti-ship, anti-air, and anti-submarine weapons and sensors,” says the Pentagon. The Office of Naval Intelligence states that Chinese naval-ship design and material quality is in many cases comparable to America&#39;s “and China is quickly closing the gap in any areas of deficiency.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> One of China&#39;s advantages is its vast shipbuilding industry, which is the world&#39;s largest, accounting for 44% of commercial ships produced worldwide in 2021. A single state-run company, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation ( <small>CSSC</small> ), accounted for more than a fifth of global orders that year. But it also produces most of China&#39;s navy ships, often at the same shipyards as commercial vessels. For instance, the <small>CSSC</small> -owned Jiangnan shipyard (the one founded by Li Hongzhang in 1865) completed China&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/03/chinas-next-aircraft-carrier-will-be-its-biggest">third aircraft-carrier</a> in 2022 but has also made dozens of cargo ships, including for Taiwanese customers. Combining production in this way helps to sustain the shipyards in economic downturns, to apply civilian technology and mass-production techniques to naval shipbuilding, and to circumvent sanctions targeting the <small>PLA</small> , says Monty Khanna, a retired rear-admiral in the Indian navy. America&#39;s naval shipbuilders, meanwhile, focus almost exclusively on defence contracts, making it hard to scale up production or to sustain a stable supply of skilled workers.</p><h2> <b>Forged in battle</b></h2><p class="article__body-text"> Yet there is one crucial area in which China will struggle to match America for many years, if not decades: experience. China has not been to war since one with Vietnam, fought largely on land, in 1979. It has not yet perfected carrier operations in peacetime, let alone combat. And it has not mastered the art of keeping its submarines hidden, while tracking potentially hostile ones. America, by comparison, has honed those capabilities over decades. China is also struggling to attract enough well-educated recruits to operate its new ships.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is still, of course, a risk that Mr Xi goes to war before his armed forces are ready. The most likely triggers for that would be Taiwan formally declaring independence or America taking steps to significantly enhance the island&#39;s status or defences. As he grows older and more vulnerable to ill health and political challenges, there is the possibility that he miscalculates or grows impatient, as Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s president, apparently did over Ukraine. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Some see signs of such impatience already in Mr Xi, who American officials say has ordered his armed forces to develop the capability to take Taiwan by 2027, the <small>PLA</small> ’s centenary. But that does not mean he plans to attack by then, says the <small>CIA</small> . Many <small>PLA</small> experts believe that 2027 is more of a short-term milestone designed to maintain momentum towards the medium-term target of complete <small>PLA</small> modernisation by 2035. His ultimate goal is still to build a <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/27/xi-jinping-wants-chinas-armed-forces-to-be-world-class-by-2050">“world class” fighting force</a> by 2049, the centenary of Communist rule.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Recent war games suggest that China could perhaps win a conflict over Taiwan this decade, but not for sure, and losses on all sides would be devastating. The longer Mr Xi waits, the more the military balance tips in China&#39;s favour—and not just in conventional terms. The Pentagon predicts China&#39;s nuclear arsenal will almost quadruple in size by 2035. Chinese strategists hope that will facilitate a peaceful solution by persuading both Taiwan and America that conflict would be too costly. “Peak China” proponents may be correctly predicting a fraught decade ahead. But Mr Xi still has time on his side. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Subscribers can sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">Drum Tower</a> , our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China—and what China makes of the world.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 08 May 2023 15:23:19 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rib9js830hnjq4c7b61p8avjtlmj3g5e</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap </item><item><title><![CDATA[Could Erdogan be ousted in Turkey’s coming election?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Turkey&#39;s President Tayyip Erdogan poses with the political party leaders of his alliance during a ceremony for the launch of amphibious assault ship TCG Anadolu, aiming to extend its drone capabilities from land-based to naval operations, in Istanbul, Turkey, April 10, 2023.

Now he has become the persecutor, locking up opponents on flimsy charges, cowing the media and deposing elected officials. Turkey barely deserves the label democracy, in the eyes of many observers (see chart 1).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Erdogan&#39;s economic management, too, has come full circle. The first decade of his rule saw inflation banished and incomes soar. In the second, inflation has returned and <small>gdp</small> per person has fallen by 15% in dollar terms (see chart 2).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Erdogan has performed a similar volte face with regards to Turkey&#39;s big Kurdish minority, which he courted in his early years in power but whose political leaders he now dismisses as terrorist stooges. And he has fallen out with America and the <small>EU</small> , which at first feted him for helping to strengthen Turkey&#39;s democracy, but now castigate him for weakening it. In all of these realms—upholding democracy, righting the economy, managing social cleavages and conducting foreign policy—the election offers a stark choice between a reforming opposition and the ever more entrenched and intransigent Mr Erdogan.</p></div><h2> Sarays and lamentations </h2><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1775/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1775/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/584/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/876/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/1168/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1752/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1868/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/2336/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/2919/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/3737/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBC033.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> On the face of things, it is odd that Mr Erdogan and the <small>AK</small> party are even in contention, given the state of the economy. The lira has lost 60% of its value against the dollar over the past two years. Money is flooding out of the country: foreign investors owned 64% of Turkish equities and 25% of Turkish government bonds only five years ago, but only 29% and 1% now. The current-account deficit hit a record $10bn in January. Runaway inflation—it reached 86% year-on-year in the autumn, and remains over 40%—has impoverished millions of Turks. Moreover, the drop in inflation in recent months is thanks in part to the central bank&#39;s unsustainable bolstering of the exchange rate. It is selling perhaps $1bn a day, much of it borrowed, to slow the lira&#39;s slide. Taking into account the dollars it owes other central banks and domestic commercial banks, it is thought to have negative foreign reserves, of almost -$70bn. Further devaluation of the lira, and therefore higher inflation, seem inevitable when it runs out of dollars to sell.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Erdogan is trying to distract attention from all this by pointing to the many advances Turkey has made on his watch. Over the past month alone, he has inaugurated the country&#39;s first nuclear plant, celebrated the tapping of a big gasfield in the Black Sea, jumped behind the wheel of Turkey&#39;s first electric car and unveiled its first aircraft-carrier. The message such projects are meant to convey is that Mr Erdogan has defied the West to transform Turkey into a world power, and that the best is still to come. “If you&#39;re wondering why he still hovers at more than 40% [in the polls],” says Galip Dalay, an analyst, “one reason is this idea and this language of grandeur.”</p></div><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/04/if-turkey-sacks-its-strongman-democrats-everywhere-should-take-heart">If Turkey sacks its strongman, democrats everywhere should take heart</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-01-21">Special report: Erdogan&#39;s empire</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> It is not all hollow rhetoric. Mr Erdogan took power in 2003, on the heels of an inflationary spiral and a banking crisis that had trampled the economy. He initially presided over steady growth, in the economy as a whole and in the middle class. Many Turks benefited enormously and remain loyal to Mr Erdogan as a result.</p><h2> Spinning like a Topkapi</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Erdogan has used his influence over the media to persuade supporters that the economy&#39;s troubles have more to do with foreign conspiracies to keep Turkey down than with his government&#39;s mismanagement. He is also adept at exploiting divisions within Turkish society. Many of those who benefited from his early economic policies were conservative, middle-class, provincial types who had long felt ignored or sneered at by the secular, metropolitan elite. For years he has been telling them that the freedoms they have won on his watch, including the right to wear the Islamic headscarf in universities and state institutions, depend on his remaining in power. He characterises the election as a contest between proudly pious and nationalist Turks and a rabble of whisky-sipping, godless elitists, Kurdish separatists and sexual deviants, all slavishly seeking to embrace imported Western values. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> But none of this can hide the fundamental problem: Mr Erdogan is sabotaging the economy. He believes, perversely, that high interest rates fuel inflation, and that lowering borrowing costs will help stabilise prices. By packing the central bank with yes-men, he has imposed this view on the country, leading to feverish inflation. And because low interest rates make credit ludicrously cheap (the central bank&#39;s main lending rate is more than 35 percentage points below the rate of inflation), it has to be rationed through government regulations. Critics see this as a recipe for cronyism. “The central bank decides who gets to buy dollars, the banking authority decides who is eligible for loans, and the government decides whose debts are forgiven or postponed,” complains Kerim Rota, a former banker and a deputy chair of Future, a small opposition party.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Erdogan&#39;s only remedies are sticking-plasters. The recent discovery of a big gasfield in the Black Sea, says Numan Kurtulmus, <small>AK</small> ’s deputy chair, will cut Turkey&#39;s bill for imports, easing pressure on the lira. Meanwhile, since the end of 2021, the government has increased the basic monthly state pension fivefold to 7,500 lira ($385) and tripled the minimum wage to 8,500 lira, bringing it close to median earnings. It promises to raise the minimum wage again in July, after the election.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The opposition, in contrast, promises a return to economic orthodoxy. It is led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, a former official in the finance ministry and head of a state-pension agency, whose understated personality offers a striking foil to Mr Erdogan&#39;s grandstanding. (While Mr Erdogan cuts the ribbon on one megaproject after another, Mr Kilicdaroglu records videos in his modest kitchen, with tea towels draped over the oven handle and a lone onion as a prop to discuss inflation. )</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kilicdaroglu says he will restore the independence of the central bank, which will inevitably lead to sharp increases in interest rates. That, in turn, is likely to slow the economy down, if not prompt a recession. Meanwhile, inflation will take some time to quell. Under Mr Erdogan it has become so sticky that the opposition has had to revise its timeframe for bringing it down to single digits from one year to two.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Opposition politicians say that social spending will mitigate some of the pain, as will foreign capital, which they expect to flood into Turkish equity and bond markets as soon as a new economic team takes charge and rates start rising. Direct investments in firms and factories will take longer, but will return too, the opposition argues. Turkey&#39;s is the largest economy between India and Germany, after all, and benefits from a customs union with the <small>EU</small> , making it an excellent base from which to export to Europe. Conversations with fund managers flocking to Istanbul ahead of the elections suggest such hopes are not unfounded. “I know what needs to be done,” says Bilge Yilmaz, a possible economy minister if the opposition prevails, “and delaying it is only going to increase the pain in the long term.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> In terms of institutional reforms, too, the government and opposition offer starkly different programmes. Mr Erdogan has strongly centralised power in the presidency, which used to be a largely ceremonial office, while abolishing the job of prime minister and diminishing the role of parliament. He has also used the state&#39;s power in extremely partial and punitive ways. He has stiffened and abused a law against insulting the president, which is now punishable by up to four years in prison. There have been some 200,000 investigations of this crime during his time in office. In a haunting echo of the banning of Islamic parties and politicians before he came to power, his prosecutors are pushing for the dissolution of the Peoples&#39; Democratic Party ( <small>hdp</small> ), the main Kurdish party. In the meantime, he has summarily evicted many elected Kurdish mayors from office. Tens of thousands of followers of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric with whom Mr Erdogan was once allied politically, have been dismissed from government jobs or jailed on paper-thin charges backed by risible evidence, after Mr Gulen was accused of instigating an attempted coup in 2016.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kilicdaroglu promises to reverse much of that. He says he will restore the independence of the courts, hand power back to parliament and repeal the law on insulting the president. The opposition also pledges to end Mr Erdogan&#39;s policy of sacking elected mayors and to compensate those wrongfully dismissed after the coup. It says it will pursue crooked officials, too, including those suspected of massaging the inflation numbers and awarding lucrative contracts to government cronies.</p><h2> Sublime support</h2><p class="article__body-text"> One of the likely beneficiaries of such a policy would be Selahattin Demirtas, the imprisoned former leader of the <small>HDP</small> . Since the breakdown of talks with the Kurdistan Workers&#39; Party ( <small>PKK</small> ), a Kurdish insurgent group, in 2015, <small>AK</small> has become increasingly hostile to Turkey&#39;s Kurdish minority, who make up around 15-20% of the population. Since 2018 it has governed with the support of the National Movement Party ( <small>MHP</small> ), which fiercely opposes any concessions to Kurds.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The opposition alliance also contains a nationalist outfit, the Good Party, which formed after a split in the <small>MHP</small> . Its manifesto therefore features few clear concessions to Kurdish sentiment. But whereas Mr Erdogan dismisses Kurdish political parties as fronts for the <small>pkk</small> in his speeches, Mr Kilicdaroglu condemns Mr Erdogan for caricaturing all Kurds as extremists. Simply by restoring the rule of law, the opposition would make life much easier for Kurdish activists. The <small>HDP</small> has formally endorsed Mr Kilicdaroglu. Although his election would not resolve all its grievances, it would markedly lower tensions. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230506_FBP002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Turkey&amp;#39;s Republican People&amp;#39;s Party (CHP) Chairman and Presidential candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu gestures on the stage during a rally in Kocaeli, on April 28, 2023. - A sea of umbrellas and hoods at his feet, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the Turkish opposition candidate who will challenge Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the polls on 14 May, smilingly promises" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span><figcaption> On a Kilicdaroglu</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text"> On foreign policy, too, the government and the opposition differ dramatically in tone, at least. Mr Erdogan&#39;s disregard for civil liberties and his stridently nationalist tone make relations with the West awkward, despite a recent effort at rapprochement on both sides. Mr Erdogan has blocked Sweden&#39;s bid to join <small>NATO</small> , arguing that it harbours Kurdish terrorists. And his government depends on Mr Putin for all manner of economic help, from cheap imports of gas to loans and expertise to build the nuclear-power plant that Mr Erdogan recently inaugurated.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An aide to Mr Kilicdaroglu says Sweden could join <small>NATO</small> within a month if his boss wins the election. The opposition has promised to improve relations with the <small>EU</small> , too—although this depends as much on Europe getting over its fears about migration from Turkey as it does on Turkey improving its record on human rights. And the opposition is almost as sceptical as Mr Erdogan about unqualified support for Ukraine, arguing that the war can end only through negotiation. Turkey, in short, will still see itself as a regional power deserving a degree of deference if Mr Kilicdaroglu becomes president, but it should become less reflexively prickly and pugnacious. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> All these changes, however, will only be possible if the opposition prevails. It is a mixed bunch. Mr Kilicdaroglu&#39;s Republican People&#39;s Party ( <small>CHP</small> ) had for decades clung to the statist and secular legacy of Turkey&#39;s modern founder, Kemal Ataturk, and opposed any outward expression of Islamic faith. The Good Party&#39;s leader, Meral Aksener, served briefly as interior minister in the 1990s, when human-rights abuses in the Kurdish south-east were at their worst. Other prominent opposition leaders include Mr Erdogan&#39;s former prime minister, his erstwhile economy tsar and an avowed Islamist who only years ago argued that Turkey should ditch ties with Europe in favour of an Islamic union.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This motley assembly have gradually set aside their differences and moderated their views. Mrs Aksener has rebranded the Good Party as centre-right. Mr Kilicdaroglu has begun transforming the <small>CHP</small> from a Kemalist fossil into a modern social-democratic party (which has helped make him more palatable to Kurdish voters). At Mr Kilicdaroglu&#39;s insistence, the opposition alliance has drawn up a 200-page manifesto after months of negotiations. It also agreed on Mr Kilicdaroglu as a joint presidential candidate, despite misgivings about his lack of charisma.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The opposition is certainly capable of winning elections. Four years ago, thanks in part to the Kurdish vote, its mayoral candidates handed Mr Erdogan a stinging defeat, beating <small>AK</small> in four of Turkey&#39;s five biggest cities. The latest polling suggests close races in both the parliamentary and presidential elections.</p><p class="article__body-text"> To win the presidential election in the first round of voting, a candidate must secure more than 50% of the vote. With two other candidates running in addition to Messrs Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu, that is unlikely. So the race is likely to go to a run-off on May 28th.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some opposition supporters fear that Mr Erdogan will refuse to hand over power if he loses. “My people will not hand over this country to a president supported by [the <small>PKK</small> ],” he thundered on May 1st.几天前，内政部长警告说，选举日可能会发生“西方支持的政治政变企图”。</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such rhetoric is stoking concerns that Mr Erdogan, perhaps at the behest of members of his inner circle, may subvert the election or challenge the results, especially in case of a narrow loss. The <small>AK</small> party tried this, after all, in the most recent mayoral election in Istanbul, persuading the courts to order a re-run. <small>AK</small> lost again, by a bigger margin. Three years later the victorious candidate was convicted of insulting government officials.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Opposition politicians, however, wave aside such concerns, saying they are confident in the integrity of the vote, and that Mr Erdogan would not dare challenge the people&#39;s will, on which his legitimacy depends. “He can try anything,” says Mr Kilicdaroglu. “But no matter what he does, this nation has made its decision.” If Mr Kilicdaroglu is right, the election will mark a watershed, for Turkey and the world. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 04 May 2023 09:56:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/vse0e1bovklc280bm37qgo3mqtke1ujn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/04/could-turkeys-strongman-be-on-the-way-out </item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia’s economy can withstand a long war, but not a more intense one]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="俄罗斯。莫斯科。 16.02.2023学员学校班级奔向“胜利博物馆”，这是一个致力于伟大卫国战争的博物馆。" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP501.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">A</span> <small>WEEK AFTER</small> Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Antony Blinken, America&#39;s secretary of state, crowed, “The value of the ruble has plummeted; the Russian stockmarket closed as fear of capital flight rose; interest rates more than doubled; Russia&#39;s credit rating has been cut to junk status.” American authorities clearly hoped that the “massive, unprecedented consequences” they and their allies had imposed on Russia, including “severe and lasting economic costs”, would help impede its war machine.

By the admission of none other than Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s president, “The illegitimate restrictions imposed on the Russian economy in the medium term may indeed have a negative impact on it.” The question is not so much whether Russia can endure an even longer war of attrition (it can), but whether it can support the sort of intensification of the conflict Russia will probably need to transform its prospects on the battlefield. That looks almost impossible.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Russia&#39;s bureaucracy has achieved three feats over the past 14 months.

Yet this economic assault has yielded disappointing results, in part because there were always big holes in the sanctions regime and in part because Russia has found ways around some of the restrictions that did initially hem it in.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some of the showiest measures have targeted oligarchs and other cronies of Mr Putin&#39;s regime. World-Check, a data firm, reckons that 2,215 individuals with close ties to the government can no longer travel to some or all Western countries, or gain access to their possessions there, or both. Some wealthy Russians have complained about their lost social standing. A few have left Russia and renounced their citizenship.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Despite the reports of impounded superyachts, however, most oligarchs are still putting caviar on the table. Foreign governments have frozen about $100bn-worth of private Russian assets—only about a quarter of the $400bn that Russian households have abroad. The biggest imposition on many rich Russians relates to their holidays. The French Riviera is off limits; Dubai and Antalya are the main substitutes. Sanctions, perversely, may pave the way for the creation of a new generation of oligarchs. With Western firms leaving the country en masse, there are hundreds of billions of dollars&#39; worth of assets up for grabs. If the intention behind the measures was to cause discomfort among Mr Putin&#39;s inner circle, there is little sign of it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Financial sanctions, too, have had a limited effect. After Russia invaded Ukraine, ten Russian lenders were kicked out of <small>SWIFT</small> , which more than 11,000 banks around the world use for cross-border payments. Close to two-thirds of Russia&#39;s banking system can no longer process transactions in euros or dollars. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> But Western countries have not cut off Russian banks entirely, as they need to pay for the Russian oil and gas they continue to import. Gazprombank, which processes these payments, remains a member of <small>SWIFT</small> . What is more, new financial pipes are being built to replace Western ones. Average daily transactions using CIPS, China&#39;s alternative to <small>SWIFT</small> , have increased by 50% since the invasion began. This past December 16% of Russia&#39;s exports were paid for in yuan, up from almost none before the war. The narrow gap between the price at which Russian banks sell their customers yuan and the price at which they buy yuan suggests a liquid market. Some international transactions are also settled, with difficulty, in Indian rupees and Emirati dirhams.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Restrictions on exports of certain goods to Russia have also disappointed. America and its allies have banned sales to Russia of thousands of high-tech items, while many Western firms that used to operate in Russia have voluntarily pulled out. Of about 3,000 global firms with a Russian presence tracked by the <small>KSE</small> Institute at the Kyiv School of Economics, roughly half have curtailed operations there in some way. Last year the stock of foreign direct investment in Russia fell by a quarter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet Russia continues to import almost as much as it did before the invasion. New trading partners have sprung up to replace the West. China now sells twice as much to Russia as it did in 2019. “Parallel” imports—unauthorised sales from the West to Russia via a third country of everything from fizzy drinks to computer chips—have soared. In 2022 imports from the <small>EU</small> to Armenia mysteriously doubled, even as Armenian exports to Russia tripled. Serbia&#39;s exports of phones to Russia rose from $8,518 in 2021 to $37m in 2022. Shipments of washing machines from Kazakhstan to Russia rose from zero in 2021 to nearly 100,000 units last year.</p><p class="article__body-text"> These arrangements have drawbacks. Russia&#39;s economic hubs are nearer to Brussels than to Beijing. Higher transport costs mean higher prices. People also have less choice than before (one Muscovite complains about the difficulty of finding mortadella). According to a recent survey by Romir, a Russian market-research firm, two-thirds of Russians reckon the quality of the products they buy is deteriorating.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What is more, not all goods can be obtained in sufficient quantities through backchannels. Many Russian-made medications, which depend on imported raw materials, are in short supply. The car industry, meanwhile, is struggling with a shortage of imported semiconductors. Production was down 70% in January-February, compared with the same period a year before.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet even if Russia cannot make as many cars any more, it can still import them. After Lada, a Soviet stalwart, the most popular brand in Russia is now Haval, a mid-range Chinese marque. Its monthly sales have increased 331% over the past year.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Russia also seems to be getting hold of the parts it needs to keep its civilian planes airborne, somehow. Hackers have been stealing updates of aircraft software that Russian firms can no longer buy. Crashes, although frequent by Western standards, have not increased. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The impact of sanctions on Russia&#39;s exports has been bigger–but Western countries always shied away from making them too severe for fear of pushing up energy prices for their own consumers to unbearable levels. The <small>EU</small> ’s imports of Russian gas have fallen dramatically. Russia has limited capacity to divert the exports to China, since the pipeline linking the two countries is small. Shipping more by sea requires new liquefaction plants which take time to build and need sophisticated tech. Rystad Energy, a consultancy, forecasts that Russia&#39;s gas sales will dwindle to 136bn cubic metres (bcm) in 2023 from 241bcm in 2021.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Oil, however, is more fungible. In December the <small>EU</small> , which in 2021 bought more than 40% of Russia&#39;s crude exports, imposed an import ban. It also forbade its shipping firms, insurers and financiers from facilitating the sale of Russian crude to buyers in other countries unless the price per barrel was below $60. In February a similar package of sanctions came into force on Russia&#39;s refined oil, a smaller but profitable export, much of which also went to Europe before the war. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AR2Y8NU3k-k?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> But Asian buyers have been happy to absorb the oil that Europe is spurning. In March nearly 90% of Russia&#39;s total crude exports went to China and India, estimates Reid I&#39;Anson of Kpler, a data firm, up from a quarter before the war. That month Russia shipped 3.7m barrels a day (b/d) on average, more than it did in 2021. March was also a strong month for sales of refined products such as diesel. A new ecosystem of shadow traders and shippers, largely based in Hong Kong and Dubai, has emerged to help ferry the embargoed barrels to their new destinations, often with the help of Russian lenders and insurers. These new buyers, plus high commodity prices brought about in part by the war, helped push Russia&#39;s current-account surplus to a record $227bn—10% of <small>GDP</small> . </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC823.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> But it is unlikely to see another bumper year. The price of a barrel of Brent, an oil benchmark, has fallen below $85 from an average of $100 in 2022 (see chart 1). Urals, Russia&#39;s main grade, now sells at a steep discount at Russian ports—below $50 on average in January and February, according to the ministry of finance, compared with $76 on average in 2022. Russia would need a price of well over $100 a barrel to balance its budget, analysts estimate. The International Energy Agency, a watchdog, reckons Russia&#39;s oil revenues were 43% lower in March than a year earlier. Economists expect the country&#39;s current-account surplus to fall to 3-4% of <small>GDP</small> this year, in line with the average of the 2010s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Lower hydrocarbon sales mean lower government revenues. In 2022 the Russian government ran a deficit of about 3trn roubles ($37bn), or 2% of <small>GDP</small> . This year it is planning something similar, but actual spending and taxation data so far this year make that look optimistic. A deficit in the range of at least 10trn roubles, as much as 5% of <small>GDP</small> , looks likelier—high by Russian standards.</p><p class="article__body-text"> All the same, the Russian state has plenty of options to fund itself. Russia&#39;s sovereign-wealth fund still has about $150bn (about 10% of <small>GDP</small> ), even after being drained of about $30bn last year. The government could also issue more debt. Last year&#39;s bumper exports have left big Russian energy firms with lots of cash they must stash somewhere. Those firms, which are largely state-owned anyway, could also be hit with a windfall tax, as they were last year. And Russian financial institutions hold sufficient assets to cover 10trn-rouble deficits for 25 years–a huge resource the government might seek to tap in some way. Richard Connolly, an expert on the Russian economy at <small>RUSI</small> , a think-tank, says, “The government can always fund itself by taking money from big companies.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Money, in other words, will not be a severe constraint on the war effort. Demands on the budget for this purpose are in any case modest. Our best guess, based on comparing actual spending figures with what was budgeted before the war, is that Russia&#39;s assault on Ukraine is currently costing it about 5trn roubles a year, or 3% of <small>GDP</small> –less than America spent on the Korean war.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> But replacing damaged weapons and spent munitions is not simply a question of money. Russia has churned through military equipment on a vast scale. Estimates of the number of armoured vehicles destroyed during the war, for example, range between 8,000 and 16,000, according to a recent report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies ( <small>CSIS</small> ), a think-tank. Russia has also lost lots of aircraft, drones and artillery systems.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One solution is to fall back on existing stocks, although many of these are old and in poor repair. Another is to redirect weapons intended for export to the front line. Siemon Wezeman of <small>SIPRI</small> , a Swedish think-tank, reckons Russia&#39;s arms exports plummeted from $50bn in 2021 to $11bn or less last year. He points out that unusual <small>T-90</small> tanks—perhaps demonstration models, or units originally destined for Algeria—have been spotted on the battlefield in Ukraine. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Russia is also trying to make more weapons. Dmitri Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia&#39;s security council, recently said the country would produce 1,500 modern tanks in 2023. Officials have also said they want drones to be manufactured en masse in Russia. Some factories are working around the clock. The government is lending lavishly to arms manufacturers, or ordering banks to do so. In January and February production of “finished metal goods” was 20% higher than the year before, according to official statistics.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem is that, to manufacture advanced weapons, it needs access to Western-made, high-end “dual-use” components, from engines to microchips, that are hard to obtain because of Western sanctions. Desperately needed parts can always be diverted to their most urgent use. Thus in February the government temporarily stopped accepting applications for biometric passports to save microchips. High-end washing machines are also being imported in large numbers to be stripped of their chips, presumably for use in guided missiles and other military kit. Ukraine&#39;s military intelligence recently reported that every month Russia manages to make around 30 Kh-101s and 20 Kalibrs, its two main types of guided missile, presumably thanks to such ruses.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the volumes of advanced weaponry produced is nowhere near what Russia needs to replace its depleting stocks. Ukrainian and Western military officials believe that Russia has used most of its stocks of its most accurate guided missiles. Serial numbers found in the wreckage of spent missiles suggest it is now using new ones, made during the war. Insiders say the army is asking for ten times more tanks than Russia&#39;s factories can produce. A lack of software and technical equipment also seems to be preventing Russia&#39;s production of drones from taking off.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What Russia lacks in quality, however, it may partly compensate for in quantity—by gussying up Soviet-era weapons. It is modernising perhaps 90 old tanks a month by equipping them with new electronics and communication systems. It is refurbishing old missiles that are less accurate but difficult to intercept and repurposing nuclear delivery systems to launch them. It is cannibalising civilian planes to repair fighter jets.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Russia is also getting military supplies from allies. Some artillery shells appear to be arriving from China, via Belarus. Russia is also buying (ostensibly civilian) drones from its eastern neighbour, as well as artillery shells from North Korea. It reportedly also traded 60 Su-35 aircraft with Iran in exchange for several thousand kamikaze drones. In short, the quality of Russian weapons is declining, but it has found ways to avoid running out. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230422_BBP502.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin talks to workers as he visits an aviation factory in the east Siberian city of Ulan-Ude on March 14, 2023.

Many have been killed in action; many more have emigrated. In the year to December 2022 the number of employed Russians under the age of 35 fell by 1.3m, according to FinExpertiza, an auditor. Shortages of workers are common. In December the central bank said that half of firms surveyed were struggling to find enough staff. There are 2.5 vacancies for every unemployed person, making the Russian labour market twice as tight as America&#39;s. Wages are growing fast. Specialists, such as IT engineers and lawyers, are especially scarce. At a recent meeting of Russia&#39;s entrepreneurs union, the labour shortage was the main topic of conversation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The labour shortage makes life difficult for military recruiters, too. The army is now sending conscription and mobilisation notices by email, in addition to physical copies, to make it harder for people to pretend they have not seen them. Draftees are not allowed to leave the country. With enough coercion, though, Russia should have no trouble filling its ranks. The country is not about to run out of young men: before the war there were about 17m of them. But more people on the frontline means fewer people in offices and factories. And the more widespread conscription becomes in big cities like Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the greater the chance of popular unrest.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The government&#39;s third economic achievement has been to maintain living standards. Last year it spent an extra 3% of <small>GDP</small> to stimulate the economy. Aside from higher spending on the military, support is coming in the form of economic aid to civilian companies: direct handouts to firms, subsidised loans, joint investments and so on. Spending on the budget category that subsumes many of these items, “national economy”, rose by 20% in 2022, to 4.3trn roubles. Between January and mid-March it increased by another 45% compared with the same period last year. Banks are being asked to give indebted firms breathing room. In 2022 business failures fell to a seven-year low.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Last year “social” spending also rose, from 6trn to 7trn roubles (4.5% of <small>GDP</small> ). However, says Vladimir Milov, a former deputy minister of energy, the federal government accounts for only part of overall social spending. The pension fund—a nominally independent agency recently renamed the Social Fund—is also doling out cash to retirees, mothers, the disabled and more, as are regional governments. Allowances towards constituencies important to Mr Putin, such as families with more than one child, the poor and the elderly, are growing, notes Maria Snegovaya of <small>CSIS</small> . Outside Moscow, payments to the families of dead conscripts can be enough to buy a flat.</p><p class="article__body-text"> All this may explain why the war has not affected Russian living standards all that much. Consumer prices did rise by 12% last year, in large part because of a depreciation of the rouble in the spring. Average pay at medium-sized and large companies, which include many state-owned entities, rose marginally last year even after accounting for inflation. The value of people&#39;s savings has fallen only slightly, central-bank statistics suggest. Inflation fell back to 3.5% in March. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230429_FBC825.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Overall, the Russian economy has proved resilient. Real <small>GDP</small> fell by only 2-3% last year—far less than the 10-15% decline that many economists had predicted. A “current activity indicator” compiled by Goldman Sachs, a bank, which correlated closely with official <small>GDP</small> numbers before the war, shows that Russia emerged from recession about a year ago. Most forecasters believe the economy will grow this year (see chart 2).</p><p class="article__body-text"> All this suggests that Mr Putin should be able to maintain the war effort for some time to come. Expanding it, however, is another matter. Some on the right are calling for Mr Putin to spend more than a few percentage points of <small>GDP</small> on the invasion. After all, Russia has embraced total war before—including in 1942 and 1943, when it spent an astonishing 60% of its <small>GDP</small> on the military, according to “Accounting for War”, a book by Mark Harrison published in 1996.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But it is hard to see how Mr Putin could do that while maintaining economic stability and preserving living standards. The first problem would be raising money fast. Not all the sovereign-wealth fund&#39;s assets are liquid. Printing money would spur inflation, causing the rouble to lose value and eroding the living standards the government has worked so hard to preserve. Loading up banks with huge amounts of public debt overnight might have a similar effect, stirring doubts about how soundly the economy was being managed. Tax rises or a big shift in public expenditure towards defence would also eat into personal incomes. And any of these measures would undermine the air of calm, control and stability that Mr Putin is at pains to maintain. “Of course, national defence is the top priority,” he said recently, “but in resolving strategic tasks in this area, we should not repeat the mistakes of the past and should not destroy our own economy.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> It&#39;s unclear that spending vastly more money would achieve the desired results anyway. Russia&#39;s economy has become more centralised, but it is not the planned, command-and-control apparatus of the Soviet times. Converting a budgetary bazooka into weapons of a more conventional sort would thus, at best, take time. The effort would exacerbate the bottlenecks that are already constricting Russia&#39;s military output, in machinery subject to sanctions, for example, and in skilled workers. Much would depend on the continued assistance of China, the Gulf states and other countries through which Russian capital and imports flow–and they might be nervous about abetting a big Russian escalation.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Throwing the kitchen sink at Ukraine therefore looks out of the question. “Considering Russia&#39;s existing capabilities and limitations, it will likely opt for a slower-paced attritional campaign in Ukraine,” asserts the <small>CSIS</small> report.

In 1990 America accounted for 40% of the nominal <small>GDP</small> of the <small>G</small> 7, a group of the world&#39;s seven biggest advanced economies, including Japan and Germany. Today it accounts for 58%. In <small>PPP</small> terms the increase was smaller, but still significant: from 43% of the <small>G7</small> &#39;s <small>GDP</small> in 1990 to 51% now (see chart 2). So much for a declining power.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America&#39;s outperformance has translated into wealth for its people. <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/15/incomes-are-rising-in-america-especially-for-the-poorest">Income per person</a> in America was 24% higher than in western Europe in 1990 in <small>PPP</small> terms; today it is about 30% higher. It was 17% higher than in Japan in 1990; today it is 54% higher. In <small>PPP</small> terms the only countries with higher per-person income figures are small petrostates like Qatar and financial hubs such as Luxembourg. A lot of that income growth was at the top end of the scale; the ultra rich have indeed done ultra well. But most other Americans have done pretty well, too. Median wages have grown almost as much as mean wages. A trucker in Oklahoma can earn more than a doctor in Portugal. The consumption gap is even starker. Britons, some of Europe&#39;s best-off inhabitants, spent 80% as much as Americans in 1990. By 2021 that was down to 69%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Money is obviously not everything. It is often argued (and not just in Europe) that Europeans make a trade off between extra pay and a nicer way of life. Instead of clogged roads and overstuffed wardrobes, they have longer holidays and generous maternity leave. What is more, they devote a lot less of their income to health care.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At a personal level such trade-offs may make perfect sense: there is much else to life besides income and shopping. But they are hardly new. Can the long-standing cultural difference on which they are based really account for a gap that continues to grow today? What&#39;s more, America has been devoting a little more of its national treasure to helping its people. America&#39;s social spending was just 14% of <small>GDP</small> in 1990 but had risen to 18% by the end of 2019, thanks in part to more medical insurance for its poor and elderly. That hardly makes it Sweden, which has spent a quarter of its <small>GDP</small> on social programmes for decades. But the gap is narrowing, not widening.</p></div><h2> Fortunate sons</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Americans are getting richer because they are getting more productive more quickly than workers in other rich countries. That advantage comes with real costs. America&#39;s economy permits extreme volatility in individual livelihoods. Unemployment soars during downturns. Vast numbers end up chucked to the side: a combination of drugs, gun violence and dangerous driving has led to a shocking decline in average life expectancy in America. This suffering is concentrated among the country&#39;s poorest, most marginalised communities. Money could mitigate most of these problems, and outperforming America has money aplenty. But this is not what it is spent on. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230415_FBC719.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The fact that America has problems hardly sets it apart. All economies do. The striking thing about America&#39;s is that they have not noticeably slowed down its growth. Investors are gratefully aware of this. A hundred dollars invested in the <small>S&amp;P 500</small> , a stock index of America&#39;s biggest companies, in 1990 would have grown to be worth about $2,300 today. By contrast, if someone had invested the same amount at the same time in an index of the biggest rich-world stocks which excluded American equities they would now have just about $510 (see chart 3).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Past performance is, of course, no predictor of future returns. Since America became the world&#39;s largest economy in the 1890s its lead has waxed and waned. But three decades in, its current period of outperformance has gone on long enough to merit a closer look.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are two things that matter to an economy in the long term: the size of its workforce and the productivity thereof. A higher fertility rate and a more open immigration system have long given America a demographic advantage over most other wealthy countries, and that continues. America&#39;s working-age population—those between 25 and 64—rose from 127m in 1990 to 175m in 2022, an increase of 38%. Contrast that with western Europe, where the working-age population rose just 9% during that period, from 94m to 102m.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That said, a higher proportion of those Europeans actually work. America&#39;s labour-force participation rate has been <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/24/where-have-all-americas-workers-gone">falling this century</a> , largely because of men dropping out of the workforce. But this American oddity is not large enough to make up for the country&#39;s advantage in raw numbers. Even with lower participation, the past three decades have seen America&#39;s labour force grow by 30%. In Europe the number is 13%, in Japan, just 7%.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> And this growing workforce is also becoming more productive.由美国企业支持的智囊团咨询委员会发现，从 1990 年到 2022 年，美国的劳动生产率（工人每小时生产的产品）增长了 67%，而欧洲为 55%，日本为 51%。再加上美国人工作很多。美国工人平均每年工作 1,800 小时（每周工作 36 小时，假期 4 周），比欧洲多大约 200 小时，但比中国少 500 小时。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国生产率的增长部分来自于更多的投资。但是全要素生产率 ( <small>TFP</small> ) 也有所提高，它剔除了这些影响以试图显示效率的提高和新技术的采用。根据跨国比较数据库 Penn World Tables，美国的全<small>要素生产率</small>在 1990 年至 2019 年期间增长了约 20%。<small>七国集团</small>整体的平均水平还不到这一数字的一半。</p><p class="article__body-text">如何解释这种更高的生产力？对于初学者来说，确定美国最有生产力的地方是很有用的。 2019 年，美国增长研究学院院长、西北大学的罗伯特·戈登和普林斯顿大学的哈桑·赛义德将经济分为 27 个不同的行业，以找出明星。他们在蓬勃发展的信息和通信技术行业中找到了他们，并看到他们从 20 世纪 90 年代中期到 2000 年代中期最闪耀。但是制造和连接计算机的经济的快速增长只是故事的一部分。经济的其他部分忙于有效地使用新技术。在那神奇的十年里，美国企业的生产率增长翻了一番，达到每年 3% 以上，而欧洲企业的生产率则不到 2%。从那以后，美国的生产率增长回落到约 1.5% 的长期平均水平。但它仍然比大多数其他富裕国家更快，并且仍然受到技术部门的推动。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国作为技术创新者的成功根源很深；硅谷是几代人在建设中。然而，其产品被投入如此多产用途的原因更容易理解，并且在今天仍然适用。简而言之，它们是技能、大小和勇气。</p><h2>大轮子不停转动</h2><p class="article__body-text">首先，美国工人的平均水平很高。鉴于传统观点，尤其是在美国，关于学校失败的传统观点，这可能看起来很刺耳。但美国在每个学生上的教育支出比<small>经合组织</small>（主要由富裕国家组成的俱乐部）的平均成员国高出约 37%。对于大专学生，它的花费是平均水平的两倍。</p><p class="article__body-text">有充分的理由质疑其中一些支出的效率：15 岁儿童的科学和数学测试结果可能会更好。但好学生——通常是特权学生——会茁壮成长。根据哈佛大学和高丽大学的罗伯特·巴罗 (Robert Barro) 和李钟和 (Jong-Wha Lee) 编制的数据，作为劳动年龄人口的一部分，大约 34% 的美国人完成了高等教育。只有新加坡的比率更高。 Penn World Table 的人力资本指数基于受教育年限，目前韩国处于领先地位；但自 1990 年以来，美国平均在主要经济体中排名第一。</p><p class="article__body-text">在最新的<i>泰晤士高等教育</i>排行榜中，美国拥有世界 15 所顶尖大学中的 11 所。在教育许多最聪明的美国人的同时，他们长期以来一直充当着将世界上最聪明的年轻人输送到美国的渠道。他们中的一些人继续加入每年通过“可选实践培训”计划进入劳动力市场的 200,000 名外国学生的行列——即使在唐纳德·特朗普的领导下，这个数字仍然很高。 </p><figure class="g-fallback"

class="article__body-text">美国经济充分利用了受过高等教育的劳动力。公共和私营部门的研发支出——一个有用但并非绝对可靠的未来增长标志——在过去十年中已上升至<small>GDP</small>的 3.5%，远远领先于大多数其他国家。美国在国外有效的专利数量证明了美国的创新实力，这是国际认可的一个指标：美国在全球此类专利中的份额从 2004 年（有数据可用的第一年）的 19% 增加到 2021 年的 22% ，超过任何其他国家。</p><p class="article__body-text">第二种解释与美国的规模有关。一个大的单一市场总能给一个国家一个优势；技术规模带来的回报在美国放大了这种效应。欧洲试图打造一个统一的市场，但语言、行政和文化差异仍然对电子商务平台等企业构成障碍。由于印度还不够富裕，其规模还不足以提供如此规模的利益，中国是唯一可以在这方面真正与美国匹敌的国家。这有助于解释其消费科技行业的活力——至少在习近平上任之前如此。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">尺寸还有其他优势。覆盖世界第三大大陆近 40% 的面积意味着美国可以获得各种各样的地质财富——其中一些已经成为新近善于挖掘的资源。在 2000 年代的头十年，美国每天净进口超过 1000 万桶石油。但大约在同一时间，一场革命正在进行，因为能源公司完善了水力压裂和水平钻井技术，以释放从北达科他州到德克萨斯州的页岩层中的丰富矿物。天然气和石油产量猛增；美国现在通过国内生产满足其大部分能源需求。 2020年成为石油净出口国。</p><h2>来吧，上升的风</h2><p class="article__body-text">这既扩大了经济，又使其多样化，增加了新的弹性。由于天然气的繁荣是以煤炭为代价的，因此减少了温室气体的排放。尽管直到最近还没有什么值得一提的联邦气候政策，但美国的工业二氧化碳排放量比 2000 年代中期的峰值低了 18%。既然美国有意将注意力转向其幅员辽阔的其他资源——例如阳光、多风的平原和海岸——它应该会加速这一趋势。</p><p class="article__body-text">使美国人的技能和规模更加强大的是第三个因素：活力。这通常是试图解释美国成功的人们首先提到的属性。它也是定义最粗略的一个。但是有一些明显的相关性。</p><p class="article__body-text">一是机动性。美国人在机会来临时站起来走人的能力和意愿已今非昔比；但它在国际上仍然令人印象深刻。 2013 年，盖洛普的一项调查发现，在过去五年中，大约四分之一的成年美国人从国内的一个城市或地区搬到了另一个城市或地区，而在其他发达国家，这一比例为十分之一。每年约有 500 万人在各州之间流动。布鲁金斯学会 (Brookings Institution) 的人口统计学家威廉·弗雷 (William Frey) 发现，受教育程度最高的人在这些州际迁移者中所占比例过高，他们可能会前往最有生产力的工作。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国还拥有世界上最深厚、流动性最强的金融市场，为企业融资和区分赢家和输家提供了高效但有时不稳定的渠道。股票市值占<small>GDP</small>的 170% 左右；在大多数其他国家/地区，它低于 100%。对具有潜在高增长潜力的初创企业的资助尤其丰厚：世界上大约一半的风险资本流向了美国的公司。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，对开始新事物的渴望早于科技世界，并远远超出了科技世界。新冠肺炎引发的禁闭的后果前所未有地点燃了美国重塑的动力：2021 年有 540 万家新企业开业，创下年度纪录，比 2019 年增长了 53%。许多人不会成功，但创始人不会与其他地方一样受到严重伤害：<small>经合组织</small>衡量企业家个人失败成本的一项措施始终将美国和加拿大置于垫底。</p><p class="article__body-text">对于一个同时创造了斯普林菲尔德的秃鹫资本家伯恩斯先生和典型的办公室无人机迪尔伯特的国家来说，这听起来可能很奇怪，但企业管理的质量是活力的另一个来源。自 2003 年以来，伦敦<small>政治经济学院</small>的 John Van Reenen 和斯坦福大学的 Nicholas Bloom 一直试图通过他们的世界管理调查为国际管理比较提供分析严谨性。美国位居榜首。研究人员认为，激烈的竞争有助于解释美国的企业文化。老板们更愿意解雇员工（而且更容易做到：美国的员工保护法比其他大型经济体要弱得多）。市场更愿意奖励公司，以证明它们经营良好。他们的调查发现，美国的管理实力可以解释其生产力领先于其他发达国家的一半。</p><p class="article__body-text">很难将美国令人难以置信的财富与其在其他领域的失败相提并论。即使在税收和转移支付之后，它的收入分配也是<small>七国集团</small>中最不平等的。在 1990 年代和 2000 年代初扩大的贫富收入差距在过去十年的大部分时间里因劳动力市场紧张而得到稳定。最近低收入者的工资上涨使他们开始赶上中产阶级，但高收入和中等收入工人之间的差距仍然存在。</p><h2>穿过丛林</h2><p class="article__body-text">更令人不安的是其生活的严酷：今天出生的美国人的平均预期寿命为 77 岁，比其他发展水平相似的国家的同龄人短约 5 岁。对于穷人来说，获得医疗服务的机会更少，周围的暴力事件更多，赤字尤为明显。某种 Pangloss 可能会争辩说，严酷，尽管令人反感，却是美国秘诀的一部分，促使人们努力取得成功。</p><p class="article__body-text">另一种解释是，该国既不缺乏财富也不缺乏智慧来改善人们的生活，但它选择不这样做——并且为此选择付出的经济代价很少。 “经济学不是道德剧，”智库彼得森国际经济研究所的亚当波森说。 “如果我们能设计出同时解决不平等和促进增长的政策，那就太好了，但遗憾的是，只有少数政策能同时做到这两者。残酷并不能阻止经济增长。” </p><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">如果残忍没有，还有什么可能？什么情况下美国几十年的经济表现可能会走到尽头？一种可能性是其富裕世界的同行采取更多措施迎头赶上。欧洲未能产生像美国这样的大型科技公司，但其强有力的反垄断规则培育了一个更具竞争力的市场，尤其是对消费者而言，这可能仍会取得成果。日本一直在努力改变其低迷的经济模式，但还没有结束。尽管存在明显的结构性挑战，但中国决心保持快速增长。与此同时，印度的崛起必将使世界经济更加向太平洋倾斜。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">但美国也有削弱自身成功的方法。以<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/02/05/america-is-stagnating-demographically-that-is">人口统计数据</a>为例。尽管在过去 30 年中美国的劳动年龄人口增长速度超过欧洲，但生育率现在已接近欧洲水平。由于生育率较低，美国需要更多的移民来维持其人口优势。但是本土主义的上升趋势反对这一点。唐纳德·特朗普总统试图拆散美国欢迎高技能外国工人的签证计划，并开始建造一堵墙来阻止低技能移民，但没有成功。即使他未能在 2024 年再次赢得选举，他也为更多对移民的怀疑和敌意定下了基调。乔·拜登总统保留了特朗普先生的许多边境政策。在他任内，边境当局驱逐了至少 200 万非法移民。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国政治的丑陋转变也威胁到成功的其他支柱。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/09/03/american-policy-is-splitting-state-by-state-into-two-blocs">高度两极分化的州政府</a>开始危及该国庞大的统一市场，迫使企业面临新的选择。例如，得克萨斯州禁止金融公司与该州开展业务，前提是认为它们对石油行业不友好。佛罗里达州州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯 (Ron DeSantis) 是共和党总统候选人提名的可能候选人，他利用自己的办公室试图让迪士尼谦逊，以回应该公司的“觉醒议程”。加州正从另一端进攻，新法律可能会迫使石油公司限制利润。</p><p class="article__body-text">更大的政治自我破坏行为的可能性也在地平线上隐约可见。在接下来的几个月里，民主党和共和党之间的长期对峙可能导致国会无法提高联邦政府的债务上限，这将引发主权违约。这将动摇投资者对美国市场的信心。它还可能使政府的融资成本永久升高，鉴于新冠疫情期间公共债务急剧上升，这是一个很大的风险。</p><h2>末日快到了？</h2><p class="article__body-text">在贸易政策这一两党政客意见一致的领域，共识令人深感担忧。它对全球化的拥抱是美国长期强劲增长的关键背景条件，正如 1990 年代和 2000 年代不断上升的贸易与<small>GDP</small>比率所表明的那样。外国竞争促使美国公司提高运营效率；国外的机会为他们提供了更大的发展空间。</p><p class="article__body-text">不过现在， <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/12/the-destructive-new-logic-that-threatens-globalisation">全球化</a>在华盛顿<small>特区</small>是一个肮脏的词。对国家安全和产业政策的关注已经接管。以半导体为例：虽然美国很久以前就失去了作为主要制造商的地位，但它是高通和英伟达等设计世界上最先进芯片的公司的所在地。这对美国很有效，让它占据了全球半导体行业中价值最高的部分。</p><p class="article__body-text">但这已经不够了。政府已经开始投入数十亿美元将芯片制造商带到美国——实际上是试图以供应链安全的名义吸纳该行业的低价值部分。它正试图对电动汽车、风力涡轮机、氢气生产等做同样的事情，可能会花费 2 兆美元，即<small>GDP</small>的近 10% 来重塑经济。这些激进的干预措施与美国 80 年代后的立场背道而驰；他们最终可能会损失生产力和金钱。</p><p class="article__body-text">具有讽刺意味的是，大多数这些可能自我伤害的政策都源于一种衰落主义观点，这种观点至少在经济上根本不反映事实。诊断是中国正在取得进步，或者移民是一种威胁，大公司是觉醒力量的堡垒，自由贸易是一种背叛形式。他们的愚蠢更加引人注目，因为这表明他们对更大的经济前景以及美国的经济前景缺乏认识。 <span
