。美国银行分析师上个月宣布利率“正脱离 5000 年来的低点”时，听起来可能有点喘不过气来。但这确实是经济学家、投资者和任何在偿还债务时处于不舒服境地的人的感受，因为几乎每个人都预计利率将永远处于低位。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">利率将“在更长时间内保持较高水平”的信念正在全世界蔓延。 2021年欧元区出现负利率；现在德国必须支付近3%的利率才能借贷十年。英国的债券收益率几乎与美国一样高。即使是日本，其明显的永久性低利率被视为世界其他地区的先兆，也面临着债券收益率的上行压力（见图1）。人们越来越多地押注中国央行将不得不在 2024 年加息，这是自 2007 年以来的首次。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果市场是正确的，一个新时代就会开始，其后果将是深远的。家庭和公司将不得不支付更多费用才能借贷。金融体系将不得不适应痛苦的新现实。政府将发现他们必须转移更多的税收收入来支付累积债务的利息。许多投资者现在预测的长期走高的情况是一个潜在的有毒组合。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从实体经济入手。过去一年的令人惊讶的事情之一是世界经济（尤其是美国经济）面对利率上升的弹性。 10月26日消息，美国第三季度<small>GDP</small>年化增长率为4.9%。由于covid-19大流行的封锁和刺激支付，家庭积累的超额储蓄支撑了消费者支出。许多公司在利率较低时发行了长期债务，因此如今仍然享有较低的融资成本。美国公司今年的净利息支付实际上有所下降，因为他们手头现金赚取的利息增长速度快于偿债成本。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些保护性缓冲将持续一段时间。 9月份，统计人员上调了对疫情期间积累的储蓄的估计，此前这些储蓄看起来正处于耗尽的边缘。现在看来，美国家庭仍然持有约 1 万美元的多余现金，相当于个人年总收入的近 5%。更高的利率也需要时间来减缓企业的发展速度。高盛银行估计，只有 16% 的美国企业债务将在未来几年内到期。再融资将使债务总额的平均利率从今年的 4.2% 提高到 2025 年的 4.5%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，并非所有公司都能适应更高的利率。尽管经济蓬勃发展，美国规模较小的企业的债务通常比大企业更早到期，但它们仍面临压力。在该地区和欧洲，经济增长疲软，企业破产数量不断增加（见图 2）。在一些经济体中，企业更容易受到利率上升的影响：截至 2021 年底，西班牙和意大利企业债务的中位期限分别仅为 2.6 年和 2.1 年。在瑞典，公司债务占<small>GDP</small>的比例高达 155%，令人瞠目结舌，截至 3 月份的一年里，公司未偿还银行贷款的平均实际利率从 1.5% 上升至 3.9%，而且目前还会更高。 9月份企业破产数量比去年同期增加14%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果利率达到永久较高的水平，即使是长期债务最终也会开始让企业付出高昂的代价。这将是痛苦的，因为在 2010 年代，企业大量借贷：美国的非金融企业在这十年间发行了净 4.1 万亿美元的债务，同时通过股息和回购收回了净 3.2 万亿美元的股本。根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的数据，在整个发达经济体中，企业债务约占<small>GDP</small>的 93%，而 2000 年代中期这一比例还不到 80%。如果利率在较长时间内保持较高水平，这种借贷热潮可能需要停止。因此，长期去杠杆化可能会抑制 2020 年代的投资，就像低增长抑制 2010 年代的投资一样。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">家就是受伤的地方</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">家庭最终也会发现更高的利率会产生影响。在美国和一些欧洲国家，抵押贷款利率可以固定数十年，这样只要借款人不搬家，就可以免受利率上涨的影响。但房价可能会下跌，因为它们主要依赖于重新借贷的买家，因此面临更高的成本。 10月18日，数据提供商《抵押贷款新闻日报》报道称，美国30年期固定利率抵押贷款平均利率自2000年以来首次达到8%。因此，购买美国房产所需的月付款中位数抵押贷款占房产价值 90% 的房屋现在占平均收入的近 60%，高于 2021 年 7 月的 33%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">房地产市场能够维持这样的比率令人难以置信。根据国际清算银行的数据，从 2022 年初到 2023 年第二季度，12 个发达经济体的实际房价下跌了 10%。如果利率遵循市场暗示的路径，实际房价预计将再下跌 14%。到2025年底。在利率稳定在略高于当前水平的情况下，实际房价从峰谷到谷底的跌幅将达到35%。相比之下，全球金融危机导致的下降为13%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">接下来，考虑提高利率对金融部门的影响。交易员经常开玩笑说，利率会上升，直到出现问题。 2023 年春天，有件事发生了：银行。他们拥有大量政府债券，这些债券随着利率上升而贬值。十年期国债收益率从 2021 年底的 1.5% 跃升至一年后的 3.5% 左右，导致国债广泛指数的价值下跌约 10%。这给美国银行造成了超过 6000 亿美元的损失，其中最脆弱的——硅谷银行和第一共和银行——遭遇挤兑并倒闭。美联储最终以美国国债的面值而非市场价值向银行提供贷款，缓解了银行资产负债表的压力，从而避免了这场危机。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但在一个更高、更长久的世界里，危机可能会卷土重来。美联储新贷款计划下的最后一笔贷款将于三月份发放。即使延长期限，银行也可能发现自己无力支付美联储贷款的利息（与现行的短期利率类似，因此一直在稳步上升）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当利率上升时，不仅仅是国债的市值下降。任何在中长期期限内支付固定回报的贷款或多或少都会遵循相同的模式。 Erica Jiang、Gregor Matvos、Tomasz Piskorski 和 Amit Seru 等经济学家进行了一项分析，按照 3 月份的市场价格对美国银行的所有资产进行了估值，然后进行测试，看看如果它们的一半或全部资产被没有保险的储户提取了他们的储蓄。他们发现，即使在不那么灾难性的情况下，约有 200 家左右的银行（总资产达 3000 亿美元）也可能资不抵债。另两位经济学家马克·弗兰纳里 (Mark Flannery) 和索林·索雷斯库 (Sorin Sorescu) 撰写的另一篇论文得出结论：“如果所有未入账损失都充分反映在银行资产负债表中，那么大约一半的银行（持有大约一半的银行资产）将无法满足最低监管资本要求要求。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">自3月份以来，债券指数又下跌了5%。蒋女士和她的合著者重复了他们的分析。他们发现，未实现损失略有上升，但现在主要集中在较大的银行。 3 月份，这些损失为 2.2 万亿美元，其中只有约 30% 发生在被监管机构标记为“具有系统重要性”的银行。现在有 2.5万亿美元的未实现损失，其中约三分之二是在此类银行。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">金融脆弱性还有其他来源。商业地产贷款约占银行资产的十分之一，而由于利率上升和入住率下降，办公楼的价值已经暴跌。一些业主只是将钥匙交给贷方。更重要的是，近年来，大量贷款已从银行转移到其他类型的金融机构，例如养老基金和保险公司。作为大型银行，他们之前从未经历过利率上升的周期。尽管分散风险原则上是有帮助的，但这也意味着更多的公司面临潜在的损失。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最后，考虑政府的脆弱性。全球金融危机后，富裕国家的公共债务飙升至 1946 年以来的最高水平。自疫情大流行以来，相对于<small>GDP 的债务</small>规模比拿破仑战争以来的任何时候都要高（见图 3）。这些巨额债务的可持续性不仅取决于利率，还取决于这些利率与经济增长的比较。在低利率时代，人们流行这样一种观点：如果<small>GDP 的</small>增长速度快于利息的增长速度，那么政府的债务与<small>GDP 的</small>比率可能会下降，即使它重新借贷来支付利息。它甚至可以继续借入更多资金来为额外支出提供资金，同时保持债务与<small>国内生产总值的</small>比率稳定。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 10月，<small>国际货币基金组织</small>预测，尽管最近利率有所上升，但2023年至2028年期间，发达经济体的经济增长率将继续超过其政府为其债务支付的利率，平均高出1.4个百分点。原因是政府和企业一样，通过发行长期债务在一定程度上锁定了低利率。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，无论如何，债务与<small>国内生产总值的</small>比率大多会上升，因为许多政府继续存在过度赤字。美国尤其放肆借贷：据智库负责任联邦预算委员会称，剔除会计扭曲，去年美国赤字占<small>GDP</small>的7.5%。如此高的赤字通常只在战争或灾难性衰退期间才会出现。根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的预测<i>，《经济学人》</i>计算了发达经济体为保持债务稳定所需进行的财政调整。除德国和日本外，每个大型发达经济体都需要勒紧裤腰带，以阻止债务与<small>GDP</small>之比进一步上升。美国必须将其基本预算赤字（即不包括债务利息的赤字）每年削减<small>GDP</small>的 2.4%。考虑到应对人口老龄化、气候危机和不断加剧的地缘政治紧张局势所需的额外支出，这种节俭的做法尤其困难——<small>国际货币基金组织</small>估计，所有这些问题的年度支出将占富裕国家<small>GDP</small>的 7.5% 左右。国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更重要的是，在一个更高、更长期的世界里，政府和公司一样，最终必须进行再融资。目前，十年期国债收益率高于大多数富裕经济体长期增长的合理估计。这意味着可能需要更多地勒紧裤腰带来阻止债务上升。很难回避这样的结论：根据目前的增长预测，长期较高的增长将迫使各国政府陷入另一轮痛苦的预算平衡，就像欧洲在 2010 年代所经历的那样。如果金融业的动荡引发昂贵的救助，财政前景将变得更加黯淡。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">总有应对的办法</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">世界经济能否应对企业去杠杆化、房价下跌、银行动荡和财政节俭等问题？令人惊讶的是，答案或许是——如果利率上涨的原因正确的话。经济学家通常认为，从长期来看，利率是由世界储蓄意愿和投资意愿之间的平衡决定的。在其他条件相同的情况下，更多的储蓄会降低所谓的“自然”利率；更多的投资会推高它。对于2010年代的最低利率，最流行的解释是人口老龄化为退休储蓄了更多的钱，而长期增长前景平淡削弱了企业扩张的欲望——这种现象有时被称为“长期停滞”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了使利率永久改变，这种前景必须改变。其可能的原因之一是对经济更快增长的预期，这或许是由人工智能 ( <small>ai</small> ) 的最新进展推动的。从长远来看，增长和利率密切相关。当人们的收入随着时间的推移而增加时，他们的储蓄需求就会减少。公司期望更高的销售额，因此更加热衷于投资。央行必须保持较高的利率以防止经济过热。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">说对<small>人工智能的</small>乐观情绪正在推高债券收益率似乎有些牵强。但这可以解释为什么长期走高的前景并未导致股市大幅下跌。从理论上讲，较高的债券收益率应该会降低公司未来收益的价值，这对科技公司的影响最为严重，因为它们往往会承诺明天会出现堵塞。事实上，随着对<small>人工智能</small>的乐观情绪蔓延，微软和英伟达等大型科技公司的价值已经飙升。尽管债券收益率（<small>以及</small>用于贴现未来利润的利率）现在要高得多，但它们不断上涨的价值使<small>标准普尔</small>500 指数的周期性调整市盈率保持在大流行前的水平左右。美国第三季度的强劲增长并不是由异常的就业繁荣推动的；而是由非同寻常的就业繁荣推动的。事实上，劳动力市场正在降温。如果增长数字准确，那么生产率一定有所提高。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

edweubf1">图片：帕特里克·莱杰</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从生产力增长解释更高利率的角度来看，新时代可能是一个幸福的时代。随着偿债成本的上升，家庭的实际收入将增加，企业的收入将增加，金融机构的违约率将降低，政府将征收更多的税收。资本的良性竞争甚至可能带来其本身的好处。一些经济学家长期以来怀疑2010年代的低利率时代导致经济活力减弱。 “对于效率相对低下的公司来说，维持生存很容易，因此没有太多的创造性破坏，”<small>麻省理工学院</small>的克里斯汀·福布斯说。在一个以更快增长为基础的高利率世界中，将会有充足的活力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">可惜的是，利率上升还有一个更令人担忧的解释：政府债务增长如此之大，以至于吸干了世界剩余储蓄，让私营部门争夺残羹剩饭。短期来看，许多交易员将债券收益率上升归咎于大流行以来的大量债务发行以及央行大规模债券购买的取消。经济学家经常对现有债券易手的重要性嗤之以鼻，但他们确实认为未偿债务存量的规模很重要。哈佛大学的拉里·萨默斯 (Larry Summers) 和时任英格兰银行的卢卡斯·雷切尔 (Lukasz Rachel) 在 2019 年提出的一条经验法则是，从长远来看，债务与<small>GDP</small>之比增加 10 个百分点将使利率提高 0.35 个百分点，而赤字每增加一个百分点，利率就会提高类似的幅度。这意味着挥霍无度的政府造成了今天的高利率。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果政府债务是“长期走高”的罪魁祸首，那么世界经济将不得不应对利率上升，但增长却没有任何相应的刺激。那会很痛苦。彼得森国际经济研究所的莫里斯·奥布斯特费尔德表示：“你不能真正认为赤字将继续推高利率，而且还会继续不受抑制。” “必须做出一些让步，无论是更严格的财政政策还是某种债务危机。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">除了财政危机，紧张局势还能如何化解？一种可能性是，持续的高通胀可能会侵蚀政府债务的实际价值，就像过去经济危机之后的情况一样。在这种情况下，尽管名义利率可能会在较长时间内保持较高水平，但实际利率不会上升那么多。公司和政府将在高利率下生存，因为他们的现金收入将很强劲。相对于他们今天预期的高实际收益率，债券持有人将受到挤压。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一种可能性是，高利率导致世界经济陷入衰退，进而导致央行降息。根据这一论点，10 月 23 日，潘兴广场资本 (Pershing Square Capital) 的比尔·阿克曼 (Bill Ackman) 宣布，他的基金不再押注利率将持续上升，从而压低国债价值。他写道：“世界上存在太多风险，无法以目前的长期利率继续做空债券。” “经济放缓速度比最近数据显示的要快。”如果他是对的，更高的水平可能不会持续太久。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 09:59:34 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

日以色列大屠杀发生近三周后，这场攻势尚未开始。以色列对加沙的轰炸仍在继续，造成数千人死亡，并摧毁了<a href="/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war">该地区约 9% 的建筑物</a>。近乎全面的围困导致平民缺乏食物和水，医院也无法运转。</p><p class="article__body-text">不过，除了几次小规模袭击外，地面部队尚未采取行动。在以色列有史以来最大规模的动员中，36万预备役军人中的一些人已经被遣送回国。还有数万人仍在以色列南部，等待一再推迟的命令。 </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text">军官们抱怨说他们无法永远保持战备状态。一位沮丧的指挥官带着他的部队到一个建筑工地，在半完工的高层建筑上跑来跑去——表面上是一次城市战演习。他说，事实上，这是一种发泄情绪的方式。 “赶紧等待”是军队生活中亘古不变的格言；但今天的以色列情况尤其严峻。</p><p class="article__body-text">推迟的理由有很多：继续谈判以释放被哈马斯扣押的人质，哈马斯是管理加沙的激进伊斯兰组织；美国的压力是出于对地区战争的担忧；加沙境内的严峻形势；以及长期担任以色列总理的本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的长期犹豫不决。 10月25日，他证实地面进攻仍在计划中。但在大屠杀发生后的几天里，这场屠杀的规模和速度将比任何人预期的要小，哈马斯武装分子在这场屠杀中杀害了 1,400 多人，其中大多数是平民。</p><p class="article__body-text">根据以色列官员的最新统计，袭击中至少有 220 人被抓获，其中包括数十名儿童和老人，以及至少十几个国家的公民。人质已成为内塔尼亚胡政府的压力来源。俘虏家属发起了有效的公关活动，外国领导人也敦促他努力释放本国公民。</p><p class="article__body-text">以色列各地都举行了守夜活动。人质的亲属经常接受电视和广播采访。这个问题具有深刻的政治意义。遭受袭击的许多来自基布兹的人都是世俗、左倾的以色列人，他们最有可能参加全年反对内塔尼亚胡政府的抗议活动。他们觉得他的政府在 10 月 7 日就抛弃了他们，而且仍然让他们失望。来自家人的压力已经迫使政府改变计划。原本打算不顾人质安全冲入加沙，但后来宣布营救人质是“首要任务”。</p><p class="article__body-text">哈马斯一些领导人的东道国卡塔尔也感受到了压力。自大屠杀以来，它与该组织的关系一直受到密切关注。它迫切希望向西方伙伴，特别是美国表明，它可以充当对话者。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 10 月 25 日，以色列国家安全委员会主席查奇·哈内格比 (Tzachi Hanegbi) 在 X（前 Twitter）上发布了一条不同寻常的消息：“我很高兴地说，卡塔尔正在成为促进人道主义解决方案的重要一方和利益相关者。”他写了。最近几周，以色列官员一直在严厉批评卡塔尔。哈内格比先生对此表示赞扬（用英语，而不是希伯来语），这表明在释放至少部分哈马斯俘虏的协议方面取得了进展。</p><p class="article__body-text">哈马斯已经释放了少数人。 10 月 20 日，一对拥有美国和以色列双重国籍的母女被释放。三天后，它释放了两名在加沙边境基布兹尼尔奥兹被绑架的以色列老年妇女。它没有得到任何回报——这表明美国对卡塔尔的压力正在发挥作用。</p><p class="article__body-text">其中一位 85 岁的女性 Yocheved Lifshitz 在第二天的新闻发布会上讲述了她的遭遇。她说，绑架者在前往加沙的途中殴打了她。一旦进入领地，她就被带入了一个“蜘蛛网”的隧道。走了几个小时后，她来到了一个房间，里面还关押着大约两打人质。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280"

class="article__body-text">利夫什茨女士说，他们受到了体面的对待：医务人员照顾伤员，俘虏和俘虏一样吃简单的面包、奶酪和蔬菜。当她在加沙与埃及边境被移交给红十字会时，她与一名绑架者握手。她说，这是因为人质受到了“敏感性”对待。但她的丈夫仍被囚禁：她有充分的理由不与哈马斯对抗。</p><p class="article__body-text">此外，该组织对祖母表现得很人道，但这并不能减轻他们绑架祖母、把她扔到摩托车上并用棍棒殴打的愤怒。这也不能成为哈马斯在以色列城镇的恐怖行径的借口。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 10月23日，以色列军队向外国记者播放了43分钟的大屠杀原始镜头。一些是从攻击者的随身摄像机中拍摄的，其余的是从监控摄像头和手机中拍摄的。在军事基地的一个不起眼的礼堂里，放映时不允许录音：这是一部不适合公众观看的虐待狂电影。</p><p class="article__body-text">在一个令人痛心的片段中，一位父亲将他的两个年幼的儿子（他们都穿着内衣）赶到一个藏身之处。一名恐怖分子向他们扔了一枚手榴弹。父亲被杀。血迹斑斑的男孩——其中一个似乎失去了一只眼睛——被枪口带回自己的房子，杀害他们父亲的凶手向他们要水，平静地搜查冰箱并开始喝可乐。 （军方发言人无法透露这些男孩是否幸存。）</p><p class="article__body-text">暴行仍在继续。一名枪手试图斩首一名腹部中弹的泰国劳工；由于找不到刀，他用一把锄头砍断了那个人的脖子。其他图像显示被烧伤的婴儿和儿童的大脑从头颅中溢出。几名袭击者自豪地在受害者旁边摆姿势拍照。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种野蛮行径在以色列和国外引发了愤怒。哈马斯自 2007 年推翻巴勒斯坦权力机构 ( <small>PA</small> ) 以来一直控制着加沙地带，此举得到了广泛支持。但也有强烈的声音敦促谨慎行事，其中最重要的是乔·拜登。</p><p class="article__body-text">他对以色列仓促卷入一场没有明确结局的战争的担忧是有道理的。以色列安全机构希望看到<small>管理被占领西岸部分地区的巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>也重新控制加沙。但一位高级官员承认，尚未制定认真的计划。内塔尼亚胡先生甚至否认存在这样的计划。 </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text">拜登还担心战争不会留在加沙。在以色列与黎巴嫩的北部边境，每天都会发生交火。什叶派民兵兼政党真主党用反坦克导弹袭击了以色列城镇和军事哨所，以色列炮击和轰炸了黎巴嫩南部。真主党承认约有 40 名武装分子被杀（实际人数可能更高）。这是自 2006 年战争以来最持续的战斗，尽管战斗尚未升级到针锋相对的轰炸程度。</p><p class="article__body-text">叙利亚和伊拉克的民兵使用无人机袭击了美国基地，造成两打士兵受轻伤。 10 月 19 日，五角大楼表示，一艘美国驱逐舰<i>卡尼号</i><i><small>在</small></i>红海击落了从也门发射的导弹和无人机。美国认为他们的目标是以色列南部，这是<a href="/graphic-detail/2023/10/25/the-firepower-of-iran-backed-militias-in-maps">伊朗支持的也门民兵</a>组织胡塞武装卷入战争的一次引人注目的举动。</p><h2>危险的校准</h2><p class="article__body-text">所有这些升级都是小规模的，这表明伊朗希望展示其代理人的影响力，而不是让该地区陷入战争。但它们是有风险的。在以色列或黎巴嫩，一次造成大量人员死亡的袭击就足以打破平衡。为了降低这种可能性，以色列已经疏散了北部约二十几个社区，其中包括靠近黎巴嫩边境、有 2 万多人的什莫纳市。随着居民逃往更北的地方，黎巴嫩一侧的村庄也已空无一人。 </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZ_BZ-knasU?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">以色列也强化了边境：本月征召的许多预备役军人被派往北方，而不是南方。美国部署了两个航母打击群，一个部署在地中海东部，另一个部署在波斯湾。 10月21日，它表示将部署更多的爱国者防空营和<small>萨德</small>反弹道导弹连。另外还有 2000 名士兵待命，以备可能的部署。</p><p class="article__body-text">以色列的评估是，这些增援部队阻止了真主党加剧战斗。战时内阁中有关对该组织发动先发制人打击的讨论已经平息。最近，石油市场似乎也更加乐观。布伦特原油价格从哈马斯袭击前的每桶 85 美元飙升至 10 月 19 日的每桶 92 美元，现已跌至 90 美元以下。</p><p class="article__body-text"><a href="/graphic-detail/2023/10/18/a-short-history-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict">每场以色列战争</a>都是在分秒必争地进行的，国际社会的谴责声不断增加，而美国最终也获得了支持。 1973 年，尽管以色列军队正在推进，美国仍敦促停火以结束赎罪日战争。 2006年，在以色列实现其在黎巴嫩的目标之前，它实施了停火。正如一位以色列官员所说，“我们的国际合法性之窗是有限的。”</p><p class="article__body-text">加沙的恐怖场景意味着窗口已经关闭。<small>联合国</small>称该地区有 140 万人流离失所；它的避难所的拥挤程度是其容量的两倍半。 10 月 13 日，以色列要求加沙北部的全体居民向南逃亡。此后，数千名遵守该命令的人从另一条路返回。他们认为，如果没有什么地方感觉安全，最好呆在自己的家里，而不是帐篷或拥挤的避难所。</p><p class="article__body-text">在哈马斯释放所有被扣押的人质之前，以色列拒绝允许任何物资越过其边境。 10 月 21 日，第一批援助物资由 20 辆卡车组成，载有食品、水和药品，从埃及进入加沙。随后又交付了几次。这只是该地区需求的一小部分（<small>联合国</small>称每天至少需要 100 辆卡车）。家庭已经减少到每天一顿饭。人们转而饮用井里的咸水。援助人员表示，卫生条件差导致疥疮和腹泻病例增多，他们担心更严重的疾病会蔓延。</p><p class="article__body-text">自10月7日以来，没有任何燃料进入加沙。唯一的发电厂已关闭，以色列已经<a href="/graphic-detail/2023/10/20/gazans-are-rapidly-losing-access-to-the-internet">切断了正常的电力供应</a>。世界卫生组织表示，加沙 13 家医院中有 6 家已经耗尽燃料。大多数面包店都因为同样的原因而关门；仍在工作的人排队长达六个小时。以色列拒绝允许燃料运输。</p><p class="article__body-text">阿拉伯国家希望立即停火。欧盟分裂，但其最高外交官何塞普·博雷尔呼吁“人道主义暂停”，以允许更多物资进入。英国首相里希·苏纳克(Rishi Sunak)也表示支持其中之一。美国仍然向以色列提供坚定的支持，但不会无限期地这样做。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，内塔尼亚胡面临着来自极右翼基础的越来越大的压力，要求证明他正在打击哈马斯，并且不愿承认拜登或人质家属没有出手。相反，他开始利用代理人向外界通报，军队还没有做好地面战役的准备。有人认为，以色列不应冒着士兵生命危险，而应发动更具破坏性的空袭，包括使用破坏地堡的炸弹，以摧毁哈马斯的隧道网络。</p><p class="article__body-text">军队进行了反击，称其已“完全准备好”入侵。以色列媒体连续几天刊登了关于内塔尼亚胡先生和国防部长约阿夫·加兰特之间不和的丑陋但准确的头条新闻。内塔尼亚胡先生在三月份试图解雇加兰特先生，此前后者对政府削弱最高法院的计划提出了批评。在大规模的公众抗议后，他被迫撤退。从那时起，两国之间的不信任日益加深，现在正在阻碍以色列的战争规划努力。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 10 月 11 日，一个反对党领导人本尼·甘茨 (Benny Gantz) 和加迪·艾森科特 (Gadi Eisenkot)（两位前陆军参谋长）加入了战时内阁。但他们未能恢复团结。 “[军队]和情报界因未能发现和阻止哈马斯袭击而受到严重打击，”一名国防官员表示。 “但他们已经重新站起来，现在只是等待政府给出明确的指示，该怎么做。”</p><h2>普遍混乱</h2><p class="article__body-text">军队的命令仍然是摧毁哈马斯的军事能力并结束其对加沙的控制。军队和更广泛的国防机构中的一些人认为，更加渐进的地面战役会更好。但将军们被告知要为大规模进攻做好准备；他们不能改变该计划，除非内阁给他们一个不同的时间表或不同的目标。内阁也在犹豫不决。</p><p class="article__body-text">陆军参谋长赫尔齐·哈勒维将军承认军队未能阻止大屠杀。以色列内部安全部门辛贝特 (Shin Bet) 主任罗南·巴尔 (Ronen Bar) 和军事情报部门负责人阿哈龙·哈利瓦 (Aharon Haliva) 将军也是如此。预计这三人都会做出光荣的事情并在战后辞职。 Most Israelis want their prime minister to accept similar responsibility—but he has not.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Instead Mr Netanyahu spends most of his time huddling with political advisers and briefing journalists.

Arye Deri, the leader of Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party which is one of the largest in the coalition of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, also visited military units preparing for war in Gaza. A day earlier, Mr Deri had angered Israel&#39;s military chiefs when he leaked the details of a meeting with his party members in which he had said the Israel Defence Forces ( <small>IDF</small> ) were “not ready”.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Read more on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">war between Israel and Hamas.</a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Deri has no official role in government, nor does he have any significant military experience. Yet the prime minister has invited him in an unofficial capacity to some of the meetings of the war cabinet. His qualification is that he is an important political ally of Mr Netanyahu.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> War is politics by other means, and this war is increasingly politicised. While the polls show broad backing among Israelis for the ground offensive in Gaza, they also show support for Mr Netanyahu has plummeted. Some 40% of voters who supported his Likud party less than a year ago now say they would vote for someone else. Calls are growing for a national commission of enquiry to be held once the conflict has ended.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On October 25th Israeli officials said they had agreed to delay the invasion of Gaza to allow America to shore up its air defences in the region. But Mr Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from his hard-right base to prove his readiness to destroy Hamas. The prime minister&#39;s proxies have been briefing journalists that the <small>IDF</small> is not fully prepared for the ground campaign and that, instead of jeopardising the lives of Israeli soldiers with a rapid invasion, as Israel&#39;s generals suggest, even more devastating air-strikes are needed to destroy Hamas&#39;s network of tunnels. This has led to angry responses from the <small>IDF</small> that it is, in fact, ready. It has also prompted ugly—and accurate—headlines in the Israeli media about the discord in the war cabinet between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Divisions within this government are not new. In March Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant after he publicly criticised the government&#39;s plan to weaken the powers of the Supreme Court. The prime minister was forced to retreat in the face of massive public protests. But the growing distrust between the two since then is now hampering Israel&#39;s war-planning. The establishment of a “unity government” with leaders of one of the opposition parties, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot—both of whom are former <small>IDF</small> chiefs of staff and also part of the war cabinet—has failed to bring about any actual unity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Netanyahu&#39;s relationship with Israel&#39;s generals has long been tense. That tension has been heightened by their responses to Hamas&#39;s attack on October 7th. “The <small>IDF</small> and the intelligence community were severely hit by their failure to detect and prevent the Hamas attack,” says a senior defence official. “But they&#39;ve got back on their feet and are now just waiting for a clear idea from the government [about] what to do.” By contrast Israel&#39;s politicians, and its prime minister in particular, still seem to be floundering.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The army&#39;s chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, has already publicly acknowledged the failure of October 7th, as have Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet, Israel&#39;s security service, and the chief of the military intelligence branch, Major General Aharon Haliva. All are expected to resign once the war is over. The prime minister, though, has not accepted any such responsibility, beyond saying vaguely on October 25th that “only after the war” would questions be asked “of me as well”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “There are many who shoulder the blame for thinking that Hamas wouldn&#39;t dare do something like this,” says one Knesset member from Mr Netanyahu&#39;s coalition. “Obviously Bibi is more to blame than all the others but don&#39;t wait for him to say so.” Instead, when he has not been in meetings with his war cabinet or welcoming foreign leaders, Mr Netanyahu has spent most of his time in recent days huddled with his political advisers and briefing journalists. He has also assembled a shadow cabinet of former generals and security officials to second-guess Mr Gallant and the <small>IDF</small> ’s generals.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The prime minister is not the only one focused on politicking. The coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties that backs Mr Netanyahu knows it may not last long: public anger and another election could sweep them away. But they are anxious to cling on for as long as possible—and to make the most of their power. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister and leader of Jewish Power, a far-right party, has made a show of handing weapons to civilians, ostensibly to prevent further terrorist attacks. But he has been trying to stoke tensions between Israeli Jews and Arab-Israelis. For now, at least, he has had no success. (He was pointedly not included in the war cabinet.) Other coalition partners have blocked efforts to get cash to help the thousands of Israeli families uprooted by the war, because they worry the money will be diverted from funding the special interests of their own communities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All the talk is of the next stage of the fighting in Gaza, not what follows it. Israel&#39;s security establishment would prefer to see the Palestinian Authority, which was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in a bloody coup in 2007, return and take control of the area. But one senior official admits that no planning is being done on that front. For over a decade Mr Netanyahu has isolated and neglected Gaza, believing it could safely be left to fester. The attack on October 7th demonstrated how tragically that policy has failed. His politicising of the war now, and his reluctance to plan for the future, could cost Israel even more. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:00:16 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/km2iggca1c1tagbrt08k9qhrph1e4onf</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/25/israels-prime-minister-and-its-army-are-damagingly-divided </item><item><title><![CDATA[The overstretched superpower]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Biden_s%20bandwidth-c5edd27e5587ef9851fd358371ced144-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HREE DAYS</small> after Hamas fighters swarmed across the security fence of the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,400 people and kidnapping about 220 more, the <i><small>USS</small> Gerald R.

Israel is girding itself for a ground operation; violence in the West Bank is intensifying; and exchanges of missile and artillery fire between Israel and Hizbullah, a Lebanese Shia militia allied with Iran, presage a possible second front (see map). </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">On October 22nd Lloyd Austin, America&#39;s defence secretary, warned of the “prospect of a significant escalation” against American forces. Three days earlier an American warship in the Red Sea shot down cruise missiles and drones aimed at Israel by the Iranian-aligned Houthi militias in Yemen. American bases in Iraq and Syria have also been coming under attack by rockets and drones, presumably fired by other Iranian proxies. “This is the most dangerous moment since the cold war,” argues Matthew Kroenig of the Atlantic Council, a think-tank in Washington, <small>DC</small> . “If Iran and Hizbullah get involved, America may feel compelled to respond. And does China then see an opportunity to try something against Taiwan?”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> President Joe Biden is thus turning into an unlikely wartime president. He was not exaggerating when he told Americans in a recent televised address that the world was at an inflection point. When America acted to help Ukraine resist Russia&#39;s invasion many asked whether it had the wherewithal to deter a looming Chinese assault against Taiwan. The question is all the more acute now that America also seeks to defend Israel. In Mr Biden&#39;s view, helping friends is not only possible but necessary. “American leadership is what holds the world together,” he declared. “American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet academics debate whether and when the “unipolar” world, in which America bestrode the globe after the cold war, reverted to a “bipolar” one, in which America is challenged by China rather than the Soviet Union; or whether it is already a “multipolar” world. Joseph Nye, a Harvard academic, defined national power in three dimensions: military, economic and “soft power”, ie, the ability, among other things, to co-opt others to do your bidding. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">In military terms, America remains a colossus (see chart). Economically, the world is bipolar in a way it never was during the cold war, with China&#39;s economic output somewhat smaller than America&#39;s at market exchange rates, and surpassing it at purchasing-power parity (though Americans remain far richer than Chinese). Soft power is harder to measure, but it is probably fair to say the world is more multipolar, says Mr Kroenig.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That said, in the Middle East, America is still the “indispensable nation”, a concept popularised by the late Madeleine Albright, a former secretary of state. It is the only country willing and able to mediate between regional leaders and shape events. That includes securing the opening of a (still inadequate) humanitarian corridor in Gaza. “The phone in Beijing didn&#39;t ring. The phone in Moscow didn&#39;t ring. But the phone in Washington has been ringing off the hook,” notes Ivo Daalder, formerly America&#39;s representative to <small>NATO</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Set against that central role, though, is the fact that three Arab leaders—King Abdullah of Jordan, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the Egyptian president, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian one—have been frosty towards Mr Biden. He had been due to meet them in Amman on October 18th, after visiting Israel. But a day earlier a blast in the grounds of a Gaza hospital killed scores if not hundreds of Palestinians. Palestinians say the carnage was caused by an Israeli strike; Israel said it was the result of an errant Palestinian missile. Mr Biden seemed to give Israel the benefit of the doubt (and later said more firmly that it was not responsible). The Arab leaders did not. They cancelled the summit after Mr Abbas declared three days of mourning and returned home. Just then America looked like the dispensable power.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Not where he would start</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In office, Mr Biden&#39;s priority has been revitalising the American economy. He borrowed the protectionist mindset of his predecessor, Donald Trump, and added large doses of subsidies and industrial policy to promote, among other things, green technology and the manufacture of semiconductors. Gratifyingly, the American economy has outperformed that of its rich-world peers. He hoped such policies would reduce social and political polarisation. He also hoped they would fortify America in its contest with China. Describing the era as one of “competition in an age of interdependence”, Mr Biden&#39;s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, says foreign and domestic policies are more interconnected than ever, for instance in efforts to restrict China&#39;s access to advanced technology.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Abroad, Mr Biden sought to revitalise alliances that Mr Trump had either neglected or threatened to undo. He renewed the New <small>START</small> agreement with Russia, limiting long-range nuclear weapons, as part of his effort to establish “a stable, predictable relationship” with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Above all Mr Biden&#39;s foreign policy meant doing much less in the Middle East, a region that had consumed the energies of many an American president. He sought to end the “forever wars” in Iraq and Afghanistan. He promised to restore the nuclear deal with Iran, which Barack Obama had signed in 2015 and Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, to contain the danger of a nuclear Iran. He initially said Saudi Arabia should be treated as a “pariah”. He reverted to America&#39;s long-standing support for the “two-state solution”, ie, the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, though he put little effort into it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Much of this has gone awry for Mr Biden. Far from being stable and predictable, Mr Putin invaded Ukraine and information exchanges under New <small>start</small> are suspended. America&#39;s chaotic departure from Afghanistan allowed the Taliban to return to power instantly. In the Gulf, meanwhile, China took the plaudits for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, appearing to fill a vacuum left by American indifference.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Changing focus</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden flew to the Saudi city of Jeddah in July last year to make up with Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince. The president could not persuade the de facto ruler of the world&#39;s biggest oil exporter to help moderate oil prices; instead, Saudi Arabia cleaved to a production deal with Russia to keep prices high. Moreover, he set a high bar for the normalisation of relations with Israel that Mr Biden hoped to bring about: concessions on the Palestinian question; a mutual-defence agreement with America; and uranium enrichment at home to counterbalance Iran&#39;s nuclear programme. Often Team Biden fell back on benign neglect. “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,” declared Mr Sullivan—just days before Hamas&#39;s onslaught.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s allies around the world, especially in Asia, ask two seemingly contradictory questions, says Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, an American think-tank. First, will American resources and attention be diverted to the Middle East? Second, will America&#39;s resolve in one or other crisis fail? “If we allow the security of Europe to be destabilised by Russian aggression, or allow Israel to suffer a terrible terrorist attack, they will believe that we don&#39;t care about any other problem,” she argues.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s reliability as an ally comes down to both credibility and capacity. Given America&#39;s many alliances, academics have long debated the importance of credibility: does a failure to live up to obligations to one ally affect commitments to others? America&#39;s abandonment of the war in Vietnam, for instance, did not much damage its will to defend western Europe. The West went on to win the cold war.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These days the question is whether America&#39;s pell-mell departure from Afghanistan undermined American credibility and encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine. Tod Wolters, a former military commander of <small>NATO</small> forces, suggested last year that it had been one of several factors. But Mr Sullivan insists that, in fact, leaving Afghanistan “improved our strategic capacity” to respond to the invasion of Ukraine and the threat to Taiwan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for military capacity, America must supply weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan and now Israel. That raises doubts about whether its defence industries can meet their needs as well as its own. In general America sends different weapons to the three countries, but some demands overlap. For instance, 155mm artillery shells are in short supply, and America is reported to have diverted a consignment intended for Ukraine to Israel. The war in Ukraine has shown how big state-on-state conflicts consume vast quantities of munitions. War games suggest that, in a war over Taiwan, America would quickly run out of the long-range anti-ship missiles that would be most useful in repelling a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such problems can be solved with time and money, but both are in short supply because of <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/the-republican-party-no-longer-believes-america-is-the-essential-nation">America&#39;s polarisation</a> and congressional paralysis. Republicans, especially those of Mr Trump&#39;s “America First” tendency, have grown ever more sceptical about supporting Ukraine in its war. And Congress, unable to pass bills since the removal of the speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, on October 3rd, got a new one, Mike Johnson, only this week.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden hopes cross-party sympathy for Israel will unblock things. He has asked Congress for a massive $106bn in supplemental national-security spending. He seeks to pre-empt future divisive votes on Ukraine by allocating $61bn in military and economic aid to the country, to tide it through America&#39;s febrile 2024 election season. To make it more palatable, he has wrapped it in other spending that Republicans should find more appealing, including $14bn for Israel; $2bn for military-equipment transfers in the Indo-Pacific (probably to Taiwan); nearly $12bn in various measures to strengthen the processing of migrants on the southern border; and $3bn for the submarine defence-industrial base.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” declared Mr Biden. Yet Israel&#39;s war is different from Ukraine&#39;s in several respects. One concerns international perceptions. America helps Ukraine in the name of the <small>UN</small> charter, the inviolability of sovereign borders and human rights. In defending Israel, America is backing a country that breaches international law by building Jewish settlements in occupied territories, rejects statehood for Palestinians and stands accused of imposing collective punishments on Palestinians, if not committing war crimes, in its bombardment and siege of Gaza.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Middle East rules</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whereas the Western allies are almost united in defence of Ukraine, they are split on the question of Palestine. A <small>UN</small> Security Council resolution calling for “humanitarian pauses” in the fighting in Gaza was supported by France and 11 other countries, but drew an abstention by Britain (alongside Russia) and was vetoed outright by America, on the ground that it did not recognise Israel&#39;s right to defend itself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second factor is America&#39;s own role. In Europe it is acting at arm&#39;s length, sending weapons, intelligence and money to Ukraine, but not troops. In the Middle East it is deploying its own forces to protect Israel from attack by Iran and its allies. Mr Biden&#39;s embrace of Israel is sincerely felt—Mr Biden calls himself a Zionist—but is also an attempt to influence and restrain Israel. “If Biden&#39;s hugging strategy works in delivering a more calibrated Israeli response, people will see it as Biden&#39;s special flair,” says Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. “If it does not work, America is going to be seen as a warring party.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Regional dynamics add a further element. Arab states are ambiguous. Many detest Hamas, as a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood that challenges their rule, and have made peace with Israel, or have tacit relations with it. Yet when Palestinians fight, these countries are compelled to champion the Palestinian case. Having taken in successive waves of Palestinian refugees, they don&#39;t want more. Indeed, they fear Israel secretly wants to resolve its problem by pushing out more Palestinians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The crisis in Gaza, notes Mr Hokayem, has shifted attention back to Palestine after years of American efforts to ignore it, or to solve it from the “outside in”, ie, normalising relations between Israel and Arab states and only then dealing with the Palestinians themselves. Yet the endgame in Gaza is being left intentionally blank. Israel insists Hamas must not rule Gaza again; America says Israel must not occupy it again. Neither says what the alternative might be. Mr Netanyahu, moreover, has done his utmost to sabotage Palestinian statehood. After Hamas&#39;s onslaught he, and many Israelis, will be even more convinced that it poses a mortal danger.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> American officials readily admit they don&#39;t have a strategy for the “day after”. The two-state model, says Mr Hokayem, “was a preference, not a policy”. If a solution seems impossible, it is only in part because of the inherent difficulty of reconciling two nationalist imperatives, Israeli and Palestinian, on the same hallowed land. It is also “the cost of American retrenchment”, says Mr Hokayem. “It is more difficult for America to come back into the game having been outside for a long time.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China and Russia may offer no substitute for America&#39;s diplomacy, but they will be more than happy to see American discomfiture and will play up the claims of American double standards. Ahead of his visit to Washington this week, Wang Yi, China&#39;s foreign minister, described Israel&#39;s actions as “beyond the scope of self-defence” and did not mention Hamas.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The impact of the crisis may be more tangible among some “swing states”, says Richard Fontaine of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank in Washington, <small>DC</small> . These are countries that are “multi-aligned”, and for whose allegiance America, China and Russia compete ever more intensely. Saudi Arabia may demand a higher price from Israel and America if it is ever to follow its Gulf neighbours, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, in establishing formal ties with Israel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Turkey, an equivocal ally of the West&#39;s in the Ukraine crisis, could turn more hostile. Though he has tried to patch up relations with Israel, and condemned the killing of Israeli civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hosts Hamas leaders and has sharpened his denunciation of Israel&#39;s response as “amounting to genocide”. Indonesia, the world&#39;s most populous Muslim country, inevitably sympathises with Palestinians. Though India thinks of itself as non-aligned and a friend of anti-colonial movements, it has expressed solidarity with Israel, feeling sympathy for it as a fellow victim of Islamist terrorism.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> South Africa sees Israel&#39;s treatment of Palestinians as akin to apartheid. African countries, more broadly, feel America either ignores conflicts on their continent—such as the war in Sudan—or is hypocritical when it comes to human rights. They regard America not so much as indispensable as absent. Many fear Mr Biden will not keep his promise to visit Africa this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Countries of the global south have also been courted more avidly by big powers. Though critical of Russia&#39;s invasion they do not want to be trapped in a new cold war. America has been trying to woo them through such things as boosting the lending capacity of the <small>IMF</small> and World Bank, and creating a global infrastructure fund to compete with China&#39;s Belt and Road Initiative ( <small>BRI</small> ). But it has a long way to go. On the same day as Mr Biden was in Tel Aviv, 20-odd leaders were in Beijing for a <small>BRI</small> summit hosted by China&#39;s leader, Xi Jinping.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A day later, in a televised address, Mr Biden made the case for America as the world&#39;s “essential nation”. In Europe and the Indo-Pacific his administration has acted nimbly, knitting existing alliances more tightly and creating new partnerships, helped by the aggression of Russia and China. In the Middle East, though, America is more alone in its defence of Israel, and more liable to lose friends and partners than win over new ones. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.

America has sent a second carrier strike group led by the <i><small>USS</small> Eisenhower</i> to the Persian Gulf. “There&#39;s a likelihood of escalation,” said Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, on October 22nd. The chances of further attacks by Iranian proxies on American forces are growing, he continued: “We don&#39;t want to see a second or third front develop.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Fears are also growing in Lebanon that Israel could use America&#39;s cover to launch a pre-emptive strike. Israel has evacuated its towns near the border with Lebanon and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&#39;s prime minister, has cautioned that if <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah">Hizbullah</a> , an Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, enters the fighting, the consequences for Lebanon will be devastating. One reason Israel has delayed its offensive in Gaza may be to bolster its preparations for escalation on its northern front. Iran&#39;s foreign minister has said the region is like a “powder keg”.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Read more on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">war between Israel and Hamas.</a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Iran&#39;s autocratic rulers hold one of the matches that could set it alight: an “axis of resistance”, or network of violent proxies across the region. They have spent two decades building this up in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Iran preys on places where the local polity is weak, where it is easy to funnel in personnel and weapons and where no external actor can challenge it, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank based in London. Iran&#39;s ability to cause mayhem at arm&#39;s length—through Hamas, Hizbullah, Iraq&#39;s plethora of Shia militias and Yemen&#39;s Houthis—may even give it more leverage than its conventional military capabilities, which are relatively weak.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Iran&#39;s goal right now, as it has been over the past decade, is not to provoke outright war with the West and its allies but to sow uncertainty and instability. Just as it has hovered on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, so it maintains strategic ambiguity with the axis. It denies it is in charge while supplying armed groups like the Houthis with arms, giving them training and using them as fronts to conduct attacks, such as a missile strike on Saudi Aramco in 2019 which temporarily shuttered 5% of global oil production. The purpose is to intimidate while complicating the West&#39;s calculus. That strategy pleases Iran&#39;s ever-closer friend, Russia. Similarly isolated from the West, it engages in weapons trade and sanctions-busting with the Islamic republic: think of Iranian-designed Shahed-136 kamikaze drones killing Ukrainians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The present crisis shows the opportunities and problems of Iran&#39;s approach. It has long sponsored Hamas but did not appear to know in advance about its attack on Israel on October 7th, according to Western officials familiar with the matter. Yet it has sought to capitalise on Hamas&#39;s atrocities and mobilise the axis of resistance. Hizbullah and Israel have exchanged fire, with the explicit support of Iran and America, respectively. As many as 19 of Hizbullah&#39;s fighters have been killed. The Houthis, who control Yemen&#39;s capital, have launched three medium-range cruise missiles, recently acquired from Iran, and a number of drones towards Eilat, Israel&#39;s port city (they were intercepted by an American destroyer). And Iranian-backed Shia militias in Syria and Iraq have broadened the struggle by repeatedly targeting bases housing American troops with rockets and drones (America has drawn down its diplomatic presence in Iraq as a result). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">For Iran, there are some obvious benefits. The conflagration in Gaza has halted—even if only temporarily—talks on normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Any such agreement would mark a further step in the Abraham accords through which Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have since 2020 established diplomatic ties with Israel. Iran&#39;s Shia ayatollahs cannot stand the idea of being isolated as Sunni-led Muslim states and Israel co-operate more. A push to delegitimise the Abraham accords continues: at a meeting of Muslim foreign ministers in Saudi Arabia on October 18th, Iran called on Muslim countries to impose an oil embargo on Israel. The Iranian regime is backing calls to push Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza, perhaps in the hope of aggravating tensions between Israel and its oldest Arab ally.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Regional turmoil also means more cash for Iran, at least for now. Oil prices have climbed by over $5 per barrel since October 7th. America is anxious to tamp down inflation in the run-up to its election next year and has been tacitly allowing Iran to export more oil, despite formally retaining sanctions. “Those Iranian barrels are very important” to Joe Biden, says Ahmed Mehdi, a London-based oil analyst. Production has topped 3m barrels per day, its highest levels since the Trump administration imposed sanctions in 2018. Year on year, Mr Mehdi says, exports are up by over a third.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the escalating proxy war with America and its friends comes with big risks for Iran. At home officials crow that they have become “statesmen” again, with president Ebrahim Raisi—viewed by many in the West as a hardline pariah—speaking to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in recent days. Ordinary Iranians are less impressed. A regional war could prompt a new cycle of protests at home. Armita Geravand, an Iranian schoolgirl who collapsed on October 1st after a beating from the morality police, according to local activists, has been declared brain-dead—news that could revive the outrage that brought Iranian protesters into the streets in 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, detained for “improperly” wearing the mandatory veil. Iranians are exhausted by their regime&#39;s adventures abroad and reluctant to endure more suffering for Palestine. Government-organised protests have been sparsely attended. A minute&#39;s silence at a football match in Tehran for those killed in Gaza was interrupted by raucous guffaws. “Neither Gaza nor Lebanon,” protesters chanted from their windows. “We sacrifice our lives for Iran.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Iran&#39;s shadow war is a delicate game and it is not clear that the country can control its proxies. Since America&#39;s assassination of Qassem Suleimani, one of the masterminds behind the axis of resistance, three years ago, Iran&#39;s satellites have increased their autonomy. As they hurl threats of war along with their rockets, they may find it hard to step back from their rhetoric. Each has set “red lines” for intervention against Israel and the West. A failure to respond could puncture their credibility with local supporters. An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza could force their hand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The proxies must also balance their military aspirations with the interests of their host countries. According to Iranian officials, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, has told Hizbullah he has no desire to heed its calls to attack Israel from his territory. In his view, Hamas betrayed him by siding with the rebellion against him in 2011 after he gave them sanctuary. He does not want to fight for them now.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lebanon fears being another sacrificial pawn. Its Shias are the country&#39;s largest sect, but its other 17 official denominations form a majority. Tellingly, Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah&#39;s leader famed for his belligerent speeches, has shied from addressing his public from his bunker in Beirut since the fighting began. The threat of war has kiboshed Lebanon&#39;s hopes of a tourism revival. Lloyd&#39;s, an insurance firm, has signalled it could withdraw cover, and Middle East Airlines, Lebanon&#39;s national carrier, is docking some of its fleet in Turkey. America has told its citizens to leave. The Lebanese prime minister has said “the decision regarding war and peace” is out of his hands.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If Iran&#39;s proxies attack American interests, or possibly Israel, it is most likely that America retaliates against them, rather than their sponsor Iran, in the first instance. Still, that is a high-stakes gamble. And in the long run Iran&#39;s decision to mobilise the axis of resistance signals it is heading towards isolation and autocracy. Only a month ago, the regime was celebrating a prisoner exchange with America and the imminent transfer to Iran of $6bn of frozen oil revenues. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had blessed direct talks for the first time since the Trump administration withdrew from a nuclear deal. Some spoke of a new detente. Now that lies in tatters—and the chances of a catastrophic wider war, while still low, are far too high for comfort. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 21:06:40 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/e2uvhu5oscs740irbuvmuk3g5cd6aqhf</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/irans-ayatollahs-play-the-middle-easts-most-dangerous-game </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can the Palestinian Authority control Gaza if Hamas is ousted?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>S ISRAELI TROOPS</small> prepare to <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-nears-the-obstacles-get-more-daunting">invade Gaza</a> , one question keeps coming up: who should take control of it after they have rooted out Hamas—if, indeed, they are able to do so? Many, especially Israel&#39;s allies, are looking to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/11/the-palestinian-authority-is-being-eclipsed-by-radical-militants">Palestinian Authority</a> ( <small>PA</small> ), which was thrown out of Gaza by Hamas almost two years after Israel withdrew its troops and dismantled its settlements there in 2005. But the <small>PA</small> seems to be in no position to take charge of the coastal enclave. In fact there are no guarantees that by the end of this war it will even be in control of Ramallah, the de facto capital city of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-war-in-gaza-may-mark-a-watershed-for-the-palestinian-authority">West Bank</a> .</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">了解有关以色列和哈马斯之间战争的更多信息</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Born out of the Oslo Accords of 1993, the <small>PA</small> was supposed to be the basis of a future Palestinian state. But as the prospects of that state&#39;s establishment have receded, so has confidence in the <small>PA</small> , which is led by the 87-year-old Mahmoud Abbas (pictured) and is widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt and incompetent. Mr Abbas was elected to serve a four-year presidential term in 2005—and has been there ever since. “There is not really a whole lot left in the legitimacy tank of the <small>PA</small> ,” says Salam Fayad, a former prime minister of the <small>PA</small> . “Unless they really change course very rapidly, the whole thing could fall.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Partly because it has been unable to protect Palestinian civilians on the West Bank from attacks by Israeli settlers or halt the expansion of Israeli settlements, the <small>PA</small> has lost control of security in swathes of the West Bank to militant groups such as Kata&#39;ib Jenin and the Lions&#39; Den in Nablus in recent years. The slaughter of 1,400 Israelis by Hamas on October 7th, Israel&#39;s subsequent bombardment of Hamas in Gaza, and a sharp increase in attacks by settlers have all pushed it into an even more precarious position. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">In a poll in September, 53% of Palestinians said they thought an “armed struggle” against Israel was the best way to establish a state, compared with just 20% favouring negotiations. As the war in Gaza goes on, along with the flow of pictures coming out of the enclave that show civilians killed by Israel&#39;s bombing, Hamas&#39;s popularity appears to be increasing, while the <small>PA</small> ’s seems to be plummeting. When news broke of an explosion at Gaza&#39;s Ahli Arab hospital, furious crowds thronged into the streets of the West Bank. Their anger was not, however, directed at Israel, which most Palestinians believe bombed the hospital. (A more likely explanation for the blast, according to independent analysts and Western intelligence agencies, is that it was caused by a misfired rocket launched from Gaza by <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-palestinian-islamic-jihad">Islamic Jihad</a> , another Palestinian militant group.) Instead anger was directed at the <small>PA</small> . Hundreds marched on Mr Abbas&#39;s presidential compound in Ramallah. In an echo of the protests that rocked Arab countries and toppled governments in 2011, many chanted: “The people want the fall of the president.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Fatah, the Palestinian faction led by Mr Abbas that dominates the <small>PA</small> , was already riven by infighting over who would succeed him. Now it is being further torn apart over its stance on Hamas. Those close to the leader believe Fatah—and the <small>PA</small> , with which it has become synonymous—can muddle through to see the crushing of its Islamist rival, which could perhaps give it a chance to take back control of Gaza. However, many among the party&#39;s rank and file think differently. “A collapse [of Hamas] in Gaza will lead to a collapse in Fatah,” says a Fatah official in Ramallah, as he agonised over the safety of his relatives in Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even those who have little love for Hamas and its Islamist fervour are dismayed by the prospect of its being wiped out by Israel. They are urging Mr Abbas to set aside factionalism and to rally the secular Fatah movement behind Hamas in a unity government. “Both sides need each other,” says Raed al-Debiy, a Fatah official in Nablus, the West Bank&#39;s biggest city. “Hamas needs the international legitimacy of Fatah, and Fatah and the <small>PA</small> need the popularity of Hamas.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>PA</small> ’s legitimacy crisis is being intensified by a financial one. Although the <small>PA</small> has not been able to evolve into an independent Palestinian state, many Palestinians accept it simply as a source of salaries and public-sector work. Yet it seems it may not be able to provide even these. In the next few weeks the <small>PA</small> is scheduled to pay public-sector salaries, including the wages of 34,000 members of the Palestinian Security Forces. But it can afford to pay less than 50% of this month&#39;s wage bill, according to one senior <small>PA</small> official, who added that, even before the current war in Gaza, Israel was withholding customs revenues which it is obliged to hand over. This cash crunch is likely to become more acute as a result of the war because Israel has closed its borders to the thousands of West Bank Palestinians who usually work in Israel and pay income taxes to the <small>PA</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Members of <small>PA</small> ’s security forces are already accused by friends and family of being proxies for Israel&#39;s occupation of the West Bank. In many cases, the only thing that keeps them from leaving their posts is their monthly pay-cheque. The <small>PA</small> has weathered previous financial storms and paid salaries late, or been unable to pay them in full, in the past. But the latest projected pay cut is far larger. If it goes ahead, tens of thousands of young men in the <small>PA</small> ’s police and national security forces may not show up to work. Some would be ripe recruits for other armed groups in the West Bank including Hamas and Islamist Jihad, the group that may have been responsible for the hospital blast in Gaza. In any case, it is hard to see how unpopular and unpaid security forces will stand their ground if Palestinians try to sack the presidential palace. “The Palestinian public is reaching a boiling point and an explosion against the authority,” says Amjad Bashqar, a Hamas official in Nablus. “The only thing delaying it is our focus on the resistance [against Israel]”. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 17:41:10 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/7jrhu8tbt3bc2iqepkffns4q3sm7b5bs</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/can-the-palestinian-authority-control-gaza-if-hamas-is-ousted </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE want to keep links with Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>T FEELS like</small> an image from an alternate reality. Hundreds of bankers and executives will descend on Riyadh this week for the Future Investment Initiative, a flashy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/27/the-reluctant-rise-of-the-diplomat-ceo">money men</a> will try to pretend it is business as usual but the Middle East is boiling.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">阅读我们对以色列和哈马斯之间战争的所有报道</a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">war between Israel and Hamas</a> is threatening to trigger a broader conflict that draws in the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/18/the-arab-world-thinks-differently-about-this-war">Gulf states</a> , whose <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/07/the-gulf-countries-want-to-reshape-the-middle-east-in-their-image">booming economies</a> are key to global oil and gas markets. On October 20th an American destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted cruise missiles that Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen fired towards Israel. That day President Joe Biden said the goal of Hamas&#39;s attack was to prevent a peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. “I was about to sit down with the Saudis….the Saudis wanted to recognise Israel,” he said. The oil price, a barometer of regional escalation risk, has hit $92 per barrel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Gulf states had hoped this would be a year of de-escalation <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause">in the region</a> . They wanted calm to focus on ambitious plans to diversify their economies. Now the region&#39;s oldest conflict has roared back to life. For one Gulf monarchy, Qatar, which has supported Hamas, the immediate goal is self-preservation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> ), however, want to weaken Hamas, forestall a wider confrontation with Iran and somehow keep alive their vision of an autocratic but more peaceful and prosperous region. It is a delicate and dangerous balancing act.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Qatar looks vulnerable. It is both an American ally and a supporter of Hamas. Since October 7th, when Hamas militants murdered more than 1,400 people in Israel, those ties have become a source of embarrassment and nervousness. Some of Hamas&#39;s leadership lives in Doha, the Qatari capital. The gas-rich emirate donates up to $30ma month to Hamas-run Gaza. For years Qatar has told allies that its ties with Hamas were a benefit: it could be an interlocutor between those groups and the West.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For now Qatar is scrambling to show that it can still be useful to America. On October 20th Hamas freed two of the more than 200 hostages it seized during the rampage, both American-Israeli dual citizens, in a deal that Qatar helped broker. But there are also signs of denial and panic in the tiny, wealthy state. On October 14th, a Qatari diplomat contacted your correspondent to say that Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, was not in Doha but in Turkey. Hours later, Iran&#39;s foreign minister held a televised meeting with Mr Haniyeh—in Doha. Qatar&#39;s ties with Islamist groups were one reason why four Arab states imposed a <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/06/10/saudi-arabia-cuts-off-qatar">travel-and-trade embargo</a> on the tiny emirate in 2017. When the dust settles on this war, the country could come under greater American pressure to sever its links with militant groups.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>UAE</small> , which in 2020 became the first Gulf state to recognise Israel, has taken a different stance. Unlike most of its neighbours, its initial statement on the October 7th attack was one of sympathy with Israel, and its leaders made multiple condolence calls to their Israeli counterparts. They loathe political Islam, which they see as a threat, and in private are scathing in their criticism of Hamas.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hours after the explosion at Gaza&#39;s Ahli Arab hospital on October 17th, the Israeli army denied that it targeted the facility in an air strike (and the evidence, so far, seems to support its denial). The <small>UAE</small> still joined other Arab states in condemning Israel. Such statements, however, should be taken as diplomatic theatre: ties between the two countries remain solid.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi Arabia has tried to chart a middle course. Its response to the Hamas attack was to cite a list of Israel&#39;s past misdeeds and call for an immediate ceasefire—the sort of statement it always issues after flare-ups in the Holy Land. But there are also signs that its stance has shifted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On October 17th Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who led the kingdom&#39;s intelligence service from 1979 to 2001, spoke in English to an American think-tank. His words carry weight as a former mandarin and a member of the royal family. He denounced Hamas for killing civilians and suggested it was un-Islamic. He condemned Israel too, for both its “indiscriminate bombing” in Gaza this month and the crimes of its half-century occupation. He made little mention of Iran, which is Saudi Arabia&#39;s regional nemesis and one of Hamas&#39;s main backers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A day later Al Arabiya, a Saudi-owned news channel, aired a tough interview with Khaled Meshaal, the former head of Hamas. Rasha Nabil, the presenter, asked him repeatedly how Hamas could expect support from other Arab countries after it made a unilateral decision to go to war, pressed him to condemn the murder of Israeli civilians and needled him on whether Iran&#39;s help had “lived up to your expectations”. It was an interview the likes of which Hamas officials are almost never subjected to on Arabic-language channels. Mr Meshaal seemed rattled. Clips of the interview were widely shared on social media and even on Israeli television.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Three conclusions can be drawn about Saudi Arabia&#39;s intentions. First, it wants to undercut Hamas. Second, it wants to avoid a broader confrontation with Iran. Prince Turki implied that rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran was still alive. The two foes agreed in March to reopen embassies and ease their years-long feud. The Saudis are nervous that a regional war could lead to Iranian-sponsored attacks on the kingdom, like the one in 2019 that briefly disabled half of its oil production.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lastly, Saudi Arabia is not shutting the door on <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/america-israel-and-saudi-are-at-the-cusp-of-a-deal">normalisation with Israel</a> . America spent much of this year pushing for a deal that would have seen the Saudis recognise Israel; the kingdom wanted a defence pact with America in return. The Saudis had seemed content to push for token gestures toward the Palestinians—not an end to the occupation, merely to make it less painful. Now Muhammad bin Salman (pictured), the Saudi crown prince and the country&#39;s de facto ruler has called for the creation of a Palestinian state along the region&#39;s pre-1967 borders. Talks with Israel will continue, albeit more quietly than before, but the price for Israel will now be higher.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Much now depends on the nature of Israel&#39;s looming ground invasion of Gaza: as the civilian death toll rises the Gulf states will come under growing pressure at home and across the Arab world to condemn Israel and sever ties. Still one thing the Gulf leaders can all agree on: they want the war to end. The financiers gathering in Riyadh this week want to talk about billion-dollar ideas for travel, trade and tourism. None of them is likely to come to fruition if there is a risk of missiles flying overhead. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 12:12:05 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/b0b830gig5bk0sovfbhvfcf1la5k02vr</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/are-the-abraham-accords-over </item><item><title><![CDATA[Mapping the destruction in Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1ey6m750"><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span>F</span> <small>or most</small> Gazans the dull boom of an air strike is a familiar sound.

The Israeli Air Force claims to have dropped nearly 6,000 bombs on the narrow strip of land in the first week of the war—more than the yearly rate of American forces in their operation against Islamic State in 2014-17. Our analysis of satellite images suggests that in this short space of time at least 4.3% of the enclaves&#39; buildings have been destroyed.</p><p class="article__body-text"> To assess the damage caused by the strikes we analysed freely available data from Sentinel-1, a European satellite. It flies over Gaza at least three times every 12 days, and creates an image by bouncing microwaves off the Earth&#39;s surface and measuring the “echo” when they return.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By comparing images taken before the war began with the latest image from October 12th, we identified areas with dramatic changes in signal, a hallmark of damage. We verified the method&#39;s accuracy by applying it to data from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol in the spring of 2022, and comparing it with human-coded assessments. Our method is not perfect. Not all damage can be detected from above. As a result, our numbers, if anything, may be too low. </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Our analysis of Gaza revealed that significant areas of its north may have been damaged or destroyed. The city of Beit Hanoun appears to be the worst hit. Sources on the ground confirm that the Al-Sousi and Ahmed Yassin mosques—which our analysis highlighted as damaged—have been levelled. Overall, our estimates suggest that 11,000 buildings in Gaza are already damaged or destroyed.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Gaza&#39;s population is particularly vulnerable to air strikes. Around 2.2m people live in the sliver of land—40km (25 miles) long and 10km wide—that makes up the strip. All border crossings are closed. In some refugee camps as many as 400 people live in each 100-metre square. Hundreds of thousands have already been displaced. By merging our damage map with fine-grained population data, our analysis suggests at least 92,000 will have no home to return to when the fighting stops. This is about three times our number for roughly the same point of the 2021 war. </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Israel says the strikes have killed hundreds of terrorists and destroyed Hamas command centres. The Ministry of Health in Gaza reports around 3,500 Palestinian lives lost, more than in any other Israel-Gaza conflagration. With bombs still falling, and Israel expected to launch a ground attack, this number is sure to rise. <span>■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <em>Chart sources: European Commission;欧洲航天局； OpenStreetMap; UN; <i>The Economist</i></em></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 12:27:50 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8655smnr4pr1i375bdqhgov1tbqfb0oo</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/mapping-the-destruction-in-gaza </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s four unpalatable options for Gaza’s long-term future]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/014%20Briefing%20-%20Israel%20and%20Palestine-738b9e070b24d0d6aa18ecd5376d3942.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE PUBLIC</small> statements Joe Biden made during his lightning visit to Israel on October 18th did not suggest many misgivings about Israel&#39;s impending invasion of the Gaza Strip. In private, however, the American president&#39;s advisers hoped to press Israel&#39;s leaders on an urgent question: what should happen after the war?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israeli officials say they are focused on toppling Hamas from power, in retribution for the massacre it committed in southern Israel on October 7th. “Gaza will no longer be a threat for Israel,” says Eli Cohen, the foreign minister. “We will not agree that Hamas will have any power in Gaza.” Even after the risks of fighting in such a densely populated place were illustrated by a deadly blast on October 17th at Gaza&#39;s Ahli Arab hospital, which Israel blamed on an errant Palestinian rocket, Israel&#39;s stated war aims have not changed.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Four-way stop</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Israel&#39;s post-war plans remain uncertain. It has four main options, all bad ones. First is a prolonged occupation of Gaza, like the one it undertook from 1967 to 2005. Israeli troops would have to secure the enclave and, in the absence of a Palestinian government, might have to oversee basic services as well.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This might please a segment of Israel&#39;s religious right, which still fumes about the withdrawal in 2005 of all Israeli soldiers and settlers from Gaza as the abandonment of a sliver of the biblical homeland of the Jews. But no one else wants to see Gaza reoccupied, given the heavy financial burden and the likelihood of endless bad press and a steady trickle of casualties. Mr Biden warned on October 15th that a lasting occupation would be a “big mistake”. Most Israeli strategists agree.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second option is to wage a war that decapitates Hamas and then leave the territory. This is arguably the worst way forward. Some of Hamas&#39;s leaders and supporters would probably emerge to reconstitute the group. Even if they did not, some other undesirable force would take its place. The Middle East has a history of radical groups taking advantage of ungoverned spaces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The best outcome, from Israel&#39;s perspective, would be the return of the Palestinian Authority ( <small>PA</small> ), which governs parts of the West Bank in co-ordination with Israel. But that path is littered with obstacles. The first is that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, is loth to do it. “I don&#39;t think anybody can be that stupid and think he can go back to Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank,” says Ghassan al-Khatib, a former Palestinian minister.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if Mr Abbas were able to take power that way, he may not want to. Yasser Arafat, the previous president of the <small>PA</small> and longtime figurehead for Palestinian nationalism, had a fondness for Gaza; he lived there for a time after being allowed to return to Palestine in 1994. People close to Mr Abbas say that he, in contrast, views Gaza as a hostile place. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Gaza would almost certainly be hostile to Palestinian police sent to secure it. The <small>PA</small> employs around 60,000 people in its security services, which have authority in roughly a third of the West Bank (see map). It cannot control even that limited area: parts of Jenin and Nablus, cities in the northern West Bank, are so restive that the <small>PA</small> ’s forces dare not patrol them lest they be attacked. Morale is low. If Palestinian police returned to Gaza, they would be a target for the remnants of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militants. Hamas and the <small>PA</small> fought a bloody civil war in Gaza after Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006. Hamas eventually prevailed and ejected the <small>PA</small> from the strip in 2007.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nor is security the only question. After Hamas came to power, Mr Abbas told bureaucrats in Gaza to stop working. Hamas hired tens of thousands of supporters to fill the civil service instead, while the <small>PA</small> continued to pay its workers to sit at home. Keeping that bureaucracy would mean working with around 40,000 people hired for their ideological loyalty to Hamas; dismissing it would repeat the mistake of America&#39;s “de-Baathification” programme in Iraq, which threw legions of angry, unemployed men on the streets.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A fourth option would be to cobble together some sort of alternate administration, composed of local notables working closely with Israel and Egypt. Israel relied on that sort of arrangement until the 1990s, before the <small>PA</small> began to take over civil functions in the occupied territories.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There has been talk of trying to enlist Muhammad Dahlan, a former <small>PA</small> security chief who grew up in Gaza, to take the reins after Hamas. But Mr Dahlan has spent the past decade in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> ). He has fallen out with the <small>PA</small> ; in 2016 a Palestinian court convicted him of corruption. There is also bad blood between him and families in Gaza: he led the fighting against Hamas in 2007. “I think that&#39;s an illusion,” says Michael Milstein, a reserve colonel in the Israeli army and an analyst at the Moshe Dayan Centre, a think-tank in Tel Aviv. “I&#39;m not even sure he&#39;d want to come back. He&#39;d be worried people would want him dead.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The case of Mr Dahlan points to a larger problem. The Palestinians have been divided for almost two decades. The split is largely their fault: though Hamas and <small>PA</small> leaders meet every couple of years to pay lip service to reconciliation, neither party wants to compromise. But the schism has also been exacerbated by the divide-and-rule policy of Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, who thought it a useful tool to stymie the Palestinian dream of an independent state. “Netanyahu had a flawed strategy of keeping Hamas alive and kicking,” says Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Both Hamas and the <small>PA</small> rule their statelets as one-party authoritarian regimes. In 2021 Nizar Banat, a critic of Mr Abbas, was beaten to death by Palestinian police at his home in Hebron. Those who oppose Hamas in Gaza risk torture and execution. Most Palestinians choose to keep silent, shunning politics and focusing on their day-to-day struggles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most recent poll from the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research ( <small>PCPSR</small> ) found that 65% of Gazans would vote for Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, in a head-to-head presidential race against Mr Abbas (who would lose the West Bank as well). Hamas would win 44% of the vote in Gaza in a parliamentary ballot, whereas Fatah, Mr Abbas&#39;s faction, would take just 28%.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Between a rock and a crock</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At first glance this would suggest enduring support for Hamas. But such polls offer only a binary choice between militants and incompetents. Fully 80% of Palestinians want Mr Abbas to resign. Hours after the hospital explosion there were protests in cities across the West Bank, where demonstrators chanted: “The people demand the downfall of the president.” He is 87 and has no clear successor. None of his would-be replacements inspires much enthusiasm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In a hypothetical race between Mr Haniyeh and Muhammad Shtayyeh, the <small>PA</small> ’s colourless prime minister, the former would win by a 45-point margin in Gaza and 21 points in the West Bank. Again, this is less a testament to Mr Haniyeh&#39;s popularity than to Mr Shtayyeh&#39;s lack of it: a poll in 2019, after his first 100 days in office, found that 53% of Palestinians did not even know he was the prime minister.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Open-ended questions yield more telling results. When the <small>PCPSR</small> asked Palestinians to name their preferred successor to Mr Abbas, a plurality said they did not know. The second most popular answer, in both the West Bank and Gaza, was Marwan Barghouti, a member of Fatah serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison for orchestrating terrorist attacks in which Israeli civilians were killed. Several of the other top choices, such as Mr Dahlan and Khaled Meshal, a former Hamas leader, do not even live in the Palestinian territories.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Exiles, prisoners—or no one: Palestinian political life is moribund. Palestinians blame this sorry situation on Israel, arguing that the lack of meaningful peace talks has deprived the <small>PA</small> of its <i>raison d&#39;être</i> . “I think Mr Abbas will be the last Palestinian president,” says Mr Khatib. “The whole idea of the Palestinian Authority is that it&#39;s a transition towards a Palestinian state. If there&#39;s no political horizon, then the whole <small>PA</small> becomes irrelevant.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israelis contend that the <small>PA</small> has undermined itself through rampant graft. Billions of dollars in foreign aid have been siphoned off over the past three decades to buy plush villas in Jordan and to pad bank accounts in Europe. Asked to name the main problems in Palestinian society, more people cite their own government&#39;s corruption (25%) than Israel&#39;s continued occupation (19%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is blame enough to share. The result, though, is that Fatah is probably irredeemable in the eyes of most Palestinians, a liberation movement turned ossified and decadent. In recent years even some Israelis had begun to wonder if Hamas could become an interlocutor, following the same path Fatah did decades earlier, from violent militants to pliable bureaucrats.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not only had Hamas appeared focused on trying to improve Gaza&#39;s economy, some of its leaders also seemed amenable to a two-state solution. That would have been a remarkable shift for a group whose charter used to call for Israel&#39;s destruction. Last year Bassem Naim, a member of the group&#39;s political leadership in Gaza, told your correspondent that it was willing to accept “a state on 1967 borders”. Ghazi Hamad, another political official, said much the same a year earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such thoughts now seem naive. Mr Milstein was one of the few prominent Israelis who warned, well before the massacre, that Hamas&#39;s apparent pragmatism was just a ruse. His view, vindicated by awful events, is now a near-universal one in Israel. Even if Hamas were willing to take part in peace talks, an angry, grieving Israeli public would not be a willing partner: the vast majority of Israelis want to obliterate Hamas, not reward it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Two other questions will shape Gaza&#39;s future. One is what role Arab states will play. In private conversations over the past week, several Arab officials floated the idea of a foreign peacekeeping force for the enclave—but most quickly added that their country was not eager to participate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt is not popular in Gaza, both because it has joined Israel in blockading the territory and because of its prior history as Gaza&#39;s ruler from 1948 to 1967. The <small>UAE</small> would be hesitant to play a big role. “We don&#39;t act solo,” says an Emirati diplomat. The same is probably true of Saudi Arabia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel would probably veto any role for Qatar, one of the countries with the most influence in Gaza. For years the emirate has helped stabilise Gaza&#39;s economy with Israel&#39;s blessing, distributing up to $30ma month in welfare payments, salaries for civil servants and free fuel. But its support for Hamas—some of the group&#39;s leaders live there—will now make it suspect. “The whole strategy of Israel during the last decade was to trust Qatar,” says Mr Milstein. “One of the lessons we should learn from this war is that we should not give Qatar any more involvement.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although Arab states do not want to secure Gaza, they may be willing to help rebuild it. After the last big war, in 2014, donors pledged $3.5bn for <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/19/israel-turns-to-financial-weapons-as-well-as-military-ones">reconstruction</a> (though by the end of 2016 they had disbursed just 51% of that). The bill will be even bigger this time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other question is what happens to the <small>PA</small> . Half of Palestinians tell pollsters it should be dissolved. Doing so would deprive many of them of an income (the <small>PA</small> is the largest employer in the West Bank) and probably lead to more violence. But it would also raise the costs of Israel&#39;s occupation and, perhaps, force Palestine&#39;s long-term future back onto Israel&#39;s political agenda after two decades in which it was rarely discussed. “It&#39;s the only card he has left,” says a former confidant of Mr Abbas.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is no lasting solution for Gaza alone. Despite the long schism, Palestinians there still see themselves as part of a larger polity. Anyway, the strip is too small and bereft of natural resources to thrive by itself. Its economy depends on Israel&#39;s: everything from strawberry farms to furniture factories relies on exports to its wealthier neighbour. Whoever takes control, Gaza will be neither stable nor prosperous as an isolated statelet.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The only way to bring enduring quiet to Gaza is through a broader settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If the prospect of a negotiated solution evaporates completely, warns Mr Khatib, “with it, moderate leadership will vanish.” Israel can decapitate Hamas. But it is far less clear that anything better will take its place. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:09:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/u8gvh3f6d072pis8eq4lvopki1alq084</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/israels-four-unpalatable-options-for-gazas-long-term-future </item><item><title><![CDATA[As Israel’s invasion of Gaza nears, the obstacles get more daunting]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Israel%20and%20Hamas-44c74f7dccf7569cf8cf6ad96f96d437.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>OR THE</small> first time in more than 40 years, the Israel Defence Forces ( <small>IDF</small> ) have called up their entire armoured corps, thought to number more than 1,000 tanks. Fully 360,000 reservists have also been mustered, including a civil-defence force of 20,000 people. The additional manpower is intended to bolster the <small>IDF</small> ’s full-time personnel, of roughly 170,000. Although some of these troops are deployed along Israel&#39;s northern border, to ward off a potential attack from Lebanon by the militants of Hizbullah, more are massing in the south, near the Gaza Strip. Israel is poised to begin what is expected to be its biggest military operation since the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Its leaders have said they are determined to destroy Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, in retaliation for its bloodthirsty rampage across southern Israel on October 7th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As <i>The Economist</i> went to press, no assault had materialised. The most obvious reason for the delay was the brief visit to Israel on October 18th of Joe Biden, America&#39;s president. His presence was intended both to show support for Israel and to try to broker some sort of agreement to help Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As it happened, just as Mr Biden was boarding Air Force One on October 17th to head to the region, a deadly explosion racked a hospital in Gaza. The territory&#39;s health ministry said that hundreds of people had been killed. Hamas blamed bombing by the <small>IDF</small> . Israel said a rocket fired by another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, had malfunctioned and fallen on the hospital compound.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Analysis of images and video footage by independent researchers suggested that Israel&#39;s explanation was more plausible. The <small>IDF</small> also released tracking data on rocket launches and intercepted communications among Palestinians that appeared to bear out its account. Palestinian rockets are built in makeshift workshops in Gaza to Iranian designs. Mid-air malfunctions are common: the <small>IDF</small> claims that of over 7,000 rockets fired at Israel since October 7th, at least 450 have fallen within Gaza. Israel points out that the images of the explosion&#39;s aftermath show a charred car park at the centre of the hospital compound, and lots of damage to adjacent buildings, but no crater or structural devastation of the sort that would be expected from the munitions it uses in air strikes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden backed Israel&#39;s version of events. American officials cited their own infra-red satellite data and intercepts as evidence. But the tragedy nonetheless scotched his hopes of reaching a sweeping deal with Arab leaders to get aid into Gaza and at least some civilians out, despite Israel&#39;s blockade of the territory.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Timing is all</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Any agreement depends on the acquiescence of Egypt, with which Gaza has a short border and where deliveries of food and medical equipment are piling up. But the carnage at the Ahli Arab hospital caused such outrage in the Arab world that Jordan quickly cancelled a summit where Mr Biden was to meet Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt&#39;s president, and Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority ( <small>PA</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “There is no point in doing anything at this time other than stopping this war,” said Ayman Safadi, Jordan&#39;s foreign minister. In the end the best Mr Biden could do was secure an Israeli pledge not to obstruct aid deliveries and an Egyptian one to let 20 trucks a day into Gaza. He also announced that America itself would provide $100m in aid to ease the Palestinians&#39; plight.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tragedy at the hospital underlined the slow progress of Israel&#39;s effort to encourage Palestinian civilians to move to the southern part of the Gaza Strip to escape the brunt of the looming battle. The <small>IDF</small> says that only 600,000 or so of the 1.1m residents of northern Gaza have heeded its call. By delaying a wide-ranging deal on humanitarian aid or safe zones where civilians can take shelter, the explosion at Ahli Arab will have set back efforts to persuade the holdouts. As it is, more Gazans have already been killed just by <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/mapping-the-destruction-in-gaza">Israel&#39;s bombing campaign</a> since October 7th than in any previous conflict involving the territory. Inevitably, a ground assault will lead to far more deaths.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Southern Gaza has become extremely overcrowded, with no organised provision of food or shelter for arrivals from the north. Hamas has told Gazans to stay put. What is more, Israeli bombing continues in southern Gaza as well, with reports of refugees from the north being killed in air strikes. A common refrain among Gazans is that nowhere in the territory is safe, and that they might as well stay in the relative comfort of their homes. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Israeli forces along the border with Gaza, Israel" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">There are 995 more</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: EPA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another worry for Israel&#39;s generals is the risk of a war on two fronts. Iran, an ally of Hamas, was caught by surprise on October 7th, according to people familiar with the situation. But it has since urged Hizbullah, a big militant group in Lebanon, to enter the fray. Hizbullah has an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including more accurate ones than Hamas can deploy, which would severely tax Israel&#39;s missile-defence systems.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The possibility of war with Hizbullah is looking likelier by the day, say Israeli insiders. Although Hizbullah might prefer not to invite Israeli retaliation against Lebanon, which is gripped by a dire economic slump, it ultimately answers to its Iranian paymasters, not ordinary Lebanese. On October 16th Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran&#39;s foreign minister, made an ominous warning: “The possibility of pre-emptive action…is expected in the coming hours,” he told Iranian state television. The same day Israel&#39;s government issued an unprecedented order to evacuate 28 Israeli villages within 2km of the border with Lebanon. On October 17th the <small>IDF</small> killed four people attempting to cross a security fence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some ministers and defence officials have suggested that it may be better for Israel to attack Hizbullah pre-emptively, rather than wait for another surprise attack, this time from the north. Israel&#39;s war cabinet, which includes both Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and various political rivals, including former generals, seems inclined to wait while sending more troops to the border.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel may also be waiting for more American firepower to arrive in the region. A flotilla led by an aircraft-carrier is already in the eastern Mediterranean. Another is en route. These forces are intended to deter Iran, Hizbullah and other Iran-aligned militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen from entering the war, or attacking American interests in the Gulf. The American ships&#39; air-defence systems may also be able to provide Israel with additional warning of missile strikes, if not a degree of protection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another potential disruption to Israel&#39;s preparations for war is the West Bank, the other slice of Palestinian territory, with roughly 2.7m inhabitants. The 40% of it that Israel does not administer directly are in the hands of the <small>PA</small> . But Mr Abbas is weak and unpopular. After the tragedy at the Ahli Arab hospital widespread protests broke out against his government. The <small>IDF</small> ’s fear is not so much of a third front, in the form of a popular uprising against Israel, so much as chaos that requires the presence of more Israeli troops. There is also the constant threat of violence between Palestinians and the almost 700,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and the eastern part of Jerusalem.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A final reason for Israel to delay its offensive was an effort to free at least some of the Israeli hostages captured on October 7th. The <small>IDF</small> believes that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups hold 203 of them. Israeli spies have been trying to gather intelligence about where they are being held.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Discussions disrupted</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Quiet talks to secure the release of hostages had been under way. Qatar, which hosts Hamas&#39;s political leadership and has strong ties to the group, had been acting as a go-between. But those diplomatic efforts appeared to collapse on October 17th after the tragedy at the Ahli Arab hospital. Most Arab states, including those who had previously appeared somewhat sympathetic to Israel, such as the United Arab Emirates, blamed the <small>IDF</small> for the disaster, despite Israel&#39;s detailed disavowal of responsibility. That both makes it much harder for Israel to build diplomatic support for a ground war and gives it less reason to delay, now that Mr Biden has left the region.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israeli commanders, at any rate, are getting itchy feet. The <small>IDF</small> began mustering within hours of the atrocities of October 7th. Its forces have been largely in place for almost a week.“We really should get going this weekend,” says a colonel. “You can maintain this level of readiness for two weeks at the most.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The invasion, when it comes, will be hard-fought and bloody. Israel&#39;s leaders have loudly and repeatedly promised to destroy Hamas&#39;s military capabilities for good and end its 16-year rule. That means a campaign of a different order from previous incursions into Gaza, in 2009 and 2014, which aimed merely to diminish Hamas&#39;s military capacity and were followed by a gradual return to the status quo.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the Gaza Strip is a difficult place to fight, for several reasons. First, it is full of dense cities, composed of tightly packed apartment blocks. Such places will limit the invaders&#39; lines of sight and hamper their communications, with the tall buildings impeding radio signals. Civilians could be anywhere, and there will be endless places for Hamas&#39;s fighters to hide.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What is more, Hamas has built a 500km network of tunnels under Gaza—a territory only 40km long and 10km wide. The intention was in part to undercut Israel&#39;s technological advantage in seeing and striking from the air. Even the most sophisticated drones cannot provide much information about what is happening underground. Troops entering the tunnels cannot navigate by <small>GPS</small> or communicate by radio. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Forty years later, militias in Lebanon remain a threat</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Magnum/Micha Bar-Am</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In its invasion of Gaza in 2014 the <small>IDF</small> struggled to deal with such tunnels. It has since invested heavily in subterranean warfare, setting up special units for the task and constructing a simulacrum of Hamas tunnels for training. It has developed various technical means to hunt for them, including some modelled on the underground surveys conducted by the oil industry, as well as methods based on old-fashioned intelligence—looking for spots where militants&#39; mobile-phone signals suddenly disappear, for instance. Even so, finding and demolishing the tunnel network will be the work of months, if not years, and certainly not a few days.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second concern is the presence of so many Palestinian civilians. American-led assaults on cities during the Iraq war and the Iraqi-led, Western-backed capture of Mosul from Islamic State in 2016-17, were painstakingly planned and conducted with the benefit of copious intelligence. Large numbers of civilians died nonetheless—perhaps as many as 10,000 in the battle for Mosul alone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In theory, international humanitarian law, which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting those on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians—even lots of them—can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportionate “in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. In other words, Israel can legally justify the deaths of civilians as long as they are killed in the crossfire in operations that did not use disproportionate force.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whatever international law might say, however, as civilian casualties mount, so will pressure on Israel to withdraw and accept a ceasefire. Its previous invasions of Gaza, in 2009 and 2014, were quite brief. In both cases, the <small>IDF</small> remained on the ground for about 18 days. That would not be nearly enough time to achieve Israel&#39;s stated goals this time around. It took Iraqi troops nine months of house-to-house combat to subdue Mosul.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That points to perhaps the biggest challenge for Israeli forces in Gaza: not getting bogged down. America&#39;s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and Israel&#39;s war in Lebanon in 1982 (the last time all those tanks were deployed) provide cautionary tales.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的“全球反恐战争”胜利打响。 2001年9月基地组织袭击美国仅两个月后，美国领导的部队就控制了阿富汗首都喀布尔。塔利班政府已经不复存在了。基地组织遭到追捕。其领导人奥萨马·本·拉登 (Osama bin Laden) 于 2011 年被追踪到巴基斯坦并被击毙。但塔利班却与日益壮大的叛乱活动作斗争。美国在失去 2,400 多名军事人员后于 2021 年撤离。阿富汗政府几乎立即垮台，塔利班重新掌权。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊拉克战争也是不光荣的，而且更加血腥。 2003年4月，美国军队再次迅速占领首都巴格达。布什总统在<i>亚伯拉罕·林肯号</i>航空母舰的飞行甲板上昂首阔步，上面写着“任务完成”。事实上，该国即将陷入内战。美军抓获了伊拉克独裁者萨达姆·侯赛因，但很快就面临逊尼派和什叶派民兵的血腥叛乱。总共，美国失去了大约 4,500 名军人，更不用说大约 30 万伊拉克人死亡，其中大多数是平民。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> History lessons</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列自身的历史也提出了类似的警告。 In 1982, amid a series of attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( <small>plo</small> ), the nationalist umbrella group, gunmen shot and wounded Israel&#39;s ambassador in London. The Israeli government took the killing as a <i>casus belli</i> to invade Lebanon and dismantle the <small>plo</small> , even though it was attributed to militants from a rival, the Abu Nidal group. Israeli forces besieged the <small>plo</small> in west Beirut, forcing its leader, Yasser Arafat, and thousands of fighters, to sail into exile.以色列的基督教盟友巴希尔·杰马耶勒当选黎巴嫩总统。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后一切都崩溃了。杰马耶勒被炸毁。在以色列军队的注视下，他的长枪党战士通过杀害萨布拉和查蒂拉难民营中的巴勒斯坦人来进行报复。 An Israeli commission of inquiry found Ariel Sharon, Israel&#39;s defence minister, indirectly responsible.一年之内，在反战抗议的压力下，总理梅纳赫姆·贝京宣布辞职。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One effect of the Lebanese imbroglio was that the <small>plo</small> was replaced by Hizbullah, a more formidable, Shia militia, which succeeded in pushing Israel out of Lebanon in 2000. Another impact was on Palestinians within the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Their first intifada, or “shaking off”, a stone-throwing uprising that started in 1987, set the stage for the Oslo accords between Israel and the <small>plo</small> of 1993. Arafat made a triumphant return to Gaza the following year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hamas emerged as the main force of violent rejectionism and did much to destroy the Oslo accords. It forced Israel out of Gaza in 2005 and won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006. The following year it pushed out the <small>PA</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute, an American think-tank, the lessons are clear. Terrorist and insurgent groups, he argues, resort to spectacular violence to provoke an irrational response. “They know that the harm that they can do to the dominant power is limited,” he says. “They understand that the harm that the dominant power can do to itself is infinitely greater.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:07:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/k3d4pbckcfbhj4voqslfs6mokonaqm91</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-nears-the-obstacles-get-more-daunting </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Arab world thinks differently about this war]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Visit our <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">dedicated hub</a> for coverage of Israel and Hamas.</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE SCENES</small> looped on news channels all night: ambulances, bodies, an explosion lighting the night sky. Hamas blamed Israel for the blast at Gaza&#39;s al-Ahli hospital on October 17th. The Gaza health ministry said hundreds of people were killed. Israel later denied that it was carrying out air strikes in the area; the explosion, it said, was caused by a misfired rocket launched by Islamic Jihad, another militant group in <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/10/people-in-gaza-hate-the-night-all-they-can-see-are-explosions">Gaza</a> . By the time Israel issued its denial, though, details had ceased to matter. The catastrophe had sparked protests in the West Bank and Jordan, and as far away as Tunisia. That was the maelstrom into which Joe Biden flew when he arrived in Israel on October 18th for a quick visit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is hard to generalise about “the Arab world”, a collection of 450m people spread across thousands of kilometres and nearly two dozen countries. But it is safe to say that most Arabs still sympathise with the Palestinian cause. Their dispossession remains a totemic political issue across the Middle East, able to mobilise popular anger and protest like little else.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war between Israel and <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas">Hamas</a> , now in its 12th day, has been no different. Covered around the clock on television, discussed endlessly on social media, it has sparked an outpouring of support for Palestinians. Still, compared with past conflicts, like the 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, a few things look different.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One is geopolitics. Since 2020 four Arab states—Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> )—have established relations with Israel, which previously had ties with just two (Egypt and Jordan). Saudi Arabia has been in talks to do the same. That has changed the way some Arab media outlets cover the conflict.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Al Jazeera, the Qatari broadcaster, has given ample time to Hamas, which is supported by Qatar. Meanwhile, channels run by Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE</small> have tried to walk a tightrope. Though they cover scenes of devastation in Gaza, they do not book Hamas officials for interviews (Arabic-speaking Israeli Jews are frequent guests, though). There have been heated debates in newsrooms over language: where once they might have used the phrase <i>jaish al-ihtilal</i> (“occupation army”), for example, today they just refer to it as the Israeli army.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second difference is fear of a broader conflict. The 2014 war was limited to the holy land. It may not stay there this time—and that has complicated the discussion, at least in those countries close to Israel. Take Egypt. America and several Arab countries are urging it to open Rafah, the sole border crossing with Gaza not controlled by Israel, to allow civilians to escape the fighting.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But a broad swath of Egyptian society is adamant that their country should resist such pressure. “Why did you impose this war on me?” asked Ibrahim Eissa, a pro-government talk-show host, in a message directed at Hamas. “You want me to risk 100m Egyptians for your sake?” Other pundits have made similar remarks. One could dismiss them as mere mouthpieces for the regime—but their words have been widely echoed by the public.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The discourse is similar in Lebanon, which is four years into one of the worst economic crises in modern history. Many Lebanese are worried that Hizbullah, the powerful Shia militia and political party, will open a second front against Israel, thus dragging their country into another ruinous war like the one in 2006. “Don&#39;t enter us into this hell,” wrote Dima Sadek, a well-known journalist who is both deeply supportive of the Palestinians and deeply critical of Hizbullah.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That points to a third shift: the region is more polarised today. Many Syrians, in particular, are appalled by the scenes in Gaza, where Israel&#39;s siege warfare reminds them of the tactics deployed by Bashar al-Assad. But they are simultaneously loth to cheer for Hamas, a group backed by Iran, which did so much to destroy their country. And they fume at commentators across the Arab world who abhor Israeli atrocities but cheered Mr Assad&#39;s. In Lebanon, too, some people are focused on the wider politics: whatever their views of Israel, they hope Iran (and thus Hizbullah) will emerge weakened.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In off-the-record conversations over the past 12 days, some Arab officials have spoken about Hamas and Gaza in the sort of language one would expect to hear from right-wing Israelis. They harbour no sympathy for an Islamist group backed by Iran. But they dare not repeat such remarks in public.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The disconnect between palace and public helps explain why Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, received a frosty reception on his recent round of shuttle diplomacy. First it was Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, who kept Mr Blinken and his entourage waiting hours for a planned Saturday-night meeting (the prince did not receive them until the next morning).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not unusual for Prince Muhammad, a night owl with an erratic schedule, to leave guests to cool their heels. That he did it to such a high-profile visitor, though, was seen as a pointed message. Then, after landing in Cairo, Mr Blinken was subjected to an unusual public lecture by Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the Egyptian president, who lamented the plight of the Palestinians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden will not even receive that chilly welcome. He had been scheduled to fly to Jordan after Israel, where he was to meet King Abdullah; Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president; and Mr Sisi. But Mr Abbas backed out shortly after the hospital blast, and then Jordan announced that the whole summit was off. Whatever Mr Biden had hoped to say to Arab leaders, they are in no mood to hear it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet behind the public posturing lies deep unease. Since October 7th many analysts have drawn parallels with the Yom Kippur war, the last time Israel experienced such a calamitous intelligence failure. But there is also a profound contrast with that moment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 1973 Arab states were able to launch a war that seemed, to Israel, an existential threat. Historians have argued ever since about whether that was true. But it felt that way at the time—enough so that Moshe Dayan, the defence minister, is said to have mooted the use of nuclear weapons. Half a century later, Israel was dragged to war by a militant group, and the region now faces the prospect of a broader conflict waged by other non-state actors supported by non-Arab Iran.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for Arab states, they are nervous onlookers. Najib Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, was blunt about the possibility of war in Lebanon: “These decisions are not in my hands,” he told al-Jadeed, a local television network. The leaders of Egypt and Jordan fear fallout from the war will destabilise their own brittle regimes. Gulf states are nervous about antagonising Iran, lest its proxies lash out at Riyadh or Abu Dhabi. This is not an existential moment for Israel—but some Arab rulers fear it might be for them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:18:01 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/f91l15fjgd7ptb5652b934gph5sid6vs</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/18/the-arab-world-thinks-differently-about-this-war</item></channel></rss>
