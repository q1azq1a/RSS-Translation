class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在过去的六个月里，每个工作日都有<span>一群</span><small>群</small>美丽的人聚集在好莱坞电影制片厂外，高呼口号，在阳光下游行。美国的编剧和演员引人注目，部分原因是担心人工智能（ <small>AI</small> ）很快就会开始编写剧本甚至扮演角色。 “你去找工作，他们会对你<i>进行扫描</i>，”一位背景女演员说道，她担心自己的脸会在人群场景中一遍又一遍地出现。另一位人士表示，这项技术“令人作呕”，他认为它的使用“侵犯了你自己和你的职业生涯”。 11 月 8 日，协议参与者达成了结束罢工的协议，其中包括针对人为竞争对手的保护措施。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 5000 英里之外，经常可以看到另一群充满活力的人群在谈论<small>人工智能</small>，通常是在天气阴沉但精神振奋的情况下。在伦敦东部一个专门建造的体育场外，各个年龄段的人们（其中一些穿着奇装异服）每周七次聚集在一起观看<small>ABBA</small> Voyage，在这场表演中，一个七十多岁的流行乐队通过虚拟化身演奏了长达 90 分钟的充满活力的表演。在<small>人工智能</small>的帮助下生成。该节目于 2022 年推出，第一年就吸引了 100 万人次观看，大多数夜晚仍然几乎售空，据报道每周收入为 20 万美元，而<small>ABBA</small>的四位成员也都在奋力拼搏。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>人工智能</small>是否会像好莱坞抗议的演员和作家所担心的那样，让人才变得匮乏，还是像<small>ABBA</small>所发现的那样，进一步丰富人才？明星们紧张的原因很容易理解。多年来，技术已经自动化取代了娱乐业的许多日常工作，但商业核心的创造性工作却受到了保护。不再。生成式<small>人工智能</small>正在吸纳受版权保护的作品，并制作出各种各样的重新混合的文学、音乐和视频，在质量上日益与人类竞争，并且在数量上已经远远超过了人类。在<small>人工智能</small>生成内容无限的世界里，成为明星还有可能吗？</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">人才们正在动员工会、律师和政客来保护自己。好莱坞的编剧们在九月结束了为期五个月的罢工，并赢得了制片厂的承诺，在电影和<small>电视</small>节目中雇用最低数量的人类编剧。工作室保留使用<small>人工智能</small>生成或润色剧本的权利，但<small>人工智能</small>不会被视为作者，因此人类作家的版税不会被稀释。就作家而言，他们保留在自己的作品中使用<small>人工智能的</small>权利。 （尽管他们不喜欢它，但许多人认为<small>人工智能是</small>“他们曾经拥有过的最好的写作伙伴”，一位好莱坞经纪人承认。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">截至<i>《经济学人》</i>付印时，演员们与制片厂和流媒体服务的交易细节尚未公布，但他们的工会美国演员工会表示，其中包括“前所未有的同意和赔偿条款，将保护成员免受威胁”的<small>人工智能</small>”。这可能意味着，如果演员的肖像或声音要通过数字方式复活，他们至少会收到通知并获得报酬。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">我起诉，我起诉，我起诉，我起诉，我起诉</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">明星们的第二道防线是合法的。包括约翰·格里沙姆（John Grisham，《公司》和其他几十部惊悚小说的作者）和乔治·RR·马丁（George RR Martin，《权力的游戏》的作者）在内的一群作者对 Open <small>AI</small> （Chat <small>GPT</small>背后的微软支持公司）提起集体诉讼，辩称它未经许可或付款就摄取了他们的作品。包括全球最大唱片公司环球音乐集团在内的另一方投诉称，亚马逊和谷歌支持的<small>人工智能</small>公司 Anthropic 对歌词做了类似的事情。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">科技公司认为，在受版权保护的作品上“训练”<small>人工智能</small>模型相当于合理使用。用埃默里大学马修·萨格的话说，<small>人工智能</small>并不是“像修道院里的抄写员”那样抄书，而是像学生一样从中学习。训练数据，无论是小说还是歌曲，通常在模型的输出中发挥的作用很小，几乎无法追踪。但不总是。 “如果你说，‘按照丹·布朗（《达芬奇密码》）的风格写作，那当然会借鉴丹·布朗的书，”代表作家的作家协会主席玛丽·拉森伯格表示。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着法院采取行动，政府也介入其中。 10 月 30 日，美国总统乔·拜登发布行政命令，制定<small>人工智能</small>发展的基本规则。<small>美国</small>版权局正在对<small>人工智能</small>进行调查，调查将于本月晚些时候结束评论。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一位音乐行业内部人士警告说，政府可能会竞相创造最“宽松”的监管环境，以吸引<small>人工智能</small>公司。其他人则以过去的技术驱动颠覆浪潮为例，认为有妥协的空间。当音乐流媒体出现时，“我们变得非常防御，而且只是防御，”另一位唱片公司高级管理人员承认。唱片公司花了十年时间才意识到这项技术对商业有利，并与流媒体平台达成了协议。他预测，与<small>人工智能</small>公司的谈判将花费不到一半的时间。 “这是需要共存的。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当法律确定后，技术上谁会赢谁会输？从表面上看，最大牌的明星似乎最脆弱。<small>人工智能</small>帮助普通人缩小与最有天赋的人的差距。不那么光鲜亮丽的行业已经见证了这一点。 4 月份，斯坦福大学的 Erik Brynjolfsson 等人发表的一份工作论文发现，新手客户支持代理在使用聊天机器人后，工作效率提高了 35%，而经验丰富的代理却几乎没有受益。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">演艺界也发生了类似的事情。甚至在<small>人工智能</small>出现之前，自动调音等工具就可以帮助普通人听起来更像他们的偶像。下一代技术有望使这些功能更加强大。 TikTok 的母公司字节跳动正在试用一款名为 Ripple 的应用程序，该应用程序可以将用户在手机中唱的任何旋律转化为优美的歌曲。 Boomy 是一家美国初创公司，让业余作曲家只需点击几下即可生成原创音乐，并将其上传到 Spotify 等流媒体平台上以赚取版税。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">借助 Vanity <small>AI</small>等工具的数字化改造，古板的演员可以与华丽的演员竞争，这些工具被用于《怪奇物语》和《行尸走肉》等制作中，根据需要让演员看起来更漂亮或更可怕。迟钝的作家可以从 Sudowrite 等应用程序中获得灵感，它会提出新的想法和编辑。它简洁地将自己定位为“你一直想要的不带评判性、随时可以再读一份草稿、即使在凌晨 3 点也不会耗尽想法<small>的人工智能</small>写作伙伴”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AI</small>制作的好作品并不多，更不用说耀眼到足以与天赋树顶端的明星竞争了。但它已经开始通过巨大的规模产生影响。 Boomy 声称已经生成了近 1800 万首歌曲（相比之下，Spotify 的整个目录略多于 1 亿首）。 Spotify 现在每天都会添加超过 100,000 首新曲目，其中许多是<small>人工智能</small>制作的。环球音乐总裁卢西恩·格兰奇爵士警告说，随着流媒体平台充斥着业余曲目，真正的音乐可能会淹没在“噪音的海洋”中。专业艺术家的聆听份额确实在下降。 2017 年，与唱片公司签约的艺术家占 Spotify 流媒体播放量的 87%。去年他们的份额仅为 75%。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>人工智能</small>很难做出真正的热门音乐，但它擅长制作人们在工作或睡觉时播放的背景音乐。这些曲目的播放时间很长，因此在流媒体使用的付费模式下可以获得丰厚的回报。一些业内人士怀疑，流媒体平台欢迎业余艺术家的崛起，而业余艺术家的议价能力不如大唱片公司。另一位唱片公司高管表示，流媒体可能会促使听众关注这些内容的想法“绝对令人担忧”。他认为唯一阻止他们的是惹恼听众的风险。主播们反驳说，宣传不良音乐根本不符合他们的利益。今年早些时候，Spotify 清除了许多<small>人工智能</small>制作的歌曲，据说正在重新调整其规则，以降低低质量壁纸音乐的利润； Deezer 和 Tidal 这两个规模较小的竞争对手也采取了类似的措施。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">出版界也有类似的抱怨。通过<small>人工智能</small>制作整本书是如此快速和容易，以至于今年 9 月，亚马逊禁止作者每天在其 Kindle 平台上自行出版超过三本电子书，并要求出版商明确标记机器人作家的书籍。大多数<small>人工智能</small>文本都充满了陈词滥调和胡言乱语（一位代理人讽刺道，这使得它们在管理领域具有竞争力）。但有些人通过欺骗手段夺走了人类作家的销量：例如，作家协会发现<small>人工智能</small>制作的传记在真实的回忆录出版之前就出现了。 “点击农场”也被用来操纵亚马逊的排名。该协会表示，今年夏天，Kindle 上排名前 100 的年轻成人浪漫小说中有 40 本是<small>人工智能</small>编写的。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">胜利者成就了一切</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，这些大牌明星并没有沉没在<small>人工智能</small>娱乐的海洋中，反而似乎比以往任何时候都更加活跃。当唱片公司对机器人作曲家感到担忧之际，泰勒·斯威夫特 (Taylor Swift) 的巡回演唱会正在进行中，这可能是历史上收入最高的巡回演唱会，预计销售额将达到 14 亿美元或更多（之前的巡回演唱会从未突破过 10 亿美元）。配套电影的票房额外增加了 2.3 亿美元。据<i>商业杂志《出版商周刊》报道</i>，浪漫青年小说作家科琳·胡佛（Colleen Hoover）去年击败机器人作家，在美国畅销书排行榜前 25 名中占据八席，销量达 1400 万册。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">互联网时代的悖论之一是，随着 YouTube 和 TikTok 等平台上在线内容的爆炸式增长，粉丝们前所未有地涌向最盛大的活动。这是成为业余创作者的好时机，更是成为超级巨星的更好时机。 Spotify 的数据显示，2017 年至 2022 年间，随着该平台充斥着数千万首业余曲目，每年版税至少 1000 美元的艺术家数量增加了 155%。与此同时，年收入 500 万美元或以上的人数增加了 165%，少数年收入 1000 万美元或以上的头条人物增加了 425%（参见上一页的图表 1）。表现最差的是中大型艺术家，他们面临着来自娱乐长尾的更多竞争，但却无法跻身顶级精英群体。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">类似的模式在娱乐界随处可见。更好、更便宜的技术使电影制作民主化。 21 世纪的前 20 年间，美国每年上映的电影数量增加了一倍以上，但大片的观众份额却在增加，而不是减少。 2019 年（疫情爆发前的最后一年），美国五部大片占据了国内票房的四分之一，几乎是 2000 年在不太拥挤的市场中所占份额的两倍（见图 2）。与此同时，数据公司尼尔森的数据显示，尽管每年有 200 万多部自行出版的书籍在过去十年中占据英国图书销量的 2% 至 3%，但十大畅销书作家仍然稳定地占据着 2% 至 3% 的份额。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">把你所有的喜欢都放在我身上</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">前媒体高管道格·夏皮罗 (Doug Shapiro) 表示：“在内容无限的世界中，热门作品将持续存在。”令人眼花缭乱的品种让消费者难以选择，因此他们更多地依赖推荐，无论是朋友推荐还是算法推荐。作者协会的拉森伯格女士表示，人们不是浏览，而是寻找他们已经听说过的东西。 “知名作家正在出售。而其他人的日子则要艰难得多。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>人工智能</small>还为超级明星的崇拜者创造成为超级粉丝的机会，帮助他们更加闪耀。一位行业高管表示，音乐表演的追随者过去主要通过“唱片、 <small>T</small>恤和混音带”来表达自己。现在互联网提供“类固醇混合磁带”。粉丝可以在社交媒体上与偶像对唱或随着他们的音乐跳舞。 《堡垒之夜》等游戏提供了互动体验的场所：2021 年，爱莉安娜·格兰德 (Ariana Grande) 在该平台上举办了一场音乐会与游戏的混合活动，吸引了 2700 万参与者。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>人工智能</small>驱动的技术有望让最大牌的明星出现在更多的地方，让更多的粉丝满意。瑞典娱乐公司 Pophouse 的负责人 Per Sundin 表示， <small>《ABBA</small> Voyage》的制片人正在商谈将该节目带到北美、东南亚和澳大利亚的城市。Pophouse 是瑞典娱乐公司，也是该公司最大的投资者。他说，其他艺术家也一直在联系，希望通过类似的展览“巩固和提升他们的遗产”。 “我们现在有了一个经过验证的模板。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">明星不需要像<small>ABBA</small>一样建造自己的竞技场来利用<small>人工智能</small>同时出现在更多的地方。 Spotify 正在与 Open <small>AI</small>合作，将播客翻译成不同的语言，让广播公司能够以自己的声音在更多市场上被听到。 HeyGen 等其他公司提供视频配音服务，利用<small>人工智能</small>改变演员嘴唇的动作以匹配他们所说的内容。 HeyGen 最近制作了一段病毒视频，视频中斯威夫特女士似乎能说一口流利的中文。此类平台还可以通过其他方式调整内容，例如为更广泛的受众淡化粗暴的语言。这样的技术将使明星能够吸引更多观众，但也给专门从事配音的低层演员带来了问题。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">明星们也利用<small>人工智能</small>进行时间​​旅行。约翰·列侬 (John Lennon) 于 11 月 2 日凭借《Now and Then》重新进入排行榜，他的旧录音已通过<small>人工智能</small>抢救出来。 （“我希望有人能在我死后对我所有的垃圾小样进行这样的操作——让它们成为热门歌曲，”他已故的披头士成员乔治·哈里森在谈到早期复兴列侬作品的尝试时说道。） 詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯（James Earl Jones） 92 岁的达斯·维德 (Darth Vader) 在大约 50 年前首次配音，他已向迪士尼出售了人工复制其沙哑语气的权利。去年，虚拟达斯出现在迪士尼的《欧比旺·克诺比》中。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些艺术家正在尝试更广泛地许可他们的声音或图像。四月，加拿大歌手格莱姆斯邀请业余作曲家克隆她的声音以用于他们的歌曲，前提是他们与她分享版税。 9 月，Meta 推出了 28 个由名人扮演的聊天机器人角色。史努比狗狗 (Snoop Dogg)、帕丽斯·希尔顿 (Paris Hilton) 和查理·达梅里奥 (Charlie D&#39;Amelio) 都是被机器人改造的<small>二线</small>明星之一，据报道其中一人在两年内获得了 500 万美元的报酬。 Meta 的老板马克·扎克伯格 (Mark Zuckerberg) 邀请明星“打造一个<small>人工智能</small>版本的自己……帮助人们满足与你互动的愿望以及建立社区的愿望。” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px"

美元的“提示”，让聊天机器人呈现从汤姆·克鲁斯到约瑟夫·斯大林等名人的个性，但这些名人似乎并未给予他们的许可。它在包括格里沙姆先生在内的一组作者的法律诉讼中被点名，它也模仿了格里沙姆先生。 （Socialdraft 否认有不当行为。其首席执行官安东尼奥·埃文斯 (Antonio Evans) 表示，“<small>人工智能</small>、版权和个人权利之间的相互作用是一个令人兴奋的故事，我们都是其中的一部分。”）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些未经授权的克隆产品已经成为热门产品。四月，一位匿名业余作曲家发布了一首名为“Heart On My Sleeve”的歌曲，其中使用了两位说唱歌手 Drake 和 The Weeknd 的<small>人工智能</small>复制声音。在代表这两位艺术家的环球影业要求将其删除之前，这首歌已被播放了 2000 万次。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这首歌引起了恐慌，但它也证明了克隆如何为艺术家带来好处。 《Pivot》一书的作者、Spotify 前首席经济学家威尔·佩奇 (Will Page) 的分析表明，克隆可以帮助明星销售正版音乐。他计算出，法国<small>DJ</small> David Guetta 在二月份发布了一段<small>由人工智能</small>生成的阿姆风格说唱片段后，阿姆真实曲目的播放量增加了约五分之一。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，人们对<small>人工智能</small>的反感仍然很强烈。一群演员、作家和导演成立了一个名为 Credo23 的机构，用于认证没有<small>人工智能</small>制作的电影和<small>电视</small>节目（尚未起飞）。许多过去因数字盗版而受苦的歌手也怀有敌意。 83 岁的歌手克里夫·理查德爵士 (Sir Cliff Richard) 最近宣称，他的演唱“没有使用人工授精”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其他人担心<small>人工智能</small>只会让娱乐变得衍生和无聊。四分之三的美国人告诉民意调查机构 YouGov，他们担心<small>人工智能</small>会削弱人类的创造力。一位文学经纪人表示，吸收所有内容然后吐出平均值的过程可能会导致风格和概念上的平均值回归，他认为社交媒体上的算法与有助于传播最平淡观点的算法有相似之处。环球影业的卢西安爵士表示，<small>人工智能</small>“永远缺乏驱动最有才华的艺术家做出最好作品的基本火花，这就是意图”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一切都取决于观众是否接受人工表演。 “例如，下一代电影观众是否会想在詹姆斯·邦德中看到不同的演员？还是他们想看到肖恩·康纳利回来？”一位好莱坞经纪人问道。事实证明，<small>人工智能</small>生成的表演对于大牌明星来说可能是最成功的，他们不挑剔的超级粉丝永远无法欣赏这些表演。正如绿洲乐队前主唱、约翰·列侬粉丝利亚姆·加拉格尔 (Liam Gallagher) 在社交媒体上被问及对翻唱版《Now and Then》有何看法时所回答的那样：“披头士乐队可以在我的手提包里拉屎，但我仍然会把我的马球薄荷糖藏在那里。” ”。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读更多关于<a

。美国银行分析师上个月宣布利率“正脱离 5000 年来的低点”时，听起来可能有点喘不过气来。但这确实是经济学家、投资者和任何在偿还债务时处于不舒服境地的人的感受，因为几乎每个人都预计利率将永远处于低位。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">利率将“在更长时间内保持较高水平”的信念正在全世界蔓延。 2021年欧元区出现负利率；现在德国必须支付近3%的利率才能借贷十年。英国的债券收益率几乎与美国一样高。即使是日本，其明显的永久性低利率被视为世界其他地区的先兆，也面临着债券收益率的上行压力（见图1）。人们越来越多地押注中国央行将不得不在 2024 年加息，这是自 2007 年以来的首次。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果市场是正确的，一个新时代就会开始，其后果将是深远的。家庭和公司将不得不支付更多费用才能借贷。金融体系将不得不适应痛苦的新现实。政府将发现他们必须转移更多的税收收入来支付累积债务的利息。许多投资者现在预测的长期走高的情况是一个潜在的有毒组合。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从实体经济入手。过去一年的令人惊讶的事情之一是世界经济（尤其是美国经济）面对利率上升的弹性。 10月26日消息，美国第三季度<small>GDP</small>年化增长率为4.9%。由于covid-19大流行的封锁和刺激支付，家庭积累的超额储蓄支撑了消费者支出。许多公司在利率较低时发行了长期债务，因此如今仍然享有较低的融资成本。美国公司今年的净利息支付实际上有所下降，因为他们手头现金赚取的利息增长速度快于偿债成本。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些保护性缓冲将持续一段时间。 9月份，统计人员上调了对疫情期间积累的储蓄的估计，此前这些储蓄看起来正处于耗尽的边缘。现在看来，美国家庭仍然持有约 1 万美元的多余现金，相当于个人年总收入的近 5%。更高的利率也需要时间来减缓企业的发展速度。高盛银行估计，只有 16% 的美国企业债务将在未来几年内到期。再融资将使债务总额的平均利率从今年的 4.2% 提高到 2025 年的 4.5%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，并非所有公司都能适应更高的利率。尽管经济蓬勃发展，美国规模较小的企业的债务通常比大企业更早到期，但它们仍面临压力。在该地区和欧洲，经济增长疲软，企业破产数量不断增加（见图 2）。在一些经济体中，企业更容易受到利率上升的影响：截至 2021 年底，西班牙和意大利企业债务的中位期限分别仅为 2.6 年和 2.1 年。在瑞典，公司债务占<small>GDP</small>的比例高达 155%，令人瞠目结舌，截至 3 月份的一年里，公司未偿还银行贷款的平均实际利率从 1.5% 上升至 3.9%，而且目前还会更高。 9月份企业破产数量比去年同期增加14%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果利率达到永久较高的水平，即使是长期债务最终也会开始让企业付出高昂的代价。这将是痛苦的，因为在 2010 年代，企业大量借贷：美国的非金融企业在这十年间发行了净 4.1 万亿美元的债务，同时通过股息和回购收回了净 3.2 万亿美元的股本。根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的数据，在整个发达经济体中，企业债务约占<small>GDP</small>的 93%，而 2000 年代中期这一比例还不到 80%。如果利率在较长时间内保持较高水平，这种借贷热潮可能需要停止。因此，长期去杠杆化可能会抑制 2020 年代的投资，就像低增长抑制 2010 年代的投资一样。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">家就是受伤的地方</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">家庭最终也会发现更高的利率会产生影响。在美国和一些欧洲国家，抵押贷款利率可以固定数十年，这样只要借款人不搬家，就可以免受利率上涨的影响。但房价可能会下跌，因为它们主要依赖于重新借贷的买家，因此面临更高的成本。 10月18日，数据提供商《抵押贷款新闻日报》报道称，美国30年期固定利率抵押贷款平均利率自2000年以来首次达到8%。因此，购买美国房产所需的月付款中位数抵押贷款占房产价值 90% 的房屋现在占平均收入的近 60%，高于 2021 年 7 月的 33%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">房地产市场能够维持这样的比率令人难以置信。根据国际清算银行的数据，从 2022 年初到 2023 年第二季度，12 个发达经济体的实际房价下跌了 10%。如果利率遵循市场暗示的路径，实际房价预计将再下跌 14%。到2025年底。在利率稳定在略高于当前水平的情况下，实际房价从峰谷到谷底的跌幅将达到35%。相比之下，全球金融危机导致的下降为13%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">接下来，考虑提高利率对金融部门的影响。交易员经常开玩笑说，利率会上升，直到出现问题。 2023 年春天，有件事发生了：银行。他们拥有大量政府债券，这些债券随着利率上升而贬值。十年期国债收益率从 2021 年底的 1.5% 跃升至一年后的 3.5% 左右，导致国债广泛指数的价值下跌约 10%。这给美国银行造成了超过 6000 亿美元的损失，其中最脆弱的——硅谷银行和第一共和银行——遭遇挤兑并倒闭。美联储最终以美国国债的面值而非市场价值向银行提供贷款，缓解了银行资产负债表的压力，从而避免了这场危机。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但在一个更高、更长久的世界里，危机可能会卷土重来。美联储新贷款计划下的最后一笔贷款将于三月份发放。即使延长期限，银行也可能发现自己无力支付美联储贷款的利息（与现行的短期利率类似，因此一直在稳步上升）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当利率上升时，不仅仅是国债的市值下降。任何在中长期期限内支付固定回报的贷款或多或少都会遵循相同的模式。 Erica Jiang、Gregor Matvos、Tomasz Piskorski 和 Amit Seru 等经济学家进行了一项分析，按照 3 月份的市场价格对美国银行的所有资产进行了估值，然后进行测试，看看如果它们的一半或全部资产被没有保险的储户提取了他们的储蓄。他们发现，即使在不那么灾难性的情况下，约有 200 家左右的银行（总资产达 3000 亿美元）也可能资不抵债。另两位经济学家马克·弗兰纳里 (Mark Flannery) 和索林·索雷斯库 (Sorin Sorescu) 撰写的另一篇论文得出结论：“如果所有未入账损失都充分反映在银行资产负债表中，那么大约一半的银行（持有大约一半的银行资产）将无法满足最低监管资本要求要求。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">自3月份以来，债券指数又下跌了5%。蒋女士和她的合著者重复了他们的分析。他们发现，未实现损失略有上升，但现在主要集中在较大的银行。 3 月份，这些损失为 2.2 万亿美元，其中只有约 30% 发生在被监管机构标记为“具有系统重要性”的银行。现在有 2.5万亿美元的未实现损失，其中约三分之二是在此类银行。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">金融脆弱性还有其他来源。商业地产贷款约占银行资产的十分之一，而由于利率上升和入住率下降，办公楼的价值已经暴跌。一些业主只是将钥匙交给贷方。更重要的是，近年来，大量贷款已从银行转移到其他类型的金融机构，例如养老基金和保险公司。作为大型银行，他们之前从未经历过利率上升的周期。尽管分散风险原则上是有帮助的，但这也意味着更多的公司面临潜在的损失。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最后，考虑政府的脆弱性。全球金融危机后，富裕国家的公共债务飙升至 1946 年以来的最高水平。自疫情大流行以来，相对于<small>GDP 的债务</small>规模比拿破仑战争以来的任何时候都要高（见图 3）。这些巨额债务的可持续性不仅取决于利率，还取决于这些利率与经济增长的比较。在低利率时代，人们流行这样一种观点：如果<small>GDP 的</small>增长速度快于利息的增长速度，那么政府的债务与<small>GDP 的</small>比率可能会下降，即使它重新借贷来支付利息。它甚至可以继续借入更多资金来为额外支出提供资金，同时保持债务与<small>国内生产总值的</small>比率稳定。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 10月，<small>国际货币基金组织</small>预测，尽管最近利率有所上升，但2023年至2028年期间，发达经济体的经济增长率将继续超过其政府为其债务支付的利率，平均高出1.4个百分点。原因是政府和企业一样，通过发行长期债务在一定程度上锁定了低利率。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，无论如何，债务与<small>国内生产总值的</small>比率大多会上升，因为许多政府继续存在过度赤字。美国尤其放肆借贷：据智库负责任联邦预算委员会称，剔除会计扭曲，去年美国赤字占<small>GDP</small>的7.5%。如此高的赤字通常只在战争或灾难性衰退期间才会出现。根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的预测<i>，《经济学人》</i>计算了发达经济体为保持债务稳定所需进行的财政调整。除德国和日本外，每个大型发达经济体都需要勒紧裤腰带，以阻止债务与<small>GDP</small>之比进一步上升。美国必须将其基本预算赤字（即不包括债务利息的赤字）每年削减<small>GDP</small>的 2.4%。考虑到应对人口老龄化、气候危机和不断加剧的地缘政治紧张局势所需的额外支出，这种节俭的做法尤其困难——<small>国际货币基金组织</small>估计，所有这些问题的年度支出将占富裕国家<small>GDP</small>的 7.5% 左右。国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更重要的是，在一个更高、更长期的世界里，政府和公司一样，最终必须进行再融资。目前，十年期国债收益率高于大多数富裕经济体长期增长的合理估计。这意味着可能需要更多地勒紧裤腰带来阻止债务上升。很难回避这样的结论：根据目前的增长预测，长期较高的增长将迫使各国政府陷入另一轮痛苦的预算平衡，就像欧洲在 2010 年代所经历的那样。如果金融业的动荡引发昂贵的救助，财政前景将变得更加黯淡。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">总有应对的办法</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">世界经济能否应对企业去杠杆化、房价下跌、银行动荡和财政节俭等问题？令人惊讶的是，答案或许是——如果利率上涨的原因正确的话。经济学家通常认为，从长期来看，利率是由世界储蓄意愿和投资意愿之间的平衡决定的。在其他条件相同的情况下，更多的储蓄会降低所谓的“自然”利率；更多的投资会推高它。对于2010年代的最低利率，最流行的解释是人口老龄化为退休储蓄了更多的钱，而平淡的长期增长前景削弱了企业扩张的欲望——这种现象有时被称为“长期停滞”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了使利率永久改变，这种前景必须改变。其可能的原因之一是对经济更快增长的预期，这或许是由人工智能 ( <small>ai</small> ) 的最新进展推动的。从长远来看，增长和利率密切相关。当人们的收入随着时间的推移而增加时，他们的储蓄需求就会减少。公司期望更高的销售额，因此更加热衷于投资。央行必须保持较高的利率以防止经济过热。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It might seem farfetched to say that optimism about <small>AI</small> is pushing up bond yields. Yet it would explain why the prospect of higher-for-longer has not caused stockmarkets to fall much. In theory, higher bond yields should reduce the value of companies&#39; future earnings, an effect that bites hardest for technology firms, since they tend to promise jam tomorrow. In fact, as optimism about <small>AI</small> has spread, the value of big tech firms such as Microsoft and Nvidia has soared. Their rising value has kept the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio of the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 at around pre-pandemic levels, even though bond yields—and hence the rate used to discount future profits—are now much higher. And America&#39;s strong growth in the third quarter was not driven by an unusual jobs boom; in fact, the labour market is cooling. If the growth number is accurate, productivity must have risen. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Patrick Leger</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To the extent that productivity growth explains higher rates, the new era could be a happy one. Alongside the rise in debt-service costs, households will have higher real incomes, firms will have higher revenues, financial institutions will enjoy low default rates and governments will collect more tax. Healthy competition for capital might even bring benefits of its own. Some economists long suspected that the low-rate era of the 2010s made the economy less dynamic. “It was easy for relatively inefficient companies to stay afloat, so there wasn&#39;t much creative destruction,” says Kristin Forbes of <small>MIT</small> . In a higher-rate world underpinned by faster growth, there would be plenty of dynamism.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Alas, there is a more worrying explanation for higher rates: that government debt has grown so large that it has sopped up the world&#39;s surplus savings, leaving the private sector to compete for the scraps. In the short term, many traders blame the avalanche of debt issuance since the pandemic, as well as the unwinding of big bond purchases at central banks, for rising bond yields. Economists often pooh-pooh the significance of existing bonds changing hands, but they do think the size of the outstanding stock of debt matters. A rule of thumb proposed in 2019 by Larry Summers of Harvard University and Lukasz Rachel, then at the Bank of England, is that a ten-percentage-point increase in debt-to- <small>GDP</small> raises interest rates by 0.35 percentage points in the long run, while every percentage point increase in deficits raises rates by a similar amount. That would imply that spendthrift governments have contributed to today&#39;s high rates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To the extent government debt is to blame for “higher-for-longer”, then the world economy will have to deal with higher rates without any accompanying fillip to growth. That would be painful. “You can&#39;t really take the view that deficits will continue to push interest rates up and will also continue unchecked,” says Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Something&#39;s got to give, whether it&#39;s a more restrictive fiscal policy or some sort of debt crisis.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other than a fiscal crisis, how could the tension be resolved? One possibility is that persistently high inflation could erode the real value of government debts, as it has in the past after moments of economic crisis. In that case, though nominal interest rates might be higher-for-longer, the real interest rate would not have risen as much. Companies and governments would survive high rates because their incomes would be strong in cash terms. Relative to the high real yields they expect today, bondholders would be squeezed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another possibility is that high rates push the world economy into a recession, which in turn causes central banks to cut them. In line with this thesis, on October 23rd Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital announced that his fund was no longer betting that rates would keep rising, pushing down the value of Treasuries. “There is too much risk in the world to remain short bonds at current long-term rates,” he wrote. “The economy is slowing faster than recent data suggests.” If he is right, higher may not be for that much longer. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 09:59:34 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/l9lqenpjs2dom81bsiij1dhabr3a32hr</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Israel’s invasion of Gaza has been delayed]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1ey6m750"><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span>I</span> <small>T ALL BEGAN</small> so fast. An unprecedented barrage of rockets served as cover for a murderous rampage, which led to a frantic manhunt and ferocious air strikes. Reservists rushed to don uniforms and report for duty. Generals promised a massive ground offensive.

Israel&#39;s bombardment of Gaza continues, killing thousands and destroying around <a href="/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war">9% of buildings in the territory</a> . A near-total siege has left civilians short of food and water and hospitals unable to function.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Apart from a few small raids, though, the ground troops have yet to move. Some of the 360,000 reservists called up in Israel&#39;s largest-ever mobilisation have been sent home. Tens of thousands more are still in southern Israel, awaiting orders that have been delayed and delayed again. </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Officers grumble that they cannot maintain their readiness forever. One frustrated commander took his troops to a building site to run up and down half-finished high-rises—ostensibly an urban-warfare drill. In reality, he says, it was a way to let off steam. “Hurry up and wait” is a perennial maxim of military life; but an especially stark one in Israel today.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are many reasons to delay: continuing talks to free the array of hostages held by Hamas, the militant Islamist group that runs Gaza; American pressure, motivated by fears of a regional war; the dire conditions inside Gaza; and the chronic dithering of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&#39;s long-serving prime minister. On October 25th he confirmed that a ground offensive is still planned. But it will be smaller and slower than anyone would have expected in the days after the massacre, in which Hamas militants murdered more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.</p><p class="article__body-text"> According to the latest count from Israeli officials, the tally of at least 220 people seized during the attack includes scores of children and old people, and citizens of at least a dozen foreign countries. The hostages have become a source of pressure on Mr Netanyahu&#39;s government. The captives&#39; families have waged an effective public-relations campaign, and foreign leaders have pushed him to try to free their citizens.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Vigils have been held across Israel. The hostages&#39; relatives often give television and radio interviews. The issue is deeply political. Many of those from the kibbutzim that were attacked are the secular, left-leaning sorts of Israelis most likely to have joined protests against Mr Netanyahu&#39;s government throughout the year. They feel his government forsook them on October 7th and is still failing them. Pressure from the families has already forced the government to change its plans. Originally inclined to rush into Gaza without regard for the hostages&#39; safety, it has since declared that their rescue is a “top priority”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Qatar, host to some leaders of Hamas, is also feeling the heat. Its ties with the group have come under scrutiny since the massacre; it is desperate to show its Western partners, particularly America, that it can serve as an interlocutor.</p><p class="article__body-text"> On October 25th Tzachi Hanegbi, the head of Israel&#39;s national-security council, posted an uncharacteristic message on X (formerly Twitter): “I&#39;m pleased to say that Qatar is becoming an essential party and stakeholder in the facilitation of humanitarian solutions,” he wrote. Israeli officials had been scathing about Qatar in recent weeks. That Mr Hanegbi praised it (in English, rather than Hebrew) suggests progress towards a deal to release at least some of Hamas&#39;s captives.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Hamas has already let a handful go. On October 20th it freed a mother and daughter who hold dual American and Israeli citizenship. Three days later it freed two elderly Israeli women who were abducted from Nir Oz, a kibbutz on the Gaza border. It got nothing in return—a sign that American pressure on Qatar is having an effect.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One of the women, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, spoke of her ordeal at a press conference the next day. Her captors, she said, beat her on the journey to Gaza. Once inside the territory she was led into a “spiderweb” of tunnels; after walking for hours, she wound up in a room where around two dozen other hostages were being held.</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231028_FBP003.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="A man lights a candle at a vigil in Tel Aviv for those killed in the war and for the Isaeli hostages held by Hamas."></span><figcaption> Candles for the killed; candles for the kidnapped</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Ms Lifshitz said they were treated decently: medics tended to the wounded, and captives ate the same simple meals of bread, cheese and vegetables as their captors. When she was turned over to the Red Cross on Gaza&#39;s border with Egypt, she shook hands with one of her captors. She said that was because the hostages were treated with “sensitivity”. But her husband is still in captivity: she had good reason not to antagonise Hamas.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That the group behaved humanely to a grandmother, moreover, does not mitigate the outrage of having kidnapped a grandmother in the first place, tossing her across a motorbike and beating her with sticks. Nor does it excuse the horrors of what Hamas did in Israeli towns.</p><p class="article__body-text"> On October 23rd the Israeli army screened 43 minutes of raw footage from the massacre for foreign journalists. Some was taken from the attackers&#39; body cameras, the rest from surveillance cameras and mobile phones. No recording was allowed at the screening, in a nondescript auditorium on an army base: this was a sadistic snuff film not for the public&#39;s eyes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In one harrowing clip a father rushes his two young sons, all of them clad in their underclothes, to a hiding place. A terrorist throws in a hand grenade after them. The father is killed. The bloodied boys—one appears to have lost an eye—are led back into their house at gunpoint, where their father&#39;s killer asks them for water, calmly raids the fridge and starts drinking a cola. (An army spokesman was unable to say if the boys survived.)</p><p class="article__body-text"> The atrocities go on. A gunman tries to behead a Thai labourer who has been shot in the stomach; unable to find a knife, he hacks away at the man&#39;s neck with a garden hoe. Other images show burned babies and children with their brains spilling from their heads. Several of the attackers proudly pose for photos next to their victims.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The barbarity sparked rage in Israel and abroad. There is broad support for a military campaign to topple Hamas in Gaza, which it has controlled since it ousted the Palestinian Authority ( <small>PA</small> ) in 2007. But there are also powerful voices urging caution—Joe Biden&#39;s most of all.</p><p class="article__body-text"> His fear that Israel is rushing into a war with no clear endgame is a valid one. The Israeli security establishment would like to see the <small>PA</small> , which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, also retake control in Gaza. But one senior official admits that no serious planning has been done. Mr Netanyahu even denied that such a plan exists. </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Biden also fears that the war will not stay in Gaza. On Israel&#39;s northern border with Lebanon, there have been daily exchanges of fire. Hizbullah, the Shia militia cum political party, has attacked Israeli towns and army posts with anti-tank missiles, and Israel has shelled and bombed southern Lebanon. Hizbullah admits that some 40 of its fighters have been killed (the real toll is probably higher). It is the most sustained fighting since the war they fought in 2006, though it has yet to escalate beyond tit-for-tat bombardment.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Militias in Syria and Iraq have used drones to attack American bases, where two dozen soldiers were lightly injured. On October 19th the Pentagon said an American destroyer, the <i><small>USS</small></i> <i>Carney,</i> had shot down missiles and drones launched from Yemen over the Red Sea. America believes their target was southern Israel, a remarkable entry into the war by the Houthis, an <a href="/graphic-detail/2023/10/25/the-firepower-of-iran-backed-militias-in-maps">Iranian-backed militia</a> in Yemen.</p><h2> Dangerous calibrations</h2><p class="article__body-text"> All of these escalations are small—signs that Iran wants to show the reach of its proxies, not plunge the region into war. But they are risky. A strike that kills a lot of people in either Israel or Lebanon would be enough to upset the balance. To make that less likely, Israel has evacuated around two dozen communities in the north, including Kiryat Shmona, a city of more than 20,000 people near the Lebanese border. Villages on the Lebanese side have also emptied as residents flee farther north. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZ_BZ-knasU?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Israel has hardened its border too: many reservists called up this month were sent north, not south. America has deployed two aircraft-carrier strike groups, one to the eastern Mediterranean, the other to the Persian Gulf. On October 21st it said it would deploy more Patriot air-defence battalions and a <small>THAAD</small> anti-ballistic missile battery. Another 2,000 troops are on standby for a possible deployment.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Israel&#39;s assessment is that these reinforcements have deterred Hizbullah from ramping up the fighting. Talk in the war cabinet of launching a pre-emptive strike on the group has died down. Of late, oil markets seem more sanguine, too. The price of Brent crude, which spiked from $85 a barrel before the Hamas attack to $92 on October 19th, has slipped to below $90.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <a href="/graphic-detail/2023/10/18/a-short-history-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict">Every Israeli war</a> is fought watching the clock, as international condemnation grows and eventually America qualifies its support. In 1973 America urged a ceasefire ending the Yom Kippur War, even though Israeli forces were on the advance. In 2006 it imposed a ceasefire before Israel could achieve its objectives in Lebanon. As one Israeli official puts it, “Our window of international legitimacy is limited.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> The scenes of horror in Gaza mean the window is already closing. The <small>UN</small> says 1.4m people in the territory have been displaced; its shelters are crammed to two-and-a-half times their capacity. On October 13th Israel told the entire population of northern Gaza to flee south. Thousands who heeded that order have since travelled back the other way. If nowhere feels safe, they reckon, better to be in one&#39;s own home than a tent or a crowded shelter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Israel refuses to allow any supplies to cross its border until Hamas releases all the hostages it holds captive. On October 21st the first shipment of aid, a convoy of 20 lorries containing food, water and medicine entered Gaza from Egypt. Several more deliveries followed. This is only a small fraction of what the territory needs (the <small>UN</small> says at least 100 lorries a day are required). Families have cut back to one meal a day. People have resorted to drinking salty water from wells. Aid workers say poor sanitation has led to cases of scabies and diarrhoea and fear that even more serious diseases will spread.</p><p class="article__body-text"> No fuel has entered Gaza since October 7th. The sole power plant is offline and Israel has <a href="/graphic-detail/2023/10/20/gazans-are-rapidly-losing-access-to-the-internet">cut the supply</a> of electricity that it normally provides. The World Health Organisation says six of Gaza&#39;s 13 hospitals have run out of fuel. Most bakeries are closed for the same reason; queues at those still working stretch up to six hours. Israel refuses to allow fuel shipments.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Arab states want an immediate ceasefire. The European Union is split, but Josep Borrell, its top diplomat, has called for a “humanitarian pause” to allow more supplies to enter. Rishi Sunak, Britain&#39;s prime minister, has signalled support for one too. America still offers Israel staunch backing, but will not do so indefinitely.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet Mr Netanyahu faces mounting pressure from his hard-right base to prove he is clobbering Hamas, and is loth to admit that Mr Biden or the hostages&#39; families have stayed his hand. Instead, using proxies, he has begun to brief that the army is not ready for a ground campaign. Rather than risk soldiers&#39; lives, it is argued, Israel should launch more devastating air strikes, including the use of bunker-busting bombs, to destroy Hamas&#39;s tunnel network.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The army has pushed back, saying it is “fully ready” for an invasion. There have been days of ugly but accurate headlines in the Israeli media about discord between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant in March, after the latter voiced criticism of the government&#39;s plan to weaken the supreme court. He was forced to retreat after massive public protests. There has been growing distrust between the two ever since, and it is now hampering Israel&#39;s war-planning effort.</p><p class="article__body-text"> On October 11th leaders of one opposition party, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot—both former army chiefs—joined the war cabinet. But they have failed to restore unity. “The [army] and the intelligence community were severely hit by their failure to detect and prevent the Hamas attack,” says a defence official. “But they&#39;ve got back on their feet and are now just waiting for a clear idea from the government what to do.”</p><h2> General confusion</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The army&#39;s orders remain to destroy Hamas&#39;s military capabilities and end its control of Gaza. Some within the army and the wider defence establishment believe a more gradual ground campaign would be better. But generals were told to prepare for a broad offensive; they cannot change that plan unless the cabinet gives them a different timetable or a different goal. And the cabinet is dithering.</p><p class="article__body-text"> General Herzi Halevi, the army chief, has acknowledged the army&#39;s failure to prevent the massacre. So has Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet, Israel&#39;s internal-security service, and General Aharon Haliva, the head of military intelligence. All three are expected to do the honourable thing and resign after the war. Most Israelis want their prime minister to accept similar responsibility—but he has not.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Instead Mr Netanyahu spends most of his time huddling with political advisers and briefing journalists. He has assembled his own shadow cabinet of former generals and security officials to second-guess Mr Gallant and the army. “There are many who shoulder the blame for thinking that Hamas wouldn&#39;t dare do something like this,” says one Knesset member from Mr Netanyahu&#39;s coalition. “Obviously Bibi is more to blame than all the others, but don&#39;t wait for him to say so.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even a well-oiled government would struggle to navigate between so many competing priorities—and Israel, these days, barely has a government at all. <span>■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 09:12:42 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/r4fu7pv2b33vsgars6icrkf50ck31jlc</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/26/why-israels-invasion-of-gaza-has-been-delayed </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s prime minister and its army are damagingly divided]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>SRAELI SOLDIERS</small> near the border with Gaza were surprised on October 24th to see a familiar figure visiting the kibbutzim devastated by Hamas&#39;s attack. Arye Deri, the leader of Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party which is one of the largest in the coalition of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, also visited military units preparing for war in Gaza. A day earlier, Mr Deri had angered Israel&#39;s military chiefs when he leaked the details of a meeting with his party members in which he had said the Israel Defence Forces ( <small>IDF</small> ) were “not ready”.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Read more on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">war between Israel and Hamas.</a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Deri has no official role in government, nor does he have any significant military experience. Yet the prime minister has invited him in an unofficial capacity to some of the meetings of the war cabinet. His qualification is that he is an important political ally of Mr Netanyahu.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> War is politics by other means, and this war is increasingly politicised. While the polls show broad backing among Israelis for the ground offensive in Gaza, they also show support for Mr Netanyahu has plummeted. Some 40% of voters who supported his Likud party less than a year ago now say they would vote for someone else. Calls are growing for a national commission of enquiry to be held once the conflict has ended.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On October 25th Israeli officials said they had agreed to delay the invasion of Gaza to allow America to shore up its air defences in the region. But Mr Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from his hard-right base to prove his readiness to destroy Hamas. The prime minister&#39;s proxies have been briefing journalists that the <small>IDF</small> is not fully prepared for the ground campaign and that, instead of jeopardising the lives of Israeli soldiers with a rapid invasion, as Israel&#39;s generals suggest, even more devastating air-strikes are needed to destroy Hamas&#39;s network of tunnels. This has led to angry responses from the <small>IDF</small> that it is, in fact, ready. It has also prompted ugly—and accurate—headlines in the Israeli media about the discord in the war cabinet between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Divisions within this government are not new. In March Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant after he publicly criticised the government&#39;s plan to weaken the powers of the Supreme Court. The prime minister was forced to retreat in the face of massive public protests. But the growing distrust between the two since then is now hampering Israel&#39;s war-planning. The establishment of a “unity government” with leaders of one of the opposition parties, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot—both of whom are former <small>IDF</small> chiefs of staff and also part of the war cabinet—has failed to bring about any actual unity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Netanyahu&#39;s relationship with Israel&#39;s generals has long been tense. That tension has been heightened by their responses to Hamas&#39;s attack on October 7th. “The <small>IDF</small> and the intelligence community were severely hit by their failure to detect and prevent the Hamas attack,” says a senior defence official. “But they&#39;ve got back on their feet and are now just waiting for a clear idea from the government [about] what to do.” By contrast Israel&#39;s politicians, and its prime minister in particular, still seem to be floundering.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The army&#39;s chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, has already publicly acknowledged the failure of October 7th, as have Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet, Israel&#39;s security service, and the chief of the military intelligence branch, Major General Aharon Haliva. All are expected to resign once the war is over. The prime minister, though, has not accepted any such responsibility, beyond saying vaguely on October 25th that “only after the war” would questions be asked “of me as well”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “There are many who shoulder the blame for thinking that Hamas wouldn&#39;t dare do something like this,” says one Knesset member from Mr Netanyahu&#39;s coalition. “Obviously Bibi is more to blame than all the others but don&#39;t wait for him to say so.” Instead, when he has not been in meetings with his war cabinet or welcoming foreign leaders, Mr Netanyahu has spent most of his time in recent days huddled with his political advisers and briefing journalists. He has also assembled a shadow cabinet of former generals and security officials to second-guess Mr Gallant and the <small>IDF</small> ’s generals.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The prime minister is not the only one focused on politicking. The coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties that backs Mr Netanyahu knows it may not last long: public anger and another election could sweep them away. But they are anxious to cling on for as long as possible—and to make the most of their power. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister and leader of Jewish Power, a far-right party, has made a show of handing weapons to civilians, ostensibly to prevent further terrorist attacks. But he has been trying to stoke tensions between Israeli Jews and Arab-Israelis. For now, at least, he has had no success. (He was pointedly not included in the war cabinet.) Other coalition partners have blocked efforts to get cash to help the thousands of Israeli families uprooted by the war, because they worry the money will be diverted from funding the special interests of their own communities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All the talk is of the next stage of the fighting in Gaza, not what follows it. Israel&#39;s security establishment would prefer to see the Palestinian Authority, which was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in a bloody coup in 2007, return and take control of the area. But one senior official admits that no planning is being done on that front. For over a decade Mr Netanyahu has isolated and neglected Gaza, believing it could safely be left to fester. The attack on October 7th demonstrated how tragically that policy has failed. His politicising of the war now, and his reluctance to plan for the future, could cost Israel even more. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:00:16 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/km2iggca1c1tagbrt08k9qhrph1e4onf</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/25/israels-prime-minister-and-its-army-are-damagingly-divided </item><item><title><![CDATA[The overstretched superpower]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Biden_s%20bandwidth-c5edd27e5587ef9851fd358371ced144-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HREE DAYS</small> after Hamas fighters swarmed across the security fence of the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,400 people and kidnapping about 220 more, the <i><small>USS</small> Gerald R.

The show of force sends two messages. To Iran and its proxies: stay out. To Israel: you are not alone. American forces may yet be ordered into action amid signs that the war could spread. Israel is girding itself for a ground operation; violence in the West Bank is intensifying; and exchanges of missile and artillery fire between Israel and Hizbullah, a Lebanese Shia militia allied with Iran, presage a possible second front (see map). </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBM945.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">On October 22nd Lloyd Austin, America&#39;s defence secretary, warned of the “prospect of a significant escalation” against American forces. Three days earlier an American warship in the Red Sea shot down cruise missiles and drones aimed at Israel by the Iranian-aligned Houthi militias in Yemen. American bases in Iraq and Syria have also been coming under attack by rockets and drones, presumably fired by other Iranian proxies. “This is the most dangerous moment since the cold war,” argues Matthew Kroenig of the Atlantic Council, a think-tank in Washington, <small>DC</small> . “If Iran and Hizbullah get involved, America may feel compelled to respond. And does China then see an opportunity to try something against Taiwan?”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> President Joe Biden is thus turning into an unlikely wartime president. He was not exaggerating when he told Americans in a recent televised address that the world was at an inflection point. When America acted to help Ukraine resist Russia&#39;s invasion many asked whether it had the wherewithal to deter a looming Chinese assault against Taiwan. The question is all the more acute now that America also seeks to defend Israel. In Mr Biden&#39;s view, helping friends is not only possible but necessary. “American leadership is what holds the world together,” he declared. “American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet academics debate whether and when the “unipolar” world, in which America bestrode the globe after the cold war, reverted to a “bipolar” one, in which America is challenged by China rather than the Soviet Union; or whether it is already a “multipolar” world. Joseph Nye, a Harvard academic, defined national power in three dimensions: military, economic and “soft power”, ie, the ability, among other things, to co-opt others to do your bidding. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_FBC151.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">In military terms, America remains a colossus (see chart). Economically, the world is bipolar in a way it never was during the cold war, with China&#39;s economic output somewhat smaller than America&#39;s at market exchange rates, and surpassing it at purchasing-power parity (though Americans remain far richer than Chinese). Soft power is harder to measure, but it is probably fair to say the world is more multipolar, says Mr Kroenig.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That said, in the Middle East, America is still the “indispensable nation”, a concept popularised by the late Madeleine Albright, a former secretary of state. It is the only country willing and able to mediate between regional leaders and shape events. That includes securing the opening of a (still inadequate) humanitarian corridor in Gaza. “The phone in Beijing didn&#39;t ring. The phone in Moscow didn&#39;t ring. But the phone in Washington has been ringing off the hook,” notes Ivo Daalder, formerly America&#39;s representative to <small>NATO</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Set against that central role, though, is the fact that three Arab leaders—King Abdullah of Jordan, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the Egyptian president, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian one—have been frosty towards Mr Biden. He had been due to meet them in Amman on October 18th, after visiting Israel. But a day earlier a blast in the grounds of a Gaza hospital killed scores if not hundreds of Palestinians. Palestinians say the carnage was caused by an Israeli strike; Israel said it was the result of an errant Palestinian missile. Mr Biden seemed to give Israel the benefit of the doubt (and later said more firmly that it was not responsible). The Arab leaders did not. They cancelled the summit after Mr Abbas declared three days of mourning and returned home. Just then America looked like the dispensable power.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Not where he would start</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In office, Mr Biden&#39;s priority has been revitalising the American economy. He borrowed the protectionist mindset of his predecessor, Donald Trump, and added large doses of subsidies and industrial policy to promote, among other things, green technology and the manufacture of semiconductors. Gratifyingly, the American economy has outperformed that of its rich-world peers. He hoped such policies would reduce social and political polarisation. He also hoped they would fortify America in its contest with China. Describing the era as one of “competition in an age of interdependence”, Mr Biden&#39;s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, says foreign and domestic policies are more interconnected than ever, for instance in efforts to restrict China&#39;s access to advanced technology.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Abroad, Mr Biden sought to revitalise alliances that Mr Trump had either neglected or threatened to undo. He renewed the New <small>START</small> agreement with Russia, limiting long-range nuclear weapons, as part of his effort to establish “a stable, predictable relationship” with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Above all Mr Biden&#39;s foreign policy meant doing much less in the Middle East, a region that had consumed the energies of many an American president. He sought to end the “forever wars” in Iraq and Afghanistan. He promised to restore the nuclear deal with Iran, which Barack Obama had signed in 2015 and Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, to contain the danger of a nuclear Iran. He initially said Saudi Arabia should be treated as a “pariah”. He reverted to America&#39;s long-standing support for the “two-state solution”, ie, the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, though he put little effort into it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Much of this has gone awry for Mr Biden. Far from being stable and predictable, Mr Putin invaded Ukraine and information exchanges under New <small>start</small> are suspended. America&#39;s chaotic departure from Afghanistan allowed the Taliban to return to power instantly. In the Gulf, meanwhile, China took the plaudits for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, appearing to fill a vacuum left by American indifference.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Changing focus</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden flew to the Saudi city of Jeddah in July last year to make up with Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince. The president could not persuade the de facto ruler of the world&#39;s biggest oil exporter to help moderate oil prices; instead, Saudi Arabia cleaved to a production deal with Russia to keep prices high. Moreover, he set a high bar for the normalisation of relations with Israel that Mr Biden hoped to bring about: concessions on the Palestinian question; a mutual-defence agreement with America; and uranium enrichment at home to counterbalance Iran&#39;s nuclear programme. Often Team Biden fell back on benign neglect. “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,” declared Mr Sullivan—just days before Hamas&#39;s onslaught.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s allies around the world, especially in Asia, ask two seemingly contradictory questions, says Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, an American think-tank. First, will American resources and attention be diverted to the Middle East? Second, will America&#39;s resolve in one or other crisis fail? “If we allow the security of Europe to be destabilised by Russian aggression, or allow Israel to suffer a terrible terrorist attack, they will believe that we don&#39;t care about any other problem,” she argues.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s reliability as an ally comes down to both credibility and capacity. Given America&#39;s many alliances, academics have long debated the importance of credibility: does a failure to live up to obligations to one ally affect commitments to others? America&#39;s abandonment of the war in Vietnam, for instance, did not much damage its will to defend western Europe. The West went on to win the cold war.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These days the question is whether America&#39;s pell-mell departure from Afghanistan undermined American credibility and encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine. Tod Wolters, a former military commander of <small>NATO</small> forces, suggested last year that it had been one of several factors. But Mr Sullivan insists that, in fact, leaving Afghanistan “improved our strategic capacity” to respond to the invasion of Ukraine and the threat to Taiwan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for military capacity, America must supply weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan and now Israel. That raises doubts about whether its defence industries can meet their needs as well as its own. In general America sends different weapons to the three countries, but some demands overlap. For instance, 155mm artillery shells are in short supply, and America is reported to have diverted a consignment intended for Ukraine to Israel. The war in Ukraine has shown how big state-on-state conflicts consume vast quantities of munitions. War games suggest that, in a war over Taiwan, America would quickly run out of the long-range anti-ship missiles that would be most useful in repelling a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such problems can be solved with time and money, but both are in short supply because of <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/the-republican-party-no-longer-believes-america-is-the-essential-nation">America&#39;s polarisation</a> and congressional paralysis. Republicans, especially those of Mr Trump&#39;s “America First” tendency, have grown ever more sceptical about supporting Ukraine in its war. And Congress, unable to pass bills since the removal of the speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, on October 3rd, got a new one, Mike Johnson, only this week.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden hopes cross-party sympathy for Israel will unblock things. He has asked Congress for a massive $106bn in supplemental national-security spending. He seeks to pre-empt future divisive votes on Ukraine by allocating $61bn in military and economic aid to the country, to tide it through America&#39;s febrile 2024 election season. To make it more palatable, he has wrapped it in other spending that Republicans should find more appealing, including $14bn for Israel; $2bn for military-equipment transfers in the Indo-Pacific (probably to Taiwan); nearly $12bn in various measures to strengthen the processing of migrants on the southern border; and $3bn for the submarine defence-industrial base.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” declared Mr Biden. Yet Israel&#39;s war is different from Ukraine&#39;s in several respects. One concerns international perceptions. America helps Ukraine in the name of the <small>UN</small> charter, the inviolability of sovereign borders and human rights. In defending Israel, America is backing a country that breaches international law by building Jewish settlements in occupied territories, rejects statehood for Palestinians and stands accused of imposing collective punishments on Palestinians, if not committing war crimes, in its bombardment and siege of Gaza.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Middle East rules</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whereas the Western allies are almost united in defence of Ukraine, they are split on the question of Palestine. A <small>UN</small> Security Council resolution calling for “humanitarian pauses” in the fighting in Gaza was supported by France and 11 other countries, but drew an abstention by Britain (alongside Russia) and was vetoed outright by America, on the ground that it did not recognise Israel&#39;s right to defend itself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second factor is America&#39;s own role. In Europe it is acting at arm&#39;s length, sending weapons, intelligence and money to Ukraine, but not troops. In the Middle East it is deploying its own forces to protect Israel from attack by Iran and its allies. Mr Biden&#39;s embrace of Israel is sincerely felt—Mr Biden calls himself a Zionist—but is also an attempt to influence and restrain Israel. “If Biden&#39;s hugging strategy works in delivering a more calibrated Israeli response, people will see it as Biden&#39;s special flair,” says Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. “If it does not work, America is going to be seen as a warring party.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Regional dynamics add a further element. Arab states are ambiguous. Many detest Hamas, as a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood that challenges their rule, and have made peace with Israel, or have tacit relations with it. Yet when Palestinians fight, these countries are compelled to champion the Palestinian case. Having taken in successive waves of Palestinian refugees, they don&#39;t want more. Indeed, they fear Israel secretly wants to resolve its problem by pushing out more Palestinians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The crisis in Gaza, notes Mr Hokayem, has shifted attention back to Palestine after years of American efforts to ignore it, or to solve it from the “outside in”, ie, normalising relations between Israel and Arab states and only then dealing with the Palestinians themselves. Yet the endgame in Gaza is being left intentionally blank. Israel insists Hamas must not rule Gaza again; America says Israel must not occupy it again. Neither says what the alternative might be. Mr Netanyahu, moreover, has done his utmost to sabotage Palestinian statehood. After Hamas&#39;s onslaught he, and many Israelis, will be even more convinced that it poses a mortal danger.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> American officials readily admit they don&#39;t have a strategy for the “day after”. The two-state model, says Mr Hokayem, “was a preference, not a policy”. If a solution seems impossible, it is only in part because of the inherent difficulty of reconciling two nationalist imperatives, Israeli and Palestinian, on the same hallowed land. It is also “the cost of American retrenchment”, says Mr Hokayem. “It is more difficult for America to come back into the game having been outside for a long time.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China and Russia may offer no substitute for America&#39;s diplomacy, but they will be more than happy to see American discomfiture and will play up the claims of American double standards. Ahead of his visit to Washington this week, Wang Yi, China&#39;s foreign minister, described Israel&#39;s actions as “beyond the scope of self-defence” and did not mention Hamas.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The impact of the crisis may be more tangible among some “swing states”, says Richard Fontaine of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank in Washington, <small>DC</small> . These are countries that are “multi-aligned”, and for whose allegiance America, China and Russia compete ever more intensely. Saudi Arabia may demand a higher price from Israel and America if it is ever to follow its Gulf neighbours, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, in establishing formal ties with Israel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Turkey, an equivocal ally of the West&#39;s in the Ukraine crisis, could turn more hostile. Though he has tried to patch up relations with Israel, and condemned the killing of Israeli civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hosts Hamas leaders and has sharpened his denunciation of Israel&#39;s response as “amounting to genocide”. Indonesia, the world&#39;s most populous Muslim country, inevitably sympathises with Palestinians. Though India thinks of itself as non-aligned and a friend of anti-colonial movements, it has expressed solidarity with Israel, feeling sympathy for it as a fellow victim of Islamist terrorism.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> South Africa sees Israel&#39;s treatment of Palestinians as akin to apartheid. African countries, more broadly, feel America either ignores conflicts on their continent—such as the war in Sudan—or is hypocritical when it comes to human rights. They regard America not so much as indispensable as absent. Many fear Mr Biden will not keep his promise to visit Africa this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Countries of the global south have also been courted more avidly by big powers. Though critical of Russia&#39;s invasion they do not want to be trapped in a new cold war. America has been trying to woo them through such things as boosting the lending capacity of the <small>IMF</small> and World Bank, and creating a global infrastructure fund to compete with China&#39;s Belt and Road Initiative ( <small>BRI</small> ). But it has a long way to go. On the same day as Mr Biden was in Tel Aviv, 20-odd leaders were in Beijing for a <small>BRI</small> summit hosted by China&#39;s leader, Xi Jinping.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A day later, in a televised address, Mr Biden made the case for America as the world&#39;s “essential nation”. In Europe and the Indo-Pacific his administration has acted nimbly, knitting existing alliances more tightly and creating new partnerships, helped by the aggression of Russia and China. In the Middle East, though, America is more alone in its defence of Israel, and more liable to lose friends and partners than win over new ones. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.

America has sent a second carrier strike group led by the <i><small>USS</small> Eisenhower</i> to the Persian Gulf. “There&#39;s a likelihood of escalation,” said Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, on October 22nd. The chances of further attacks by Iranian proxies on American forces are growing, he continued: “We don&#39;t want to see a second or third front develop.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Fears are also growing in Lebanon that Israel could use America&#39;s cover to launch a pre-emptive strike. Israel has evacuated its towns near the border with Lebanon and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&#39;s prime minister, has cautioned that if <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah">Hizbullah</a> , an Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, enters the fighting, the consequences for Lebanon will be devastating. One reason Israel has delayed its offensive in Gaza may be to bolster its preparations for escalation on its northern front. Iran&#39;s foreign minister has said the region is like a “powder keg”.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Read more on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">war between Israel and Hamas.</a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Iran&#39;s autocratic rulers hold one of the matches that could set it alight: an “axis of resistance”, or network of violent proxies across the region. They have spent two decades building this up in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Iran preys on places where the local polity is weak, where it is easy to funnel in personnel and weapons and where no external actor can challenge it, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank based in London. Iran&#39;s ability to cause mayhem at arm&#39;s length—through Hamas, Hizbullah, Iraq&#39;s plethora of Shia militias and Yemen&#39;s Houthis—may even give it more leverage than its conventional military capabilities, which are relatively weak.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Iran&#39;s goal right now, as it has been over the past decade, is not to provoke outright war with the West and its allies but to sow uncertainty and instability. Just as it has hovered on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, so it maintains strategic ambiguity with the axis. It denies it is in charge while supplying armed groups like the Houthis with arms, giving them training and using them as fronts to conduct attacks, such as a missile strike on Saudi Aramco in 2019 which temporarily shuttered 5% of global oil production. The purpose is to intimidate while complicating the West&#39;s calculus. That strategy pleases Iran&#39;s ever-closer friend, Russia. Similarly isolated from the West, it engages in weapons trade and sanctions-busting with the Islamic republic: think of Iranian-designed Shahed-136 kamikaze drones killing Ukrainians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The present crisis shows the opportunities and problems of Iran&#39;s approach. It has long sponsored Hamas but did not appear to know in advance about its attack on Israel on October 7th, according to Western officials familiar with the matter. Yet it has sought to capitalise on Hamas&#39;s atrocities and mobilise the axis of resistance. Hizbullah and Israel have exchanged fire, with the explicit support of Iran and America, respectively. As many as 19 of Hizbullah&#39;s fighters have been killed. The Houthis, who control Yemen&#39;s capital, have launched three medium-range cruise missiles, recently acquired from Iran, and a number of drones towards Eilat, Israel&#39;s port city (they were intercepted by an American destroyer). And Iranian-backed Shia militias in Syria and Iraq have broadened the struggle by repeatedly targeting bases housing American troops with rockets and drones (America has drawn down its diplomatic presence in Iraq as a result). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM935.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">For Iran, there are some obvious benefits. The conflagration in Gaza has halted—even if only temporarily—talks on normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Any such agreement would mark a further step in the Abraham accords through which Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have since 2020 established diplomatic ties with Israel. Iran&#39;s Shia ayatollahs cannot stand the idea of being isolated as Sunni-led Muslim states and Israel co-operate more. A push to delegitimise the Abraham accords continues: at a meeting of Muslim foreign ministers in Saudi Arabia on October 18th, Iran called on Muslim countries to impose an oil embargo on Israel. The Iranian regime is backing calls to push Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza, perhaps in the hope of aggravating tensions between Israel and its oldest Arab ally.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Regional turmoil also means more cash for Iran, at least for now. Oil prices have climbed by over $5 per barrel since October 7th. America is anxious to tamp down inflation in the run-up to its election next year and has been tacitly allowing Iran to export more oil, despite formally retaining sanctions. “Those Iranian barrels are very important” to Joe Biden, says Ahmed Mehdi, a London-based oil analyst. Production has topped 3m barrels per day, its highest levels since the Trump administration imposed sanctions in 2018. Year on year, Mr Mehdi says, exports are up by over a third.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the escalating proxy war with America and its friends comes with big risks for Iran. At home officials crow that they have become “statesmen” again, with president Ebrahim Raisi—viewed by many in the West as a hardline pariah—speaking to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in recent days. Ordinary Iranians are less impressed. A regional war could prompt a new cycle of protests at home. Armita Geravand, an Iranian schoolgirl who collapsed on October 1st after a beating from the morality police, according to local activists, has been declared brain-dead—news that could revive the outrage that brought Iranian protesters into the streets in 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, detained for “improperly” wearing the mandatory veil. Iranians are exhausted by their regime&#39;s adventures abroad and reluctant to endure more suffering for Palestine. Government-organised protests have been sparsely attended. A minute&#39;s silence at a football match in Tehran for those killed in Gaza was interrupted by raucous guffaws. “Neither Gaza nor Lebanon,” protesters chanted from their windows. “We sacrifice our lives for Iran.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Iran&#39;s shadow war is a delicate game and it is not clear that the country can control its proxies. Since America&#39;s assassination of Qassem Suleimani, one of the masterminds behind the axis of resistance, three years ago, Iran&#39;s satellites have increased their autonomy. As they hurl threats of war along with their rockets, they may find it hard to step back from their rhetoric. Each has set “red lines” for intervention against Israel and the West. A failure to respond could puncture their credibility with local supporters. An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza could force their hand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The proxies must also balance their military aspirations with the interests of their host countries. According to Iranian officials, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, has told Hizbullah he has no desire to heed its calls to attack Israel from his territory. In his view, Hamas betrayed him by siding with the rebellion against him in 2011 after he gave them sanctuary. He does not want to fight for them now.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lebanon fears being another sacrificial pawn. Its Shias are the country&#39;s largest sect, but its other 17 official denominations form a majority. Tellingly, Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah&#39;s leader famed for his belligerent speeches, has shied from addressing his public from his bunker in Beirut since the fighting began. The threat of war has kiboshed Lebanon&#39;s hopes of a tourism revival. Lloyd&#39;s, an insurance firm, has signalled it could withdraw cover, and Middle East Airlines, Lebanon&#39;s national carrier, is docking some of its fleet in Turkey. America has told its citizens to leave. The Lebanese prime minister has said “the decision regarding war and peace” is out of his hands.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If Iran&#39;s proxies attack American interests, or possibly Israel, it is most likely that America retaliates against them, rather than their sponsor Iran, in the first instance. Still, that is a high-stakes gamble. And in the long run Iran&#39;s decision to mobilise the axis of resistance signals it is heading towards isolation and autocracy. Only a month ago, the regime was celebrating a prisoner exchange with America and the imminent transfer to Iran of $6bn of frozen oil revenues. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had blessed direct talks for the first time since the Trump administration withdrew from a nuclear deal. Some spoke of a new detente. Now that lies in tatters—and the chances of a catastrophic wider war, while still low, are far too high for comfort. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 21:06:40 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/e2uvhu5oscs740irbuvmuk3g5cd6aqhf</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/irans-ayatollahs-play-the-middle-easts-most-dangerous-game </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can the Palestinian Authority control Gaza if Hamas is ousted?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>S ISRAELI TROOPS</small> prepare to <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-nears-the-obstacles-get-more-daunting">invade Gaza</a> , one question keeps coming up: who should take control of it after they have rooted out Hamas—if, indeed, they are able to do so? Many, especially Israel&#39;s allies, are looking to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/11/the-palestinian-authority-is-being-eclipsed-by-radical-militants">Palestinian Authority</a> ( <small>PA</small> ), which was thrown out of Gaza by Hamas almost two years after Israel withdrew its troops and dismantled its settlements there in 2005. But the <small>PA</small> seems to be in no position to take charge of the coastal enclave. In fact there are no guarantees that by the end of this war it will even be in control of Ramallah, the de facto capital city of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-war-in-gaza-may-mark-a-watershed-for-the-palestinian-authority">West Bank</a> .</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Born out of the Oslo Accords of 1993, the <small>PA</small> was supposed to be the basis of a future Palestinian state. But as the prospects of that state&#39;s establishment have receded, so has confidence in the <small>PA</small> , which is led by the 87-year-old Mahmoud Abbas (pictured) and is widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt and incompetent. Mr Abbas was elected to serve a four-year presidential term in 2005—and has been there ever since. “There is not really a whole lot left in the legitimacy tank of the <small>PA</small> ,” says Salam Fayad, a former prime minister of the <small>PA</small> . “Unless they really change course very rapidly, the whole thing could fall.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Partly because it has been unable to protect Palestinian civilians on the West Bank from attacks by Israeli settlers or halt the expansion of Israeli settlements, the <small>PA</small> has lost control of security in swathes of the West Bank to militant groups such as Kata&#39;ib Jenin and the Lions&#39; Den in Nablus in recent years. The slaughter of 1,400 Israelis by Hamas on October 7th, Israel&#39;s subsequent bombardment of Hamas in Gaza, and a sharp increase in attacks by settlers have all pushed it into an even more precarious position. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">In a poll in September, 53% of Palestinians said they thought an “armed struggle” against Israel was the best way to establish a state, compared with just 20% favouring negotiations. As the war in Gaza goes on, along with the flow of pictures coming out of the enclave that show civilians killed by Israel&#39;s bombing, Hamas&#39;s popularity appears to be increasing, while the <small>PA</small> ’s seems to be plummeting. When news broke of an explosion at Gaza&#39;s Ahli Arab hospital, furious crowds thronged into the streets of the West Bank. Their anger was not, however, directed at Israel, which most Palestinians believe bombed the hospital. (A more likely explanation for the blast, according to independent analysts and Western intelligence agencies, is that it was caused by a misfired rocket launched from Gaza by <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-palestinian-islamic-jihad">Islamic Jihad</a> , another Palestinian militant group.) Instead anger was directed at the <small>PA</small> . Hundreds marched on Mr Abbas&#39;s presidential compound in Ramallah. In an echo of the protests that rocked Arab countries and toppled governments in 2011, many chanted: “The people want the fall of the president.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Fatah, the Palestinian faction led by Mr Abbas that dominates the <small>PA</small> , was already riven by infighting over who would succeed him. Now it is being further torn apart over its stance on Hamas. Those close to the leader believe Fatah—and the <small>PA</small> , with which it has become synonymous—can muddle through to see the crushing of its Islamist rival, which could perhaps give it a chance to take back control of Gaza. However, many among the party&#39;s rank and file think differently. “A collapse [of Hamas] in Gaza will lead to a collapse in Fatah,” says a Fatah official in Ramallah, as he agonised over the safety of his relatives in Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even those who have little love for Hamas and its Islamist fervour are dismayed by the prospect of its being wiped out by Israel. They are urging Mr Abbas to set aside factionalism and to rally the secular Fatah movement behind Hamas in a unity government. “Both sides need each other,” says Raed al-Debiy, a Fatah official in Nablus, the West Bank&#39;s biggest city. “Hamas needs the international legitimacy of Fatah, and Fatah and the <small>PA</small> need the popularity of Hamas.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>PA</small> ’s legitimacy crisis is being intensified by a financial one. Although the <small>PA</small> has not been able to evolve into an independent Palestinian state, many Palestinians accept it simply as a source of salaries and public-sector work. Yet it seems it may not be able to provide even these. In the next few weeks the <small>PA</small> is scheduled to pay public-sector salaries, including the wages of 34,000 members of the Palestinian Security Forces. But it can afford to pay less than 50% of this month&#39;s wage bill, according to one senior <small>PA</small> official, who added that, even before the current war in Gaza, Israel was withholding customs revenues which it is obliged to hand over. This cash crunch is likely to become more acute as a result of the war because Israel has closed its borders to the thousands of West Bank Palestinians who usually work in Israel and pay income taxes to the <small>PA</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Members of <small>PA</small> ’s security forces are already accused by friends and family of being proxies for Israel&#39;s occupation of the West Bank. In many cases, the only thing that keeps them from leaving their posts is their monthly pay-cheque. The <small>PA</small> has weathered previous financial storms and paid salaries late, or been unable to pay them in full, in the past. But the latest projected pay cut is far larger. If it goes ahead, tens of thousands of young men in the <small>PA</small> ’s police and national security forces may not show up to work. Some would be ripe recruits for other armed groups in the West Bank including Hamas and Islamist Jihad, the group that may have been responsible for the hospital blast in Gaza. In any case, it is hard to see how unpopular and unpaid security forces will stand their ground if Palestinians try to sack the presidential palace. “The Palestinian public is reaching a boiling point and an explosion against the authority,” says Amjad Bashqar, a Hamas official in Nablus. “The only thing delaying it is our focus on the resistance [against Israel]”. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 17:41:10 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/7jrhu8tbt3bc2iqepkffns4q3sm7b5bs</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/can-the-palestinian-authority-control-gaza-if-hamas-is-ousted </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE want to keep links with Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>T FEELS like</small> an image from an alternate reality.

On October 20th an American destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted cruise missiles that Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen fired towards Israel. That day President Joe Biden said the goal of Hamas&#39;s attack was to prevent a peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. “I was about to sit down with the Saudis….the Saudis wanted to recognise Israel,” he said. The oil price, a barometer of regional escalation risk, has hit $92 per barrel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Gulf states had hoped this would be a year of de-escalation <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause">in the region</a> . They wanted calm to focus on ambitious plans to diversify their economies. Now the region&#39;s oldest conflict has roared back to life. For one Gulf monarchy, Qatar, which has supported Hamas, the immediate goal is self-preservation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> ), however, want to weaken Hamas, forestall a wider confrontation with Iran and somehow keep alive their vision of an autocratic but more peaceful and prosperous region. It is a delicate and dangerous balancing act.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Qatar looks vulnerable. It is both an American ally and a supporter of Hamas. Since October 7th, when Hamas militants murdered more than 1,400 people in Israel, those ties have become a source of embarrassment and nervousness. Some of Hamas&#39;s leadership lives in Doha, the Qatari capital. The gas-rich emirate donates up to $30ma month to Hamas-run Gaza. For years Qatar has told allies that its ties with Hamas were a benefit: it could be an interlocutor between those groups and the West.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For now Qatar is scrambling to show that it can still be useful to America. On October 20th Hamas freed two of the more than 200 hostages it seized during the rampage, both American-Israeli dual citizens, in a deal that Qatar helped broker. But there are also signs of denial and panic in the tiny, wealthy state. On October 14th, a Qatari diplomat contacted your correspondent to say that Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, was not in Doha but in Turkey. Hours later, Iran&#39;s foreign minister held a televised meeting with Mr Haniyeh—in Doha. Qatar&#39;s ties with Islamist groups were one reason why four Arab states imposed a <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/06/10/saudi-arabia-cuts-off-qatar">travel-and-trade embargo</a> on the tiny emirate in 2017. When the dust settles on this war, the country could come under greater American pressure to sever its links with militant groups.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>UAE</small> , which in 2020 became the first Gulf state to recognise Israel, has taken a different stance. Unlike most of its neighbours, its initial statement on the October 7th attack was one of sympathy with Israel, and its leaders made multiple condolence calls to their Israeli counterparts. They loathe political Islam, which they see as a threat, and in private are scathing in their criticism of Hamas.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hours after the explosion at Gaza&#39;s Ahli Arab hospital on October 17th, the Israeli army denied that it targeted the facility in an air strike (and the evidence, so far, seems to support its denial). The <small>UAE</small> still joined other Arab states in condemning Israel. Such statements, however, should be taken as diplomatic theatre: ties between the two countries remain solid.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi Arabia has tried to chart a middle course. Its response to the Hamas attack was to cite a list of Israel&#39;s past misdeeds and call for an immediate ceasefire—the sort of statement it always issues after flare-ups in the Holy Land. But there are also signs that its stance has shifted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On October 17th Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who led the kingdom&#39;s intelligence service from 1979 to 2001, spoke in English to an American think-tank. His words carry weight as a former mandarin and a member of the royal family. He denounced Hamas for killing civilians and suggested it was un-Islamic. He condemned Israel too, for both its “indiscriminate bombing” in Gaza this month and the crimes of its half-century occupation. He made little mention of Iran, which is Saudi Arabia&#39;s regional nemesis and one of Hamas&#39;s main backers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A day later Al Arabiya, a Saudi-owned news channel, aired a tough interview with Khaled Meshaal, the former head of Hamas. Rasha Nabil, the presenter, asked him repeatedly how Hamas could expect support from other Arab countries after it made a unilateral decision to go to war, pressed him to condemn the murder of Israeli civilians and needled him on whether Iran&#39;s help had “lived up to your expectations”. It was an interview the likes of which Hamas officials are almost never subjected to on Arabic-language channels. Mr Meshaal seemed rattled. Clips of the interview were widely shared on social media and even on Israeli television.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Three conclusions can be drawn about Saudi Arabia&#39;s intentions. First, it wants to undercut Hamas. Second, it wants to avoid a broader confrontation with Iran. Prince Turki implied that rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran was still alive. The two foes agreed in March to reopen embassies and ease their years-long feud. The Saudis are nervous that a regional war could lead to Iranian-sponsored attacks on the kingdom, like the one in 2019 that briefly disabled half of its oil production.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lastly, Saudi Arabia is not shutting the door on <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/america-israel-and-saudi-are-at-the-cusp-of-a-deal">normalisation with Israel</a> . America spent much of this year pushing for a deal that would have seen the Saudis recognise Israel; the kingdom wanted a defence pact with America in return. The Saudis had seemed content to push for token gestures toward the Palestinians—not an end to the occupation, merely to make it less painful. Now Muhammad bin Salman (pictured), the Saudi crown prince and the country&#39;s de facto ruler has called for the creation of a Palestinian state along the region&#39;s pre-1967 borders. Talks with Israel will continue, albeit more quietly than before, but the price for Israel will now be higher.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Much now depends on the nature of Israel&#39;s looming ground invasion of Gaza: as the civilian death toll rises the Gulf states will come under growing pressure at home and across the Arab world to condemn Israel and sever ties. Still one thing the Gulf leaders can all agree on: they want the war to end. The financiers gathering in Riyadh this week want to talk about billion-dollar ideas for travel, trade and tourism. None of them is likely to come to fruition if there is a risk of missiles flying overhead. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 12:12:05 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/b0b830gig5bk0sovfbhvfcf1la5k02vr</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/are-the-abraham-accords-over </item><item><title><![CDATA[Mapping the destruction in Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1ey6m750"><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span>F</span> <small>or most</small> Gazans the dull boom of an air strike is a familiar sound.

The Israeli Air Force claims to have dropped nearly 6,000 bombs on the narrow strip of land in the first week of the war—more than the yearly rate of American forces in their operation against Islamic State in 2014-17. Our analysis of satellite images suggests that in this short space of time at least 4.3% of the enclaves&#39; buildings have been destroyed.</p><p class="article__body-text"> To assess the damage caused by the strikes we analysed freely available data from Sentinel-1, a European satellite. It flies over Gaza at least three times every 12 days, and creates an image by bouncing microwaves off the Earth&#39;s surface and measuring the “echo” when they return.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By comparing images taken before the war began with the latest image from October 12th, we identified areas with dramatic changes in signal, a hallmark of damage. We verified the method&#39;s accuracy by applying it to data from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol in the spring of 2022, and comparing it with human-coded assessments. Our method is not perfect. Not all damage can be detected from above. As a result, our numbers, if anything, may be too low. </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Our analysis of Gaza revealed that significant areas of its north may have been damaged or destroyed. The city of Beit Hanoun appears to be the worst hit. Sources on the ground confirm that the Al-Sousi and Ahmed Yassin mosques—which our analysis highlighted as damaged—have been levelled. Overall, our estimates suggest that 11,000 buildings in Gaza are already damaged or destroyed.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Gaza&#39;s population is particularly vulnerable to air strikes. Around 2.2m people live in the sliver of land—40km (25 miles) long and 10km wide—that makes up the strip. All border crossings are closed. In some refugee camps as many as 400 people live in each 100-metre square. Hundreds of thousands have already been displaced. By merging our damage map with fine-grained population data, our analysis suggests at least 92,000 will have no home to return to when the fighting stops. This is about three times our number for roughly the same point of the 2021 war. </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Israel says the strikes have killed hundreds of terrorists and destroyed Hamas command centres. The Ministry of Health in Gaza reports around 3,500 Palestinian lives lost, more than in any other Israel-Gaza conflagration. With bombs still falling, and Israel expected to launch a ground attack, this number is sure to rise. <span>■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <em>Chart sources: European Commission; European Space Agency; OpenStreetMap; UN; <i>The Economist</i></em></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 12:27:50 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8655smnr4pr1i375bdqhgov1tbqfb0oo</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/mapping-the-destruction-in-gaza </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s four unpalatable options for Gaza’s long-term future]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/014%20Briefing%20-%20Israel%20and%20Palestine-738b9e070b24d0d6aa18ecd5376d3942.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE PUBLIC</small> statements Joe Biden made during his lightning visit to Israel on October 18th did not suggest many misgivings about Israel&#39;s impending invasion of the Gaza Strip. In private, however, the American president&#39;s advisers hoped to press Israel&#39;s leaders on an urgent question: what should happen after the war?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israeli officials say they are focused on toppling Hamas from power, in retribution for the massacre it committed in southern Israel on October 7th. “Gaza will no longer be a threat for Israel,” says Eli Cohen, the foreign minister. “We will not agree that Hamas will have any power in Gaza.” Even after the risks of fighting in such a densely populated place were illustrated by a deadly blast on October 17th at Gaza&#39;s Ahli Arab hospital, which Israel blamed on an errant Palestinian rocket, Israel&#39;s stated war aims have not changed.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Four-way stop</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Israel&#39;s post-war plans remain uncertain. It has four main options, all bad ones. First is a prolonged occupation of Gaza, like the one it undertook from 1967 to 2005. Israeli troops would have to secure the enclave and, in the absence of a Palestinian government, might have to oversee basic services as well.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This might please a segment of Israel&#39;s religious right, which still fumes about the withdrawal in 2005 of all Israeli soldiers and settlers from Gaza as the abandonment of a sliver of the biblical homeland of the Jews. But no one else wants to see Gaza reoccupied, given the heavy financial burden and the likelihood of endless bad press and a steady trickle of casualties. Mr Biden warned on October 15th that a lasting occupation would be a “big mistake”. Most Israeli strategists agree.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second option is to wage a war that decapitates Hamas and then leave the territory. This is arguably the worst way forward. Some of Hamas&#39;s leaders and supporters would probably emerge to reconstitute the group. Even if they did not, some other undesirable force would take its place. The Middle East has a history of radical groups taking advantage of ungoverned spaces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The best outcome, from Israel&#39;s perspective, would be the return of the Palestinian Authority ( <small>PA</small> ), which governs parts of the West Bank in co-ordination with Israel. But that path is littered with obstacles. The first is that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, is loth to do it. “I don&#39;t think anybody can be that stupid and think he can go back to Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank,” says Ghassan al-Khatib, a former Palestinian minister.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if Mr Abbas were able to take power that way, he may not want to. Yasser Arafat, the previous president of the <small>PA</small> and longtime figurehead for Palestinian nationalism, had a fondness for Gaza; he lived there for a time after being allowed to return to Palestine in 1994. People close to Mr Abbas say that he, in contrast, views Gaza as a hostile place. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBM922.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Gaza would almost certainly be hostile to Palestinian police sent to secure it. The <small>PA</small> employs around 60,000 people in its security services, which have authority in roughly a third of the West Bank (see map). It cannot control even that limited area: parts of Jenin and Nablus, cities in the northern West Bank, are so restive that the <small>PA</small> ’s forces dare not patrol them lest they be attacked. Morale is low. If Palestinian police returned to Gaza, they would be a target for the remnants of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militants. Hamas and the <small>PA</small> fought a bloody civil war in Gaza after Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006. Hamas eventually prevailed and ejected the <small>PA</small> from the strip in 2007.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nor is security the only question. After Hamas came to power, Mr Abbas told bureaucrats in Gaza to stop working. Hamas hired tens of thousands of supporters to fill the civil service instead, while the <small>PA</small> continued to pay its workers to sit at home. Keeping that bureaucracy would mean working with around 40,000 people hired for their ideological loyalty to Hamas; dismissing it would repeat the mistake of America&#39;s “de-Baathification” programme in Iraq, which threw legions of angry, unemployed men on the streets.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A fourth option would be to cobble together some sort of alternate administration, composed of local notables working closely with Israel and Egypt. Israel relied on that sort of arrangement until the 1990s, before the <small>PA</small> began to take over civil functions in the occupied territories.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There has been talk of trying to enlist Muhammad Dahlan, a former <small>PA</small> security chief who grew up in Gaza, to take the reins after Hamas. But Mr Dahlan has spent the past decade in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> ). He has fallen out with the <small>PA</small> ; in 2016 a Palestinian court convicted him of corruption. There is also bad blood between him and families in Gaza: he led the fighting against Hamas in 2007. “I think that&#39;s an illusion,” says Michael Milstein, a reserve colonel in the Israeli army and an analyst at the Moshe Dayan Centre, a think-tank in Tel Aviv. “I&#39;m not even sure he&#39;d want to come back. He&#39;d be worried people would want him dead.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The case of Mr Dahlan points to a larger problem. The Palestinians have been divided for almost two decades. The split is largely their fault: though Hamas and <small>PA</small> leaders meet every couple of years to pay lip service to reconciliation, neither party wants to compromise. But the schism has also been exacerbated by the divide-and-rule policy of Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, who thought it a useful tool to stymie the Palestinian dream of an independent state. “Netanyahu had a flawed strategy of keeping Hamas alive and kicking,” says Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Both Hamas and the <small>PA</small> rule their statelets as one-party authoritarian regimes. In 2021 Nizar Banat, a critic of Mr Abbas, was beaten to death by Palestinian police at his home in Hebron. Those who oppose Hamas in Gaza risk torture and execution. Most Palestinians choose to keep silent, shunning politics and focusing on their day-to-day struggles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most recent poll from the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research ( <small>PCPSR</small> ) found that 65% of Gazans would vote for Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, in a head-to-head presidential race against Mr Abbas (who would lose the West Bank as well). Hamas would win 44% of the vote in Gaza in a parliamentary ballot, whereas Fatah, Mr Abbas&#39;s faction, would take just 28%.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Between a rock and a crock</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At first glance this would suggest enduring support for Hamas. But such polls offer only a binary choice between militants and incompetents. Fully 80% of Palestinians want Mr Abbas to resign. Hours after the hospital explosion there were protests in cities across the West Bank, where demonstrators chanted: “The people demand the downfall of the president.” He is 87 and has no clear successor. None of his would-be replacements inspires much enthusiasm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In a hypothetical race between Mr Haniyeh and Muhammad Shtayyeh, the <small>PA</small> ’s colourless prime minister, the former would win by a 45-point margin in Gaza and 21 points in the West Bank. Again, this is less a testament to Mr Haniyeh&#39;s popularity than to Mr Shtayyeh&#39;s lack of it: a poll in 2019, after his first 100 days in office, found that 53% of Palestinians did not even know he was the prime minister.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Open-ended questions yield more telling results. When the <small>PCPSR</small> asked Palestinians to name their preferred successor to Mr Abbas, a plurality said they did not know. The second most popular answer, in both the West Bank and Gaza, was Marwan Barghouti, a member of Fatah serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison for orchestrating terrorist attacks in which Israeli civilians were killed. Several of the other top choices, such as Mr Dahlan and Khaled Meshal, a former Hamas leader, do not even live in the Palestinian territories.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Exiles, prisoners—or no one: Palestinian political life is moribund. Palestinians blame this sorry situation on Israel, arguing that the lack of meaningful peace talks has deprived the <small>PA</small> of its <i>raison d&#39;être</i> . “I think Mr Abbas will be the last Palestinian president,” says Mr Khatib. “The whole idea of the Palestinian Authority is that it&#39;s a transition towards a Palestinian state. If there&#39;s no political horizon, then the whole <small>PA</small> becomes irrelevant.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israelis contend that the <small>PA</small> has undermined itself through rampant graft. Billions of dollars in foreign aid have been siphoned off over the past three decades to buy plush villas in Jordan and to pad bank accounts in Europe. Asked to name the main problems in Palestinian society, more people cite their own government&#39;s corruption (25%) than Israel&#39;s continued occupation (19%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is blame enough to share. The result, though, is that Fatah is probably irredeemable in the eyes of most Palestinians, a liberation movement turned ossified and decadent. In recent years even some Israelis had begun to wonder if Hamas could become an interlocutor, following the same path Fatah did decades earlier, from violent militants to pliable bureaucrats.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not only had Hamas appeared focused on trying to improve Gaza&#39;s economy, some of its leaders also seemed amenable to a two-state solution. That would have been a remarkable shift for a group whose charter used to call for Israel&#39;s destruction. Last year Bassem Naim, a member of the group&#39;s political leadership in Gaza, told your correspondent that it was willing to accept “a state on 1967 borders”. Ghazi Hamad, another political official, said much the same a year earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such thoughts now seem naive. Mr Milstein was one of the few prominent Israelis who warned, well before the massacre, that Hamas&#39;s apparent pragmatism was just a ruse. His view, vindicated by awful events, is now a near-universal one in Israel. Even if Hamas were willing to take part in peace talks, an angry, grieving Israeli public would not be a willing partner: the vast majority of Israelis want to obliterate Hamas, not reward it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Two other questions will shape Gaza&#39;s future. One is what role Arab states will play. In private conversations over the past week, several Arab officials floated the idea of a foreign peacekeeping force for the enclave—but most quickly added that their country was not eager to participate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt is not popular in Gaza, both because it has joined Israel in blockading the territory and because of its prior history as Gaza&#39;s ruler from 1948 to 1967. The <small>UAE</small> would be hesitant to play a big role. “We don&#39;t act solo,” says an Emirati diplomat. The same is probably true of Saudi Arabia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel would probably veto any role for Qatar, one of the countries with the most influence in Gaza. For years the emirate has helped stabilise Gaza&#39;s economy with Israel&#39;s blessing, distributing up to $30ma month in welfare payments, salaries for civil servants and free fuel. But its support for Hamas—some of the group&#39;s leaders live there—will now make it suspect. “The whole strategy of Israel during the last decade was to trust Qatar,” says Mr Milstein. “One of the lessons we should learn from this war is that we should not give Qatar any more involvement.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although Arab states do not want to secure Gaza, they may be willing to help rebuild it. After the last big war, in 2014, donors pledged $3.5bn for <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/19/israel-turns-to-financial-weapons-as-well-as-military-ones">reconstruction</a> (though by the end of 2016 they had disbursed just 51% of that). The bill will be even bigger this time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other question is what happens to the <small>PA</small> . Half of Palestinians tell pollsters it should be dissolved. Doing so would deprive many of them of an income (the <small>PA</small> is the largest employer in the West Bank) and probably lead to more violence. But it would also raise the costs of Israel&#39;s occupation and, perhaps, force Palestine&#39;s long-term future back onto Israel&#39;s political agenda after two decades in which it was rarely discussed. “It&#39;s the only card he has left,” says a former confidant of Mr Abbas.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is no lasting solution for Gaza alone. Despite the long schism, Palestinians there still see themselves as part of a larger polity. Anyway, the strip is too small and bereft of natural resources to thrive by itself. Its economy depends on Israel&#39;s: everything from strawberry farms to furniture factories relies on exports to its wealthier neighbour. Whoever takes control, Gaza will be neither stable nor prosperous as an isolated statelet.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The only way to bring enduring quiet to Gaza is through a broader settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If the prospect of a negotiated solution evaporates completely, warns Mr Khatib, “with it, moderate leadership will vanish.” Israel can decapitate Hamas. But it is far less clear that anything better will take its place. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:09:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/u8gvh3f6d072pis8eq4lvopki1alq084</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/israels-four-unpalatable-options-for-gazas-long-term-future </item><item><title><![CDATA[As Israel’s invasion of Gaza nears, the obstacles get more daunting]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Israel%20and%20Hamas-44c74f7dccf7569cf8cf6ad96f96d437.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>OR THE</small> first time in more than 40 years, the Israel Defence Forces ( <small>IDF</small> ) have called up their entire armoured corps, thought to number more than 1,000 tanks. Fully 360,000 reservists have also been mustered, including a civil-defence force of 20,000 people. The additional manpower is intended to bolster the <small>IDF</small> ’s full-time personnel, of roughly 170,000. Although some of these troops are deployed along Israel&#39;s northern border, to ward off a potential attack from Lebanon by the militants of Hizbullah, more are massing in the south, near the Gaza Strip. Israel is poised to begin what is expected to be its biggest military operation since the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Its leaders have said they are determined to destroy Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, in retaliation for its bloodthirsty rampage across southern Israel on October 7th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As <i>The Economist</i> went to press, no assault had materialised. The most obvious reason for the delay was the brief visit to Israel on October 18th of Joe Biden, America&#39;s president. His presence was intended both to show support for Israel and to try to broker some sort of agreement to help Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As it happened, just as Mr Biden was boarding Air Force One on October 17th to head to the region, a deadly explosion racked a hospital in Gaza. The territory&#39;s health ministry said that hundreds of people had been killed. Hamas blamed bombing by the <small>IDF</small> . Israel said a rocket fired by another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, had malfunctioned and fallen on the hospital compound.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Analysis of images and video footage by independent researchers suggested that Israel&#39;s explanation was more plausible. The <small>IDF</small> also released tracking data on rocket launches and intercepted communications among Palestinians that appeared to bear out its account. Palestinian rockets are built in makeshift workshops in Gaza to Iranian designs. Mid-air malfunctions are common: the <small>IDF</small> claims that of over 7,000 rockets fired at Israel since October 7th, at least 450 have fallen within Gaza. Israel points out that the images of the explosion&#39;s aftermath show a charred car park at the centre of the hospital compound, and lots of damage to adjacent buildings, but no crater or structural devastation of the sort that would be expected from the munitions it uses in air strikes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden backed Israel&#39;s version of events. American officials cited their own infra-red satellite data and intercepts as evidence. But the tragedy nonetheless scotched his hopes of reaching a sweeping deal with Arab leaders to get aid into Gaza and at least some civilians out, despite Israel&#39;s blockade of the territory.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Timing is all</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Any agreement depends on the acquiescence of Egypt, with which Gaza has a short border and where deliveries of food and medical equipment are piling up. But the carnage at the Ahli Arab hospital caused such outrage in the Arab world that Jordan quickly cancelled a summit where Mr Biden was to meet Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt&#39;s president, and Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority ( <small>PA</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “There is no point in doing anything at this time other than stopping this war,” said Ayman Safadi, Jordan&#39;s foreign minister. In the end the best Mr Biden could do was secure an Israeli pledge not to obstruct aid deliveries and an Egyptian one to let 20 trucks a day into Gaza. He also announced that America itself would provide $100m in aid to ease the Palestinians&#39; plight.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tragedy at the hospital underlined the slow progress of Israel&#39;s effort to encourage Palestinian civilians to move to the southern part of the Gaza Strip to escape the brunt of the looming battle. The <small>IDF</small> says that only 600,000 or so of the 1.1m residents of northern Gaza have heeded its call. By delaying a wide-ranging deal on humanitarian aid or safe zones where civilians can take shelter, the explosion at Ahli Arab will have set back efforts to persuade the holdouts. As it is, more Gazans have already been killed just by <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/mapping-the-destruction-in-gaza">Israel&#39;s bombing campaign</a> since October 7th than in any previous conflict involving the territory. Inevitably, a ground assault will lead to far more deaths.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Southern Gaza has become extremely overcrowded, with no organised provision of food or shelter for arrivals from the north. Hamas has told Gazans to stay put. What is more, Israeli bombing continues in southern Gaza as well, with reports of refugees from the north being killed in air strikes. A common refrain among Gazans is that nowhere in the territory is safe, and that they might as well stay in the relative comfort of their homes. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Israeli forces along the border with Gaza, Israel" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">There are 995 more</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: EPA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another worry for Israel&#39;s generals is the risk of a war on two fronts. Iran, an ally of Hamas, was caught by surprise on October 7th, according to people familiar with the situation. But it has since urged Hizbullah, a big militant group in Lebanon, to enter the fray. Hizbullah has an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including more accurate ones than Hamas can deploy, which would severely tax Israel&#39;s missile-defence systems.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The possibility of war with Hizbullah is looking likelier by the day, say Israeli insiders. Although Hizbullah might prefer not to invite Israeli retaliation against Lebanon, which is gripped by a dire economic slump, it ultimately answers to its Iranian paymasters, not ordinary Lebanese. On October 16th Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran&#39;s foreign minister, made an ominous warning: “The possibility of pre-emptive action…is expected in the coming hours,” he told Iranian state television. The same day Israel&#39;s government issued an unprecedented order to evacuate 28 Israeli villages within 2km of the border with Lebanon. On October 17th the <small>IDF</small> killed four people attempting to cross a security fence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some ministers and defence officials have suggested that it may be better for Israel to attack Hizbullah pre-emptively, rather than wait for another surprise attack, this time from the north. Israel&#39;s war cabinet, which includes both Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and various political rivals, including former generals, seems inclined to wait while sending more troops to the border.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel may also be waiting for more American firepower to arrive in the region. A flotilla led by an aircraft-carrier is already in the eastern Mediterranean. Another is en route. These forces are intended to deter Iran, Hizbullah and other Iran-aligned militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen from entering the war, or attacking American interests in the Gulf. The American ships&#39; air-defence systems may also be able to provide Israel with additional warning of missile strikes, if not a degree of protection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another potential disruption to Israel&#39;s preparations for war is the West Bank, the other slice of Palestinian territory, with roughly 2.7m inhabitants. The 40% of it that Israel does not administer directly are in the hands of the <small>PA</small> . But Mr Abbas is weak and unpopular. After the tragedy at the Ahli Arab hospital widespread protests broke out against his government. The <small>IDF</small> ’s fear is not so much of a third front, in the form of a popular uprising against Israel, so much as chaos that requires the presence of more Israeli troops. There is also the constant threat of violence between Palestinians and the almost 700,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and the eastern part of Jerusalem.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A final reason for Israel to delay its offensive was an effort to free at least some of the Israeli hostages captured on October 7th. The <small>IDF</small> believes that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups hold 203 of them. Israeli spies have been trying to gather intelligence about where they are being held.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Discussions disrupted</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Quiet talks to secure the release of hostages had been under way. Qatar, which hosts Hamas&#39;s political leadership and has strong ties to the group, had been acting as a go-between. But those diplomatic efforts appeared to collapse on October 17th after the tragedy at the Ahli Arab hospital. Most Arab states, including those who had previously appeared somewhat sympathetic to Israel, such as the United Arab Emirates, blamed the <small>IDF</small> for the disaster, despite Israel&#39;s detailed disavowal of responsibility. That both makes it much harder for Israel to build diplomatic support for a ground war and gives it less reason to delay, now that Mr Biden has left the region.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israeli commanders, at any rate, are getting itchy feet. The <small>IDF</small> began mustering within hours of the atrocities of October 7th. Its forces have been largely in place for almost a week.“We really should get going this weekend,” says a colonel. “You can maintain this level of readiness for two weeks at the most.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The invasion, when it comes, will be hard-fought and bloody. Israel&#39;s leaders have loudly and repeatedly promised to destroy Hamas&#39;s military capabilities for good and end its 16-year rule. That means a campaign of a different order from previous incursions into Gaza, in 2009 and 2014, which aimed merely to diminish Hamas&#39;s military capacity and were followed by a gradual return to the status quo.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the Gaza Strip is a difficult place to fight, for several reasons. First, it is full of dense cities, composed of tightly packed apartment blocks. Such places will limit the invaders&#39; lines of sight and hamper their communications, with the tall buildings impeding radio signals. Civilians could be anywhere, and there will be endless places for Hamas&#39;s fighters to hide.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What is more, Hamas has built a 500km network of tunnels under Gaza—a territory only 40km long and 10km wide. The intention was in part to undercut Israel&#39;s technological advantage in seeing and striking from the air. Even the most sophisticated drones cannot provide much information about what is happening underground. Troops entering the tunnels cannot navigate by <small>GPS</small> or communicate by radio. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_FBP005.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Forty years later, militias in Lebanon remain a threat</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Magnum/Micha Bar-Am</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In its invasion of Gaza in 2014 the <small>IDF</small> struggled to deal with such tunnels. It has since invested heavily in subterranean warfare, setting up special units for the task and constructing a simulacrum of Hamas tunnels for training. It has developed various technical means to hunt for them, including some modelled on the underground surveys conducted by the oil industry, as well as methods based on old-fashioned intelligence—looking for spots where militants&#39; mobile-phone signals suddenly disappear, for instance. Even so, finding and demolishing the tunnel network will be the work of months, if not years, and certainly not a few days.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second concern is the presence of so many Palestinian civilians. American-led assaults on cities during the Iraq war and the Iraqi-led, Western-backed capture of Mosul from Islamic State in 2016-17, were painstakingly planned and conducted with the benefit of copious intelligence. Large numbers of civilians died nonetheless—perhaps as many as 10,000 in the battle for Mosul alone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In theory, international humanitarian law, which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting those on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians—even lots of them—can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportionate “in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. In other words, Israel can legally justify the deaths of civilians as long as they are killed in the crossfire in operations that did not use disproportionate force.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whatever international law might say, however, as civilian casualties mount, so will pressure on Israel to withdraw and accept a ceasefire. Its previous invasions of Gaza, in 2009 and 2014, were quite brief. In both cases, the <small>IDF</small> remained on the ground for about 18 days. That would not be nearly enough time to achieve Israel&#39;s stated goals this time around. It took Iraqi troops nine months of house-to-house combat to subdue Mosul.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That points to perhaps the biggest challenge for Israeli forces in Gaza: not getting bogged down. America&#39;s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and Israel&#39;s war in Lebanon in 1982 (the last time all those tanks were deployed) provide cautionary tales.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s “global war on terror” started triumphantly. Just two months after al-Qaeda&#39;s attacks on America in September 2001, American-led forces were in control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The Taliban government was gone. Al-Qaeda was hounded. Its leader, Osama bin Laden, was tracked to Pakistan and killed in 2011. But the Taliban fought a growing insurgency. Having lost more than 2,400 military personnel, America left in 2021. The Afghan government collapsed almost immediately and the Taliban returned to power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war in Iraq was inglorious, too, and far bloodier. Once again, American forces quickly took the capital, Baghdad, in April 2003. President George W. Bush strutted on the flight deck of the <i>USS Abraham Lincoln</i> , an aircraft-carrier, under the sign: “Mission Accomplished”. In fact, the country was about to slip into civil war. American forces captured Saddam Hussein, Iraq&#39;s dictator, but soon faced bloody insurgencies by both Sunni and Shia militias. All told, America lost some 4,500 service members, not to mention some 300,000 Iraqis who died, most of them civilians.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> History lessons</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel&#39;s own history offers similar warnings. In 1982, amid a series of attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( <small>plo</small> ), the nationalist umbrella group, gunmen shot and wounded Israel&#39;s ambassador in London. The Israeli government took the killing as a <i>casus belli</i> to invade Lebanon and dismantle the <small>plo</small> , even though it was attributed to militants from a rival, the Abu Nidal group. Israeli forces besieged the <small>plo</small> in west Beirut, forcing its leader, Yasser Arafat, and thousands of fighters, to sail into exile. Israel&#39;s Christian ally, Bachir Gemayel, was elected Lebanon&#39;s president.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Then it all fell apart. Gemayel was blown up. In sight of Israeli forces, his Phalangist fighters exacted revenge by killing Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps. An Israeli commission of inquiry found Ariel Sharon, Israel&#39;s defence minister, indirectly responsible. Within a year, under pressure from anti-war protests, Menachem Begin, the prime minister, announced his resignation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One effect of the Lebanese imbroglio was that the <small>plo</small> was replaced by Hizbullah, a more formidable, Shia militia, which succeeded in pushing Israel out of Lebanon in 2000. Another impact was on Palestinians within the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Their first intifada, or “shaking off”, a stone-throwing uprising that started in 1987, set the stage for the Oslo accords between Israel and the <small>plo</small> of 1993. Arafat made a triumphant return to Gaza the following year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hamas emerged as the main force of violent rejectionism and did much to destroy the Oslo accords. It forced Israel out of Gaza in 2005 and won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006. The following year it pushed out the <small>PA</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute, an American think-tank, the lessons are clear. Terrorist and insurgent groups, he argues, resort to spectacular violence to provoke an irrational response. “They know that the harm that they can do to the dominant power is limited,” he says. “They understand that the harm that the dominant power can do to itself is infinitely greater.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:07:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/k3d4pbckcfbhj4voqslfs6mokonaqm91</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-nears-the-obstacles-get-more-daunting</item></channel></rss>
