e190yofl0"><span>直到</span><small>上个月</small>，由巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非组成的<small>外交</small>俱乐部金砖国家的成员来自除中东以外的发展中国家的各个角落。不再：在 8 月 22 日举行的年度峰会上受邀加入欧盟的六个国家中，有四个国家——埃及、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国 ( <small>UAE</small> )——来自该地区。如果他们都接受，中东将占扩大后集团成员国的三分之一以上。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些邀请只是中东正在发生变化的众多迹象之一。富裕的海湾国家正试图将自己打造成不结盟的中等强国。沙特阿拉伯已提出在俄罗斯和乌克兰之间进行调解。<small>阿联酋</small>将主办今年的全球气候峰会（ <small>COP</small> 28），希望扮演石油出口国和绿色能源强国的双重角色。由六名成员组成的海湾合作委员会（ <small>GCC</small> ）是世界经济热点之一，吸引了东西方的人才和超级富豪，并将大量资本部署到海外。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更引人注目的是中东新发现的（相对的）平静。停火平息了也门八年的战争。伊朗和沙特阿拉伯三月份同意缓和长达 40 年的不和。卡塔尔修复了与邻国的关系。该地区甚至与叙利亚残暴的独裁者巴沙尔·阿萨德达成和解。与此同时，美国正在敦促沙特阿拉伯加入《亚伯拉罕协议》，根据该协议，其他四个阿拉伯国家自 2020 年以来已与以色列建立了关系。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">五年前，沙特阿拉伯王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼对事情的发展方向提出了充满希望的愿景。 “我认为新欧洲是中东，”他说。 “下一次全球复兴将在中东。”他的言论符合海湾地区日益流行的说法，即“新”中东将关注经济，而不是民主化、伊斯兰化或其他分散注意力的意识形态。外交将带来稳定，从而促进投资和增长，帮助每个人摆脱过去几十年的动荡。海湾国家长期以来在国内采用这种模式。现在他们想出口它。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中东潜力巨大。首先，也是最明显的，它充满了碳氢化合物。它占世界石油产量的36%、石油出口的46%、天然气产量的22%和液化天然气（ <small>LNG</small> ）出口的30%。这些数字只会上升。该地区储量丰富（石油储量占世界总量的52%，天然气储量占世界储量的43%）且生产成本低廉。在西方石油巨头对投资感到不安之际，海湾公司却在增加产能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">地理位置也很重要：该地区连接欧洲、非洲和亚洲。全球约 30% 的集装箱通过埃及的苏伊士运河，而 16% 的航空货运则通过海湾地区的机场。年轻人口是另一个优势：55%的中东人年龄在30岁以下，而<small>经合组织</small>（主要由富裕国家组成的俱乐部）的人口比例为36%。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">巨大的不幸</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，过去二十年的故事充满了冲突和绝望。首先是2003年美国对伊拉克的不幸入侵。随之而来的是阿拉伯之春的愤怒，带来了动乱，但没有带来民主：所有受影响的国家最终要么恢复独裁，要么陷入内战。伊斯兰暴力和宗派冲突加剧了该地区的困境。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr

src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中东地区人口占世界6%，但经济产出仅占4%。剔除几家大型石油生产商后，这一数字将降至 2% 以下。该地区大部分地区的人均<small>GDP</small>停滞或下降（见图 1）。埃及和黎巴嫩的贫困率飙升，更不用说饱受战争蹂躏的苏丹、叙利亚和也门了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但正在发生的三大转变可能会改变中东在世界上的地位。首先是海湾国家与美国之间的距离日益拉大。连续三任总统都寻求减少美国在中东的军事存在。现任总统乔·拜登并没有试图将民主强加于该地区；而是试图将民主强加于该地区。他甚至似乎对控制伊朗核计划也不太感兴趣。美国还有其他优先事项：与中国的竞争、乌克兰战争、国内政治动荡。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的经济作用也在下降。根据<small>国际货币基金组织的数据，过去 30 年来，中东对中国和印度的出口份额从 5% 攀升至 26%；</small>发往欧美的份额从34%下降到16%。这在很大程度上反映了亚洲对该地区主要出口产品石油的需求旺盛。 20世纪90年代，中国占沙特阿拉伯原油出口量的比例不到1%，印度则不到3%；到 2021 年，这一数字分别为 28% 和 12%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">石油是能源市场第二次转变的核心。该地区正试图成为石油和天然气领域的一支更强大的力量，为摆脱碳氢化合物的转型提供资金，尽管这听起来可能很矛盾。近期高油价带来了一笔意外之财。沙特国有巨头阿美公司 (Aramco) 去年公布的利润达到创纪录的 1610 亿美元，高于 2021 年的 1100 亿美元。该公司计划在未来三年内将产能扩大到每天 100 万桶（约 10%）。<small>阿联酋也</small>有类似的目标。它还使自己成为受到西方制裁的伊朗和俄罗斯石油的中转站。卡塔尔已经是全球最大的<small>液化天然气</small>出口国，计划到 2027 年将产量提高 63%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">所得收益正被投入新产业。沙特阿拉伯没有像以前那样将石油美元存入美国国债，而是开始收购从欧洲足球运动员到电动汽车公司股份的一切资产。今年夏天，沙特与巴西最大的矿业公司达成了价值 26 亿美元的协议，这是到 2030 年在该行业投资 1700 亿美元的计划的一部分。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最后的转变是态度的转变。调查显示，阿拉伯人将经济视为他们最关心的问题。大约三分之一的年轻阿拉伯人表示，生活成本是该地区最大的问题，另外三分之一的人则表示失业；近一半的人表示在自己的国家很难找到工作。当被问及稳定和民主哪个更重要时，82%的人选择前者。越来越多的人认为民主不利于经济增长。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">公民也对政治伊斯兰失去了兴趣。突尼斯选民和埃及士兵迫使伊斯兰政党退出政府。武装伊斯兰主义者未能控制伊拉克、利比亚和叙利亚。去年伊朗<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/07/a-year-after-iran-was-shaken-by-protests-zealots-have-tightened-their-grip">广泛的抗议活动</a>表明民众对其宗教统治者感到失望。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">海湾国家的领导人似乎也有了新的看法。在过去的十年里，他们一直寻求使用武力来改变该地区。他们试图在也门建立一个友好的政府；沙特阿拉伯向叙利亚叛乱分子提供武器；<small>阿联酋</small>试图任命军阀哈利法·哈夫塔尔为利比亚领导人。每次努力都失败了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至少目前，大男子主义外交政策的时代已经结束。最意想不到的外交转变是沙特阿拉伯和伊朗之间的协议。自后者1979年伊斯兰革命以来，他们一直不和，打了一场代理人战争，最终蔓延到伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚和也门。不过，在中国的推动下，两国于 3 月同意重新开放自 2016 年以来一直关闭的大使馆，以减少官方媒体对彼此的批评，并加强经济联系。他们算不上是朋友，但这项协议减少了海湾地区发生冲突的可能性。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最令人不快的转变是阿萨德先生的重返社会。他没有做任何事情来赢得这一荣誉：在摧毁叙利亚以保持权力之后，他没有做出任何改革或和解的姿态。但五月，沙特让他重新夺回叙利亚在阿拉伯联盟的席位。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，紧张局势的缓和带来了一定程度的平静，这可能有助于解释经济前景的改善。<small>国际货币基金组织</small>预计，今年海湾国家经济的非石油部分将增长 4.2%（与去年持平），而石油部分仅增长 1.9%（低于 2022 年的 10.3%）。去年，该地区吸引了全球外国直接投资流量的 6%，高于 2019 年的 3%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">资本市场蓬勃发展。 2023 年第一季度，<small>阿联酋</small>首都阿布扎比的企业占全球<small>IPO</small>数量的 14%。高盛银行估计，中东股票的外资持股比例从 2017 年的 2% 攀升至 10%去年。预计未来几年该地区在新兴市场指数中的权重将从目前的 7% 上升至 10%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国内重大改革正在取得进展：今年第一季度，沙特女性就业率为 31%，而 2017 年同期为 16%。海湾国家也在努力更加严格地发放援助。有些仍然没有附加任何条件：例如，突尼斯在 7 月份意外地从沙特阿拉伯获得了 5 亿美元的救助（其中大部分是贷款）。但埃及不得不通过将国有企业的股份出售给卡塔尔和<small>阿联酋</small>的主权财富基金来筹集资金。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乐观者思考这可能会导致什么结果。中东地区更加平静意味着全球贸易和能源流动的风险会减少，难民也会减少（全球 3500 万难民中，该地区难民人数超过 800 万）。随着西方公司寻求供应链多元化，年轻的中东可能成为新的制造基地。摩洛哥蓬勃发展的汽车工业每年生产约 700,000 辆汽车并维持 220,000 个就业岗位，这证明了一切皆有可能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">该地区还可以开展更多的自营业务。中东内部的贸易仅相当于该地区<small>GDP</small>的 2.9%，而<small>欧盟</small>内部的这一比例为 22%。阿联酋零售巨头 Majid al-Futtaim 和咨询公司麦肯锡的研究人员估计，取消贸易壁垒可能会使该地区的<small>GDP</small>增加 2300 亿美元（5%）。如果沙特阿拉伯和以色列言归于好，与中东最具活力的经济体建立商业联系将成为可能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">基础设施也可以拼接在一起。<small>海湾合作委员会</small>国家长期以来一直在讨论整合其铁路，这些铁路也可以很容易地与伊拉克、以色列和约旦的铁路相连。管道可以将低成本的沙特氢气穿过地中海输送给欧洲消费者；升级后的输电线路可以让阳光充足的地区输出太阳能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是一个诱人的愿景，但也存在许多陷阱。首先是这几年经济发展不平衡。中东长期以来一直存在革命派和保皇党、民族主义者和伊斯兰主义者、逊尼派和什叶派之间的政治分裂。然而，今天最重要的区别是经济上的富裕国家和贫穷国家之间的区别。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">不幸的是，中东大部分地区都很贫穷。即使在地区平静的时期，严峻的经济形势也威胁着这些国家的稳定。仅在过去五年中，自从穆罕默德亲王首次开始谈论地区复兴以来，阿尔及利亚、伊朗、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩和苏丹都发生了大规模抗议活动。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">法老管理不善</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃及作为阿拉伯世界人口最多的国家，情况尤其令人担忧。自 2013 年政变以来执掌该国的士兵阿卜杜勒-法塔赫·塞西 (Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi) 在医疗和教育方面的支出一直低于宪法要求。但他已经找到了资金用于宏伟的项目，例如在沙漠中建造新首都以及为军队大量购买武器（埃及是世界第六大武器进口国）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃及债务占<small>GDP的</small>比例已升至93%，其中36%的贷款以外币计价。其非石油经济已连续33个月收缩，过去90个月中有81个月收缩。过去两年，该货币已贬值一半，并且可能很快会再次贬值。 7 月份年度通胀率创下 38% 的历史新高。今年夏天，由于政府无力进口足够的发电厂燃料，居民们在酷暑中忍受停电。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一场全面的国际收支危机似乎有可能发生。即使政府一瘸一拐地继续前进，当这个最大的国家陷入困境时，也很难重塑该地区。如果骚乱爆发到足够规模，甚至可能损害海湾国家的经济前景。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个风险是，即使是该地区的繁荣国家也无法创造其承诺的就业和增长。无可否认，迄今为止，他们比中东其他地方的同行做得更好。 1975年，沙特和利比亚的人均国内<small>生产总值</small>大致相同；今天，沙特的数字高出 353%。海湾地区和以色列（该地区的另一个繁荣地区）人口仅占中东地区的 14%，但却占中东地区<small>GDP</small>的 60%、货物出口的 73% 和<small>外国直接投资</small>的 75%（见图 2）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但沙特阿拉伯和其邻国一样，正在与深层次的结构性问题作斗争。公民仍然将一份轻松的公共部门工作视为与生俱来的权利。政府雇佣了 53% 的沙特就业人员，尽管这一比例低于 2019 年的 66%。学校不教授适销对路的技能。沙特的工资太高，无法成为制造业中心，至少在没有昂贵的国家补贴的情况下是这样。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">穆罕默德亲王希望到 2030 年，年度外国直接投资将达到 1000 亿美元。去年仅为 80 亿美元。这使得政府成为经济转型的主要推动者，这在两个方面令人担忧。首先，其财务状况受制于石油市场。分析师估计，如果算上主权财富基金的预算外支出，当油价跌至每桶 100 美元以下时，沙特将出现赤字。目前价格约为 90 美元，为近一年来的最高水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次，目前还不清楚政府的多元化投资是否会获得回报。沙特王国的经济蓝图“2030 年愿景”预计，到本十年末，旅游业将占沙特<small>GDP</small>的 10%。官员们声称，该行业将创造 100 万个就业岗位，足以雇佣二十分之一的沙特人，这一比例高于法国或西班牙。但几乎没有证据表明每年将有 1 亿游客涌入。据<small>联合国</small>估计，去年的人数仅为 1600 万人，比该愿景通过的 2016 年减少了约 150 万人。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个担忧是，领导人如此急于掩盖的意识形态争论将在某个时候重新浮出水面。尽管伊朗继续为其流氓核计划生产高浓缩铀，但沙特阿拉伯仍在寻求与伊朗缓和关系。如果该政权进一步制造炸弹，可能会引发地区军备竞赛，甚至引发战争。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img

e190yofl0">过去二十年来，以巴冲突相对缓和，但不太可能永远保持这种状态。圣地的严重冲突可能会动摇阿拉伯与以色列的协议。利比亚、叙利亚和也门的暴力事件已经减少，但潜在的争端仍未解决。上个月，阿萨德在南部省份苏维达面临一波抗议活动。沙特阿拉伯和<small>阿联酋</small>虽然是新中东的主要支持者，但在外交政策和经济问题上经常存在分歧。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最后一个风险是该地区地缘政治平衡的做法是错误的。美国仍然是唯一愿意并且能够在该地区投射军事力量的国家，其对全球金融体系的主导地位赋予其无与伦比的经济影响力。海湾国家不能冒险失去它作为合作伙伴。然而，他们与俄罗斯和中国的调情正在引发华盛顿日益增长的愤怒。美国对<small>阿联酋</small>的几家公司实施了制裁，其中包括一家被指控向俄罗斯供应无人机的公司。由于有指控称中国军队驻扎在阿布扎比港口，该公司推迟了向该国出售<small>F</small> -35战斗机的交易。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">英国智库国际战略研究所的埃米尔·霍卡耶姆指出，海湾国家“在一定程度上基于中国经济持续崛起的假设来规划未来的繁荣”。不过，中国经济也亮起了警灯：增长缓慢、人口老龄化、房地产市场停滞不前。对中国的大赌注会疏远美国，可能会让海湾地区陷入困境。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，穆罕默德亲王并不是第一个对中东复兴大肆宣扬的地区领导人。当前时代与 20 世纪 90 年代有许多相似之处，90 年代该地区似乎试图将暴力的过去抛在脑后。奥斯陆协议似乎预示着以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突的结束。黎巴嫩长期内战已经停止。埃及、约旦和叙利亚的独裁者谈论开放其墨守成规的经济。当时的沙特王储阿卜杜拉·本·阿卜杜勒阿齐兹也是如此，他承诺进行大胆改革，并寻求改善与伊朗的关系。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 1993年，时任以色列外交部长西蒙·佩雷斯写了一本名为《新中东》的书，认为贸易将安抚该地区。 “最终，中东将在一个共同市场中团结起来，”他表示。 “这个共同市场的存在本身将促进维护长期和平的切身利益。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">可悲的是，历史却有不同的想法。以巴和平进程逐渐陷入停滞。美国于 2003 年入侵伊拉克，以色列于 2006 年向黎巴嫩南部派遣军队。事实证明，整个地区的现代化独裁者在现代化方面表现得相当糟糕，从而促成了阿拉伯之春。除了迪拜以外，海湾经济体一直处于石油状态，迪拜本来就没有太多石油。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">和平与发展的时代是一个诱人的愿景，但要实现这一愿景，该地区的独裁者必须认真维护和平，并明智地修复经济。目前的情况给了他们改变的机会，技术和地缘政治力量提供了激励。剩下的就看他们的了。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:59:01

class="article__body-text">实际上，他允许突尼斯人公开种族主义。突然间，许多人可以随意使用以前被视为禁忌的侮辱性词语，其中包括一种针对黑人的侮辱性词语，字面意思是“奴隶”。八月份<i>《经济学人》</i>在街上采访的大多数当地人都使用这个词。 “奴隶正在取代我们，”首都突尼斯的家具修理工尼扎尔说。 “他们正在抢走所有的工作。”更糟糕的是，“他们穿着内衣站在阳台上喝酒。”</p><p class="article__body-text">仇恨的浪潮席卷全国。 7月，在突尼斯第二城市斯法克斯，一名阿拉伯人在与移民的斗殴中被杀，暴徒烧毁了非洲黑人住宿的房屋。房东害怕失去财产，驱逐了黑人房客。当<i>《经济学人》</i>访问时，数百名撒哈拉以南的移民正在市中心露宿，挤在一起寻求保护。</p><p class="article__body-text"> “看看我的头，”来自几内亚的画家穆罕默德指着锤击留下的疤痕说道。他说，暴徒用石头和汽油弹将他赶出了公寓；然后警察抓住了他，把他扔到了沙漠里，没有水。许多移民就这样死去，但穆罕默德却以某种方式回到了斯法克斯。他迫切地想要去欧洲。 </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMcuv4eccCA?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">总统的讲话纯属捏造。没有计划改变突尼斯的人口结构。非洲黑人只占人口的一小部分，而且大部分只是过客。如果他们犹豫不决，那只是因为他们正在为穿越地中海的危险旅程存钱。</p><p class="article__body-text">在演讲之前，由于经济不景气，赛义德先生不受欢迎。此后，他似乎赢得了更多支持。民意调查并不可靠，但 11 月份的一项民意调查显示他的支持率还不到 30%； 6 月份的另一项调查显示，69% 的人会投票给他。</p><p class="article__body-text">他发誓要保护突尼斯人民免受幽灵威胁，从而将他们团结在自己身后。他还转移了对该国弊病的指责。经济学家认为突尼斯的通货膨胀主要是由政府造成的，但来自斯法克斯的穆斯塔法将责任归咎于黑人，他说黑人吃光了所有面包，推高了物价。他计划在下次选举中投票给赛义德先生。</p><p class="article__body-text">总统散播仇恨的行为也分散了人们对他一直在做的其他有争议的事情的注意力，例如压制媒体、清洗司法机构和关闭国家反腐败监管机构。他一直在废除促进良好、廉洁治理的制衡机制，并取得了可预见的结果。突尼斯变得更加恐惧、更加不自由、更加腐败。自2021年赛义德开始废除其年轻而充满希望的民主以来，其在监督机构透明国际编制的清廉指数（ <small>CPI</small> ）上的得分显着恶化。</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span><meta><img src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/814/90/media-assets/image/20230902_FBC328.png"

alt></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">突尼斯反映了一种全球趋势：越来越多的领导人正在利用民族主义作为积累权力并滥用权力的工具（见图 1）。尽管民族主义曾经是瓦解可悲的殖民帝国的一种手段，但它正日益成为消除对政府权力的合法限制的手段。对制衡感到不满的领导人需要一个借口来废除它们。他们不能承认他们想要压制媒体并清洗法院，因为他们发现遵守规则令人厌烦，并且更愿意以不受约束的权威进行统治。因此他们指责记者和法官是叛徒或外国势力的代理人。</p><p class="article__body-text">民族主义可以是积极的，也可以是消极的。积极的一面——热爱自己的国家——可以成为一股向善的力量。亚沙·蒙克在《伟大的实验：如何让多元化民主发挥作用》一书中写道：“这是人们之间团结的最坚实基础，否则他们可能没有什么共同点。” “最好的情况是，它可以激励生活在田纳西州农村的白人基督徒对生活在洛杉矶的西班牙裔无神论者感到特别关心，反之亦然。”因为它是良性的，而且除了少数西方大学外，几乎所有政治家都拥护毫无争议的、积极的民族主义。几乎没有人会承认自己不爱自己的国家。</p><p class="article__body-text">危险在于他们拥护消极的民族主义：外来者的恐惧和怀疑。局外人可能是外国人，也可能是国内少数民族。也许因为这种偏执的变体是基于根深蒂固的本能——保护自己部落的愿望——所以它非常有效。</p><p class="article__body-text">当人们感到自己的国家受到威胁时，他们就会奋起保卫国家，有时甚至是英勇的。当弗拉基米尔·普京入侵乌克兰时，乌克兰人为抵抗他做出了巨大牺牲。这对乌克兰有利，否则乌克兰就会成为一个附庸国。它还提高了乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽伦斯基的民意支持率：人们团结在这位领导国家国防的人周围。</p></div><p class="article__body-text">唉，不择手段的领导人发现，他们可以通过发誓保护人民免受虚假威胁来赢得类似的民意调查。普京声称，他对乌克兰的无端攻击实际上是为了保卫俄罗斯免受西方侵略和乌克兰纳粹的侵害。许多俄罗斯人相信他。尽管这场战争给俄罗斯带来了鲜血、财富和国际孤立的代价，但独立民意调查显示，自战争开始以来，普京的支持率有所上升。</p><p class="article__body-text">偏执的民族主义的主要缺点是显而易见的。这对于其目标来说是可怕的，无论他们是突尼斯的移民还是土地上埋有地雷的乌克兰人。偏执的民族主义政权的邻国有理由感到紧张，与俄罗斯或中国接壤的任何地方都可以证明这一点。</p><p class="article__body-text">另一个大缺点不太为人所知：基于偏执的政治为暴政和腐败打开了大门。过去二十年来，随着普京加强民族主义宣传，他的亲信一直在掠夺俄罗斯。尽管他无疑是最极端的例子，但他并不孤单。事实上，民族主义和腐败之间存在明显的统计相关性。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>《经济学人》</i>分析了瑞典哥德堡大学附属智库 V-Dem 研究所的数据。每年它都会要求专家描述世界各国政府如何向选民或公民证明自己的合理性。然后它会根据结果创建一个比例。按人口对各国进行加权后，我们发现 2012 年至 2021 年间，各国政府变得更加依赖民族主义来为自己辩护。 （具体来说，是包含民族主义元素的意识形态。它还可能包含其他元素，例如民粹主义或伊斯兰主义。）这种变化是重大的：一个典型的公民看到她的国家使用民族主义的增加大致相当于中国的增加在“战狼”国家主席习近平的领导下。</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span><meta><img

2012 年至 2021 年公共部门腐败认知数据结合起来。利用统计模型，我们发现，如果政府依靠民族主义言论来维持权力，专家认为公共部门的腐败程度要高得多（见图2）。此外，回顾2012年，通过比较不同时期的国家，我们发现民族主义言论越多，腐败越多，民族主义越少，腐败越少。在控制了平均收入及其变化以及全球民族主义和腐败趋势后，这两个发现仍然成立。</p><p class="article__body-text">也有明显的例外（例如，中国变得更廉洁、更沙文主义），但这种关系在统计上是显着的：民族主义每增加一个标准差，腐败就会猛增 5.31（范围从 0 到 100）在比较国家时，在内部比较时跃升 0.13 个百分点。后者可能看起来很小，但腐败分数通常不会有太大变化。有趣的是，当民族主义首先出现时，它就预示着未来腐败的增加。</p><p class="article__body-text">为什么会这样呢？ <small>TI</small>的负责人丹尼尔·埃里克森 (Daniel Eriksson) 提出了民族主义助长权力滥用的三种方式。政治家可能会煽动民族主义热情来赢得或保住职位。通过给予他们的亲属或亲信影响力，他们可能会试图夺取国家。通过将批评者称为叛徒，他们可能会削弱防止掠夺公共资金的制衡机制。</p><p class="article__body-text">诉诸民族主义是有效的，因为它们简单易懂，而且比任何基本的政策建议都更加情绪化。 “投票给我，我将为学校做出渐进式的改进”是一个很好的平台，但却是一个乏味的口号。 “隔壁的部落正在攻击我们！”是一个令人振奋的。</p></div><h2>选择你的毒药</h2><p class="article__body-text">敌人可以有多种形式。可能是移民，就像突尼斯那样。或者是地缘政治对手：中国和俄罗斯的宣传不断妖魔化美国。或者少数派信仰：印度执政党夸大占人口不到 15% 的穆斯林对占多数的印度教徒构成的不存在的威胁。</p><p class="article__body-text">或者敌人可能是文化变革。许多民族主义领导人将任何令人不舒服的新社会趋势描述为外国人，甚至是外国人企图颠覆其国家价值观的恶毒企图。伊朗政权利用这一论点来讨论妇女权利；乌干达关于对同性恋者的宽容。非自由政权习惯性地将他们反对的价值观描述为外来价值观，这比解释他们为什么错了要容易。</p><p class="article__body-text">每个民族主义领导人都是独一无二的，很难判断哪些人相信自己的言论。无论哪种方式，偏执的民族主义都为他们提供了获得权力、巩固权力并掩饰滥用权力的工具。</p><p class="article__body-text">以尼加拉瓜为例。总统丹尼尔·奥尔特加曾经是一位革命马克思主义者。他于 1979 年一路上台，但在 1990 年的选举中失利。为了重新获得并保留权力，他压制了自己的马克思主义，加大了反美的夸夸其谈，赢得了 2006 年的选举，并从那时起逐渐扼杀了民主。</p><p class="article__body-text">他对妖怪的选择是精明的。四十年前，美国确实资助了他的国家的暴力革命者。这种威胁早已不复存在，但奥尔特加先生仍然声称他的对手是“洋基帝国的代理人”，“很久以前就不再是尼加拉瓜人了”。今年二月，他剥夺了 300 多名持不同政见者的公民身份。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280"

class="article__body-text">按照埃里克森先生的剧本，奥尔特加先生让他的亲属掌握了权力。他的副总统和可能的继任者是他的妻子罗萨里奥·穆里略(Rosario Murillo)。他们的九个孩子中有八个帮助他们管理国家。他们的儿子劳雷亚诺是总统顾问。他监督了与一家中国公司就修建横跨尼加拉瓜、耗资 500 亿美元的运河的谈判。该项目于 2015 年因诈骗指控而失败。劳雷亚诺也是一位歌剧歌手。并非所有歌剧迷都相信他的才华。一位评论家将他的声音比作“山羊分娩时的尖叫声”。但他经常在由他经营的基金会支持的歌剧中担任主角，该基金会由尼加拉瓜纳税人资助。</p><h2>盗窃独裁者</h2><p class="article__body-text">奥尔特加家族经营着尼加拉瓜的主要电视频道。这让他们能够偏向对自己有利的消息。这也是有利可图的。 2018年至2020年间，尼加拉瓜政府从奥尔特加斯家族拥有或控制的三大<small>电视</small>频道购买了价值约5900万美元的广告，而在与他们无关的频道上花费了区区23万美元。据信该家族总共控制着从能源到房地产等行业的 22 家公司。按照<small>TI</small>的规模计算，尼加拉瓜的腐败程度比 2012 年高出 10 个百分点，目前排名低于刚果。</p><p class="article__body-text">在更富裕、更成熟的民主国家，偏执的民族主义也为局外人提供了一种吸引注意力、闯入国家政治或保持领先地位的快捷方式。五月，匈牙利总理维克多·欧尔班在一次保守派会议上声称，“我们都受到了攻击。”他发誓要捍卫匈牙利人免受移民、伊斯兰教和同性恋权利的侵害。他宣布匈牙利各民族团结一致，包括邻国的匈牙利人。他给他们养老金，并让他们在匈牙利选举中投票；他们倾向于投票给他。因此，煽动民族主义帮助他赢得了四次选举。</p><p class="article__body-text">匈牙利媒体现在主要由欧尔班先生的亲信控制，鹦鹉学舌地重复他关于外国阴谋的说法。当来自欧盟的大量援助流入他的密友的口袋，国家资产被转移到他的盟友控制的基金会时，温和的法院很少提出反对意见。洛林克·梅萨罗斯 (Lorinc Meszaros) 是欧尔班先生的前同学，拥有一家规模不大的管道配件企业，现已成为匈牙利首富，福布斯估计其财富为 14 亿美元。</p><p class="article__body-text">在匈牙利和其他地方，民族主义为削弱制衡提供了一个听起来合理的借口。看门狗可以被指定为“外国代理人”并被绝育。 Honest public servants can be labelled “unpatriotic” and replaced with loyalists. Dodgy dealings can be kept secret in the name of national security.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin was a pioneer of this approach. In 2012 he introduced a law restricting the activities of <small>ngo</small> s that received money from abroad. In 2022 he broadened the law&#39;s scope. Now the state can declare any individual or group to be a “foreign agent” (which sounds to many ears like “spy”) if it deems them to be “under foreign influence”. So-called “foreign agents” can be banned from any kind of political activity, or simply shut down.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Elements of the Putin method have been widely imitated around the world. At least 50 countries have enacted rules to curb civil society in recent years, according to Amnesty International. More broadly, of the 31 countries that showed a significant deterioration on the Corruption Perceptions Index between 2012 and 2022, 80% also suffered a constriction of civil liberties, as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister organisation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Labelling watchdogs “foreign agents” impedes their work. Nervous local donors grow reluctant to fund feisty <small>ngo</small> s; advertisers shun independent media, lest their brand names be tarnished by association. India has used its Foreign Contributions Regulation Act to harass and muzzle groups from Oxfam to Greenpeace. China&#39;s “foreign influence” rules restrict the activities of any foreign-linked <small>ngo</small> that might annoy the Communist Party.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In July Zimbabwe&#39;s president signed a “Patriotic Bill” allowing long jail terms for anyone caught “wilfully damaging the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe”. The opposition says it criminalised criticism of the government in the run-up to an election last week, which the ruling party “won” unfairly.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Despite its name, the bill seems designed to make Zimbabwe worse-governed. It makes it hazardous for members of civil society, the principal check on a thieving ruling party, to have any contact with foreigners. If an independent journalist talks to a foreign diplomat, or a local election-monitoring group shares data with an international one, or an anti-corruption watchdog seeks advice from an expert abroad, jail may await. As a cherry on top, the law also makes it harder to punish predatory officials, by requiring prosecutors to prove that those who abuse office knew that their actions were wrong.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In country after country, incumbents have found that nationalist or sectarian arguments can be used to harass or exclude from office those who challenge the status quo. Iran&#39;s corrupt theocracy insists that all presidential candidates meet its definition of Islamic piety. In 2021 it disqualified 585 of them, including all the would-be reformers, and allowed only seven to run. A new Polish law could bar from office politicians deemed to be unduly influenced by Russia; its probable target is Donald Tusk, a leading opposition candidate who is not pro-Russian at all. Since 2015, when Poland&#39;s nationalist ruling party took charge, the country has grown eight points grubbier on the Corruption Perceptions Index.</p><h2> Shades of greed</h2><p class="article__body-text"> A more nationalist government does not automatically mean a more corrupt one. It is possible for a country to become more tub-thumping, but no dirtier, at least for a while. However, in the long run, if a leader uses nationalism to erode checks and balances, it becomes easier for the people around him or his successors to plunder. This happened in Zimbabwe, where a nationalist autocrat who was far more interested in power than money, Robert Mugabe, failed to stop looting by his cronies and was ultimately overthrown by them.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Thus, regardless of the starting point, paranoid nationalism tends to make countries worse governed and less stable. A paper co-written by Abhijit Banerjee, a Nobel prize-winning economist, found that when voters pick candidates by ethnicity instead of, say, probity or competence, they end up with less honest, less competent representatives.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Andreas Wimmer of Columbia University crunched data from nearly 500 civil wars and found that when political parties are ethnically based, civil war is nearly twice as likely. And instability is perhaps 30 times as likely if the country in question is neither a dictatorship (which can crush unrest before it escalates) nor a full democracy (where disputes are typically resolved peacefully).

Most of the few that have reached the state, however, including Hilary, have coincided with El Niño, a weather pattern that temporarily raises global temperatures while redistributing heat and moisture around the world.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Meteorologists predict that the current El Niño, which began in June, will be a strong one—perhaps as severe as the one that ended in 2016, which helped make that year the hottest ever recorded. If they are right, the record is almost certain to fall this year or next. “We are in uncharted waters,” says Maarten van Aalst, director of the Dutch meteorological agency and former head of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “We have never had an El Niño on top of so much global warming, so we don&#39;t know what is going to happen.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> El Niños form and eventually dissipate owing to interactions between the trade winds that blow to the south of the equator and the ocean beneath them. The resulting accumulations of hotter- or colder-than-average water and high or low pressure in the atmosphere affect temperatures, winds and rainfall. Most of the time, the trade winds blow warm water from the central Pacific westward, towards Australia and Asia. That movement, in turn, helps draw cooler water up from the depths in the eastern Pacific, near South America. But every two-to-seven years, conditions conspire to create a vast pool of warmer-than-average surface water all the way across the Pacific, as far as South America.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> • <a href="/podcasts/2023/08/30/el-nino-is-back-and-could-bring-devastation-far-beyond-extreme-weather">Listen to experts on our science podcast discuss why the current El Niño is alarming climatologists</a> .</p></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Peruvian fishermen named this phenomenon after the baby Jesus ( <i>el niño Jesus</i> in Spanish) because it tends to reach its peak around Christmas. It is of more than passing interest to them: the vast shimmering shoals of <i>anchovetas</i> on which their livelihood depends prefer colder water, and so vanish when El Niño appears.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In recent weeks small fishing boats in the port of Pisco have been unloading species rarely found nearby: butterfish, sierra, sardines. Meanwhile, the industrial fishing fleet, which relies on <i>anchovetas</i> , languishes in the harbour. Farther down the waterfront, factories that normally grind its catch into fishmeal are shuttered. No smoke billows from their chimneys; no fishy odour lingers in the air. An industry with exports of $2bn a year has been brought to a standstill.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The hiatus has contributed to an economic contraction in Peru and is likely to keep global fishmeal prices high for much of the year. That, in turn, will raise costs for the fish farms and livestock businesses around the world that use the stuff as feed. But those are only the beginnings of El Niño&#39;s impacts. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toKK4bGaKWQ?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> The tropical Pacific is so immense that the warming of its surface by an extra degree or two is enough to supercharge the global climate. More water evaporates, which warms the upper atmosphere and fuels tropical thunderstorms. Convection carries this additional energy to colder regions to the north and south, on either side of the equator. The spinning of the Earth spreads the energy east, as well. The net result is a vast redistribution of heat and moisture. In climate jargon, El Niño is a prime example of the “teleconnection” of the world&#39;s weather systems.</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/676/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/106/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/158/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/211/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/317/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/338/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/423/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/528/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/676/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBM988.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> No two El Niños are the same, but some general patterns exist. Broadly speaking, the Amazon Basin, Australia, the Indian subcontinent, the Sahel, South-East Asia and southern Africa often suffer drier conditions; Central and East Asia, the Horn of Africa, the southern cone of South America and the southern United States tend to get wetter (see map). Sometimes, the consequences can be devastating. A relatively mild El Niño in 2018-19 helped to fuel some of the worst wildfires in Australia&#39;s history. The exceptionally strong El Niño of 2014-16 brought droughts and floods that left some 60m people around the world short of food, drove huge outbreaks of Zika virus across South America and bleached 29% of Australia&#39;s Great Barrier Reef.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At times, the changes in the weather can also bring benefits. This year rains in Argentina are expected to increase grain production, breaking a long drought. El Niño years typically yield milder Atlantic hurricane seasons, reducing damage to property and crops (though that may not hold this year because of unusually hot waters in the North Atlantic). El Niño&#39;s impacts are hugely varied, too, going far beyond fisheries and agriculture. In 2015 production at a lithium plant in northern Chile that accounted for 30% of the world&#39;s output was disrupted by heavy rain. The ensuing jitters in the lithium market were not something forecasters had predicted.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such diversity makes it hard to assess whether the overall effect of El Niño is positive or negative for the world economy. A study by researchers at the International Monetary Fund published in 2016 found that El Niño had little effect one way or the other. But a paper published earlier this year in <i>Science</i> by Christopher Callahan of Stanford University and Justin Mankin of Dartmouth College finds that the El Niño cycles of 1982-83 and 1997-98 permanently reduced global <small>gdp</small> by $4.1trn and $5.7trn respectively. The first cycle, however, coincided with a period when the Federal Reserve, America&#39;s central bank, was raising interest rates; the second with the Asian financial crisis. In both periods, in other words, as El Niño unfolded, other completely unrelated factors were also curbing economic growth in emerging markets. Disaggregating the impact of these different events is extremely difficult.</p><p class="article__body-text"> All analyses, however, agree that poor countries are hit harder by El Niño than rich ones. Even in the <small>IMF</small> study that found little overall impact, big costs in the developing world were offset by higher agricultural yields in the United States in particular. Inflation, meanwhile, rose almost everywhere as commodity prices jumped.</p><h2> ENSO on ENSO on</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The more severe the El Niño, naturally, the bigger the impact. According to the latest forecast from <small>NOAA</small> , the American government&#39;s meteorological agency, there is a 66% chance that the current one will be “strong”. The assessment rests on the rise in surface temperatures above the norm within a specific area of the Pacific known as “Niño 3.4”. A 1.5°C rise constitutes a strong event; more than 2°C counts as “very strong”, on a par with the biggest El Niños of the past century. The previous El Niño, in 2018-19, peaked inside Niño 3.4 at 0.9°C. A climatologist calls it a “little futz of an El Niño”. The one before that, in 2014-16, spanned two winters and peaked at 2.6°C (see chart). Global average temperatures reached successive records in 2015 and 2016. According to Michelle L&#39;Heureux, who co-ordinates <small>NOAA</small> ’s El Niño forecast updates, there is a 30% chance that this year&#39;s will end up just as mighty.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span><meta><img src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/231/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/346/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/461/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/692/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/738/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/922/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1153/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1476/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBC223.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Three factors are likely to compound this El Niño, bringing new extremes. First, it arrives right on the heels of three consecutive years of La Niña, the inverse of El Niño, when winds propel warm Pacific water more strongly than usual westward, towards Asia, temporarily reducing global temperatures. The wind patterns that dominate during La Niña tend to push heat deeper into the ocean. Some of that heat resurfaces during subsequent El Niños. Three straight years of La Niña mean there is more heat to be released.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But it is not just La Niña that has been storing heat in the world&#39;s oceans. So has global warming. For decades researchers have been taking the temperature not only at the surface but also at depths of up to 2,000 metres. Since the 1990s these deeper waters have been running an ever-rising fever. Some climate researchers are wondering whether the off-the-charts surface temperatures observed in the past month or so around the world&#39;s oceans could be linked to this pelagic flu.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Although El Niño does cause surface temperatures to rise outside the Niño 3.4 region, that usually does not happen until much later in the year. A possible explanation of the early surge in temperatures is that some of the heat accumulated in the deep ocean is starting to resurface. “Perhaps we&#39;re beginning to see some of that redistribution of heat now manifesting itself,” says Piers Forster of the University of Leeds in Britain.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The theory that shifting thermal dynamics within the oceans may be intensifying this El Niño is not yet proved, but there is no question that global warming more broadly is set to make El Niños worse. “As climate change unfolds, the impacts for a given El Niño are not the same, they&#39;re bigger,” says Adam Scaife of the Met Office, Britain&#39;s meteorological agency. Global warming means the air is more charged with water, rainfall fluctuations are increasing, “and therefore, a given El Niño with the same strength as we had in the past can dump more water or cause a bigger drought.” Whereas the “triple dip” La Niña masked some warming, making temperatures cooler than they would otherwise have been, an El Niño will amplify it.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> “I am confident that 2024 will be unprecedented in terms of global temperatures,” says Dr Scaife. Currently, the planet is 1.26°C warmer than before the invention of the steam engine. As a rule of thumb, climatologists say, every degree of warming in the Niño 3.4 region during an El Niño temporarily adds 0.07°C to global average temperatures. A strong or very strong event could therefore push the total rise in the average temperature to 1.4°C.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That means that the regions that often suffer drought and wildfires during El Niño—Australia, Indonesia and parts of the Amazon Basin—are at heightened risk. In Australia alone, even the weak El Niño of 2019 helped to incinerate 240,000 square kilometres of bush, killing nearly 500 people, destroying thousands of homes and wiping out A$5bn ($3.5bn) of crops and livestock. This year&#39;s El Niño is likely to be compounded by the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole ( <small>IOD</small> ), a weather pattern characterised by fluctuating surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean that further accentuates dry conditions in Australia and Indonesia. Three years of heavy rains under La Niña, meanwhile, have boosted plant growth. Lingering moisture in the soil and plants may offer some protection. But if all that vegetation dries out, it will fuel fiercer blazes. To make matters worse, heavy rain and shortening winters have shrunk the window to carry out controlled burns, which are used to reduce the amount of fire-prone vegetation. New South Wales, Australia&#39;s most populous state, has conducted only 20% of its scheduled burn this year, according to Greg Mullins, a former fire commissioner.</p><h2> Dipolar disorder</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The <small>IOD</small> can also reinforce the wet conditions that El Niño typically brings to east Africa. On the face of things, that should be a positive after years of drought. But the rainfall is likely to be excessive, and might flood farmland and damage the roads used to bring crops to market. “We are on watch,” says Laura Harrison of the Climate Hazards Centre at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Disasters of this sort will also create havoc in agricultural markets. As it is, India&#39;s government has declared a ban on exports of certain types of rice, in anticipation of drier-than-usual conditions while the current crop is growing. The ban affects about half of India&#39;s annual exports, which in total account for 40% of the global trade in rice by volume. It has sent world rice prices to their highest level since 2011.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The outlook for the rice market may get worse before it gets better. El Niños have in the past driven down rice yields: in 2015-16 South-East Asia&#39;s crop declined by 15m tonnes, 7% of global stocks. The spectre of potential shortages has prompted panic-buying among Asian governments since the beginning of the year. Indonesia, for example, has been snaffling up rice from Vietnam, the third-largest exporter after India and Thailand.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Wheat, too, could be in for a wild ride. Australia produces 12-15% of the global crop and yields can halve in El Niño years. “Given the precarious situation of the wheat market, with the Russia-Ukraine war and other things, that Australian wheat crop is a very important one, and one we&#39;re watching closely,” says Paul Hughes of <small>S&amp;P</small> Global Commodity Insights, a research firm.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Palm oil is another vulnerable product. A drought in Indonesia and Malaysia, the two biggest exporters, would diminish yields. <small>S&amp;P</small> Global reckons that Malaysian exports could fall by 10% if the incipient El Niño is mild and double that if it is severe. After Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine last year, palm oil helped make up for a dearth of sunflower oil, 75% of which is normally produced by the two adversaries. El Niño will thus come as a second blow to the already stretched market for edible oils.</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Fishermen take a break after fishing anchovy"></span><figcaption> Not what they wanted for Christmas</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Another likely outcome of a strong El Niño is an increase in disease. Viruses replicate more quickly in vectors like mosquitoes as temperatures rise. Mosquitoes also bite more in the heat. Heavy rainfall creates more places for insects to breed, as can droughts, as people collect more water in accessible receptacles. Research collated by the World Health Organisation found that the dry conditions associated with El Niños across two decades boosted malaria cases in Colombia and Venezuela by more than a third. A strong El Niño in 1997-98 was associated with big malaria epidemics in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. This year heavy rains and floods exacerbated Peru&#39;s worst-ever outbreak of dengue, overwhelming hospitals in the north.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Flooding can result in poor sanitation, causing an increase in diarrheal diseases. The displacement and overcrowding that occurs after disaster strikes makes such outbreaks worse. If the Horn of Africa is indeed drenched by rain, a surge in cholera cases is likely.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Malnutrition exacerbates vulnerability to disease, particularly in the very young or very old. Save the Children, a charity, claims that the disruption brought by the El Niño of 2015-16 left an additional 6m children worldwide undernourished, three times the number affected in the same way by covid-19. And the pandemic has left health services overstretched and weakened. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a health charity, estimates that covid led to the biggest sustained decline in immunisation rates in 30 years, prompting a surge in outbreaks of preventable illnesses such as measles.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The fact that many of these ill-effects are foreseeable does at least mean that governments and aid agencies can try to prepare for them. Since 2015 the humanitarian community has increasingly been incorporating seasonal forecasts into their planning, explains Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a climate forecaster at Columbia University and the Red Cross. In Honduras, for instance, the Red Cross activated an emergency protocol at the end of June based on the El Niño forecast issued by <small>NOAA</small> . It is distributing cash and kits to sanitise water to places at risk of drought.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But careful preparation only gets you so far, especially in poor countries with weak institutions and widespread corruption. Since the last strong El Niño, Peru has shuffled through six presidents. Precious little of the $14bn set aside for rebuilding and climate-proofing had been invested before floods and landslides hit the same areas again this year.</p><p class="article__body-text"> More climate-related disasters will probably only deepen popular discontent and dysfunctional politics in Peru, further eroding the government&#39;s capacity to respond. In fact, oscillations in the climate have spurred the rise and fall of civilisations in South America for thousands of years. El Niño, writes author Brian Fagan, “can destroy the people&#39;s faith in the legitimacy of their leaders and in the foundations of their society”. Fempellec, a legendary ruler of an ancient Peruvian kingdom, provides a salutary example. According to myth, after sustained, unseasonable rains laid waste to crops, his people decided he was to blame. So they tied him up and tossed him into the sea. <span>■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>For more coverage of climate change, sign up for the <a href="/newsletters/the-climate-issue">Climate Issue</a> , our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our <a href="/climate-change">climate-change hub</a> .</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 24 Aug 2023 12:47:07 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/d56htlo5ta05tv3jtuuopgtfdsgg62sh</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/24/el-nino-and-global-warming-are-mixing-in-alarming-and-unpredictable-ways </item><item><title><![CDATA[China’s defeated youth]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Generation%20Stagnation-5b74b0eeebb6f535254c9a4bbc148da0.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>N THE SOUTHERN</small> city of Huizhou an electronics factory is hiring. The monthly salary on offer is between 4,500 and 6,000 yuan (or $620 and $830), enough to pay for food and essentials, but not much else. The advertisement says new employees are expected to “work hard and endure hardship”. The message might have resonated with Chinese of an older generation, many of whom worked long hours in poor conditions to give their children a brighter future. But many of those children now face similar drudgery—and are unwilling to endure it. “I can&#39;t sit on an assembly line,” says Zhang, a 20-something barista with dyed-red hair at a local tea shop. He scoffs at the idea of making such sacrifices for so little gain. The job at the tea shop pays just 4,000 yuan a month, but he enjoys chatting up customers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before you dismiss Zhang as just another Gen <small>Z</small> moper, consider that he has been working for seven years, including time spent in a factory. He sends half of his wages after rent back home to support his parents. He sees no hope of buying a house or making enough money to get married and have children. Working at the electronics factory in Huizhou would not improve his situation by much; and in other ways it would make him miserable. “Hard work is important,” he says. “But eating bitterness will make you unhappy.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Across China young people are disillusioned. They have been raised on stories of economic dynamism and social mobility. The Chinese economy more than doubled in size every ten years from 1978, when Communist Party leaders first adopted market reforms, until 2018. City kids could study hard, get into a good university and expect a white-collar job upon graduation. Lucky students from small towns or the countryside might do the same and make their way into the middle class. Less-educated young people had fewer options. But they could travel to cities, where rising wages in factories or on building sites were enough to start a family.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the decades before Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China had also been more open. Party leaders Jiang Zemin (1989-2002) and Hu Jintao (2002-12) were hardly liberals. But they left some space for civil society, intellectuals and the media to operate. Private enterprise flourished. Firms were encouraged to go out into the world and learn from the West. More and more Chinese travelled and studied abroad. A dynamic, aspirational, even hedonistic consumer and digital culture emerged. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For young people today, though, the outlook is much gloomier. The economy is struggling and they are feeling the worst of it. Unemployment among urban Chinese aged 16 to 24 has been running at over 20% for months, about double the age group&#39;s pre-pandemic level (see chart 1). The official job numbers for this group are so stubbornly awful that China recently <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/17/chinas-consumers-officials-and-statisticians-all-lack-confidence">stopped publishing</a> them altogether. Higher education is no longer a reliable ladder to a solid career. Our calculations show that in 2021 over 70% of those unemployed youngsters were graduates. Along with scarce jobs, they face sky-high property prices. Their modest dreams of finding work, buying a house and supporting a family seem increasingly out of reach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To get a sense of how young people feel, we have interviewed dozens of them. Their message is strikingly consistent. “We have no hope,” says a 27-year-old in Huizhou. The malaise felt by him and his cohort has led to the emergence of a new nihilistic vocabulary, featuring phrases such as<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/03/china-urges-its-people-to-struggle-some-say-no"><i>tang</i> <i>ping</i> (lying flat)</a> and <i>bailan</i> (letting it rot). Using sentiment-analysis tools to extract feelings from text on social media, we found that the mood of young Chinese is growing ever darker.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That should trouble officials in Beijing. Some 360m Chinese (a quarter of the population) are between the ages of 16 and 35. Their gloom has profound implications for the future of China, its economy and the party&#39;s ambitions. But rather than soothe the young, the government tends to scold them. Last year Mr Xi said they must “abandon arrogance and pampering”. Editorials in state media encourage them to “embrace struggle” and sacrifice their youth to the cause of national rejuvenation, as defined by the party. Repression is increasing. “Eat bitterness,” Mr Xi tells youngsters. His admonition, though a worn Chinese cliché, is sure to strike a nerve among people such as the barista in Huizhou.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The grind</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not as if young Chinese do not work hard. From an early age they face enormous pressure to do well in school and ace China&#39;s notoriously tough university-entrance exam, known as the <i>gaokao</i> . Nearly 13m youngsters took it this year. Many of them will have spent years cramming at the expense of other activities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet there is a growing feeling among young people that no matter how hard they study or work, they will not be rewarded with a better quality of life. They speak of <i>neijuan</i> , or “involution”, an academic word used to describe a situation in which extra input no longer yields more output. The idea was captured in “A Love for Dilemma”, a popular <small>TV</small> drama released in 2021. In the show, two characters liken the competition in educational attainment to an unruly audience at a cinema: someone stands up to get a clearer view, which obliges everyone behind them to stand. Then people climb on seats and ladders. But in the end, despite all of their effort, no one is able to see the screen any better.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The data support this sense of <i>neijuan</i> . As the number of university graduates has increased, the number of jobs for which they are suited has not risen at anywhere near the same rate. It has not helped that a large number of youngsters who decided to extend their studies during the pandemic are also now joining the job market, creating an even bigger surfeit of graduates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One problem is a mismatch between the skills that graduates are acquiring from school and those required by employers. According to one academic study of Zhaopin, a recruitment portal, 39% of job-seekers in first-tier cities had at least two surplus years of education, over and above those required by the jobs they sought. Outside these big cities, the proportion was more like 70%. Tales abound on social media of educated young people taking low-skilled jobs, such as sorting trash. One cigarette-maker hired students with master&#39;s degrees for its production line.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Young Chinese once dreamed of being lucky enough to get jobs in tech. Jack Ma, the idolised founder of Alibaba, proudly espoused a “996” culture, referring to a work schedule of 9am to 9pm, six days a week, often without extra pay. But in recent years tech workers began to complain of feeling like drones with dim prospects (made dimmer more recently with lay-offs). During an online outpouring of grievances in 2019, Mr Ma responded, perhaps unconvincingly, that “being able to work 996 is a huge blessing.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many young people now seek poorly paid but more stable government jobs that were once scorned by ambitious types. About 2.6m people sat exams for such positions last year, up from 1.4ma decade earlier. Only one in every 70 got one. Even jobs in provincial backwaters have become more attractive. Wu Xiaomei, 23, is from Guizhou, a remote mountainous province in the south-west. She complains that more people have been moving there from nearby provinces where the exams to gain work as a teacher are more competitive. That has made it tougher for locals to get such jobs. Ms Wu ended up teaching in a small-town school in another nearby province with less competition.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Those born in such places have the most difficult time moving up in the world. They have little chance of getting into a good university in a big city, where the admissions system favours locals. Most are stuck in low-skilled service jobs, such as delivering food in cities. The <i>hukou</i> system, a household registry, forces most who migrate to cities to live precarious lives, without access to local benefits like medical insurance. Since the mid-2010s, the wage growth of blue-collar workers has slowed significantly, according to a study led by Scott Rozelle of Stanford University. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whether their collars are white or blue, few youngsters earn enough to buy a house in a good location (see chart 2). Between 1998 and 2021 homes in Chinese cities became four times less affordable, judged by the ratio of average house prices to median disposable incomes. In the capital, Beijing, this ratio rose to 25 in 2021, more than twice that of London. While ruing their inability to afford a nice home, the young can also look forward to a growing burden of caring for their parents and grandparents, due to the demographic distortions wrought by nearly 40 years of the one-child policy (see chart 3). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile, the relatively open cultural atmosphere of the Hu and Jiang eras has vanished under Mr Xi. He has replaced it with an “empire of tedium”, to borrow a phrase from Geremie Barmé, a noted sinologist. Censorship has become far more heavy-handed. Chatter on the internet has turned into a dreary chorus of nationalist talking points. On Chinese television depictions of “effeminate men” and women&#39;s cleavage have been banned. Video games have been deemed too much fun; authorities have ordered the removal of gore and tried to limit kids&#39; playing hours.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At entertainment venues, bands are asked to send authorities videos of their sets before gigs. Directors of plays know that in the audience there are people checking that actors stick to approved scripts. Comedians plead for their audiences not to record them. Earlier this year Li Haoshi, a Beijing-based comic, used an army slogan—“Forge exemplary conduct! Fight to win!”—in a joke about how his dogs eagerly chased a squirrel. That was deemed insulting to the armed forces. Media companies were told not to hire the comic. Police said he was under investigation for causing a bad influence on society.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Xi has also tightened control over China&#39;s education system. Foreign textbooks were banned in 2020. The same year, schools across the country undertook to remove books that authorities said could “damage societal stability” or promote “deviant” values. Since 2021 students at primary and secondary schools have been assigned turgid texts devoted to Mr Xi&#39;s personal ideology. Universities have been told to become “strongholds of the Communist Party&#39;s leadership”. Several liberal scholars have been dismissed. Officials want Chinese history to be taught in a way that glorifies the party. To do otherwise is deemed “historical nihilism”. In 2021 a government hotline was set up for citizens to report such nihilism if they see it online.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The conservative turn has been especially hard on young women. Feminist activists are under close scrutiny. Authorities kept a tight lid on #MeToo activism. Sexism is rampant. In a survey by Zhaopin, the recruitment portal, 61% of women graduates said they were asked about their marriage and child-bearing status when applying for jobs, compared with just 32% of men. Women were also less likely to secure a job before graduation. A discouraging message about their future comes straight from the top. For the first time in decades the Politburo has no female member.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Let it rot</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dejected and demoralised, young people still find places to vent online. Baidu Tieba is a Reddit-like forum where discussions take place in various sub-groups organised by subject. We wrote a program to download posts from three sub-groups focusing on people born in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. We analysed over 150,000 contributions from 2019 to mid-2023, applying an algorithm to detect the presence of positive, negative or neutral words. Terms like <i>bailan</i> (let it rot), for example, are tagged as negative. Using this information, the algorithm then classified the posts as positive, negative or neutral in sentiment. The results show an improvement in the collective mood after the government lifted its draconian zero-covid restrictions in December. But, in general, China&#39;s young people have been growing more pessimistic in recent years (see chart 4). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Our findings come with caveats. We have focused on a single platform, which may not be representative of other social media in China. Indeed, our results could be subject to selection effects, where users of different dispositions flock to certain sites. Baidu Tieba tends to attract an older crowd. And algorithms have trouble detecting irony and sarcasm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless, the results are worthy of discussion. Take the differences across generations. Those born in the 1980s are the least glum. Growing up in hardship, they experienced the benefits of reform and opening and took advantage of the opportunities presented by China&#39;s economic boom. Those born in the 1990s, by contrast, are the most downbeat. They grew up during the boom years, in the heyday of globalisation, but are entering the workforce just as the economy stagnates and China turns inward. Some may once have entertained hopes of political liberalisation, which were gradually snuffed out as Mr Xi consolidated power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disillusioned youngsters commonly express feelings of exhaustion and resignation. Some talk of “lying flat”, or dropping out of the rat race and abandoning material ambitions that do not seem attainable. The notion of “letting it rot” is even more nihilistic: it describes an attitude of self-indulgence. Those born in the 1990s used this phrase most often in our analysis. For a sense of what it means in practice, consider Qin, whom we met in Huizhou. He is 30 and used to work in a factory. The pay was not enough for him to afford much of a life. Clutching a beer outside an internet bar, he says he now has a part-time job in construction. “I work a few days, then play a few days.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Young people are pulling back in other ways, too. “Why would I get married? Why would I go on a date?” asks Qin, citing the cost of each. High house prices are a particular concern for young men because home-ownership is often seen as a prerequisite for marriage. Dowries, which more traditional families demand for marrying their daughters, have been increasing. Some ask for sums that would bankrupt prospective grooms and their families. Such economic burdens, along with changing societal views, have resulted in a decline in marriages. Around 6.8m couples got hitched last year, about half the number of a decade ago.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A surprising number of young couples are not even having sex. In a survey conducted in 2020, 14.6% and 10.1% of partnered men and women born between 1995 and 2003 reported having had no sex in the past year. A trio of scholars at Peking University and Fudan University, evaluating these figures, wrote, “Whether and why sex has lost its appeal for a large fraction of young people needs to be further studied.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> None of this bodes well for China&#39;s dismal fertility rate (the number of children a woman can be expected to have in her lifetime). It fell to a historic low of 1.2 in 2021—far below the replacement rate of 2.1. Besides home prices, analysts point to the rocketing cost of child-rearing as a factor. YuWa Population Research, a think-tank in Beijing, calculated the average cost of raising a first child to the age of 18 at 485,000 yuan ($67,000) in 2019. That equated to nearly seven times China&#39;s <small>gdp</small> per person, one of the highest rates in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Efforts to remedy the situation have been unsuccessful. In 2016 the government swapped the one-child policy for a two-children-per-couple limit. In 2021 it switched to a three-children policy, now more a goal than a cap. Incentives such as cash handouts, tax breaks and longer maternity leave have not made much difference. Last year, when a young man was told by police that the punishment for violating pandemic-control rules would affect his family for three generations, he responded, “We are the last generation, thank you.” The exchange, caught on video, went viral, his defiant words transformed into another cynical meme (until it was censored).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some young people who can afford to are looking to leave China. Last year netizens took to using a Chinese character that sounds like the English word <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/05/05/chinas-young-elite-are-considering-moving-abroad">“run”</a> as a coded way of talking about emigration. Reports of well-heeled Chinese leaving for places such as Singapore are common. The number of Chinese trying to get to the United States via Latin America has <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/08/14/return-to-china-xing-would-rather-die-in-the-jungle">surged</a> .</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Eat this</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s leaders are not blind to these trends, but they are not wholly sympathetic. Mr Xi cites the gruelling hardships suffered by previous generations of youngsters as a model to emulate, not a nightmare to leave behind. He came of age during the Cultural Revolution, a period of Maoist madness from 1966 to 1976. (Mr Xi&#39;s father was one of many officials deemed insufficiently loyal and tortured; his half-sister took her own life.) Only a teenager at the time, Mr Xi was sent to the countryside, along with millions of other city dwellers, to learn from the peasants. Unable to cope, he ran back to Beijing. But after being returned to the village, he learned the virtues of hard work, according to party lore. Mr Xi was supposedly the first to jump into the cesspool to shovel manure. He believes today&#39;s youngsters should seek their own enlightening hardships.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, he has tried to respond to some of the underlying causes of young people&#39;s despair. Policymakers have repeated the mantra that “housing is for living in, not for speculation”, a slogan that reflects concern for people priced out of owning a home by people who own several. Regulators have urged e-commerce firms like Meituan, a food-delivery company, to improve pay and conditions for gig workers, softening the algorithms that punish them for late deliveries. They also cracked down on private tutoring businesses after Mr Xi warned that the industry had become a “social problem”, exploiting the educational anxieties of China&#39;s parents.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This regulatory storm, as it became known, was part of Mr Xi&#39;s grander pursuit of “common prosperity”, an effort to narrow inequality and “improve the channels of upward mobility” that many disillusioned youngsters believe are blocked. Along the way authorities made examples of some of China&#39;s wealthiest business celebrities by arresting them or, as with Mr Ma of Alibaba, forcing them out of public life. Mr Ma gave up control of his company and now lives in relative obscurity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the government&#39;s moves have mostly backfired. The public humiliation of tech entrepreneurs was a punch in the stomach for ambitious youngsters inspired by their example (though young leftists have celebrated the party&#39;s humbling of billionaires). And the regulatory crackdowns on their companies, as well as on property developers, have hobbled some of the most reliable employers of China&#39;s university-educated youth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Communist Party propaganda has played down the young generation&#39;s jobless woes. The <i>Economic Daily</i> , a party newspaper, said in July that many youngsters were simply choosing “slow employment”—a phrase that was widely mocked online. A recent report from the China Macroeconomy Forum, a think-tank at Renmin University of China, takes a dimmer view. It concluded the problem of youth unemployment may not abate for a decade, with potentially bigger ramifications for the country&#39;s leadership. “If it is not handled properly, it will cause other social problems beyond the economy, and it could even ignite the fuse of political problems,” the report said.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disaffected young people are a <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/01/21/might-freedom-seeking-youths-rise-up-again">recurrent wild card</a> in Chinese politics. In 1919 thousands of students took to the streets to protest against China&#39;s harsh treatment by its allies at the end of the first world war and to demand modernising reforms. During the Cultural Revolution, young people again took centre-stage when Mao Zedong unleashed his Red Guards, many of them teenagers. And in 1989 students flocked to Tiananmen Square in Beijing to demand more freedoms. Thousands may have been killed in the crackdown that followed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Since then students have played a far more muted role in political life. Three years of harsh covid-19 controls pushed some to breaking point. In November, after deaths from a fire in Xinjiang were blamed on covid restrictions, young people <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows">gathered in the streets</a> and on campuses across China to protest. They held up blank sheets of paper in a nod to China&#39;s curbs on free expression. But these protesters probably numbered in the hundreds, not thousands, in a country of 1.4bn. More broadly there appears to be no real sense of revolutionary zeal among today&#39;s youth.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> No-motivation nation</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The danger China&#39;s leaders face is not so much a social eruption as social erosion, an unspectacular but unremitting loss of the “vitality, stamina and hope” that Mr Xi claims the young can impart to Chinese socialism. This enervation might manifest itself in a variety of ways. Chinese women may give birth later or not at all, contributing to a decline in population. Forecasts for China&#39;s economy often assume rates of childbirth will enjoy a modest rebound, based on the record of other low-fertility countries. But most of those reference points are European countries with strong welfare systems that permit a better balance between family and career.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China is relying on increases in “human capital” (like education) to offset its decrease in humans. But the lying-flat phenomenon and high graduate unemployment show that is not enough. The tightening grip of the authorities over civil society, popular culture and entrepreneurs also would seem to discourage the risk-taking that marked earlier generations.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some of China&#39;s best-educated youngsters will no doubt emigrate. Others are seeking a different kind of safe harbour. Applications for the civil service are expected to jump again this year. And the share of graduates ranking state-owned enterprises as their first-choice employer has increased for three years in a row, according to the survey by Zhaopin. These businesses offer stability and security over dynamism and ingenuity. If China is to become the more innovative economy Mr Xi demands, it cannot afford to lose too many of its best minds to its least efficient firms. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A delivery rider takes a rest on his bike in Beijing" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Phoning it in</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: AP</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Does Mr Xi understand this? His thoughts on how to achieve national greatness have evolved, along with his message to young people. A few months after coming to power in 2012 he met a group of young entrepreneurs, volunteers and students, telling them to “dare to dream, to bravely chase their dreams and to strive to fulfil them”. Their ambitions will make China great, he said. One beaming participant, who had recently climbed Mount Everest, said it was a good time to be young.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Now, though, Mr Xi says the “Chinese Dream” of national rejuvenation is to be achieved by focusing on collective goals, rather than by encouraging individual aspirations. He admonishes the young to obey the party and toughen up—to “engrave the blood of their youth on the monuments of history, just as our fathers did.” That is a message that relatively few young people are taking to heart. Told to eat bitterness, they prefer to let it rot. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 17 Aug 2023 09:02:18 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qabpdca5tvlp08j1g9d8eh50q6ig41d7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/17/chinas-defeated-youth </item><item><title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia is spending a fortune on sport]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Global%20sport-dfd7e75ad9bee9509953215809856f32.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>O</span> <small>n august</small> <small>11th</small> Saudi Arabia&#39;s biggest football competition, the Saudi Pro League, will kick off for the 2023-24 season. Last season&#39;s tournament did not exactly set pulses racing. Just 9,300 fans attended games on average. For three of the past five seasons the top scorer has been Abderrazak Hamdallah, a Moroccan who has not played for any of the world&#39;s top clubs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But this season may be different. Mr Hamdallah&#39;s team, Al Ittihad, has just signed Karim Benzema, winner of the 2022 Ballon d&#39;Or award for best player in the world, from Real Madrid, and N&#39;Golo Kante, a star midfielder from Chelsea. Cristiano Ronaldo, a five-time winner of the Ballon d&#39;Or, moved to Al Nassr, another Saudi club, in January from Manchester United. Former Liverpool winger, Sadio Mané, joined him there, while Liverpool&#39;s captain, Jordan Henderson, signed for Al Ettifaq. The list goes on. Teams in the Saudi league have spent more than $480m on fees this summer, catapulting them among the biggest spenders in global football.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Pro League&#39;s moves are just one part of a multi-billion dollar push by Saudi Arabia into global sports, backed by Muhammad bin Salman, known as <small>mbs</small> , the country&#39;s crown prince and de facto ruler. It goes far beyond football and is roiling global golf, Formula 1 motor racing, boxing and more. <small>mbs</small> ’s ambition is to use sport to modernise Saudi Arabia, and to transform the outside world&#39;s perception of the desert kingdom of 36m people.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Saudi splurge is happening just as the global sports industry is being shaken by digital disruption and a new wave of private-equity investment. Cynics accuse <small>mbs</small> of vanity projects and “sportswashing”—using sport to whitewash the country&#39;s reputation for human-rights abuses. Saudi officials bridle at such criticism. Fahad Nazer of the Saudi embassy in Washington, <small>dc</small> , says the idea that the country is sportswashing “could not be further from the truth”. He says such claims reek of “ethnocentricity”: everything has been done with Saudi Arabia and its citizens—not Westerners—in mind, he says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many observers believe the moves will change not just Saudi Arabia, but global sport itself, wresting the initiative from stuffy Western guardians of teams and tournaments and introducing a dynamic new force. The spending has been going on for several years but until recently its full scope was obscured by a scatter-gun approach. Investments and negotiations have taken place in multiple layers of the sports industry, including buying players, purchasing foreign clubs, developing domestic clubs and buying or developing tournaments at home and abroad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These deals have been pursued by a squad of Saudi entities including the government itself, the Public Investment Fund ( <small>pif</small> ), a sovereign wealth fund, and even Saudi Aramco, the oil firm that is the world&#39;s most profitable company. The scope is impressive, with at least $10bn spent across half a dozen major sports.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Howay, the lads</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 2021 a Saudi-led consortium took control of Newcastle United, a storied but struggling English Premier League ( <small>epl</small> ) team, for $391m. As well as developing its domestic league, there is intense speculation that Saudi Arabia will launch a bid to host the World Cup, perhaps in 2030, following in the footsteps of neighbouring Qatar in 2022. Gulf money is thought to have supported a 2021 attempt to create a European super league, which collapsed after opposition from fans.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In golf, America&#39;s main body, the <small>pga</small> Tour, has just agreed to a merger with <small>liv</small> Golf, a Saudi upstart tournament that threw the sport into turmoil by offering top players hundreds of millions of dollars to switch their allegiance. Europe&#39;s <small>dp</small> World Tour, another organising body, is also part of the deal. Donald Trump, whose courses host <small>liv</small> events, describes it as a “beautiful and glamorous deal”. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, two left-leaning senators, recently condemned “the Saudi regime&#39;s latest attempt to sanitise its abuses” in a public letter to the <small>us</small> Justice Department.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi Arabia hosts a new Formula 1 Grand Prix in Jeddah and is building a track near the capital, Riyadh; Saudi investors were reported to have considered bidding $20bn for the whole of Formula 1 last year. The Saudi sports minister dismissed the reports as “purely speculation”. Aramco remains a major sponsor of <small>f</small> 1.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An official at the men&#39;s <small>atp</small> tennis tour has admitted to “positive” talks with possible investors, <small>pif</small> among them. The women&#39;s tennis tour, the <small>wta</small> , is considering whether to hold an event in Saudi and an official recently visited. The kingdom now hosts big boxing matches, wrestling bouts and e-sports events. Despite its climate, it has also been selected to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A league of their own</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why is the country splurging on sports? Vanity and envy play a part. Many Saudi royals are fans. They have invested in teams elsewhere and now want some of their own. They also want to be taken seriously among the global sports elite. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the <small>pif</small> , is a golf nut. Documents released as part of recent congressional hearings into the <small>pga</small> Tour- <small>liv</small> deal suggest that one idea proposed as part of the transaction was that he might gain membership of Augusta, America&#39;s most exclusive club.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudis have watched as their neighbours have stepped up. The race began in 1993, says Danyel Reiche of Georgetown University in Qatar. That was when Qatar first hosted an <small>atp</small> men&#39;s tennis tournament (Boris Becker won). It spent $200bn preparing to host the 2022 World Cup. One of its royals also owns Paris St Germain, a top French club. Manchester City, owned by an Abu Dhabi royal, is now the world&#39;s most valuable football brand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the Saudi plan goes far beyond perks for its elites and keeping up with the neighbours. Buoyant energy prices and production mean that its oil exports are expected to surpass $166bn this year, or 16% of <small>gdp</small> . With a global energy transition looming, the kingdom&#39;s “Vision 2030” plan aims to diversify its economy away from oil by developing new industries and liberalising the economy, including by getting more women into the workforce. The <small>pif</small> is a key player, using its more than $700bn of funds to redeploy capital into new areas of the economy and make strategic investments in brands and technology.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The kingdom wants the Saudi Pro League to attract investment and fans. It aims to welcome 100m visitors a year by 2030 (there were 64m in 2021). Officials hope the league will quadruple its revenue to $480m by then, though that still pales beside, for instance, the <small>epl,</small> which generated ten times as much last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Sport, it is hoped, will have a spillover effect on the rest of the economy. Part of this is a rebranding exercise in a region known for religious strife, extremism and war. “It is better for everyone to be working together for prosperity in the region, not in conflict, and the Saudis want to be seen at the forefront of it,” explains Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A better brand and more events can boost the tourism sector, which the government hopes will increase from 3% of <small>gdp</small> in 2019 to 10% in 2030. When you want to become a holiday hotspot, star-power helps: Lionel Messi, perhaps football&#39;s greatest player, is a Saudi tourism ambassador and posts sun-drenched snaps to his 482m followers on Instagram.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Sport may even be useful as a mechanism to complement social reform. The Saudi government has in recent years become more accepting of the sexes mixing in public and has taken some steps to rein in its over-zealous religious police. Women were finally allowed to drive in 2018. Now it is backing women&#39;s sports as well as men&#39;s. The Saudi women&#39;s football team gained its first ranking from <small>fifa</small> in March. All of this may make the country more attractive to female tourists.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Across the region, hosting sports events has “generally been positively perceived by residents,” says Wadih Ishac, an assistant professor in sport management at Qatar University. Mr Nazer of the Saudi embassy in Washington points out that 70% of the Saudi population is under 35 and that young people love the sporting events.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The master plan faces two big risks. The first is that its business models may not work. Gulf owners can clearly run sports businesses well. Manchester City has thrived under its <small>uae</small> investor (though in February the <small>epl</small> accused it of allegedly breaking financial rules, a charge the club denies). During the first year of Saudi ownership, Newcastle United spent around £100m ($126m) and moved out of the relegation zone. In the second, the club came fourth, qualifying for the Champions League, Europe&#39;s main club competition, for the first time in 20 years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, within Saudi Arabia, sport is a state-backed, rather than an entrepreneurial, concern, with the problems that can entail. In June some top football clubs, previously under the control of the Ministry of Sports, were notionally privatised. But <small>pif</small> has a 75% stake in four teams. Aramco, the oil firm, has another team and <small>neom</small> , a metropolis being built in the desert, has one in the second division, too. “It&#39;s almost like football clubs have become quangos in Saudi Arabia,” says Simon Chadwick of Skema Business School in Paris. Rather than a new dynamic engine of the economy, sports could become a manifestation of its old, state-run patronage system.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In order to attract stars, salaries must be huge. Mr Benzema reportedly signed a two-year contract worth $440m and Mr Ronaldo is rumoured to be earning $200m per year. Al Hilal this summer offered a record-smashing bid of €300m ($330m) to Paris St Germain for Kylian Mbappé, a French star, who so far has declined. Phil Mickelson, a golfer, pocketed $200m from <small>liv</small> Golf despite once describing the Saudis as “scary motherfuckers” (he later apologised). Colossal wage bills mean even the most successful European teams struggle to make money. Over half of the teams in the <small>epl</small> made losses in 2022, and overall the leagues in Italy, Germany and Spain are in the red. (Exor, which has a stake in <i>The Economist</i> ’s parent company, is also an investor in Juventus, an Italian football club, and Ferrari, an Italian carmaker.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thanks to its oil wealth, the Saudi experiment will not break the bank. According to <small>pif</small> ’s annual report in 2021, leisure and entertainment accounted for just 1.6% of its assets. But the combination of low domestic revenues and high costs may mean many Saudi sports ventures cannot sustain themselves or compete globally without subsidies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi Arabia may face some of the same issues with football as China, which tried to raise the fortunes of its Chinese Super League in the past decade. Expensive imported stars may grumble about the standard of football and there will be plenty of scepticism about the sustainability of the current level of spending. But the state&#39;s backing for the league will negate the financial problems and political scrutiny which have hampered the Chinese project. The Saudis are also trying to attract younger talent, and not just be like the United States, where many top players from European clubs have traditionally gone to play out their twilight years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Saudi&#39;s smallish domestic audience may also impede its ambitions. There is an example of an emerging economy taking a dominant role in the business operations of a global sport. In 2008 India launched the Indian Premier League ( <small>ipl</small> ), a cricket tournament. Last year the rights to show matches over the next five years were sold for more than $6bn, making it the world&#39;s second-most lucrative sports league per game after the <small>nfl</small> , an American-football competition. India&#39;s financial clout has given it a powerful voice over cricket worldwide. But the foundation of India&#39;s success has been the sheer scale of the audience there, with 1.4bn cricket-mad citizens. Saudi cannot rival that. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Collage showing sports players Dustin Johnson and Jordan Henderson" width="1844" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Israel Vargas/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second big danger is that the surge triggers a backlash. Sport can be a sensitive industry in which to invest and Saudi Arabia&#39;s status as an autocratic state does not help. Several human-rights groups have accused the Saudis of sportswashing, for instance when <small>fifa</small> awarded them the Club World Cup for 2023.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a new spin on an old idea, of nasty regimes using sports to show off their political models, as Mussolini did with the World Cup in 1934 and Hitler with the Olympics in 1936. East Germany and the Soviet Union had state-sponsored doping programmes in the 1970s and 1980s. More recently China was accused of sportswashing when it hosted the Winter Olympics last year, as was Russia when it staged the football World Cup in 2018. Qatar faced plenty of blowback in 2022, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Today critics point to Saudi Arabia&#39;s dearth of democratic freedoms and suppression of women&#39;s and gay rights. The gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken journalist, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 has not been forgotten, nor has the kingdom&#39;s central role in the <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/09/can-yemen-hold-together">bloody war in Yemen</a> .</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Insular peninsula</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet Saudi Arabia&#39;s autocratic politics will probably not prevent it from taking a growing role in global sports. Qualification for the Champions League has gone a long way to stilling criticism of Saudi investment in Newcastle United. President Joe Biden, having described the kingdom as a “pariah” in 2019, is now keen to repair America&#39;s alliance. But its reputation may make deals more fiddly. The proposed <small>pga</small> Tour- <small>liv</small> golf merger has created a stink and is being assessed by the <small>us</small> Justice Department to see if it violates antitrust law.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>pga</small> Tour executives were hauled before a Senate committee last month. Senator Richard Blumenthal complained that a gagging clause in the deal, which could stop players from badmouthing Saudi Arabia, is “about as broad a non-disparagement clause as I have ever seen”. The deal&#39;s backers at the <small>pga</small> Tour are doubtless keen to suggest the Saudis will have a backseat role: probably a very different vision from that of <small>mbs</small> , in which the Saudis are in control and no longer just the “dumb money”. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But even if some deals do not transform the country in the way <small>mbs</small> hopes, Saudi Arabia is part of a broader shift that is changing global sports. The surge in capital from the kingdom is part of the rise of a new cohort of sovereign and private-equity funds that are investing in sports at scale. Bloomberg reported that private-equity firms spent $51bn on sports transactions in 2021, nearly double the total of 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ownership rules are being liberalised as clubs and tournaments seek new sources of capital to stay competitive. American sports leagues are the world&#39;s best at raking in money (see chart 1). Since 2019, several big American leagues have relaxed their rules to allow minority investments by institutional investors. In July Qatar&#39;s investment authority reached a deal to buy 5% of the parent company of the Washington Wizards, an American basketball team. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Digital disruption has also finally reached live sports, which had been one of the last bastions of traditional television (see chart 2). Increasingly viewers who have “cut the cord” on television instead watch sports through streaming services which offer live games but also on-demand highlights, analysis and other digital add-ons. This digital shift is being accompanied by unexpected swirls and shifts in audiences. For example, Formula 1, once notable for having little presence in the United States, is now gaining some traction there, boosted by tie-ups with Netflix.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi&#39;s sports splurge partly reflects the dynamics within the kingdom: a new flood of petrodollars; <small>mbs</small> ’s ambition to create a more socially liberal society and to restore his tarnished reputation in the West. But the moves also reflect a sense that there is a new window of opportunity in global sports: to grab bigger and newer audiences, to create different kinds of events and tournaments and to reinvent old ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The latest annual report from <small>pif</small> , released this week, includes the announcement of a sports-specific investment vehicle, hinting at broader future plans. Mr Benzema and Mr Ronaldo are likely to be hitting the back of the net come the autumn.

Now that the plague has abated, history may also provide a few lessons for the aftermath. As the first world war and the Spanish flu receded, interest rates were low and government spending high. Inflation surged. In order to bring prices back under control, America&#39;s central bankers cranked rates up, triggering a severe recession. The Federal Reserve described its actions in 1921 as “painful but…unavoidable” following “an unprecedented orgy of extravagance”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These days Fed officials tend to avoid the word orgy, but they are wrestling with similar circumstances. They have been raising rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s. Hawkish economists argue that, to quell inflation, the Fed will have to raise them yet higher, even though that would certainly raise unemployment and probably induce a recession. Doves counter that the Fed has already gone too far and that further economic pain is unnecessary. A third possibility, that the Fed is getting things just right, and that the economy will slow and inflation dissipate without a recession (a “soft landing” in the jargon), was until recently seen as nigh on impossible.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> An orgy of tightening</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The odds are still stacked against it. Since March 2022 the Fed has lifted short-term interest rates from 0% to 5%. Such rapid jumps tend to go hand-in-hand with recessions. As higher rates raise the cost of borrowing, they drag down both spending by consumers and investment by companies. As a general rule, the bigger the increase in rates, the bigger the drag. Thus, for much of the past year, the dominant view on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms has been that America&#39;s economy would end up in a funk. As of June, the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg pegged the probability of a recession in the next 12 months at about 65%. The Conference Board, a business group, put the probability at 99% in February. Stanley Druckenmiller, Silicon Valley&#39;s favourite macroeconomic prognosticator, recently said that he expects a “hard landing”, involving a slump in corporate profits and a big rise in unemployment. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The gloomiest portent has been an extreme inversion of yield curves. Normally, rates on long-term bonds are higher than on those with short terms because investors expect extra compensation for the risk of holding securities that mature well into the future. When short-term yields are higher, the implication is that investors expect the central bank to cut rates, typically because they think growth is set to weaken. Inversions have a nearly perfect record in foreshadowing recessions in America over the past half-century, and they have been screaming trouble for some time now. Yield curves inverted for the first time in this economic cycle in October 2022, and are now deeply upside-down. The lag from the onset of inversion to the dawn of recession averages about 350 days, which would put the start of a potential recession in September. The Fed&#39;s New York branch calculates the probability of a recession based on the yield curve. In May it put the odds of one at more than 70%, the highest since 1982 (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other indicators confirm this bleak outlook. Consumer sentiment, as measured by a closely watched survey from the University of Michigan, plunged to an all-time low last year. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and a couple of other financial institutions in March provided evidence that the rapid rate hikes are harming vulnerable firms, and the ensuing financial instability added to economic headwinds. Banks have made their lending standards much stricter, another sign of a looming recession. Smaller businesses—the lifeblood of America&#39;s economy—remain extremely pessimistic. Manufacturing is already contracting, with output down since late in 2022. The debate among economists has been less about whether a recession is coming and more about whether it will be long or short, deep or shallow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the past couple of weeks, though, the mood has shifted. Despite the many ill omens, the most important indicator of the economy&#39;s health—the labour market—has remained amazingly resilient. The unemployment rate sits at just 3.6%, a smidgen above a five-decade low. A brief rise in claims for unemployment insurance during the spring has petered out. America has added new jobs for 30 consecutive months, lifting total employment to about its pre-pandemic level.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At the same time, inflation is receding. In the year to June 2022 consumer prices leapt by 9.1%. In the year to this June they rose by just 3%, the smallest increase in more than two years. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, is higher, but after a few months of stasis is moving in the right direction again. As post-pandemic supply-chain snarls untangle, the cost of most goods is rising only slowly, and in some cases falling. Rents, hitherto a big element of inflation, are falling according to private indices, and are likely to start declining soon in the official data, too. Labour costs are still rising, but the rate of increase has slowed, which bodes well for the prices of restaurant meals, car repairs, tax accounting and more.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To say that the combination of ebbing inflation and a robust labour market is unexpected is an understatement: many economists had assumed it was impossible. They had believed that there was a short-term trade-off between jobs and prices: that, all else being equal, a low unemployment rate is associated with a rising inflation rate, a relationship known as the Phillips curve. In the decade before the pandemic the Phillips curve had come into question, because inflation remained quiescent even though the jobless rate plunged. But the resurgence of inflation last year brought the Phillips curve back into fashion, in part because the labour market appeared to have become less efficient after the pandemic. Debate focused not on whether unemployment would need to go up for inflation to come down, but rather on just how many people would need to lose their jobs before prices were brought under control. In one much-discussed speech last year, Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, said the jobless rate might need to climb as high as 10%.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A bacchanal of employment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America does have an ultra-tight labour market: too many companies competing to hire too few workers. That would normally lead to sharply rising wages and thus higher inflation. The obvious way to curb that inflation, in turn, would be to inflict enough pain on companies through higher interest rates that they resort to widespread lay-offs. But another way to bring the labour market into balance is to increase the supply of workers. That has happened to a certain extent: fully 84% of those of those aged 25-54 have jobs or are looking for work, the highest share since 2002. It also helps that immigrants—a vital, if politically contentious, part of the American labour force—have returned: more than 1m arrived last year, the highest figure since 2017. Since February 2020 the economy has added nearly 4m jobs, much faster growth than the long-term trend. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Employers, meanwhile, have been hesitant to fire workers. Some may well be hoarding them, having found it very difficult to recruit enough over the past couple of years. Instead of firing staff, they are cutting back on hiring. The net result of more workers and fewer help-wanted ads is a slightly calmer labour market, despite the lack of lay-offs. Goldman Sachs calculates that there are roughly 3.2m more jobs than workers in America at the moment. That is still above 2m, which it considers the maximum for a not-too-tight, not-too-loose jobs market, but the overshoot is well down from its peak of 5.7m early in 2022. As the number of vacancies has declined, the relentless upward march of wages has eased somewhat (see chart 2). Economists at the doveish end of the spectrum are beginning to trumpet these achievements, if not quite declare victory. “The economy is defying predictions that inflation would not fall absent significant job destruction,” Lael Brainard, head of the National Economic Council, said on July 12th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Two additional things help explain America&#39;s run of good fortune. First, the looming problems were probably overstated because of pandemic oddities. Economists&#39; models of the probability of a recession have for months been flashing red. But there is reason to think the models may be giving unreliable signals. They are designed to predict trouble whenever there are abrupt shifts in the data. Recently, though, such shifts have reflected a return to normal after the pandemic, rather than incipient economic weakness. People are buying markedly fewer laptops and exercise bikes than they did in 2020, for instance, not because they are cutting back sharply on spending but because they are not working from home as much. It may be, therefore, that manufacturing&#39;s weak spell is less a harbinger than a hangover.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The yield-curve inversion could also be misleading. Long-term rates may have fallen below short-term ones not because a recession is imminent, but for a far more pleasant reason: that as inflation melts away, the Fed will be able to lower rates. Provided it can make those cuts before growth gives out, it will have a good chance of guiding America to a soft landing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second factor relates to the economy&#39;s underlying strength. Monetary policy may be tight, but there are countervailing forces. One is government spending. America is running a budget deficit worth over 5% of <small>GDP</small> —unheard of outside recessions and wars. That is putting money in people&#39;s pockets. There are plenty of reasons to worry about the sustainability of such fiscal largesse, but, for now, it is a cushion for the economy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Several big pieces of legislation from the first two years of the presidency of Joe Biden, enacted before Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives, are also starting to affect the economy. Spending on highways, ports, power plants and more, enabled by an infrastructure law passed in 2021, is worth about 0.25% of <small>GDP</small> a year. Subsidies for electric vehicles, renewable energy and semiconductors appear to have catalysed a surge in private-sector investment: spending on manufacturing facilities is up 70% this year in real terms compared with pre-pandemic levels, hitting a record high.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another countervailing force is households, whose spending accounts for about two-thirds of <small>GDP</small> . They entered the era of high inflation and rising rates well prepared. During the pandemic they had accumulated “excess savings” worth about $2trn, a consequence both of having fewer opportunities to spend their money and of receiving three rounds of stimulus cheques as well as other forms of government support. Many people have drawn down these savings as the cost of living has risen. Nevertheless, researchers with the Fed&#39;s branch in San Francisco estimate that there is still a residual amount of extra savings—$500bn or so—enough to last for most of this year. In any case, these savings matter less than they used to: for the first time in a few years nominal wage growth is eclipsing the rate of inflation, meaning that most Americans now have rising incomes in real terms. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What could go wrong? Policy lags are a known unknown that could yet trip up the economy. Lags refer to the length of time needed for changes in monetary policy to start affecting business activity. Economists used to think that it could take more than two years for a rise in interest rates to ripple through the economy. Stricter credit standards have yet to make their impact fully felt: for instance, interest rates on credit cards have just started to shoot up, and it may be another few months before delinquencies follow them higher.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But cutting against that is evidence that, in some respects, there is much less of a lag than there used to be, thanks to twitchy financial markets. For example, mortgage rates rose sharply in early 2022 prompted solely by the expectation that the Fed would soon begin raising rates, as indeed it did. The housing industry, arguably the most rate-sensitive part of the economy, is now in the throes of a mini-rebound, with both sales and construction beginning to rise (see chart 3). A new financial-conditions index developed by the Fed suggests that, on balance, the drag on growth arising from higher interest rates has actually diminished in the past few months, in part because investors in American stocks have anticipated an end to the cycle of rising rates.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A debauched degree of listlessness</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is crucial to note that a soft landing does not equate to roaring growth. Far from it. What is needed to help bring inflation to heel is a period—potentially a long one—of subdued growth, which would lower the economic temperature. Such an interlude may, in fact, be well under way. Although <small>gdp</small> growth has held up well over the past few quarters, its close relative, gross domestic income ( <small>GDI</small> ), has been anaemic. In theory the two ought to be aligned. <small>GDP</small> tracks all final expenditures in the economy, summing up consumption, investment, government spending and net exports over a specific period. <small>GDI</small> tracks the earnings associated with that expenditure, summing up wages, profits and any other income. In reality the two never match perfectly, since they are derived from different sources. Recently the gaps have been unusually large—perhaps another consequence of distortions related to the pandemic. Whereas <small>GDP</small> increased by 2% on an annualised basis in the first quarter of this year, <small>GDI</small> fell by 1.8%. It is not clear which number is more accurate, but one common approach to reconciling the two is to split the difference. That would imply that growth is already very low which, in turn, may further sap inflation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There are big risks to this rosy outlook. Inflation could prove stubborn again, as it has for the past two years. Much of the recent optimism has been tied to a better-than-expected inflation reading in June. Drawing sweeping conclusions from a single datum is never a good idea, not least when underlying trends are so volatile.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if inflation falls again in July and August, there are also questions about how low it will go if the number of vacant jobs continues to outstrip the number of available workers to such a large extent. Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, and Ben Bernanke, a former chairman of the Fed, estimated in a paper in May that, at the current level of tightness in the labour market, the unemployment rate would need to rise above 4.3% for some time to bring inflation down to the Fed&#39;s target. That would imply that roughly 1m people would have to lose their jobs—no small dislocation. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The resilience of the economy is, in this respect, discomfiting. If the rebound in housing gains steam, it could easily spur an increase in rents and goods prices (all those new homes need sofas, fridges, carpets and more). If wages continue to grow at about 5% annually, they, too, will put a floor under prices in the service sector. Expectations of inflation, although declining, do not suggest the Fed has everything under control (see chart 4). A feedback loop between a strong economy and sticky inflation would pose a stiff challenge for the Fed, leaving it with little choice but to raise rates to new heights—at which point fears of a tightening-induced recession might well come true.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The absence of a downturn to date has allowed the Fed to avoid confronting any serious trade-off in its tightening. Jerome Powell, the Fed&#39;s chairman, and his peers deserve high marks for raising rates as quickly, albeit belatedly, as they have. But it has been easy for them to be resolute given the health of the jobs market. Were conditions to deteriorate, their resolve would be sorely tested. Richard Clarida, a former vice-chairman of the Fed, says the central bank may ratchet down rates next year with inflation headed to a “two-point-something destination”, instead of actually back to its target of 2%. That might help to avoid a recession. But it would also represent a shifting of the goalposts, with the Fed tolerating a higher rate of inflation because it does not want to inflict wrenching economic pain. That, in itself, would make it harder to fight inflation in the future.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All these risks notwithstanding, it remains remarkable that America has so far avoided a hard landing. The economy is winding its way down a treacherous road from the highest peak in inflation in 40 years. Defying conventional wisdom, it has managed to add millions of jobs during the hair-raising ride. Its descent is far from over. But a soft landing, once a faint hope, is now among the plausible outcomes. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 08:54:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/a9d4lsdn2nop513pvmea6lvj87dvhrj6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/20/could-americas-economy-escape-recession </item><item><title><![CDATA[The meticulous, ruthless preparations for a second Trump term]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20The%20presidency-in-waiting-931f3285de6998a88a31ca8ded538379.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>B</span> <small>ROOKE ROLLINS</small> is sitting at her desk in Fort Worth, Texas, at the back of an anonymous, low-rise building. It looks uncannily like an office in the White House, with its lemony cream wallpaper, dark wood furniture and photographs of the president signing bills as admirers look on. Only one detail jars: the 18th-century rifle leaning against the wall.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The resemblance is not a coincidence. Mrs Rollins worked in the White House under Donald Trump and briefly ran his Domestic Policy Council. She purchased her West Wing furniture when she left. Towards the end of Mr Trump&#39;s first term, she was in charge of putting together a policy agenda for his second one. After Mr Trump lost his bid for re-election in 2020, she set up a think-tank to continue that work, the America First Policy Institute ( <small>AFPI</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AFPI</small> aspires to be an administration-in-waiting. Its staff of 172 includes eight former cabinet secretaries from the Trump administration and 20 other political appointees. “I will leave things ready for the next Republican president,” Mrs Rollins says. Campaign-finance laws prevent her from saying so, but she means Mr Trump.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AFPI</small> is the newest think-tank preparing for a second term for Mr Trump, but it is not the biggest. The Heritage Foundation, which prides itself on having done the preparatory work for Ronald Reagan&#39;s “revolution”, has its own presidential transition project. This is led by Paul Dans, a lawyer who worked in the White House&#39;s Office of Personnel Management during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency. In 1981 copies of a manual for government produced by Heritage were placed on the chairs of each of Reagan&#39;s cabinet members before their first meeting. Heritage is updating that idea, co-ordinating an effort by 350 conservative wonks and former administration officials to write a plan for government in time for the Republican primaries next year. Those who have criticised Mr Trump or his agenda will not be part of it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As well as drafting policies for each department, Mr Dans and his colleagues are building a list of potential recruits to serve in the next Republican administration. He likes to describe the effort as a conservative LinkedIn. Fully staffing an administration requires about 4,000 political appointees, 1,200 of whom must be approved by the Senate. Heritage and its allied think-tanks are vetting the people to fill those jobs now.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Dismiss that which insults</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What would prove disqualifying? “If you kind of have shown yourself to have fought against the Trump administration, or there are issues where you&#39;ve actually been counter to it,” says Mr Dans. “You know where people stand by where they sit, so to speak. Their postings and social media, their allegiances over time can give people a pretty good picture.” Blaming Mr Trump for the ransacking of the Capitol in 2021, or supporting his impeachment in the days that followed, for example, would be enough to keep someone off the list.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thanks to these efforts, the next Trump administration, if there is one, will have fleshed-out plans and the know-how to advance them. That would make it very different from Mr Trump&#39;s first term. “We didn&#39;t have the people because nobody thought we would win,” says Steve Bannon, who managed Mr Trump&#39;s campaign and was an influential figure at the beginning of his presidency. (Mr Trump fired Mr Bannon, but later stopped him being tried for misuse of funds from a non-profit group he headed by pardoning him.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Bannon mentions the National Security Council ( <small>NSC</small> ) as an example of the staffing problems the Trump administration faced. It struggled to come up with half the necessary number of political appointees, he says. They were an odd mixture of people like Michael Anton, a corporate <small>PR</small> man and apocalyptic political commentator, and old foreign-policy hands who turned out to be queasy about Mr Trump&#39;s courting of North Korea&#39;s dictator and his hostility to American allies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What was true of the <small>NSC</small> applies to other agencies, too. “You have got to hit the beach with three or four thousand guys,” Mr Bannon says. Mr Dans agrees. “In Hollywood they like to describe things as &#39;this meets that meets the other&#39;. This is the Manhattan Project meets the Empire State Building meets <small>D</small> -Day.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The initial objective for this invading force is to capture the civil service. One lesson that Mr Trump&#39;s backers drew from his first term is that no policy matters more than control of the bureaucracy, because no policies can be implemented without it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To that end Mr Trump&#39;s commandos will “deconstruct” the administrative state—the 300 or more federal offices that issue and interpret regulations. The philosophical version of this idea is that, over time, as the role of the federal government has grown from fighting wars and running the postal service into the Leviathan it is today, unelected bureaucrats have assumed powers that should belong to Congress. The Twitter version is that the deep-state liberals who thwarted Mr Trump when he was in office and have persecuted him since he left must be vanquished. Either way, Mr Trump&#39;s shock troops will try to wrest power back from the bureaucracy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In practice it is hard to see how government would function without the administrative state. Congress struggles to fulfil basic responsibilities like passing a budget on time. To imagine that the same body could act as, say, the regulator of financial markets is a stretch. That may be the point. The <small>MAGA</small> movement is not libertarian, but in many ways it would like the federal government to do far less than it does now.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The would-be Trump appointees plan to subdue the bureaucracy using Schedule <small>F</small> , shorthand for an executive order issued by Mr Trump in 2020 and rescinded by Joe Biden when he became president. It reflects a view that the federal bureaucracy, whatever its size, should not have any entrenched authority. For the first century of its existence, civil servants were appointed to jobs by the government of the day based on an algorithm of personal contacts and favours owed known as the spoils system. Then in 1881 a deranged office-seeker assassinated the president, spurring the passage of the Pendleton Act, which created a class of professional bureaucrats who stayed in their posts even as the presidency changed hands. Since the 1940s, when Franklin Roosevelt was expanding the government, it has been hard to fire federal bureaucrats, <small>AFPI</small> complains.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many political appointees in the Trump administration believe that a minority of civil servants used their protected status to thwart or undermine the president&#39;s wishes. James Sherk, a policy adviser in the Trump White House who is now at <small>AFPI</small> , cites two cases on which lawyers in various government departments reportedly refused to work: one against Yale University for allegedly discriminating against Asian-Americans, and one aimed at protecting nurses from having to perform abortions. Schedule <small>F</small> would empower Mr Trump&#39;s appointees to remove perceived obstructionists at will.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Schedule <small>F</small> is now, I think, Republican doctrine,” says Russell Vought, who ran the Office of Management and Budget under Mr Trump. “I don&#39;t know how a Republican gets elected and doesn&#39;t do that.” It would also be straightforward to enact: Mr Trump could just reissue his old executive order. Again, there is a reasonable version of this idea, in which a small number of recalcitrant civil servants lose their jobs, and a campaign version, where Schedule <small>F</small> becomes the instrument of Mr Trump&#39;s righteous purge of Washington.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> To be with those I like is enough</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The combined effect of appointing only loyalists and cowing the bureaucracy would be both to remove constraints on Mr Trump and to ensure his wishes are acted on more often. In his first term Mr Trump&#39;s opponents took some comfort from the idea that not all the people around him were true believers, and were willing to stall his most alarming ideas. The <i>New York Times</i> ran an anonymous piece by a political appointee who claimed there was an internal resistance within the administration that acted as a check on presidential power. In a second Trump term, there will not be any “grown-ups in the room”, as Mr Trump&#39;s detractors called such people. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Silhouette of a Donald Trump statue being handed a spear" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ben Hickey</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Once a second Trump administration had bent the bureaucracy to its will, what policies would it pursue? The department-by-department plans being drawn up at <small>AFPI</small> , Heritage and elsewhere give some guidance. They involve some predictable fusillades in the culture wars, such as completing a wall along the border with Mexico and directing all federal officials to consider only people&#39;s biological sex, rather than “self-identified” gender. But some of the putative policy agenda is both more sweeping in scope and more of a break with past Republican orthodoxy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One such area is the economy. The new right is enthusiastic about the kind of industrial policy the Biden administration has pursued. “No one in Ohio…cares that the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial board doesn&#39;t like the <small>CHIPS</small> bill on free-market economic grounds,” JD Vance, a senator, recently told a gathering at American Compass, a think-tank, referring to a law subsidising semiconductor factories. In some cases Mr Trump&#39;s supporters would go further: Mr Vance advocates taxing companies that shift work offshore.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main partisan disagreement over industrial policy is no longer whether to have one at all, but over the Democrats&#39; habit of smuggling diversity requirements and environmental goals into it. As the Republicans have become a more working-class party than the Democrats, people like Mr Vance have tried to synthesise a <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/13/the-american-left-and-right-loathe-each-other-and-agree-on-a-lot">new Republican position</a> that is both pro-labour and hostile to union leaders. His advocacy of subsidies for industry without “the woke bullshit” is probably more popular than the Biden administration&#39;s approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That enthusiasm for an active state coexists with a more conventional Republican programme of lowering taxes, coupled with a belief that well-intentioned efforts to cut poverty usually backfire. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks of making permanent the tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, some of which are due to expire in 2025. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy wonks also advocate attaching work requirements to Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) and other government benefits. In Arkansas, the only state to have implemented work requirements for Medicaid, a quarter of those enrolled in the programme lost their health insurance and there was no noticeable increase in employment. The reforms would at least save some money, but not enough to have much impact on the federal deficit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Expensive industrial policy, lower taxes and only small reductions in benefits—in other words, less revenue and more spending—would not balance the books, much less trim government debts or refill the funds that pay for Medicare (subsidised health insurance for the disabled and the old) and Social Security (the state pension), which are due to run dry in the early 2030s. On past evidence the bond market is likely to continue to finance the growing gap between the government&#39;s income and expenditure. Investors might become nervous, however, if the Federal Reserve&#39;s independence were in question. Some Trumpists think it should be, since they do not like to cede so much power to unelected bureaucrats. That is a minority view, Mr Vought concedes, but could gain ground: “I guarantee that if that debate was in front of President Trump, that he wouldn&#39;t just throw you out of the Oval Office.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another area in which a second Trump term could bend the arc of history is in environmental policy. In his first term emissions of greenhouse gases kept falling, even though he reversed many of Barack Obama&#39;s policies to slow climate change. Investors assumed that government policy would soon revert to a greener norm and coal-fired power stations have lifespans of several decades, so the administration&#39;s fondness for them was not enough to get new ones built. In this respect, too, a second Trump administration would be more methodical and better organised.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Whatever satisfies the soul is truth</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about ending “the war on fossil fuels” and makes untethered assumptions about how much bigger the economy would be without it. ( <small>AFPI</small> estimates that America&#39;s <small>gdp</small> will be 6% smaller by the end of this decade than it would have been without the Obama administration&#39;s emissions-reductions targets.) The argument is presented in both pragmatic and moral terms. Why should American oil stay in the ground while Saudi oil flows? And why should the use of fuels which can bring so much prosperity to so many be circumscribed? Never mind that Mr Biden&#39;s administration has granted more permits to drill than Mr Trump&#39;s did, that America is the world&#39;s largest producer of oil or that it is in the national interest to limit global warming.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America Firsters like oil, gas and coal and the relatively well-paid, manly jobs for high-school graduates they bring. They are also opposed to the green transition, which they see as unnecessary government meddling that raises energy prices for ordinary Americans. Both Kevin Roberts, who runs Heritage, and Mrs Rollins, who started <small>AFPI</small> , used to be senior figures at the Texas Public Policy Foundation ( <small>TPPF</small> ), a think-tank which opposes the development of wind farms and solar plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Over a quarter of Texas&#39;s electricity is generated by renewables, and <small>TPPF</small> has helped to propagate the idea that this makes the state&#39;s power grid unstable. Investors in renewables say Texas&#39;s electricity regulator has become hostile to new projects. <small>TPPF</small> , meanwhile, is battling renewables as far afield as New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where it has initiated a lawsuit against a big offshore wind farm on behalf of fishermen. If the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department were run by people who shared these instincts, investors in renewables would face the same sort of political risks as owners of coal plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A third area which is likely to see great upheaval if Mr Trump becomes president again is foreign policy. Among America First types, there is deep disagreement about Ukraine. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about facing the threat from Russia. Yet Mr Bannon says, “I don&#39;t give a shit about Ukraine—what I give a shit about is the invasion of America&#39;s southern border.” Mr Vought makes the same point in a more wonkish way: “Ukraine is being subsidised by our taxpayers to fight and not make strategic calculations that they would otherwise make if we weren&#39;t subsidising it. And it&#39;s not in our interest to subsidise that conflict.” Mr Trump himself says he would end the war. He may not be able to do that. But Ukraine and its other allies ought to take seriously the possibility that America may no longer be with them in 18 months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Policy towards China is less contested. The Trump administration was more confrontational towards China than any of its predecessors. The Biden administration has continued in the same vein, albeit with less inflammatory rhetoric and more considered policies. “The difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration on protectionism is that the Biden administration is competent,” says Dan Drezner of Tufts University. A second Trump term would be more likely to build on what the Biden team have done rather than, say, loosening export controls. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Silhouette of a laurel wreath being lowered onto a Donald Trump statue" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ben Hickey</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Heritage&#39;s plan for 2025 foresees an immediate ban on TikTok and also on Confucius Institutes. American pension funds would be encouraged to divest from “problematic” Chinese entities. The government should be prepared “to employ punitive policy measures” to prevent American investment in sensitive areas in China and Chinese investment in America. American companies considering large-scale investments in anything deemed critical would have to submit information about counterparties and anticipated use of funds to the <small>US</small> government before investing, “under a presumption of denial”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whether Mr Trump would authorise the use of force if China were to invade Taiwan is hard to say. Some who worked in his administration note that whenever they were about to adopt tougher policies on China, the bosses of big American firms would call the White House and tell him that the move would alarm financial markets and he would back down. The same dynamic may apply in a second term. In a memoir of his time as Mr Trump&#39;s national security adviser, John Bolton suggests the former president was not really committed to Taiwan&#39;s security. Others claim he would be “stronger” than Mr Biden.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other allies could expect the same peremptory treatment as in Mr Trump&#39;s first term. He reportedly told aides he wanted to leave <small>nato</small> . Even <small>AFPI</small> , which on foreign policy is closer to the old Republican orthodoxy, thinks that military support should be withdrawn from countries that do not spend at least 2% of <small>GDP</small> on defence, a level that neither Japan nor most countries in <small>nato</small> meet. The modern America First movement, like its namesake during the second world war, contains some true isolationists. But it also contains an influential clutch of people like Elbridge Colby, who served in the Department of Defence and believes in a muscular foreign policy. He thinks China is such a threat that America should pull back from its defence commitments in Europe and the Middle East to concentrate on the Pacific.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> No matter how well-laid the plans for a second Trump term, nor how thoroughly vetted the people carrying them out, Mr Trump would still be in charge, which means there is a limit to how methodical it could be. But it would be altogether more formidable than the version of 2017-21. As for the candidate himself, he is aware of the plans being made on his behalf but has never been excited by the details of public policy. For the professional wonks in the movement, that is an opportunity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “ <i>The Economist</i> doesn&#39;t think that populists can govern, right?” asks Mr Vought. “We believe we&#39;re trying to be an answer to that viewpoint. So we&#39;re trying to look systemically: how does someone who has an American First perspective, a populist perspective, govern credibly and effectively? Because they know the inner workings of government so well.” The winner of next year&#39;s presidential election will be sworn in in 18 months. The institutions of the new right expect it to be Mr Trump, and this time they will be prepared. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.

And its neighbourhood is not just crowded, but also tumultuous. There is a rogue state, North Korea; war-torn ones, such as Myanmar; ones with which it has festering territorial disputes, such as India; others with which it has overlapping maritime claims, such as Japan; and one—Taiwan—which it is constantly threatening to invade. It is a difficult group to get along with under any circumstances, but China&#39;s flawed diplomacy is making the task even harder.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For centuries Chinese leaders thought of the world as a series of concentric circles emanating from the Dragon Throne. The inner ones formed territory under the emperor&#39;s direct rule. Then came neighbouring kingdoms such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam, which acknowledged the emperor&#39;s ultimate authority by paying tribute. Outermost were foreigners whose trade with China was often seen as tribute, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Xi Jinping, China&#39;s present-day potentate, puts a 21st-century spin on this worldview. At home he has made himself the “core” of the Communist Party and crushed dissent, especially in border areas. Globally, he has made China a more assertive power. But his efforts to bind China&#39;s neighbours more closely to it—“to warm people&#39;s hearts and enhance our affinity, charisma and influence”, as he ordered officials in 2013—have not gone to plan.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Twitchy in Tokyo</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Several neighbours are aligning themselves more closely with America, to counteract China&#39;s growing assertiveness. Most of those friendliest to China are unstable. Others fear its intentions. In recent votes at the <small>UN</small> , half of China&#39;s immediate neighbours broke ranks with it to condemn Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and only five backed a statement rejecting criticism of its policies in Xinjiang. That all speaks to a weakness in Chinese foreign policy that could undermine Mr Xi&#39;s ambitions. Put simply, can China really challenge American leadership in the world if it cannot get its own neighbours on board?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Powerful countries often try to enhance their own prosperity and security by dominating their region in economic, military, political and cultural terms. In the modern era France, Germany, Japan and Russia have all sought local hegemony by force, with devastating consequences. The European Union has expanded peacefully, but remains a marginal power on defence and security. Only America has managed to dominate its region for a long time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is partly owing to geography, which has helped America to keep other big powers at bay. But it has also bound itself to its neighbours through mutually beneficial arrangements, including a free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, close defence relations with both (especially Canada) and relatively open borders. American soft power helps, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s neighbourhood is far trickier. It has 22,800km of land borders, more than any other country. In addition, all eight of its maritime borders are disputed. China&#39;s neighbours include big economic and military powers, such as India and Russia, with their own regional ambitions. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM966.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s neighbours fall into three broad camps (see map): fragile or failing states (Afghanistan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea and Pakistan), frenemies that have close ties but fear Chinese domination (Mongolia, Russia and Central Asian states), and places with either defence treaties with America or military ties to it (India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Chinese officials deny seeking regional hegemony. In their telling, China wants only to reclaim its rightful borders, not to expand them or dominate neighbours. They blame America for frustrating Chinese ambitions. “Western countries—led by the <small>US</small> —have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression against us,” Mr Xi complained in a speech in March.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America has indeed worked hard lately to improve ties with countries near China. Yet many of Mr Xi&#39;s problems with his neighbours date back to a time when they felt either neglected by America (during the presidency of Barack Obama) or alarmed by it (during the presidency of Donald Trump). Reservations about China stem instead from its own missteps, according to officials and academics in neighbouring countries. In particular, they cite excessive muscularity on territorial issues, haphazard or coercive economic policies and a heavy-handed approach to diplomacy that is rooted in China&#39;s imperial past and grand assumptions about its future. Most are unconvinced by China&#39;s reassurances, especially given its support for Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and the implication that might is right.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For 30 years after its inconclusive war with Vietnam in 1979, China took a conciliatory approach to territorial disputes, opting for stability as it focused on economic reform. Between 1991 and 2002 it resolved disagreements about its land borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Tajikistan and Vietnam. Perhaps most remarkably, in 2008, it signed the last of a series of agreements affirming Russia&#39;s control over a Ukraine-sized region annexed from China in the 19th century.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tilt towards confrontation began before Mr Xi took power, but he has accentuated it, making territorial issues central to his pledge of “national rejuvenation”. China has, without doubt, succeeded in altering the territorial status quo to its advantage in the short term. Its ships and aircraft now regularly patrol around rocky specks where its claims overlap with Japan&#39;s in the East China Sea. The seven fortified artificial islands that it built on disputed reefs in the South China Sea have enhanced its capacity to enforce its claims there. In some contested border areas, Indian troops no longer patrol.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Those gains have come at a cost, however, by alarming China&#39;s neighbours. Japan adopted a new security strategy in December which pledged a doubling of defence spending by 2027 and a new counterstrike capability, moving away from the pacifist principles it has embraced since the second world war. Japan is also co-ordinating more closely on defence with America, including over Taiwan, and stepping up security co-operation with American allies and other Chinese neighbours.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Xi&#39;s approach to the South China Sea has also triggered a change of course in the Philippines, the only formal American ally among the five countries whose claims there overlap with China&#39;s. Its previous president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a “separation” from America in 2016, pledging to align with China&#39;s “ideological flow”. But relations soured after China continued to harass Philippine ships and failed to build promised infrastructure.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Leery on Luzon</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A new president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, is now re-emphasising relations with America. In February he gave it access to four new military bases, including three in its north that could be useful in a war over Taiwan. In April the two sides held their biggest-ever joint military drills, involving 12,000 American troops. They are planning to resume joint naval patrols in the South China Sea. China, meanwhile, has warned the Philippines that it is falling “into the abyss of geopolitical strife”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Vietnam also has claims in the South China Sea and had several maritime stand-offs with China there in the 2010s. It, too, has drawn closer to America militarily. In 2018 it let an American aircraft-carrier visit one of its ports for the first time in more than 40 years. Two more have visited since, including one in June this year. America has also supplied Vietnam with defence equipment, such as aircraft, drones and coastguard cutters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India is another neighbour reassessing ties, after a series of clashes with China on their disputed Himalayan frontier over the past four years, one of which killed at least 20 Indian troops and four from China. That was among the deadliest such skirmishes since China won a brief border war in 1962. Bilateral trade has continued to grow (by 8.6% last year), but India has limited investment from China, banned dozens of Chinese apps and launched tax raids on several Chinese firms.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India is also now working more closely with America and its allies on defence, bilaterally and as part of the Quad, which includes America, Australia and Japan. During a state visit to Washington in June, Narendra Modi, its prime minister, signed a series of deals on the defence industry which could eventually turn India into a base for the joint manufacturing of Western-designed weapons.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s perturbed neighbours are also collaborating more closely with one another. India has trained Vietnamese submariners, supplied Vietnam with 12 high-speed patrol boats and agreed to give it a missile corvette. India also recently sold cruise missiles to the Philippines. Japan has provided patrol craft for Vietnam and radar for the Philippines, which has also received three navy ships from South Korea since 2020 and is getting several more. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBC748.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The economic picture is less clear-cut. China is an indispensable partner to all its neighbours, including those with conflicting territorial claims. Bilateral trade in goods with its 20 terrestrial and maritime neighbours was just over $2trn in 2022, an increase of 74% over the past decade. That is more than the combined trade of America and the <small>EU</small> with the same countries. In poorer ones, China is also a big source of investment. A trade deal called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which came into force in 2022 and involves China and eight of its neighbours, will further boost cross-border commerce.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But in aggregate China&#39;s neighbours sell more to America and the <small>EU</small> combined than they do to China (see chart). What is more, China has an unsettling habit of using its economic clout to punish neighbours that rile it. That, too, did not start with Mr Xi. An early example came in 2010, when China banned exports of rare-earth minerals to Japan after a clash in the East China Sea. Mr Xi, however, has expanded the practice. This week he imposed <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/04/in-its-tech-war-with-america-china-brings-out-the-big-guns">new curbs on rare earths</a> . </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Jiankou section of the Great Wall in Beijing, China" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Xinhua/Eyevine</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mongolia was an early target for Mr Xi. After it hosted the Dalai Lama in 2016, China held up loans and customs clearances. Mongolia has since become even more dependent on trade with China, which buys about 84% of its goods exports (mostly coal). But Mongolia&#39;s government hedges through a partnership with <small>Nato</small> , which is helping it build cyber-defences, train officers in English and operate in conjunction with <small>Nato</small> forces (Mongolian troops have served in Kosovo and Afghanistan).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The row over the Dalai Lama also reinforced anti-Chinese sentiment in a country where many resent the treatment of their ethnic kin in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. A ban on teaching the Mongolian language there is especially unpopular. A former Mongolian president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, has called it an “atrocity that seeks to dissolve and eliminate Mongolians as an independent ethnicity”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Bruised in Busan</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is South Korea that stands out as an example of ill-judged Chinese arm-twisting. After Park Geun-hye became president in 2013, she sought closer ties with China, even attending a military parade in Beijing. Yet in 2017 China instituted an economic boycott after America deployed an anti-missile battery in South Korea, intended chiefly to deter North Korea, but which China also saw as a threat. Until then a regular survey by South Korea&#39;s Asan Institute that rates public views of other countries consistently gave China more than five out of ten. Last year it scored 2.7.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> South Korea is now strengthening its alliance with America, and setting aside long-running differences with Japan, its former colonial ruler. The two are also joining American-led efforts to reduce China&#39;s role in their supply chains. That is creating new opportunities for others on China&#39;s periphery. Hyundai, a South Korean carmaker, said in May that it would invest $2.5bn in India over the next decade. And Vietnam (where South Korea is already the biggest foreign investor) said in December that Samsung and <small>LG</small> , two South Korean electronics makers, would invest another $6bn between them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For China&#39;s poorer neighbours, investments in infrastructure help compensate for its domineering ways. Success stories include a cargo rail link across Central Asia that carries 8% of China-Europe trade, a railway from China to Laos, which began passenger services in April and could boost Laotian <small>GDP</small> by 21% according to the World Bank, and power projects that have increased blackout-prone Pakistan&#39;s generation capacity by 8 <small>GW</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet such initiatives are often undermined by a tendency to over-promise and to ignore local sentiment. In Nepal, China has not completed any of its promised Belt and Road projects. Malaysia has ditched several of them, alleging that costs were inflated. Debt problems related to Belt and Road have pushed Pakistan and Laos to the brink of default. And a civil war in Myanmar has delayed several big Chinese projects and further sapped support for China, which backs the hated military junta.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China has also failed to stop shady Chinese businesses and criminal gangs from piggybacking on Belt and Road. Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines have all seen a huge influx of Chinese money and workers into gambling ventures, leading to an uptick in crime. They and other poorer neighbours still crave development assistance. But as China confronts an economic slowdown and scales back Belt and Road, many are looking to Japan, whose aid comes with less baggage.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A recent survey by Singapore&#39;s <small>iseas</small> -Yusof Ishak Institute found little faith in China among its South-East Asian neighbours. More people expressed distrust than trust of it in Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines. Japan was more trusted in all six of China&#39;s neighbours in the region and America more so in five. China also ranked below America, Australia and the <small>EU</small> as a place to visit or study.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even in Kazakhstan, which does well from its ties with China, people are wary. The tension is striking at Khorgos, a border crossing with a five-square-kilometre duty-free zone spanning the frontier. Rising mirage-like from the steppe, the Chinese side features two dozen multistorey malls selling everything from leather jackets to flat-screen televisions. It teems with Kazakh shoppers, closely watched by Chinese riot police with shields and batons. The Kazakh side, meanwhile, has only a couple of half-built low-rise malls, where customers are scarce and employees mostly Chinese.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Kanat Agibayev, a 22-year-old Kazakh law student, likes the cheap winter clothes and rucksack he just bought on China&#39;s side. But ask about Chinese investment in Kazakhstan, or a recent deal for visa-free access, and he echoes the fears of other interviewees: “We&#39;ll get swamped.” Russian propaganda fans such Sinophobia. But China has contributed, too, not least with its recent detention of up to a million Chinese Muslims, including ethnic Kazakhs, in re-education camps. In 2022 a survey by Central Asia Barometer found that only 35% of Kazakhs supported Chinese involvement in energy and infrastructure projects, down from almost half in 2018.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Then there are the chest-beating declarations of China&#39;s “wolf warrior” diplomats. In April alone China&#39;s ambassador in Manila appeared to threaten Filipino workers in Taiwan and the one in Paris questioned the legitimacy of former Soviet states. A month later Mr Xi hosted five Central Asian leaders at a summit infused with imagery from the Tang Dynasty, when China ruled much of Central Asia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “It looked like an emperor receiving tribal chieftains,” says Bekzat Maqsutuly, a Kazakh activist detained for planning a protest against a deal signed at the summit permitting visa-free travel between China and Kazakhstan. A Kazakh official dismisses his complaints as “irrational”. Only 3,412 Chinese nationals work in Kazakhstan, government figures show. The visa deal will benefit Kazakh lorry drivers and business people as much as Chinese visitors. Even so, the official adds, Kazakhstan&#39;s future lies not in subordination to either Russia or China, but in close relations with lots of big powers, including America, Japan and the <small>EU</small> (Kazakhstan&#39;s biggest trade partner and foreign investor), as well as Turkey, which jointly produces weapons in Kazakhstan and is a member of <small>nato</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> None of this means that China&#39;s neighbours are turning their backs on it. Given its economic heft, that is unthinkable. But it points to a future in which Mr Xi&#39;s hegemonic ambitions are frustrated as the more stable and dynamic countries on his borders either resist his initiatives or hedge their bets, while the most volatile ones, with the dimmest prospects, become increasingly reliant on China&#39;s support. The challenge for America and its allies is to offer China&#39;s neighbours ever more ways to hedge. For Mr Xi, the question is more existential: can China accept relations with its neighbours in which it is anything less than pre-eminent? <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 04 Jul 2023 19:42:21 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/25la226967oijigvcntp9ibk9hcvac1d</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/04/why-china-should-be-friendlier-to-its-neighbours </item><item><title><![CDATA[The surprising upside of climate migration]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div id="script-microapp"><section class="image svelte-kfr41l"><figure class="svelte-kfr41l"><div class="svelte-kfr41l"><img src="/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1424/20230624_FBP005.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/360/20230624_FBP005.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/384/20230624_FBP005.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/480/20230624_FBP005.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/600/20230624_FBP005.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/834/20230624_FBP005.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/960/20230624_FBP005.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1096/20230624_FBP005.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1280/20230624_FBP005.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1424/20230624_FBP005.jpg 1424w" alt class="svelte-8q80dm"></div><figcaption class="svelte-xo6s0l credit-only"><p class="credit"> image: josh haner/the new york times/redux/eyevine </p></figcaption></figure></section><div class="ds-container svelte-ddkotw"></div><p class="article-text"> <span>O</span> <small>n the outskirts</small> of Niamey, the capital of Niger, it looks as if the countryside has moved to the city. Clusters of dome-like wooden huts have popped up. Cows and goats are tethered in the shade. Waves of rural folk have arrived, largely because of climate change.</p><p class="article-text"> “The seasons are not good like they used to be. It is hotter and the rains often fail,” says Ganso Seyni Ali, the chief of a group of herders from rural Niger. He has moved permanently to the city with half of his home village—over 150 families.</p><p class="article-text"> To a visitor from a rich country, their settlement looks grim. They have no right to the land they occupy and are periodically evicted. But the city is safer than the countryside, where herders and farmers clashed constantly over dwindling pasture and water. Mr Ali describes deadly battles fought with guns, arrows and machetes. In the city such strife is rare, in part because life is less desperate.</p><p class="article-text"> Mr Ali&#39;s group have swiftly adapted to their new environment. They take their cows outside the city to graze, and find extra forage by knocking on doors to ask for vegetable scraps. They find it easier to sell milk, with so many customers close by. Mr Ali offers your correspondents a steaming bowlful, fresh from the udder.</p><p class="article-text"> Many of his group have also found jobs. “It&#39;s better here. There&#39;s work,” says Ali Soumana, an ex-herder who now makes bricks. Back in the village he did not have enough to eat; now he does.</p><p class="article-text"> When flames approach and you don&#39;t have a fire extinguisher, you move. By the same token, as parts of the Earth grow less habitable, people will migrate. The rich will find it easier to adapt to higher temperatures or rising sea levels, since they can afford air-conditioning and flood defences. The poor have fewer options.</p><p class="article-text"> How many will move because of climate change is impossible to say. In “Nomad Century”, a book published last year, Gaia Vince wrote that if the world grew 4°C hotter by 2100 (an apocalyptic scenario), regions currently inhabited by 3.5bn people would become uninhabitable. Extreme forecasts like this are often seized on for political reasons. Green groups have cited the threat of “billions” of climate refugees to lend urgency to their calls to curb emissions. Nativists in rich countries use imagined hordes of climate migrants to justify ever stricter policing of borders.</p><p class="article-text"> Cooler thinking is required. More plausible numbers come from a modelling exercise by the World Bank known as Groundswell, the findings of which were first published in 2018 and updated in 2021. It uses a “gravity model” to simulate how changes to things like water availability, agriculture and sea level might push people out of some areas and into others. It predicts that by 2050 between 44m and 216m people in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, Latin America and the Pacific islands could be on the move within their own countries (see chart). </p><div class="ds-image ai2html-chart ds-image__left"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-box" class="ai2html svelte-16z6vcq"><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1" class="g-artboard svelte-16z6vcq"><img id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1-img" class="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1-img g-aiImg svelte-16z6vcq" alt src="/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/images/20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1.png"><div id="legend-text" class="g-content-layer g-aiAbs g-aiPointText svelte-16z6vcq"><p class="g-pstyle2 svelte-16z6vcq"> Pessimistic‡</p><p class="g-pstyle3 svelte-16z6vcq"> Max estimate </p></div></div><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_2" class="g-artboard svelte-16z6vcq"><img id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_2-img" class="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_2-img g-aiImg svelte-16z6vcq" alt src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=="><div id="legend-text" class="g-content-layer g-aiAbs g-aiPointText svelte-16z6vcq"><p class="g-pstyle2 svelte-16z6vcq"> Pessimistic‡</p><p class="g-pstyle3 svelte-16z6vcq"> Max estimate </p></div></div><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_3" class="g-artboard svelte-16z6vcq"><img id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_3-img" class="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_3-img g-aiImg svelte-16z6vcq" alt src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=="><div id="legend-text" class="g-content-layer g-aiAbs g-aiPointText svelte-16z6vcq"><p class="g-pstyle3 svelte-16z6vcq"> Pessimistic‡</p><p class="g-pstyle4 svelte-16z6vcq"> Max estimate</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p class="article-text"> Groundswell looks only at domestic migration, rather than the cross-border sort, because most climate migrants will be too poor to travel far (especially if droughts or floods have wiped out their assets). It excludes rich countries and small island states. Its analysis is hostage to unpredictable factors, such as how much governments spend on flood defences. Its gloomier scenarios rest on implausibly pessimistic assumptions about global emissions of greenhouse gases. But it gives a sense of the daunting scale of the problem: there are roughly 100m displaced people in the world today, mostly owing to war, so Groundswell&#39;s higher estimate of 216m additional climate migrants would constitute a tripling.</p><p class="article-text"> Climate-induced migration will often be traumatic. Yet it will also be an essential tool for adapting to a warming planet. And it may have some positive side-effects. If it causes more subsistence farmers to move to cities, they will probably find better work, health care and schools. They may also start having smaller families.</p><p class="article-text"> Niger, where climate change is already spurring large-scale migration, gives a sense of how things might unfold. More than nine in ten people have noticed changes in the environment, such as more frequent droughts, floods or soil degradation, finds a survey by the International Organisation for Migration. Three-quarters said climate change had made it harder to grow food or raise livestock. Half said that a member of their family had been forced to move because of the weather. </p><div class="map svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-1b9yre3"><p><svelte-scroller-outer class="svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background-container class="background-container svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"><div class="main svelte-9t3n8j"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class></div></div></div></div></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-foreground class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"><section class="svelte-1b9yre3"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"> Almost all of Niger&#39;s population live in the south; to the north is desert, which covers 80% of the country</div></section><section class="svelte-1b9yre3"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"> Climate change has dramatically affected the country&#39;s rainfall.

An increase of one standard deviation in local temperature raises the risk of intergroup conflict by 11%, finds a study by Marshall Burke of Stanford University and others. Niger is racked by insurgency. “Terrorism and crime are closely linked with climate change,” its president, Mohamed Bazoum, tells <i>The Economist</i> .</p><p class="article-text"> When rural migrants move to urban areas, their lives tend to improve. Throughout the developing world, poverty is less common in cities. Urban wages are higher and depend less on the weather.</p><p class="article-text"> Climate change may jolt some into making a decision (to migrate) that would long have been in their interest anyway. A study in Kenya in 2020 found that rural people underestimate how high wages are in the capital, and that this makes them less likely to move. Another study looked at the aftermath of a volcanic eruption on an Icelandic island. Comparing the children of families whose homes were destroyed by lava with those that weren&#39;t, it found that being forced to move dramatically improved their education and lifetime earnings. This is not an argument for razing homes; but it suggests people would benefit from moving more than they do.</p><p class="article-text"> Those who move to the city are more likely to send their children to school, because schools are easier to get to and urban jobs require more book-learning. Back home, almost no children from his village attended classes, says Mr Ali. In Niamey that figure has risen to 30% or so, he reckons. That may be low, but it is progress. In Niger as a whole, urban children are twice as likely to attend primary school as their rural peers, and nearly four times as likely to attend secondary school. </p><div class="ytube svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-nyddqh"><div class="you__tube svelte-nyddqh"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pNNKexmjVAE/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Youtube 视频：" class="svelte-hw9fhp"><h3 class="svelte-nyddqh"></h3></div></div></div><p class="article-text"> Access to health care is usually better in cities, too. Abdul Moumouni Hassone, a farmer who moved to Niamey five years ago, recalls the time back in his village when his younger brother was feverish with malaria. Mr Hassone loaded him into a donkey cart and raced to the nearest clinic, 40km away. It took three hours. “He died as we arrived,” he sighs. In the city, by contrast, “It&#39;s easy to get medicine. There&#39;s a pharmacy on every corner.”</p><p class="article-text"> By accelerating urbanisation, climate change could hasten cultural change, too. Niger&#39;s population is still more than 80% rural. Villages can be stifling places, where old men enforce rigid traditions that, among other things, treat women abominably. In the hurly-burly of a city, those rules weaken. Old men may lament the shift to immodest dress and individualism. “In a village, when we make a decision, everyone follows it. Here [in the city], it&#39;s everyone for himself,” sighs Mr Hassone, who is 66. Yet he admits that his children prefer urban life, because there is more to do (and, whisper it, more freedom). “When we visit our village, they don&#39;t want to stay there even two days.”</p><p class="article-text"> The biggest change concerns fertility. In sub-Saharan Africa rural women each have on average 5.8 babies whereas urban ones have just 3.9. A study by George Martine, a Canadian demographer, and others found that urbanisation plays a big role in reducing family sizes. So climate migration could reduce population growth in some of the places where it is fastest.</p><p class="article-text"> Mr Hassone says that in his village a typical woman would have a dozen children, of whom perhaps nine would survive. He still thinks big families are desirable, but he can see how norms are shifting, as each child is no longer seen as an extra pair of hands to help in the fields, but as an extra mouth to feed, with added school fees. Some women who move to the city have “just two or three [babies], and then they are done!” he laments. Yet he concedes that, unlike rural children, all the urban ones will probably survive.</p><p class="article-text"> Whereas some climate migrants flee drought, others will be displaced by rising waters. In 2018 Daniel Lincke and Jochen Hinkel, two academics in Germany, used cost-benefit analyses to calculate that only 13% of the world&#39;s coastlines would be worth defending under their most pessimistic scenario, mostly in wealthy and densely populated parts of Europe, East Asia and the eastern United States. Conversely, 65% of coastline was not worth protecting under any scenario.</p><p class="article-text"> People will have to move out of flood zones. Some rich countries have property buy-out schemes to encourage this, but so far these have been modest in scale. Roughly 40,000 American families have taken buy-outs in the past 30 years, for example. Occasionally, a scheme may involve moving a whole community. A decade ago America spent $48m to move two dozen families from a rapidly disappearing sandbar in Louisiana to a new site 60km away.</p><p class="article-text"> That model will be hard to replicate, however. People tend to move as individuals or families, not as villages. And poor countries must adapt to rising waters on much tighter budgets. Consider Bangladesh. Most of this South Asian country of 170m is flood plain: flat as a billiard table. Its people have adapted shrewdly to violent weather. Whereas a cyclone in 1970 killed over 300,000, now early-warning systems, typhoon shelters and embankments keep the annual death toll from floods and storm surges to a few dozen. Yet the elements still cause havoc. In the south, cyclones flatten houses. In the north, floods gnaw away at friable river banks. A village can disappear in days. </p><div class="map svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-1jgib5d"><p><svelte-scroller-outer class="svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background-container class="background-container svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="main svelte-1133alf"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class></div></div></div></div></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-foreground class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> Bangladesh&#39;s population is spread across the country; around 22m people live in or near Dhaka, the capital.</div></section><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> Over the past two decades <span>floods</span> have been concentrated in the north-east, as satellite data show.</div></section><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> The Groundswell report predicts that climate change will push between 6.8m and 19.9m Bangladeshis to migrate internally by 2050, or 3.8-11.3% of the projected population.</div></section><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> Many will leave the rice paddies of the north-east and the southern river delta.

More insidious is when a river gobbles up a family&#39;s land. They save themselves from drowning by moving. They often remain in the countryside because the land is exceptionally fertile, and rural social services are surprisingly good in Bangladesh thanks to a legion of NGOs. But they have lost their assets, and often end up working other people&#39;s land.</p><p class="article-text"> Amirul Islam lost his home three times. He weeps at the memory. “When my two children ask me where my grandfather&#39;s house is, I cannot answer. Our house is now in the middle of the river,” he says. He moved to Chattogram, a port city, with seven relatives, and found work in a garment factory. He earns more than he did in the village, although he misses his old life.</p><p class="article-text"> The government&#39;s national strategy for climate displacement seeks to warn people of risks, curb settlement in vulnerable areas and help the displaced earn a living. Previous efforts did not always work well, however: many people were sent with little consultation to far-flung places with few jobs. Despite being given new houses and plots to farm, many chose not to stay. “We would go back a few years later and find that they had sold the land and ended up landless again,” says Tasneem Siddiqui of the University of Dhaka. Many simply pocketed the money and moved to cities. They may have a better idea of their own interests than any planner. </p><figure class="svelte-1whsw9v text-col-image ds-container"><img src="/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1424/20230701_FBP002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/360/20230701_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/384/20230701_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/480/20230701_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/600/20230701_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/834/20230701_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/960/20230701_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1096/20230701_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1280/20230701_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1424/20230701_FBP002.jpg 1424w" alt class="svelte-8q80dm"><figcaption class="svelte-xo6s0l credit-only"><p class="credit"> image: Zabed Hasnain Chowdhury/ZUMA/Eyevine</p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-text"> Lots of climate migrants would like to move to the rich world. Some prosperous places enable this, albeit in a strictly controlled fashion. Shahed Hossain&#39;s home in Bangladesh was destroyed by a flood. He moved to a city, worked in a factory, saved and borrowed and eventually managed to buy a plane ticket to the United Arab Emirates (which lets in far more unskilled migrants than any Western country). As a labourer there he makes $400 a month—four times what he earned in Bangladesh. He has repaid his debts, and can now afford to send his children to university.</p><p class="article-text"> But most rich countries are far less open to migrants, many of whom take extraordinary risks to get to them nonetheless. Sylla Alseny, a farmer from Guinea, left home because his crops were ravaged by insects. (He blames climate change.) He headed for Europe overland. (Flying would have been cheaper, but he had no visa.) In Algeria his traffickers robbed him at knifepoint. In Tunisia police deported him, after gang-raping a female migrant in his group. He never made it to Europe.</p><p class="article-text"> Some countries are contemplating a warmer welcome for climate migrants. One, Argentina, has created a new visa for those fleeing climate-related disasters. (It has barely been used, perhaps because Argentina is far from anywhere people are fleeing.) A White House report in 2021 said some of those displaced by climate change “may” qualify as refugees. That is a tricky category to define, however, and the world&#39;s asylum systems are dysfunctional.</p><p class="article-text"> In the meantime, most climate migrants will have to stay close to home. Few of the most vulnerable places are prepared for a surge of them. In north Africa, whose inhabitants cluster by the coast, Groundswell predicts that 4.5m-13m people (2-6% of the population) will be displaced by climate change by 2050. </p><div class="map svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-1c988d1"><p><svelte-scroller-outer class="svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background-container class="background-container svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="main svelte-9t3n8j"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class></div></div></div></div></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-foreground class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"><section class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"> In Egypt most people live along the Mediterranean coast or the Nile.</div></section><section class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"> By 2050, rising seas mean that much of the north coast, especially around the city of Alexandria, will be below the level at which <span>floods</span> can be expected at least once a year.</div></section><section class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"> Groundswell predicts that many people will leave low-lying coastal areas and head for Cairo. </div></section></div></svelte-scroller-foreground></svelte-scroller-outer></p></div></div><p class="article-text"> Many Egyptian farmers will see their fields dry out, too. Almost all Egypt&#39;s water comes from the Nile. Yet Egypt&#39;s government encourages waste by providing water free of charge to farmers and cheaply to households. Farmers flood their crops, rather than using drip irrigation. As a result, pipes often run dry.</p><p class="article-text"> This happened last year to Romany Sami, a 27-year-old farmer. He moved to Cairo and found a job as an electrician. But to afford a flat big enough for his family, he would have had to commute two or three hours each way through the city&#39;s awful traffic. Instead he shared a cramped space with 12 other labourers. It was miserable, so eventually he went back to his farm, where there is water again—for now.</p><p class="article-text"> Egypt&#39;s urbanisation rate, at 43%, has barely changed since the 1970s. At some point it will have to rise again; it makes no sense for half the swelling population of a desiccating country to live in the countryside. Yet the government has done little to make cities more welcoming. Fuel subsidies promote congestion. Red tape and rent controls make housing hard to find. The government should be making cities more livable. Instead, it is building a grandiose new capital with ornamental lakes 50km from Cairo. That provides fat contracts for military-backed firms, but few Egyptians can afford to live there.</p><p class="article-text"> Amazingly, many governments discourage domestic mobility. Roughly half have policies to reduce rural-urban migration, according to the <small>UN</small> . China&#39;s household-registration system bars rural folk from many public services in big cities, forcing millions of domestic migrants to leave their children in awful village schools. A huge rural job-guarantee scheme in India in effect pays the poor to remain in their home states. Similar schemes reduce mobility in Ethiopia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Discouraging free movement makes societies less dynamic under any circumstances. It also makes it harder for them to adapt to climate change.</p><p class="article-text"> Policies aimed at the world&#39;s estimated 475m smallholder farms tend to focus on helping them stay where they are by adopting more climate-resilient farming techniques. That can be useful. But many of these small farms will eventually become unsustainable because of climate change. Many farmers will have to give up farming, find other jobs and rely on bigger, more capital-intensive farms for food.</p><p class="article-text"> Rather than trying to prevent the inevitable, Sam Huckstep and Michael Clemens of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington, suggest that governments should subsidise rural-urban transport, teach rural folk how much urban jobs pay and help them find work when they arrive. They should also make state benefits portable, so that migrants do not lose them when they move.</p><p class="article-text"> The challenges of preparing for climate migration, though only a subset of the challenges of preparing for climate change itself, are immense. New arrivals will need physical infrastructure, from housing to transport, and the human capital to help them adapt, especially education, health care and job training.</p><p class="article-text"> All this may seem daunting. Yet if one thinks of climate mobility “as a process that occurs over the next hundred years, it can become a lot less scary,” says AR Siders of the University of Delaware. “One hundred years from now things will look very, very different…And so resisting the idea of change—it&#39;s sort of nonsensical.” <span>■</span></p><p class="article-print"> This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Out of the frying pan&quot;</p><p class="article-sources"> Sources: WorldPop and Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Columbia University; Groundswell Spatial Population and Migration Projections; USGS Earlywarning; Floodbase; Climate Central;<i>经济学家</i></p><div class="related-content svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tiles svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tile main svelte-13yxci9"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/30/why-affirmative-action-in-american-universities-had-to-go" class="svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDP504.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></a><p class="svelte-13yxci9"> And why what comes after could be better </p></div><div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDP503.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDD003.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDP502.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 10:15:10 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/vuu9tabaahi7u9d43ebabgk64hmkh5gr</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration </item><item><title><![CDATA[War is reshaping the Ukrainian state—for the better]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Governing%20Ukraine-738896fd61e4d7fa565e9906c0b35d33.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>W</span> <small>HEN RUSSIAN</small> tanks began bearing down on Kyiv, Ukraine&#39;s capital, in February of last year, Mykhailo Fedorov was overseeing improvements to an app that provides Ukrainians with easy access to government services. At the time the app focused on fairly conventional tasks: filing tax returns, obtaining business permits, claiming benefits and so on. But the 32-year-old Mr Fedorov and his colleagues quickly added extra features. Now <small>DIIA</small> (the Ukrainian for “action” and also an acronym for “the State and Me”) allows patriots to donate to the war effort, struggling businesses to apply for state support and ordinary citizens to <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/22/how-a-chatbot-has-turned-ukrainian-civilians-into-digital-resistance-fighters">report Russian troop movements</a> . And with the war making it hard for people to visit government offices, the ability to conduct official business online has become a godsend for many.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When Volodymyr Zelensky became Ukraine&#39;s president in 2019, he promised to modernise a state that until then had been a byword for bureaucracy and corruption. <small>DiIa</small> , launched in 2020, was the centrepiece of this effort. But what began as a means to mollify exasperated voters quickly became part of Ukraine&#39;s struggle for survival. To beat back the Russian onslaught and keep the government functioning, the state has had no choice but to become vastly more nimble and effective.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Wreckage and resolve</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The young, tech-savvy Ukrainians leading this overhaul see it not just as a necessity, but also as an opportunity. “We call it Ukraine 2.0. We all loved Ukraine as we knew it, but there were a lot of things in it which we don&#39;t want to bring into a new one. We got a unique chance to build a new country,” says Oleksandr Kamyshin, a 38-year-old former manager of a venture-capital fund who is now restructuring Ukraine&#39;s arms industry.  “The full-scale Russian invasion not only brought the horrors of war to millions of Ukrainians. February 24th 2022 was also an occasion for Ukraine to rethink itself,” echoes <i>Ukrainska Pravda</i> , an online newspaper.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <b>Read more of our package of articles on rebuilding Ukraine:</b></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Like Mr Fedorov, the Ukrainian state was born in 1991. A vestige of the Soviet Union, it was seen by many Ukrainians as more of a nuisance than a benefit. Corruption was endemic, from the bribes demanded by traffic cops to the kickbacks needed to secure government contracts. The public put far more faith in civil society than in official institutions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It was civil society, naturally enough, that spearheaded the campaign to change all this. It led the Maidan uprising of 2013-14 (pictured), a protest movement which brought about the fall of Viktor Yanukovych, the grasping pro-Russian president of the day. The new government, with the help of Western aid agencies, set up a series of institutions to battle corruption, including an independent investigation bureau, dedicated prosecutors and a special court. Mr Zelensky has since strengthened this system by installing a new council composed partly of retired American and European judges to regulate judicial conduct. The details of most public procurement are now made public, to make crooked transactions easier to spot. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Anti-government demonstrators clash with riot police in central Kiev on February 18th 2014." width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">They are probably in government now</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These new rules and institutions have not eliminated corruption, but they have made it a far riskier undertaking, rather than the accepted norm. In the three-and-a-half years that the anti-corruption court has been operating, 65 people have been convicted in it, including 20 judges and several <small>mp</small> s and senior officials. Such prosecutions were unheard-of before 2014. “In the past few years corruption stopped being a system and became an ailment that could be dealt with,” says Vitaly Shabunin, an anti-corruption activist.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Threatened by rectitude</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This change seems to have infuriated Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s president. Not only had the popular campaign for good government caused the downfall of a pro-Russian regime; it was also undermining Mr Putin&#39;s favoured technique for suborning Ukrainian politicians and, worse, it was creating an alarming example of successful reform that might inspire his own citizens. In a speech laying out Russia&#39;s case for war days before the invasion, Mr Putin included among Ukraine&#39;s supposed crimes the creation of the new units to fight corruption. It was not just a passing reference: he listed each agency individually, and denounced them all as tools of America. “Not every politician in Ukraine could name all these institutions. This was a real tribute to our work,” says Mr Shabunin. “Putin realised that if he does not interfere now, these reforms would lead Ukraine into the Western world.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But far from halting the overhaul of the Ukrainian state, Mr Putin&#39;s invasion has accelerated it. The state-owned railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, is a good example. In August 2021, just months before the invasion, it was put in the hands of Mr Kamyshin, who has not only a Cossack-style semi-shaved hairdo, but also a degree from <small>INSEAD</small> , a French business school. At the time, he says, Ukrzaliznytsia was a feeding trough for corrupt officials, politicians and shady intermediaries, who sold it second-rate supplies at inflated prices.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Kamyshin quickly cleared out the middlemen. But to keep the trains running throughout the war, despite relentless shelling and blackouts, he also had to empower not just thrusting young managers but also the grizzled engineers who know the tracks inside out. As a result, Ukrzaliznytsia has kept essential cargo moving, be it weapons, troops, humanitarian aid or refugees. It even ferried Joe Biden, America&#39;s president, across the country on a visit in February, earning its special service the sobriquet “Rail Force One”. All this has made Ukrzaliznytsia a popular brand among young Ukrainians. In November it opened its first merchandise shop in Kyiv.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In March Mr Kamyshin became the minister in charge of the defence industry, another pit of inefficiency and graft. State-owned factories produced more shells in the first month after his appointment than they had done in the entire previous year. Mr Fedorov, now a deputy prime minister, has found a different way to speed up military procurement, <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/27/how-crowdfunding-is-shaping-the-war-in-ukraine">crowdfunding</a> the purchase of around 4,000 drones and the training of 10,000 people to use them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Fedorov has also turned his hand to streamlining the operations of the armed forces. (In his trainers, sweatshirt and jeans, wielding only a sticker-spattered laptop, he has probably done more damage to Mr Putin&#39;s war machine than most men in uniform.) He has helped create software to pool information from assorted drones, sensors and cameras to provide a comprehensive picture of the battlefield, which can be viewed in real time by everyone from generals to foot soldiers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Appropriately enough for a system enabling quicker, less hierarchical decision-making, the software in question was developed not at a secret military research institute on orders from on high; instead, shortly before the war began, the army assembled a team of volunteer programmers and activists; they have applied themselves to problems as they have arisen. Mr Fedorov organises hackathons to come up with solutions to specific programming conundrums. “There is a fundamental change now in how we think, how we make decisions and what kind of a country we are building,” says Mr Fedorov.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The distaste for rigid hierarchies and the devolution of decision-making are among the defining features of this new approach to administration. Those may sound like boilerplate principles of good government, but they are rare in post-Soviet states. Their adoption by the Ukrainian army helps explain why it has been able to keep Russia&#39;s numerically superior forces at bay. They have also been used to great effect by Mr Kamyshin&#39;s former boss, Oleksandr Kubrakov, the minister of infrastructure, in the mammoth task of distributing all the weapons and supplies donated by Ukraine&#39;s allies. These have to be brought to the front lines without being stockpiled in big warehouses or transported along predictable routes, since both would create easy targets for Russian bombs. He has achieved the near-impossible by dividing deliveries into multitudes of small consignments, the vast majority of which are moved by private hauliers along a plethora of obscure and ever-evolving routes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That hints at another change: treating ordinary Ukrainians as allies of the state, rather than adversaries or subjects. Civil society has also grown stronger during the war. A survey conducted in mid-2022 found that 86% of Ukrainians had volunteered in some way to support the war effort. There has been an eight-fold increase in the number of registered charities since the start of the war. At the same time, there has been a blurring of the lines between activism and government. Mr Shabunin has enlisted in the army. Mustafa Nayyem, a journalist whose social-media posts were a catalyst for the Maidan uprising, served for a time as a deputy to Mr Kubrakov, overseeing the road network, and now heads the agency charged with post-war reconstruction. His brother, a human-rights lawyer, also enlisted, and lost an eye in combat.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The new generation of reformist administrators is well aware that they are not just restructuring ministries and state-owned enterprises, but are laying the foundation of a new country. “It is essential that everybody has a vision and understands what they have fought for, what we are building” says Mr Fedorov. “Without that vision, there can be no success.” </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A man trims a tree in front of a bombarded and burnt block of flats in Irpin, Kyiv region, Ukraine" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Giving shape to a revival</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Success is far from guaranteed, however, even if the war goes well. The forces arrayed against the reinvention of the Ukrainian state are many and powerful. For one thing, not all Ukrainians support the idea. Many in the old elite are losing their meal tickets. The office of the president is preoccupied not just with the war, but also with politics; the nitty-gritty of administration is a much lower priority. And the exigencies of the invasion have put the security services in positions of great authority, often with little oversight.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Corruption remains rife, a clear sign that not all bureaucrats have turned over a new leaf. Last month the most senior judge on the Supreme Court was charged with taking bribes. A scandal involving the procurement of military rations has also come to light since the beginning of the war, leading to the sacking of several officials and the resignation of the deputy minister of defence. A reforming official gripes that in some parts of the country businesses are suffering extortion on a par with the depredations of Mr Yanukovych&#39;s tenure.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What is more, the war is robbing Ukraine of many of its best and brightest. In addition to those killed or disabled on the battlefield (Ukraine does not disclose casualty figures), some 6.2m people have fled the country over the past 18 months, more than 15% of the pre-war population. The workforce has shrunk by the same proportion. And some 60% of the adults who have left had university degrees, says Tetyana Berezhna, deputy minister for economy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The exodus is currently constrained, since men of working age are not allowed to leave the country. But with so many Ukrainians now settled elsewhere in Europe, in many cases with jobs or children in school, the likelihood is that lots of Ukrainian men will go join their relatives whenever travel restrictions are lifted. Those who stay will present problems, too: they will be traumatised by fighting, and in many cases gravely injured. “The war has generated a major demographic crisis in the country,” says Ms Berezhna.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although the economy is showing some signs of life, it has been clobbered. It shrank by about 35% last year. The World Bank predicts that more than half the population may be living in poverty by the end of 2023. Some 3m people are unemployed. Roughly 5m are internally displaced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The government&#39;s priority is to try to stop the economy from atrophying yet more. It is handing out grants to small and medium-sized businesses and farmers on the condition that they create new jobs. Some 6,000 new businesses have sprung up since the war began and some 40,000 jobs have been saved by relocating firms from the most war-torn parts of the country to safer areas in the west. The state is also creating programmes to reintegrate veterans into civilian life and to make it easier for the disabled to work.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the longer run the government also wants to make Ukraine a more attractive place to invest and do business. It is debating sweeping deregulation of the labour market—to such an extent that some observers worry it will gravely reduce workers&#39; rights. Accession to the European Union, which officially accepted Ukraine as a candidate last year, will require detailed reforms to everything from energy markets to customs procedures. The process is seen by reformers as a critical safeguard, preventing the reinvention of the state from going into reverse.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The government has set all manner of lofty targets, such as doubling the size of the economy in a decade, which would require average annual growth of 7%. Its official “Recovery Plan Blueprint” calls for privatisation, stronger laws on competition and corporate governance and “de-oligarchisation”. Mr Fedorov expresses hope that the war will transform Ukraine from an economy focused on natural resources and the associated rents to one driven by technology and innovation. The authorities see <small>it</small> , already 5% of <small>gdp</small> , as an important potential source of growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All of this is contingent not only on restoring security, but also on attracting vast amounts of investment. The government estimates the bill for reconstruction at more than $750bn. Ukraine&#39;s allies and donors <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/22/rebuilding-ukraine-will-require-money-but-also-tough-reforms">have gathered in London this week</a> for a big conference intended in part to work out how to drum up such a daunting sum.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Ukrainian civil-society groups&#39; biggest worry about reconstruction is not that there will too little money, but rather that it will not be well spent and much of it will be embezzled, according to a recent survey conducted by Chatham House, a British think-tank. These sorts of concerns are widespread: according to a recent poll commissioned by <i>Zerkalo Nedeli</i> , another Ukrainian online newspaper, 84% of Ukrainians agree that, even during the war, “The facts about corruption should be made public, because through corruption we will lose unity, the support of partners, and, ultimately, victory.”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The war on graft</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Ukraine in this war is fighting not only for the right to exist, but also for the opportunity to become a European country, intolerant to corruption…That is why scrutiny of officials and government becomes even more important for journalists than before the war,” says Segvil Musaeva, the editor-in-chief of <i>Ukrainska Pravda</i> . “We cannot allow our society, our army to find out after the end of this war that all this time officials have persisted in misconduct, bad governance or corruption.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Fedorov agrees. In the eyes of the trailblazers of Ukraine 2.0, it is the government&#39;s efforts to work for its citizens, rather than exploit them, that make Ukraine worth fighting for. Everyone has been profoundly affected by the war, he explains, and everyone has become an activist, in effect. “Our society has grown tremendously,” he says, “It will not allow us to turn in the wrong direction.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 22 Jun 2023 12:53:57 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/q8e20jb2im2bni62vtn9ulptim4cpgrn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/22/war-is-reshaping-the-ukrainian-state-for-the-better</item><item><title><![CDATA[Inflation is as corrosive to investing as it is to the real economy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Markets%20and%20inflation-444618b8912ee57a175f5e7747c70375.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>t is more</small> than two years since high inflation returned to the rich world, and hopes that it will quietly fade are themselves fading. True, prices are rising more slowly than in 2022, when the pace hit 9.1% in America, 10.6% in the euro area and 10.4% globally. But the view that this was just a passing lurch looks ever less plausible. Britain&#39;s rate has been stuck at 8.7% for two months. American “core” prices, which exclude volatile food and energy, are 5.3% higher than a year ago, a rate that has barely fallen for the past six months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If inflation continues to fester, the effects will quickly be felt in financial markets. Sustained price rises do not affect all asset classes equally, so a relative repricing will be required. But those one-off profits and losses will not be the only consequence. In the <a href="https://www.economist.com/economy">real economy</a> , inflation corrodes trust by continually and arbitrarily redistributing wealth. In the financial one this corrosive dynamic is less obvious, but just as real.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Central bankers remain adamant that they will return inflation to their targets, <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/04/04/the-fed-may-not-get-inflation-down-to-2-says-richard-clarida">typically 2%</a> . Many on Wall Street, though, are sceptical. Jean Boivin, who runs the research arm of BlackRock, the world&#39;s biggest asset manager, makes his argument bluntly. “Central banks can always bring inflation back to 2% if they really want to, but now it would require too big of a demand crush to bear.” He believes it will instead settle around 3-4%. Richard Clarida, vice-chair of the Federal Reserve from 2018 to 2022, has a similar view. “Mr Powell&#39;s Fed…will eventually get the inflation rate it wants,” he recently wrote for this newspaper. “But it is likely to be something more like &#39;two point something&#39; than &#39;two point zero&#39;.” Asked what “something” means, he replies: “It could be 2.8% or 2.9% when they start to consider rate cuts.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The likelihood of monetary guardians explicitly admitting that they will tolerate inflation above 2% is low. Every time Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is asked about the possibility, he vehemently denies it. Such a shift, especially with prices already rising much faster than 2%, would immediately damage the Fed&#39;s credibility: if the target can be ignored once, why not again?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the forces ranged against central bankers, which will push up prices by constraining supply and boosting demand, are fearsome. Demographic trends are shrinking workforces in much of the rich world, which may lead to shortages of labour. The fragility of global supply chains—exposed by the covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and fracturing Sino-American trade—has incentivised countries to replicate them locally. On the demand side, higher defence spending, the investment required to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and the costs of supporting ageing populations are all increasingly seen as essential.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Read more of our package on inflation: <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/22/investors-must-prepare-for-sustained-higher-inflation">Investors must prepare for sustained higher inflation</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/21/britains-inflation-pain-is-mostly-self-inflicted-and-getting-worse">Britain&#39;s inflation pain is mostly self-inflicted and getting worse<br></a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/22/annual-inflation-of-114-is-pushing-argentina-to-the-right">Annual inflation of 114% is pushing Argentina to the right</a></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Rate-setters could, through ultra-high interest rates, destroy enough demand in other parts of the economy to bring inflation down to 2%. But with so many structural factors pushing prices up, the sceptics argue, this would involve inflicting a politically unacceptable level of economic damage. And the longer inflation remains above target the more it raises expectations of future price rises, which can then become self-fulfilling. The world may thus have entered a regime in which central bankers pay lip-service to their inflation targets but shy away from measures severe enough to meet them. In other words, 4% may be the new 2%.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Another roll of the price </h2><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC540.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An extra percentage point or two in the annual rate of inflation may not seem much. Yet the impact on investment returns is huge. Buy a ten-year government bond when inflation is 2%, and the principal that is eventually returned will be worth 82% of its original value. When inflation is 4%, that figure falls to 68% (see chart 1). Over the longer run the gap yawns even wider. The principal on a 30-year bond will, when returned, be worth 55% of its original value if inflation averages 2% over that time. With 4% inflation, it will be worth 31%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the erosion of the value of both the principal and the fixed interest payments is not the only way that higher inflation affects investments in bonds. Rising prices fuel expectations that central banks will raise rates, which in turn pushes yields in the bond market up to match those expectations. Bond prices are an inverse function of yields: when yields rise, prices fall.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The scale of this second effect would depend on the duration of the bond. If markets think central banks are prepared to tolerate slightly elevated inflation, they will assume there will be fewer increases in rates in the immediate future, not more. This expectation would push short-term yields down and prices up. Meanwhile, in addition to the expectation of higher rates eventually, the volatility and uncertainty brought on by higher inflation would raise the “term premium” (financial jargon for the extra yield long-term lenders demand in return for taking on more risk). The overall effect would be that, during the initial adjustment, bond portfolios with shorter durations would do much better than those with more distant maturities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Could inflation-linked bonds offer more protection? In theory, yes, though in practice there are not enough of them to go around. Inflation-linked Treasuries, for example, comprise just 8% of the total. And even these can fare badly under inflation that is not merely high but also volatile and unpredictable, if this instability prompts large swings in real yields. Last year was a case in point. Real yields soared alongside inflation, hurting the value of inflation-linked bonds alongside the vanilla sort. An index of inflation-linked Treasuries compiled by Bloomberg, a data provider, fell by 12% over the course of the year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On the face of things, shares are ideally suited to weathering spells of high inflation. They derive their value from the underlying companies&#39; earnings, and if prices are rising across the economy then those earnings, in aggregate, ought to be rising as well. Suppose inflation stays elevated but stable and the economy is otherwise humming along, says Ed Cole of Man Group, an asset manager. Managers should be able to control costs and adjust prices in response. And in any case, “Equities are nominal beasts. If the numbers are going up, everyone pats themselves on the back.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the very long run, data compiled by Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, three academics, for Credit Suisse&#39;s <i>Global Investment Returns Yearbook</i> back this up. Globally, between 1900 and 2022, stocks beat inflation handily, posting an annualised real return of 5%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But there is a snag: the higher inflation rises, the less stable it tends to be. Take American consumer-price inflation going back to 1913, when official data begin. After years in which prices rose by between 0% and 5%, the average inflation rate for the subsequent 12 months was within 1.8 percentage points of the first one. (So a year of 2% inflation was, on average, followed by one of between 0.2% and 3.8%.) When prices rose by between 5% and 10%, the average change for the subsequent year jumped to 3.8 percentage points. Inflation of 4% would leave little room for error.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Once bitten, price shy</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such volatility is much harder for businesses to handle. Mr Cole points to industries with high fixed costs, such as <small>IT</small> outsourcing, commercial services and construction, in which firms can do little to trim wage bills while remaining in business. If those costs rise in line with inflation, but revenues are slower to adjust, volatile inflation can generate big swings in margins and earnings.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Moreover, during individual periods of high inflation, the historical record is less comforting for shareholders. Between 1900 and 2022, in years in which inflation rose above around 7.5%, the average real return on equities flipped from positive to negative. Even when inflation was lower than this, it tended to reduce the real returns from shares. In other words, though stocks tend to outpace inflation in the long term, in the short term they do not offer a true hedge against it. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_BBC509.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Real assets will fare much better if inflation remains high (see chart 2). Property and infrastructure generate income streams, in the form of rents and usage charges, that can often be raised in line with inflation or may even be contractually linked to it. As the supply of such assets is constrained, their real prices are also likely to rise as investors seek out assets that carry some protection against inflation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is also true of commodities. Measured by returns on commodity futures (financial contracts that give investors exposure to commodities without the hassle and expense of owning actual iron ore or cattle), this class of assets has historically done even better in real terms than stocks. In years of above-average inflation, the excess real return of a diversified portfolio of commodity futures over cash has averaged 11.4%. The asset class even tends to do well when high inflation combines with low or negative growth, with excess returns averaging 10% in such “stagflationary” years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trouble with all such physical assets is the difficulty of investing in them. The total value of all commodity futures is less than $500bn—barely 1% of that of America&#39;s stockmarkets. Should investors pile into them en masse, they would push prices up enough to render the exercise futile. Infrastructure, meanwhile, is dominated by private investment managers, who tend to focus on selling to big institutional investors, such as pension funds and university endowments. Individuals, in contrast, struggle to buy such assets despite their appeal in a high-inflation world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other vendors poised to capitalise on churn in the financial markets are active asset-managers. They have had a miserable time during the years of easy money that followed the financial crisis of 2007-09. Data compiled by Strategas Securities, a brokerage and research firm, show that in each year from 2010 to 2021, the majority of active managers who measure their performance against the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 share index failed to beat it. Such underperformance is not limited to America. <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> Global, another research firm, reckons that in the ten years to 2022, 90% of European active managers produced worse returns than the broader market. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Till Lauer</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In part this is down to arithmetic. Overall market performance is the average of each investor&#39;s, which makes beating the index a zero-sum affair. On top of this, active managers charge fees (often 1-2% or more a year), which brings their average performance down—so in aggregate, they are likely to underperform. Even accounting for this, though, the years of rock-bottom interest rates and relentlessly buoyant markets were hard on stockpickers. “If everything goes up together, it doesn&#39;t matter how much skill you&#39;ve got,” says Luke Ellis, Man Group&#39;s boss.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> By contrast, the return of high inflation and the volatility it brings allow skilled investors to outperform. In particular “dispersion”, or big differences in performance among different assets, offers active managers the chance to prove their worth. “Lots of people having a tough time doesn&#39;t mean a bad opportunity set,” says Mr Ellis.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet even Mr Ellis does not think that “you&#39;ll suddenly see 70% of active managers outperforming the index”. Many will be wrong-footed by macroeconomic conditions that they have never had to grapple with before. More insidiously, their clients will only gradually adjust to the wealth-destroying effects of inflation. Jeremy Grantham, a veteran fund-manager, recently wrote of his surprise that money-managers have not yet started to routinely adjust share-performance charts for inflation, as was routine in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Do so, and the numbers look much worse. Nominally, the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 index fell by 19% in 2022, but it would need to rise by more than 30% over the course of this year to recoup its losses in real terms. And as investors see chunks of their savings being eaten away by inflation, paying another couple of percentage points to their fund-managers will become much harder to stomach. Just as, in the real economy, inflation prompts consumers to suspect firms of profiteering, in the financial one it will pit both retail and institutional investors against those managing their money.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Sugar and price</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A surprising winner from sustained high inflation, argues Martin Jaugietis of BlackRock, might be defined-benefit pension schemes, which in America hold assets worth some $17trn. Such schemes invest regular payments from workers and their employers in return for the promise of a set income in retirement (usually a fixed percentage of the worker&#39;s final salary). The financial health is determined by their “funding ratio”, or the value of their assets relative to the present value of the future payments they must make to retirees. As interest rates rise, this present value shrinks, since schemes can buy higher-yielding bonds, locking in cash flows that will help pay future liabilities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Provided their assets do not fall too much, the higher nominal interest rates brought on by persistent inflation would therefore be a fillip for defined-benefit schemes. This is especially true for American ones, says Mr Jaugietis, since they do not typically raise payouts to pensioners in line with inflation. Sure enough, in 2022 the funding ratios of American schemes improved markedly as inflation and interest rates rose, despite plunging asset prices. Even in Britain, where retirement payouts tend to be linked more closely to inflation, funding ratios shot up.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet, as in the real economy, each winner from inflation creates a loser. In this case, the workers who have contributed to defined-benefit schemes that are not inflation-linked will lose out. After ten years of 4% inflation, someone who expected to retire with an income of $50,000 a year would see the purchasing power of that income fall by around a third. In effect the boon for defined-benefit schemes would be paid for by an arbitrary reduction in their members&#39; wealth. Many pensioners would be in the same position as workers who struggle to secure pay rises that keep pace with inflation, and just as aggrieved.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final category of participants in financial markets that might welcome higher inflation is governments. The world over, their debt burdens have ballooned—first in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-09 and then during the covid-19 pandemic, on which the rich world spent 10% of its <small>GDP</small> . Europe&#39;s energy crisis has triggered yet more spending. Six of the <small>G</small> 7 group of large, developed economies have gross government-debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratios above 100%; only Germany&#39;s is below.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The only ways to chip away at these vast piles of debt other than inflation are turbocharged growth, tax rises or spending cuts. The first is unlikely; the others are politically painful. So governments may quietly rejoice as the real value of their debt is inflated away.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet in doing so, they risk falling foul of two groups. One is voters, whose savings lose purchasing power at the same time. The more immediate danger comes from the bond market. Investors in sovereign debt will be acutely aware that inflation is eating into their returns. Expect them to rake through governments&#39; fiscal statements with ever finer-toothed combs for signs that worse is to come.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Emerging-market countries are used to this treatment, and to the wild swings in borrowing costs and exchange rates it can bring. But for the rich world the adjustment would be painful. Britain&#39;s flirtation with disaster in September, when an irresponsibly inflationary budget sent gilt yields soaring and the pound through the floorboards, may offer a taste of things to come. Governments that lose the trust of lenders are in for a rough ride.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The idea that central banks might quietly allow inflation to fester, taking a chunk of society&#39;s stability and trust with it, may seem speculative. But look back at the past century and you will struggle to find an instance of inflation rising as far as it did in 2022, then immediately coming back under control. The trade-offs required to get it there look nightmarish. The generation of investors that is learning for the first time how to deal with elevated inflation may have plenty of time to study it. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8k3epir6ho28rqm9q8euf2t5f9ibhnh7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/21/inflation-is-as-corrosive-to-investing-as-it-is-to-the-real-economy</item></channel></rss>
