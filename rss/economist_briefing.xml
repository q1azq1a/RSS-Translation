class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>像</span><small>每支</small>现代军队一样， <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/netanyahu-wages-war-and-fights-for-his-own-survival">以色列将军们</a>在过去一年半的时间里一直在密切关注乌克兰的战斗并做记录。 10 月 7 日以色列社区发生<a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">恐怖袭击</a>，导致 1,400 多人被杀，现在以色列国防军 ( <small>IDF</small> ) 的坦克营已准备好进入加沙，这些教训尤其重要。尽管坦克越来越容易受到无人机、徘徊弹药和从顶部攻击的现代反坦克导弹的攻击，但坦克仍然是战场上唯一集机动性、防护性和强大火力于一体的平台。他们将成为以色列地面入侵加沙的先锋队，为身后的步兵部队扫清道路。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “我们看到了俄罗斯人如何在乌克兰作战以及他们所犯的错误，”<small>以色列国防军</small>装甲部队指挥官希沙姆·易卜拉欣准将说，他的职责是让以色列坦克及其人员做好战争准备。 “他们在那里以单军方式作战，而不是使用联合兵种战术，”他解释道。换句话说，俄罗斯的装甲团作为独立的坦克部队作战，而不是与步兵、作战工程和炮兵部队组成一体化编队，并且没有与情报和空中力量的协调。在某些情况下，坦克纵队在没有任何支援的情况下沿着道路排成一列，让乌克兰人将其击落。俄罗斯坦克乘员训练不足，几乎没有表现出遵循自己的条令的迹象。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列装甲部队的形状与以前不同，”易卜拉欣将军说。 “多年来，我们一直在各个级别进行联合训练。我们不再认为坦克能够做所有事情。战场已变；这里更加拥挤和拥挤。这些大平台面临很多挑战，我希望步兵和工兵能够弥补我的劣势。我们参加所有课程和演习的士兵现在已经习惯了在联合兵种环境中作战。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中许多想法最初是从以色列50年前赎罪日战争期间的大规模坦克战中学到的。在那场冲突中，<small>以色列国防军</small>的装甲营（有时单独行动）因苏联提供的埃及当时新颖的赛格反坦克导弹以及敌方坦克而遭受重大损失。以色列国防军迅速适应，其战术在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代被美国陆军广泛研究和采用。如今，以色列坦克兵被广泛认为是世界上训练有素、准备最充分的坦克兵之一。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但<small>以色列国防军</small>并不是唯一向乌克兰学习的国家。在哈马斯袭击以色列边境之初，袭击者使用携带大型手榴弹的无人机摧毁了观察哨。至少在一个案例中，有这样的手榴弹击中以色列梅卡瓦坦克的镜头。乌克兰人也曾对俄罗斯坦克使用过类似的战术。易卜拉欣将军坚称，虽然边境上的一些坦克被击中“两三次”，但没有一辆被摧毁，所有坦克很快就会恢复使用。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，在一些集结区域，人们看到梅卡瓦坦克配备了“顶笼”，即固定在炮塔（车辆最暴露的部分）上方的板条金属屏障，以阻止来自上方的此类攻击。俄罗斯去年使用这种简易装置引起了嘲笑，但以色列的采用表明装甲专业人士越来越严肃地对待无人机的威胁。<small>以色列国防军</small>常规装甲旅使用的梅卡瓦坦克的更先进版本（与预备役人员所使用的梅卡瓦坦克不同）配备了<small>TROPHY</small> ，这是一种极其先进的以色列设计的“主动防护系统”系统，事实证明，它可以有效地击败来袭的敌方坦克。带有向外爆炸的爆炸板的反坦克导弹。然而，并非所有坦克单位都配备该系统。以色列储存库中的每辆坦克，包括早期版本的梅卡瓦坦克，现在都在部署中，这表明即将开展的大规模行动以及保卫以色列与黎巴嫩北部边境的必要性。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯袭击开始后两小时内，易卜拉欣将军就通知<small>以色列国防军</small>所有装甲旅指挥官，他们应该开始动员，甚至在军队高层发出正式命令之前。现在，自 1982 年以色列入侵黎巴嫩以来，四十多年来第一次，整个装甲部队都被征召入伍。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是一支庞大的部队，尽管以色列国防军热衷于保护其作战安全，并未透露具体数字，但据了解其中包括 1000 多辆主战坦克。其中许多并不是为了对加沙进行地面进攻，而是部署在以色列北部，以防与伊朗支持的黎巴嫩运动真主党爆发战争，真主党每天都用火箭弹和迫击炮弹挑衅以色列的回应自 10 月 7 日哈马斯袭击以来的炮击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果第二条战线确实爆发，以色列坦克兵将进行两种类型的战争。虽然哈马斯和真主党在之前与以色列坦克的交锋中都使用了类似的战术和武器——小型伏击队发射俄罗斯制造（和伊朗提供）的反坦克导弹——但地形将产生很大的不同。在加利利和黎巴嫩南部的丘陵林地地区面对真主党的前景与在加沙城建筑密集的城市地区的战斗截然不同，在加沙城，袭击可能来自近距离。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">多年来，军事专家们一致认为，在狭窄的城市街道上驾驶笨重的坦克作战是一种负担。但更明智的观点是，如果使用得当，并与其他地面部队配合，在全副武装的对手保卫的城市环境中作战时，没有什么可以取代坦克的火力和突破能力。美国指挥官表示，坦克在伊拉克战争的关键城市战斗中发挥着至关重要的作用，包括轻型装甲车无法胜任的情况。在巴格达充满敌意的郊区萨德尔城，美国坦克和其他装甲车组成了一项研究所称的“流动装甲箱”，它们可以缓慢、稳定和安全地移动，而不会使徒步部队面临危险。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与许多其他坦克作战人员相比，以色列坦克军至少有两个优势。一是哈马斯不被认为拥有“顶部攻击”反坦克导弹，如供应给乌克兰的美国“标枪”和英瑞<small>“NLAW”</small>反坦克导弹，这些导弹可以攻击坦克装甲最薄弱的部分——车体顶部。另一个原因是，以色列坦克的设计目的是在该国边境作战，而不是远离家乡，并提供高水平的保护。这使得它们相对笨重，移动性可能较差，但能够承受严重的撞击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">除了“主动”防护之外，更先进的以色列坦克和步兵战车还拥有先进的通信系统。这些设备将它们连接到一个网络，该网络在坦克的屏幕上为部队提供服务，所有信息都是由其他以色列平台上的传感器收集的，包括盘旋在头顶上的无人机的镜头。 “今天的坦克可以利用从其他来源收集的信息向目标开火，并自行收集信息，这些信息将被其他火源使用，”易卜拉欣将军说。这克服了城市战的传统问题：视线短，其中一个坦克排可能不知道下一个街区周围发生了什么。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与世界各地的坦克将军一样，他非常不同意那些根据俄罗斯的失败推断坦克时代已经结束的人，并引用了 10 月 7 日的事件作为证据。当数千名武装分子沿着边境围栏通过 29 个突破口冲入以色列时，他认为，在某些时候，当天早上驻扎在边境的少量坦克“是唯一剩下的保护层，他们使用了所有武器” 、大炮、机枪，然后跑过去，试图阻止周围数百名试图进入社区的恐怖分子。”由于边境上的大部分观察和摄像头都被摧毁，坦克上往往携带着唯一仍在运行以传递重要信息的监视系统。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最终，<small>以色列国防军</small>那天早上的失败是情报评估和缺乏能够快速到达边境的部队的原因之一。但易卜拉欣将军坚称，在抵达基布兹的少数坦克中，“它们是恢复对这些社区的控制和结束流血事件的关键因素。没有什么能像坦克那样做到这一点。” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

class="article__body-text">以色列情报部门未能预见到这次袭击的情况堪比 1973 年赎罪日战争的开始，当时埃及和叙利亚在犹太教最重要的节日同时发动了突然袭击。然而，平民丧生的人数却截然不同。 1973 年，那些入侵军队寻求的是夺取领土，而不是屠杀非战斗人员。在为期三周的战争中死亡的 2,656 名以色列人都是士兵。相比之下，本周哈马斯受害者中只有约 13% 是现役军人。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBD002.jpg"

日至 9 日期间发射了约 4,500 枚爆炸性射弹——大约相当于 2014 年整个两个月战争期间的发射量——引发的大火从太空中都可见。 <small>NASA</small>卫星系统<small>FIRMS</small>于 10 月 7 日在以色列发现的火灾数量是过去十年中第二高的，仅次于 2020 年的一系列野火。大多数火灾集中在加沙边境附近，但有些甚至到达了特拉维夫南郊。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg"

class="article__body-text">这次袭击使所有其他针对以色列平民的大规模谋杀事件相形见绌。以色列独立战争期间阿拉伯人犯下的最血腥暴行是 1948 年 5 月在以色列定居点 Kfar Etzion 发生的大屠杀，造成 127 人死亡。巴勒斯坦恐怖分子此前最致命的一次袭击是2002年在内坦亚市一家酒店的逾越节家宴上引爆的炸弹，造成30人死亡。10月7日的死亡人数已经超过了第二次起义期间以色列人死亡的总人数。巴勒斯坦起义从2000年持续到2005年。作为以色列人口的一部分，这相当于9月11日12日的袭击——每日死亡率只有全面战争、种族灭绝或自然灾害才能超过。</p><p class="article__body-text">最尖锐的历史比较是在以色列建国之前。并非所有哈马斯的受害者都是以色列人，也并非所有以色列死者都是犹太人。但根据对这次和之前袭击中被杀者的种族构成的合理假设，10 月 7 日之前最后一次在一天内杀害这么多犹太人是在大屠杀期间。 <span>■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>图表来源：

e190yofl0"><small>最初的几个</small><span>小时</span>很混乱。以色列南部靠近加沙边境的居民被火箭弹和迫击炮弹的声音吵醒。他们冲向避难所——在这个国家的这个地区，这是一个残酷的例行公事，但仍然是例行公事。几分钟后，他们听到枪声越来越近，并用阿拉伯语喊叫。这根本不是例行公事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他们家外的难以想象的场景也开始在社交媒体上流传：巴勒斯坦武装分子坐在一辆皮卡车的床上，驶过以色列城镇，向路人开枪；公共汽车站有一堆尸体，军事哨所也有一堆尸体。早上的时间持续得很长，但没有任何救援到来。疯狂的以色列人在他们的安全室里打电话给电视新闻节目，并小声询问他们的军队在哪里。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后，同样令人震惊的是关于绑架的报道。一位母亲说，她的两个儿子（其中一个只有 12 岁）被绑架并拖过边境。一段视频显示，一名老妇人开着高尔夫球车在加沙街道上游行，她僵硬的笑容掩盖了她的震惊，一名武装男子坐在她身后。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">死亡人数不断上升。近一周后，当局仍在清点尸体。在 Be&#39;eri 这个约有 1000 人的小基布兹，武装分子挨家挨户屠杀了大约 10% 的人口。在以北 8 公里的卡法阿扎 (Kfar Azza)，死亡人数可能更多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于以色列人来说，10 月 7 日是一个史无前例的日子。在这个面积只有 1000 万的国家里，有超过 1,300 人被杀。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history">死亡人数</a>超过了过去20年以色列和巴勒斯坦之间所有暴力事件中丧生的以色列人人数。另有 3,300 人受伤。以色列人曾认为控制加沙的巴勒斯坦伊斯兰组织哈马斯是一个可以控制的威胁。现在它发动了该国历史上最致命的恐怖袭击。中东最强大的军队失去了对自己城镇的控制，需要几天时间才能重新控制。当局已找到至少 1,500 名巴勒斯坦武装分子的尸体，超过一个营的枪手数量，他们设法冲过据称防守严密的边界。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着震惊逐渐变成愤怒，迫在眉睫的问题是以色列将如何应对。它已经开始了报复性空袭，造成 1,200 多名巴勒斯坦人死亡，其中许多是平民，并使超过 30 万人流离失所。以色列不会就此止步，尽管其军事选择毫无吸引力。未来几周，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人必将遭受更多苦难。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但 10 月 7 日的后果将更为广泛。这场大屠杀不仅可能重塑以色列对巴勒斯坦人的态度，也可能重塑其国内政治。它<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause">威胁到哈马斯对加沙权力的控制</a>；它还可能引发地区战争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">袭击以一连串火箭弹开始：几个小时内就发射了 2,200 枚火箭弹。这已经足够令人震惊了：哈马斯在 2014 年对以色列的战争中花了近一个月的时间才发射了这么多子弹。但以色列人很快发现这些发射是为更大规模的行动做掩护。推土机冲破了边境围栏，数百名武装分子涌了过去。其他人乘坐滑翔伞飞越它，或者乘坐小艇绕它航行。他们呈扇形散布到以色列城镇并开始杀戮。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列花了几个小时才组织防御。一些部队不得不从北部边境赶往南方。他们一抵达，就在集结地苦苦挣扎，而指挥官则试图制定作战计划。几位退役将军亲自动手，穿上旧军装，驱车前往被围困的村庄，进行临时反击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">甚至在收复自己的领土之前，以色列就开始对加沙进行空袭。总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡宣布以色列处于战争状态，他的政府开始为可能的地面进攻做准备。军队已动员了 36 万名预备役军人，并花了几天时间将坦克和其他装备运送到加沙边境。国防部长约夫·加兰特承诺全面包围加沙。 “没有电，没有食物，没有水，没有燃料，一切都关闭了。” 10 月 11 日，其唯一的发电厂燃料耗尽并关闭。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃雷兹是以色列和加沙之间的唯一过境点，已无限期关闭。以色列要求加沙平民通过与埃及接壤的拉法过境点逃离，但一再轰炸该过境点。无论如何，埃及严格限制允许过境的人数。即使在和平时期，巴勒斯坦人也很难离开加沙。现在这是不可能的了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当以色列军队准备在加沙作战时，必须密切关注其北部边境。 10 月 8 日，黎巴嫩的什叶派激进组织和政党真主党炮击了有争议的一小片领土沙巴阿农场。根据不成文的交战规则，沙巴发生的事情就留在沙巴：真主党可以表达对巴勒斯坦人的支持，但也可以向以色列表明，它不希望发生更广泛的冲突。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而一天后，以色列军队击毙了一群从黎巴嫩越境的枪手。三名真主党武装分子随后在以色列的报复性轰炸中被打死，导致该组织向以色列军队哨所发射火箭弹。双方可能都不想爆发战争，但升级并不总是符合逻辑。黎巴嫩民众纷纷囤积食物和燃料。以色列已撤离北部边境附近的城镇。哈马斯大声呼吁其他国家加入对以色列的攻击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列军队可能需要时间来准备，但对加沙地带的地面进攻似乎几乎是肯定的。以色列军队从 1967 年到 2005 年占领加沙，随后撤军，迫使约 8,000 名犹太定居者随之撤退。此后，以色列基本上封锁了该领土的空中、陆地和海上，同时允许一些巴勒斯坦人在以色列工作，并允许非威胁性的货物进入。 （埃及几乎也有同样的限制。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列最近一次入侵加沙是在 2014 年，目的是摧毁哈马斯在边界围栏下挖掘的用于渗透以色列的隧道。以色列军队并没有渗透到该地区很远的地方，该地区只有约10公里宽、40公里长，但却居住着200万人口。即便如此，这次行动还是表明地面攻击可能会出错。哈马斯部队袭击了拉法附近的以色列巡逻队，并俘获了一名军官哈达尔·戈尔丁。以色列随后连续几天炮击拉法，造成数十名巴勒斯坦人死亡。戈尔丁后来被宣布死亡。以色列人将此事件称为“黑色星期五”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即将到来的攻击将会更大。以色列可能部署两个装甲师和一个轻型空降师，每个师下辖五个旅。其中一些部队正在等待坦克和其他装备到达加沙周围的集结地。其他人在过去几天的战斗中遭受了损失。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">假设以色列领导人确实下令大规模入侵，一两个装备坦克的装甲旅可能会试图通过代尔巴拉附近最窄处（6公里）向西推进，将地带一分为二。其他两三个旅规模的部队（每个几千人）可能会集中在北部，包括加沙城周围，另外一两个部队则集中在南部的汗尤尼斯或拉法。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t

e190yofl0">他们的目标可能是针对哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战组织（一个独立的激进组织），重点关注空袭范围之外的领导人和基础设施。哈马斯声称其在加沙拥有数百公里的隧道。找到他们的入口并投放炸药将是首要任务。最大的挑战将是城市战，这是一项众所周知的艰巨任务。加沙的人口比伦敦或东京更稠密，为武装分子提供了很多藏身之处，而平民却没有多少地方可以避难。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯可能指望进行相对谨慎的袭击。该组织认为，以色列无法承受地面入侵造成的巨大伤亡。 “我们知道他们是胆小鬼，”驻卡塔尔的哈马斯高级官员穆萨·阿布·马尔祖克说。 “我们知道他们无法在地面上作战。”它还预计加沙地带100多名以色列和外国人质的存在将限制以色列军队。哈马斯希望用这些囚犯来交换以色列监狱中关押的 5,200 名巴勒斯坦人中的许多人（如果不是全部的话）。它还威胁说，每次以色列“在没有事先警告的情况下”轰炸加沙平民住宅时，就会杀死一名平民。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，最近几天灾难性的死亡人数可能会改变以色列的盘算。华盛顿智库布鲁金斯学会的纳坦·萨克斯表示：“以色列承担成本的意愿——而且是确切的——成本比过去高得多。”至于人质，许多仍在埋葬亲人的以色列人表示，他们没有心情与杀害他们的组织讨价还价。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">忽视后果自负</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，以色列不得不重新审视许多长期持有的假设，最引人注目的是认为加沙可以安全地任其恶化的信念。 2007年哈马斯从巴勒斯坦<small>临时</small>政府手中夺取了对加沙的控制权后，以色列和埃及大幅收紧了边境限制，窒息了加沙的经济。尽管此后暴力事件屡屡发生，但以色列官员开始认为哈马斯变得更加务实。 “最重要的是，他们希望保持对加沙的控制，”一名军官去年表示。 “要做到这一点，他们需要改善经济。”人们的想法是，如果以色列允许阿拉伯政府为加沙的基本社会服务提供资金，并为加沙人在以色列工作发放更多许可证，那么该领土将保持静止状态。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这种观点不仅完全错误，而且以色列自诩的安全部门也未能发现一场精心策划的袭击正在酝酿之中。加沙的每一个电话都通过以色列网络进行，这简化了窃听。无人机经常飞越该地带。以色列在该领土上也有庞大的线人网络，但都无济于事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">毫无疑问，部分问题在于概念上的失败：认为哈马斯已经对大规模冲突失去了兴趣。事实上，甚至一些哈马斯领导人似乎也感到惊讶。阿布·马尔祖克表示，他和卡塔尔其他高级领导人事先并未获悉此次袭击事件。自2017年叶海亚·辛瓦尔成为加沙哈马斯领导人以来，少数主要在加沙的强硬派巩固了权力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个错误是本雅明·内塔尼亚胡(Binyamin Netanyahu)对巴勒斯坦人采取的分而治之的政策，内塔尼亚胡在过去14年中有12年担任以色列总理。长期以来，他一直试图削弱<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>，该机构仍然管理着约旦河西岸的部分地区。自 2014 年半心半意的谈判破裂以来，他一直拒绝恢复和平谈判。他冻结了<small>以色列</small>代表巴勒斯坦权力机构征收的税收收入的转移。与此同时，他将哈马斯视为加沙的合法势力。例如，2011 年，他批准了一项协议，用 1,027 名巴勒斯坦囚犯交换武装分子 2006 年抓获的以色列士兵吉拉德·沙利特 (Gilad Shalit)。这次交换自然提高了哈马斯在巴勒斯坦人中的地位。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于内塔尼亚胡先生来说，逻辑很清楚。巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>致力于与以色列谈判两国解决方案，这令总理的右翼支持者感到厌恶。削弱<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>并支持其激进竞争对手将有助于他声称以色列没有“和平伙伴”。但巴勒斯坦人却得到了一个不同的、但也是可以预见的教训：从以色列获得让步的唯一方法是通过武力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，哈马斯现在可能做得有些过头了。一些观察家认为，它没想到攻击会如此成功，并且不确定如何进行。它可能希望吓唬以色列让步，但实际上却让以色列做好了战争的准备。以色列军队10月10日告诉外国国防武官，其目标是“消灭”哈马斯的领导层。据参加会议的人士透露，军方的最终目标是摧毁哈马斯的能力，无论需要多长时间。然而，说起来容易做起来难，正如美国在阿富汗长期战争中或以色列在占领黎巴嫩南部 18 年期间所学到的那样。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="以色列-加沙边境附近，一名以色列士兵在一辆装甲运兵车旁祈祷。" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw"

e190yofl0">即使以色列能够铲除哈马斯，也没有人知道什么会取代它。巴勒斯坦权力<small>机构</small>太弱，无法在加沙维护权威；它甚至还不足以控制西岸，部分地区已经陷入无政府状态。大多数巴勒斯坦人和大多数加沙人都希望解散它。 87岁的总统马哈茂德·阿巴斯已经近20年没有踏足加沙了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">有人闲谈派遣阿拉伯维和人员保卫加沙，但很少有阿拉伯政权愿意这样做。 1949年至1967年埃及占领加沙；双方都对那段时光有着痛苦的回忆。沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋等海湾国家无意统治超过200万巴勒斯坦人。大多数以色列人也不希望重新占领该领土。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，入侵然后离开并不能改变现状。以色列人离开后，哈马斯的领导人和大部分武装人员可能会从他们的掩体中出来并恢复对巴勒斯坦领土的控制。这是一个令人难以接受的结果，但却是最有可能的结果。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于任何以色列政府来说，制定明确的前进道路都是困难的，尤其是现任政府。今年是政治严重动荡的一年。经过一年多的反对后，内塔尼亚胡在 11 月份的提前选举中赢得了多个席位。他领导的政府完全由右翼和宗教政党组成。他的国家安全部长伊塔马尔·本-格维尔因极端民族主义观点而被禁止在以色列军队服役。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">此后，内塔尼亚胡推行了一个分裂的议程，其中包括限制最高法院推翻政府政策的权力，以及赋予政客在法官任命方面更多的发言权。批评者称这是一场司法“政变”，并于今年每周六举行大规模抗议活动，直到 10 月 7 日被暂停。陆军预备役军人威胁要抵制他们的义务兵役（这一策略也已被搁置）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乐观者希望本月的大屠杀将有助于使以色列政治重新回到中间位置。纳夫塔利·贝内特 (Naftali Bennett) 的顾问希姆里特·梅厄 (Shimrit Meir) 写道：“在最黑暗的日子过后，如果能够达成和解，那就是以色列恢复理智、结束政治危机并组建联合政府。”贝内特于 2021 年接替内塔尼亚胡出任总理。短暂担任总理。内塔尼亚胡先生在 10 月 9 日的黄金时段讲话中敦促中间派政党“无条件”加入他的政府。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 10月11日，经过几天的谈判，领导第二大中间派政党民族团结党的前陆军参谋长本尼·甘茨同意加入“紧急政府”。但最大反对党 Yesh Atid 的领导人 Yair Lapid 迄今拒绝参加。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">团结在怀疑之中</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于两党来说，困境在于加入一个他们的支持者在过去一年里一直抗议的政府。内塔尼亚胡承诺不会推行任何与战争无关的立法，但拒绝抛弃他最极端的联盟伙伴。对于一位一如既往地关心自己政治生存的首相来说，这是有道理的。只要战斗持续，联合政府就会持续下去。内塔尼亚胡先生不想疏远他随后需要组建另一个右翼联盟的政党。甘茨先生无论如何都捏着鼻子加入，向缺乏军事专业知识的政府提供军事专业知识。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管这将暂时稳定政府，但最近几天发生的事件可能会结束内塔尼亚胡先生漫长且充满卷土重来的职业生涯。他花了一年的时间进行一场不必要的政治斗争，而不是关注真正的威胁——而在此之前的许多年，他一直在努力让巴勒斯坦成为一个无法解决的问题。安全是他的口号，十多年来他一直负责监督以色列武装部队和情报部门，只曾短暂中断过一段时间。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯则选择了凶残的虚无主义。与加沙领导人交谈就像进入了一个幻想世界，在那里加沙得到了“解放”，尽管其居民却被困在 365 平方公里的牢房里，陷入贫困。对以色列的胜利即将到来，在那之前，加沙人将欣然忍受他们的命运。自大屠杀发生以来，该组织明确表示，除了希望引发对以色列更广泛的攻击之外，除了持续暴力外，它没有任何计划。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">简而言之，正在发生的灾难似乎很可能暴露出双方思维的贫乏。唉，最近几天发生的令人震惊的流​​血事件，以及未来可能发生的更多恐怖事件，也将使采取更具建设性的方法来解决冲突变得更加困难。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“噢，</span><small>我们所有阿拉伯和伊斯兰国家的人民</small>，”哈马斯军事部门领导人穆罕默德·戴伊夫在该组织袭击以色列南部之际发布的一份录音声明中吟诵道。 “……任何有枪的人都应该把它拿出来的一天已经到来。现在是时候了。如果你没有枪，请拿起你的菜刀、斧头、斧头、燃烧瓶、卡车、推土机或汽车。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些人响应了他的号召。在埃及第二大城市亚历山大，一名警察枪杀了两名以色列游客和他们的导游。在以色列与黎巴嫩紧张的边境地区，发生了零星的战斗。从巴林到摩洛哥，哈马斯的支持者纷纷走上街头。在叙利亚首都大马士革，巴勒斯坦国旗照亮了歌剧院。在黎巴嫩的巴勒斯坦难民营中，游客们报告了狂欢节的气氛。在阿拉伯世界颇受欢迎的半岛电视台的所在地卡塔尔，流亡的哈马斯领导人跪倒在办公室地板上致谢，该电视台一直以毫不掩饰的钦佩之情报道暴行。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但哈马斯号召援助的阿拉伯和穆斯林军团还没有动静，至少现在还没有。一些阿拉伯政府已经或正在考虑与以色列正式实现和平。大多数其他人热衷于将敌意限制在纯粹的言辞层面。他们的秘密警察通常会压制任何抗议活动，担心示威者也可能反对他们自己的政府。此外，自2011年“阿拉伯之春”令人兴奋的抗议活动演变成混乱、分裂、暴力和镇压之后，阿拉伯“街道”仍处于疲惫不堪的状态。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，暴力和战争蔓延到其他战线，特别是黎巴嫩的危险依然严峻。以色列预计在加沙开始的地面行动可能是一个触发因素。一方面，美国正在认真对待这一威胁。它已在以色列附近海域部署了一艘航空母舰和其他军舰。中东的空军中队正在得到加强。紧急武器正在运往以色列。其目的既是为了表达对以色列的声援，也是为了阻止伊朗及其代理人参与其中。乔·拜登总统 10 月 10 日表示：“对于任何国家、任何组织、任何想利用这种情况的人，我都有一句话。” “不。不。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由宿敌伊朗及其在伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚和也门的代理人组成的所谓以色列“抵抗轴心”的成员正在为哈马斯的“胜利行动”欢呼，并暗示他们可能会加入战斗。但目前还没有人这样做。真主党是黎巴嫩的什叶派民兵兼政党，可以说是以色列边境上最强大的敌人，它知道它在 2006 年发起的支持哈马斯的战争对黎巴嫩造成了巨大的破坏。到目前为止，它还没有再次加入。由于经济崩溃，黎巴嫩无力应对另一场灾难。即使像真主党这样的国中之国也可能会犹豫是否要造成进一步的损害。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊朗也保持着干燥状态。它向真主党提供的12万至15万枚导弹和火箭可能主要是为了阻止以色列轰炸伊朗核设施。尽管伊朗发表了各种反以色列言论，但它从未为巴勒斯坦人发动过战争。加沙的一名哈马斯官员表示：“我们知道我们是（伊朗）的工具。”他指出，哈马斯和伊朗在逊尼派和什叶派穆斯林之间的宗派分歧上处于对立面。 “归根结底，我们只有<i>zawaj muta</i> ，一段临时婚姻。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，随着加沙战斗的加剧，轴心国采取更多行动的压力可能会增加。四个月前，真主党在黎巴嫩南部进行了一场大肆宣传的军事演习，练习占领以色列城镇。黎巴嫩安全专家希拉尔·卡尚表示，哈马斯现在这样做“让他们面临压力”。目前，跨境袭击的目的似乎是警告，而不是战争的开始。哈马斯发动袭击的第二天，真主党炮击了以色列在沙巴阿农场的阵地，这是一个有争议的边境地区，那里的战斗往往是自给自足的。其他地方也发生了更严重的交火，包括导弹和炮火。真主党报告称，其三名战士已被打死。以色列军队表示，还击毙了至少两名渗透者。问题是这些小冲突是否会升级为更大的事件。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">亚伯拉罕焦躁不安的孩子们</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊朗已经从哈马斯的屠杀中获益。它最大的担忧是其海湾邻国与以色列的和解。根据《亚伯拉罕协议》，以色列近年来与包括巴林和阿拉伯联合酋长国在内的几个阿拉伯国家实现了关系正常化。下一个获奖者是沙特阿拉伯，它是世界上最大的石油出口国，也是伊斯兰教两个圣地的所在地。上个月，沙特王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼表示，与以色列的协议即将达成：“我们每天都在更接近。”以色列部长已开始公开访问沙特阿拉伯。就在哈马斯袭击前几天，伊朗最高领导人阿亚图拉阿里哈梅内伊警告说，与以色列建立关系的国家正在将自己置于“危险之中”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">考虑到沙特阿拉伯国内民众的敌意，以及王子要求与美国签订正式防御条约和浓缩铀手段等要求，以色列和沙特阿拉伯之间的协议永远不会轻易达成。如果以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡向巴勒斯坦人做出沙特希望的让步，他也将面临失去极右翼联盟盟友的风险。尽管如此，破坏这笔交易可能是哈马斯发动袭击的主要目标之一。 </p><div

e190yofl0">如果是这样，它可能已经成功了，至少在一段时间内是这样。华盛顿智库卡内基国际和平基金会的亚伦·大卫·米勒表示，美国促成以色列与沙特达成协议的能力“已降至零”。鉴于流血事件，任何以色列领导人都不会向巴勒斯坦人做出让步。沙特阿拉伯也将受到类似的限制，无论如何，穆罕默德亲王可能不愿意仓促与可能很快失去权力的美国和以色列领导人达成协议。由于“持续占领”，沙特外交部实际上将暴力归咎于以色列。 10 月 11 日，穆罕默德王子和伊朗总统易卜拉欣·莱西通了电话——这是他们第一次这样做。伊朗表示，他们讨论了“结束针对巴勒斯坦的战争罪行的必要性”；沙特方面表示，王子正试图“阻止局势持续升级”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管沙特阿拉伯对与以色列建立关系犹豫不决，但欧盟却因支持巴勒斯坦权力机构而陷入困境。巴勒斯坦权力机构管理着巴勒斯坦人控制的西岸部分地区，由巴勒斯坦竞争对手法塔赫领导。派别属于哈马斯。<small>欧盟</small>对<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>的援助正在接受审查，因为有人声称它可能资助极端主义。 10 月 9 日，欧盟扩大事务专员奥利弗·瓦赫利 (Oliver Varhelyi) 表示，价值数亿美元的付款已被暂停。他立即遭到<small>欧盟</small>最高外交官何塞普·博雷尔的反驳，博雷尔表示“惩罚所有巴勒斯坦人民”会损害<small>欧盟</small>。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">拜登和比比的B计划</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至于以色列的重要盟友美国，这场大屠杀使拜登和内塔尼亚胡之间和解了。拜登对以色列转向民族主义右翼以及针对遏制司法机构的大规模抗议活动感到担忧，此前曾试图限制与内塔尼亚胡的接触。现在，他给了总理很大的余地来采取军事反应。他在 10 月 10 日的电视讲话中宣称：“毫无疑问，美国是以色列的支持者。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登先生迫切关心的是确定有多少美国人被杀（已确认死亡 22 人）或被扣为人质（具体数字未知，但仍有 17 人下落不明）。第二个更广泛的目标是控制整个地区可能出现的冲击波。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登对以色列的拥抱可能在某个时候成为一种温和的克制形式。美国开始更加关注加沙平民的困境。拜登敦促以色列“在战争法范围内”行动，这是对以色列官员的一种含蓄的谴责，他们曾谈到“全面围困”并切断对该领土的食品、水和电力供应。美国敦促以色列和埃及开放某种人道主义走廊。细节尚不清楚，但有报道称，它正在倡导为美国公民和至少一些巴勒斯坦人提供离开加沙的安全方式。 “平民没有做错任何事。我们希望确保他们有出路，”白宫发言人表示。但埃及不希望出现人员外逃。其总统阿卜杜勒-法塔赫·塞西表示，巴勒斯坦问题的解决不应“以牺牲其他各方的利益为代价”。承认巴勒斯坦难民大量涌入将破坏埃及的稳定，并可能被视为为以色列对加沙的破坏性袭击铺平道路。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">动荡中的另一项克制努力涉及伊朗。也许是因为他们不想开辟另一条战线，美国和以色列官员表示，没有关于伊朗或真主党直接参与策划或指挥哈马斯袭击的硬情报。但拜登的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文坚称，“从广义上讲，伊朗是这次袭击的同谋，因为他们向哈马斯提供了大部分资金”，更不用说多年的训练、武器和其他支持了。一些报道称伊朗对这次袭击感到惊讶。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登上任时希望恢复一项限制伊朗核计划的协议，巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)不顾内塔尼亚胡的反对签署了该协议，但唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)撕毁了该协议。目前还没有达成协议，伊朗现在距离制造核弹更近了。哈马斯现在的恐惧可能会让他看起来像个傻瓜，因为他甚至试图与一个高呼“以色列死亡”的政权进行谈判。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，共和党人正在将拜登的伊朗政策与哈马斯的屠杀划清界限。他们普遍批评他放松了特朗普对伊朗“极限施压”的政策。他们特别谴责他通过谈判达成一项协议，以确保五名被监禁的美国人于 9 月获释。这涉及解冻伊朗在韩国的 60 亿美元石油收入，这些收入目前由卡塔尔托管。 The administration says the money has not yet been disbursed and will be used only to pay non-Iranian contractors for food and other humanitarian supplies. “Nobody in Iran will ever touch a single dinar or cent or rial from those funds,” insists a senior official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Never mind the facts. For Mr Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee, “American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks.” He later lamented, “We are perceived as being weak and ineffective, with a really weak leader.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That said, Republicans are not helping Israel much. Their divisions, and the approach of next year&#39;s elections, have made <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/paralysis-in-congress-makes-america-a-dysfunctional-superpower">Congress</a> more dysfunctional than usual. The Senate has not confirmed Mr Biden&#39;s nominee for ambassador to Israel, nor hundreds of senior military appointments. The budget process—including new military aid for Ukraine and possibly for Israel—is at a standstill. A government shutdown looms again in November. And at a rally on October 11th, Mr Trump himself called Israel&#39;s defence minister a “jerk”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Both out of sincere belief and to defuse Republican attacks, Mr Biden will hug Israel close. “Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond—indeed has a duty to respond—to these vicious attacks,” he argued.然后怎样呢？ Nobody can tell what Gaza, or the Middle East, will be like after Israel&#39;s retribution. Mr Biden will need a new strategy for the region now that Hamas has upended much of his old one. Israel-Saudi normalisation is set back. The “two-state” solution to the Palestinian question has all but vanished. A less hostile relationship with Iran seems impossible. And the president&#39;s hopes of turning away from the Middle East to focus on the great-power contests with Russia and especially China have been dashed. As America knows all too well, from its experience of Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, overreaction to bloodthirsty terrorism without a viable long-term plan can lead to disaster.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Less than a fortnight ago, in a different era, Mr Sullivan had declared with satisfaction: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.” He recognised that “all that can change” but boasted that he had to spend less time than any of his predecessors since 9/11 dealing with crisis and conflict there. Now he has joined them, somehow trying to contain the Middle East&#39;s entropy and violent politics. Mr Sullivan had sought to “depressurise, de-escalate and ultimately integrate the Middle East region”. But it all risks going into reverse: conflict, escalation and disarray could easily start feeding each other once again. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 10:15:23 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qj8bss66cemnue1fg97t246smbc9ibms</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause </item><item><title><![CDATA[The war in Ukraine is threatening to wash across the Black Sea]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20The%20Black%20Sea-a34b4b127b192d3ddc0d94d8286e7553.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>W</span> <small>HEN RUSSIA</small> invaded Ukraine last year, the Black Sea seemed unlikely to become much of a battleground. The Ukrainian navy, after all, had only one warship, which it was forced to scuttle as Russian troops advanced on the shipyard where it was being repaired, in the city of Mykolaiv. Snake Island, a maritime outpost guarding the western approaches of Odessa, Ukraine&#39;s biggest port, fell to Russian attackers on the first day of the war. Odessa itself braced for an amphibious assault that would have cut Ukraine off from the sea altogether.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact the landings never came was the first sign that Russia&#39;s dominion over the sea was not as absolute as it seemed. A more ringing indication of that came in April of last year, when Ukraine managed to sink the flagship of Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet, the <i>Moskva</i> , using a newly developed anti-ship missile. Two months later intense Ukrainian bombardment drove the occupiers from Snake island. But it is only much more recently that Ukraine has begun to demonstrate a capacity to strike targets across the Black Sea.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In early August a Ukrainian naval drone—another new weapon—damaged a Russian landing-ship just off Novorossiysk, a big Russian port far to the east of the war zone. The following day another drone damaged a Russian oil tanker off Crimea, the peninsula that dominates the Black Sea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. On October 1st aerial drones struck a helicopter base in Sochi, some 600km away from the closest Ukrainian-held territory. Most dramatically of all, over the past month, Ukrainian missiles and drones have repeatedly hit targets across Crimea, culminating in the destruction of the headquarters of Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol on September 22nd.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia also seems to be intensifying the war at sea. In July it withdrew from a pact overseen by the <small>UN</small> whereby it allowed Ukrainian grain exports to pass safely across the sea. It has threatened to sink any cargo ships calling at Ukrainian ports and has repeatedly bombed Ukrainian docks and grain silos in an effort to throttle Ukraine&#39;s maritime trade. Since Russia and Ukraine both have the capacity to strike at shipping and since, as a diplomat puts it, the Black Sea is to grain what the Persian Gulf is to oil, an escalation in naval warfare could have a harrowing impact on global food markets. In fact, the Black Sea is also a big conduit for oil, and is central to the economies not only of Russia and Ukraine, but also Turkey and other littoral states. If it truly becomes a war zone, the world will feel the repercussions.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Sea gall</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For the most part, the war in Ukraine has been dominated by infantry, tanks and artillery, as well as long-range drones and missiles. But even though the six amphibious assault ships that Russia deployed to the Black Sea just before the outbreak of hostilities have not been used, the threat to Ukraine&#39;s southern shores has in some ways shaped the conflict. For one thing, the possibility of a coastal landing meant that Russia could menace Ukraine from three directions, and obliged Ukraine to spread its forces thinly in response.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Much the same logic has applied to the war in the skies. Excluding Iranian-made drones, around a fifth of all Russian missile strikes on Ukraine between January and March of this year originated at sea. Attacking from the sea, as well as from land and air, has allowed Russia to place a greater stress on Ukraine&#39;s air defences, which have to watch for attacks from every direction bar the west.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s response has in some ways been a triumph. The sinking of the <i>Moskva</i> has obliged Russia to keep its ships away from the shore. And the steady bombardment of Sevastopol has turned a huge naval base into something of a liability. Several ships previously berthed there have been pulled back to Novorossiysk. “They are like mice running away,” scoffs a Ukrainian naval officer. Ukraine has achieved “the functional defeat of the Russian Black Sea Fleet”, crowed James Heappey, Britain&#39;s junior defence minister, this week. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">But for all its successes, Ukraine&#39;s main goal, to ensure that cargo ships can come and go safely from Odessa and its other ports, remains elusive. After Russia withdrew from the <small>UN</small> ’s grain initiative, Ukraine set up a new shipping route that hugs its coastline until the Romanian border to the west of Snake Island (see map). The intention is to keep civilian vessels as far from Russian guns as possible, and to get them as quickly as possible into the territorial waters of Romania, a member of <small>NATO</small> , where Russia would presumably hesitate to launch attacks. So far ten ships have come to Odessa this way, loaded grain and set sail again, without incident, despite Russia&#39;s threats.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A senior Ukrainian official tells <i>The Economist</i> that intelligence indicates Russia is planning an attack on civilian shipping, in an attempt to disrupt the new export route. Russian warships can fire missiles with a range of 2,500km, which would allow them to strike cargo vessels from a safe distance. By the same token, Russia can use submarines to lay mines even if its surface ships are forced to stay away, suggests Sidharth Kaushal of the Royal United Services Institute ( <small>RUSI</small> ), a think-tank in London (although Ukrainians argue that the shallow waters along the new export route would make that difficult). Even if Ukraine were somehow to sink the entire Russian fleet, missiles fired from Crimea could easily destroy a lumbering cargo ship off Odessa.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another Ukrainian official notes that Russian strikes on Ukrainian ports are already raising insurance premiums across the Black Sea: “Insurers see where things are headed. They are not daft.” But, adds the first, “Two can play at this game.” Ukraine has warned that, if Russia attacks civilian vessels, it will retaliate in kind. It has been demonstrating its capacity to hit distant naval targets not to escalate the war in the Black Sea, he says, but to deter Russia from doing so. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The stakes for both countries are high. Before the war, roughly 60% of Ukraine&#39;s exports passed through its ports on the Black Sea. The volume of trade has since contracted dramatically, both because of the Russian blockade and because of the broader disruptions caused by the war to farms, factories and infrastructure. Even when the grain initiative was operating, Ukraine&#39;s exports were a fraction of what they once were (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some of the missing volumes have been diverted to barges on the Danube river. Ukrainian officials say they are managing to export over 3m tonnes of grain a month in that way at the moment. Another 1m tonnes is being exported by train and a smaller amount by lorry. But these alternatives are all much slower and more expensive than piling giant freighters with cargo. The cost of exporting a tonne of grain by river barge, for example, is roughly $120, versus $30-40 for exports by sea. Russia is bombing the new routes as well. What is more, Ukraine simply does not have adequate road, rail and barge capacity to substitute for deep-sea ports. The result is a further blow to an economy already gutted by the war, and further loss of tax revenue and foreign exchange for a government that is borrowing unsustainably.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Russia has a lot to lose as well. More than 80% of its grain exports and about 30% of its oil exports pass through ports on the Black Sea. These shipments have barely been affected by the war so far. Russia&#39;s military force in Syria is also dependent on fuel and supplies shipped via the Black Sea. This “Syrian express” probably ranks high on Ukraine&#39;s list of potential targets should the war at sea expand in scope.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Crimea and punishment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To inflict serious injury on the Russian economy, Ukraine does not need to sink all Russia-bound ships, but simply to damage enough of them that insurance premiums shoot up and Russian ports become commercially unattractive. “We don&#39;t have the drones to stop all Russian trade. But if you are asking if we can dramatically increase the financial stakes? Sure, no problem,” says a Ukrainian official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That would be bad not only for Russia, but also for global food markets. In the early stages of the war, they were gripped by panic. After all, when fighting broke out, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for an eighth of the calories traded worldwide. In 2021 they were the world&#39;s first and fifth biggest exporters of wheat, shipping 39m tonnes and 17m tonnes respectively—28% of the world&#39;s traded supply. Both also grow a lot of grain used to feed animals, such as maize and barley, and are the top two producers of sunflower seeds, giving them an 11.5% share of the vegetable-oil market.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Within days, the invasion sent wheat prices to more than $12 a bushel, up from $7 two months before; the cost of maize shot to its highest in a decade. This was largely because of the Russian blockade of Ukraine&#39;s ports on the Black Sea. Traders also feared that the war and Western sanctions might impede Russian exports. Many, including <i>The Economist,</i> warned that global food shortages were looming.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Agricultural markets are much calmer now, despite the growing risk of escalation in the Black Sea. Wheat currently costs little more than $5 a bushel, less than it did before the war began. In fact, prices fell back to pre-war levels during the summer of 2022 and have stayed there since.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That was less because of the <small>UN</small> ’s deal to revive Ukraine&#39;s grain exports than because of bumper crops elsewhere. Russia, whose farming industry is exempt from Western sanctions, harvested an unprecedented 100m tonnes of wheat in 2022. Other countries, from Brazil to India, also enjoyed bumper crops.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This year looks much the same. Ukraine is growing less wheat than before the war and its exports are down sharply because of the scrapping of the grain deal. But Russia has again produced a bountiful harvest, as have many other exporters. Whereas last year crops were threatened by La Niña, a climatic phenomenon that often saps yields in big cereal-growing regions in the northern hemisphere, this year, notes Carlos Mera of Rabobank, a Dutch lender, the reverse pattern, El Niño, promises more benign conditions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Attacks on commercial shipping in the Black Sea would doubtless send prices leaping again. Insurers would raise their rates or refuse to underwrite cargoes at all. Grain would not be the only casualty: some 2m barrels of oil and a further 1m barrels of refined petroleum products are exported through the Black Sea every day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the effects might again be short-lived. The Russian government is already insuring lots of the oil tankers that visit its ports, to help shipping firms evade Western sanctions. It could do the same for other exports as well. Despite rising tensions and Western pressure, lots of shipping firms are willing to transport Russian goods, says Matthew Wright of Kpler, a ship-tracking firm. What is more, Russia has a very dense network of oil pipelines. It could probably divert a good part of the oil that is normally shipped across the Black Sea to terminals in the Baltic. (The refined products would be harder to move around in this way.)</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> War and peas</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Transporting grain by road from Russia&#39;s farming heartlands in the west to distant terminals in St Petersburg, the Baltics or the Pacific would be slow and prohibitively expensive. (Ukraine already struggles to truck much smaller volumes over shorter distances.) But Russia has several grain terminals on the Black Sea and the adjoining Sea of Azov, so it could use an ever-shifting assortment of ports and shipping routes to keep cargoes out of harm&#39;s way. Given that Russia has struggled to choke off Ukraine&#39;s grain exports despite its vastly superior navy and air force, it is hard to imagine Ukraine snuffing out Russian trade.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For all these reasons, Viktor Kurilov of Rystad Energy, a consultancy, reckons attacks on commercial shipping might cause crude-oil prices to rise by only $5-7 a barrel before settling $1-2 above where they would otherwise have been. Wheat markets might be jolted more severely, at least for a time. That would not be painless: the brief spikes in food prices last year, the <small>UN</small> calculates, helped lift the number of people around the world facing severe hunger by 65m. But a lasting cataclysm is unlikely. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="The Russian Navy's submarine Rostov-on-Don sails in the Bosphorus, on its way to the Black Sea, in Istanbul, Turkey" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Not so Bosporous any more</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A critical variable in all this is the stance of Turkey, in effect the gatekeeper to the Black Sea. Under a treaty called the Montreux Convention, Turkey is obliged to let commercial shipping pass unhindered through the Bosporus and Dardanelles, the narrow straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. But the treaty places restrictions on the number and size of transiting warships. When war breaks out on the Black Sea, it gives Turkey the power to prevent belligerents from sending in reinforcements and to close the straits entirely to warships from non-littoral countries. So when Russia invaded Ukraine it barred Russia from reinforcing its Black Sea fleet, but also stopped <small>NATO</small> countries from sending in ships, despite being a member of the alliance itself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With the collapse of the grain deal, Turkey is under pressure to help prevent Russia from strangling Ukrainian trade. Bulgaria and Romania, two <small>NATO</small> members with coastline on the Black Sea but relatively weak navies, would welcome a show of force from the alliance. Some Ukrainians are calling for Western naval convoys to protect commercial shipping.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Turkey is loth to allow anything that increases the risk of a broader conflagration and that antagonises Russia. By sitting on the fence, Turkey&#39;s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has won valuable concessions from his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Russia let Turkey delay some payments for Russian gas, worth perhaps billions of dollars, a sop that helped Mr Erdogan conceal the scale of his economic mismanagement before elections earlier this year. Turkey&#39;s refusal to join other <small>NATO</small> members in imposing harsh sanctions on Russia has also been lucrative: trade between the two countries nearly doubled last year, to $62bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some analysts suspect that Mr Putin also promised Mr Erdogan that Russian troops sent to enforce a ceasefire would instead stand aside as Azerbaijan, Turkey&#39;s main regional ally, seized control of a disputed province from ethnic-Armenian rebels in late September. “Turkey is using Russian weakness to extract concessions,” says Yoruk Isik, who runs Bosphorus Observer, a consultancy. “As long as it continues to get them and as long as trade with Russia continues,” he adds, “Turkey will do its best not to confront Russia.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia is equally reluctant to rock the boat, as it were. If Russia were to attack commercial shipping, the pressure on Mr Erdogan to allow <small>NATO</small> ships into the Black Sea would increase dramatically. One thought holding Mr Putin back may be the risk of pushing Mr Erdogan into a less accommodating position.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is just another way in which neither side is likely to prevail completely in the war at sea. Ukrainian drones will continue to embarrass Russia, but the Russian navy will remain a menace to Ukrainian cities and shipping. Russia can probably push insurance rates sky-high, reckons Mr Kaushal of <small>RUSI</small> , “irrespective of how uncomfortable the Ukrainians can make Sevastopol”. And although naval battles will never be the main focus of the fighting, fears of an alarming flare-up will always linger. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 12:47:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/97jfa8dn922bjn2g8mhdcjrmmn7m7i22</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/05/the-war-in-ukraine-is-threatening-to-wash-across-the-black-sea </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Microsoft could supplant Apple as the world’s most valuable firm]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Microsoft-37a9c1204ae8d2f12b81da6615461597.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>or years</small> Microsoft has been trying to coax office workers to write reports, populate spreadsheets and create slide shows using its office software. No longer: now it wants to do the writing and populating for them. At its headquarters in Redmond, a leafy suburb of Seattle, the firm demonstrates its latest wizardry. Beyond the plate-glass windows, snow-capped mountains glisten and pine trees sway. Inside, a small grey rectangle sits at the top of a blank Word document. With a few words of instruction, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> )—or “Copilot”, as Microsoft calls it—finds a vast file in a computer folder and summarises its contents. Later, it edits its own work and succinctly answers questions about the material. It can perform plenty of other tricks, too: digging out emails on certain topics, drawing up a to-do list based on a meeting and even whipping up a passable PowerPoint presentation about your correspondent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is a glimpse into the future of work. The mind-boggling capabilities of “generative” <small>AI</small> look set to transform many desk jobs. It is also a glimpse into the future of Microsoft, which was once the world&#39;s most valuable public company and hopes to reclaim the title by selling the technology that will power the transformation. Through the firm&#39;s investment in Open <small>AI</small> , the startup behind Chat <small>GPT</small> , a popular <small>AI</small> chatbot, it is able to inject cutting-edge <small>AI</small> into its products.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pilot whale</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That does not just mean adding the Copilot to its office-work software (previously called “Office”, but recently rebranded as “Microsoft 365”), which will be rolled out in November. This week the firm will launch a Copilot for Windows, its operating system, which will be able to change your computer&#39;s settings, generate images and summarise web pages. Copilots for its sales software and human-resources offerings are already available. One for its security software is in the works. In February Microsoft added Chat <small>GPT</small> -like functions to Bing, its search engine, in effect another Copilot. With its squadron of Copilots, Microsoft is inserting generative <small>AI</small> into almost every aspect of its business. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">This is perhaps the biggest bet any company is taking on <small>AI</small> . The prize is potentially huge. Copilots could transform the world of work for the 1.2bn people who use Microsoft 365 and the 1.4bn who use Windows. This would allow Microsoft to bring in new customers and charge them more. That, in turn, could drive business to Azure, Microsoft&#39;s high-margin cloud business, possibly helping it overtake Amazon Web Services ( <small>AWS</small> ) to become the world&#39;s biggest cloud firm. It could even help Microsoft&#39;s valuation above the current $2.3trn, potentially closing the gap with Apple, currently the world&#39;s most valuable firm (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In effect <small>AI</small> offers Microsoft a tantalising chance to do something that has eluded it until now, and bring together all that it offers, argues Mark Moerdler of Bernstein, a broker. Teams, Microsoft&#39;s video-conference service, might be more attractive to <small>IT</small> managers than Zoom, a rival, if it features a Copilot that can sort through employees&#39; emails in Outlook and summon up information from their Word documents and PowerPoints. All this wizardry can also be channelled through Azure, further boosting Microsoft&#39;s business.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nonetheless Microsoft is also taking a big gamble. Next year its capital spending is expected to jump by almost two-fifths, to about $40bn. That is a near-record 16% of the firm&#39;s revenue and a higher share than any other tech giant save Meta, the parent of Facebook. Much of this will be spent on new <small>AI</small> chips and high-performance networking to go into the 120-odd extra data centres it plans to bring online. Whether such an investment will pay off is an open question. For all their promise, Copilots still have plenty of problems. At the demonstration in Redmond the <small>AI</small> -generated slide show described your correspondent as “ <small>CEO</small> of <small>ABC</small> Inc”, which he definitely is not. Competitors, in particular Alphabet (the parent of Google), are eyeing up all the same markets. As the battle over the future of work heats up, Microsoft&#39;s position is enviable but not unassailable.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Putting itself in that position has been a long endeavour. Microsoft&#39;s heyday was in the 1990s. The dominance of Windows as an operating system combined with a cut-throat business mentality made the firm mighty but roundly despised. A period of stagnation followed, as it lived off the revenue from Windows. When Satya Nadella took over in 2014, he shook things up. Windows would no longer be the firm&#39;s main focus. Instead the company was reorganised around Azure, with blockbuster programmes, such as Office, shifting to the cloud. This involved an enormous build-out of data centres. Microsoft&#39;s capital spending went from 6% of revenue in 2014 to 11% five years later. Crucially, the firm moved away from a walled-garden approach. Mr Nadella allowed Microsoft&#39;s software to run on other operating systems, such as Google&#39;s, Apple&#39;s and Linux, an open-source rival to Windows.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All the while Microsoft was also investing in <small>AI</small> . It first announced it was working with Open <small>AI</small> in 2016; it has since invested $13bn, for what is reported to be a 49% stake. The deal not only allows Microsoft to use Open <small>AI</small> ’s technology, but also stipulates that Open <small>AI</small> ’s models and tools run on Azure, in effect making Open <small>AI</small> ’s customers into indirect clients of Microsoft. And it isn&#39;t just Open <small>AI</small> . Microsoft has bought 15 <small>AI</small> -related firms since Mr Nadella took over. That includes paying $20bn for Nuance, a health-care firm with cutting-edge speech-to-text technology, in 2022. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Today Microsoft&#39;s business relies on three divisions for growth. The first is Azure. For the past five years it has been closing in on <small>AWS</small> (see chart 2). Cloud spending is slowing as <small>IT</small> managers tighten purse strings. Despite this, in the most recent quarter the business grew by 27% year on year. Microsoft does not reveal Azure&#39;s sales, but analysts think that it accounts for about a quarter of the firm&#39;s revenue, which hit $212bn last year. Gross margins for its cloud business are also secret, but Bernstein puts them at a lofty 60% or so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second is Microsoft 365, which also accounts for about a quarter of revenue. That has been growing by about 10% a year of late, thanks to take-up among smaller businesses, especially in service industries such as restaurants. The third source of growth is cybersecurity. In earnings calls Microsoft executives have said it accounts for roughly $20bn in revenue (about a tenth of the total). That is more than the combined revenues of the five biggest firms that provide only cybersecurity. What is more, revenues are growing by around 30% each year. (Microsoft&#39;s video-game arm, which brings in $15bn a year, is also set to grow substantially now that British antitrust regulators have signalled they will approve the long-delayed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, another gamemaker, for $69bn.)</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Blue fine-tuner</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Using Azure as the underlying infrastructure for Microsoft&#39;s other businesses has helped spread costs, streamline operations and boost profits. Since 2014 operating margins have risen from 29% to 43%—higher than other titans of tech (see chart 3). That has excited investors.在纳德拉先生任职期间，微软的市值增长了约 2 万美元。 Microsoft&#39;s price-to-earnings ratio, an indication of investors&#39; expectations of future profits, has more than doubled during Mr Nadella&#39;s reign, to 32. That is higher than the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 average, and more than all tech titans bar Amazon, whose figure is skewed by its paltry earnings. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Cheerleaders say Microsoft has two big advantages when it comes to generative <small>AI</small> . The first is the range of software it sells. Asking a single chatbot to peruse emails and spreadsheets to pull together a slide show is much easier than dealing with different <small>AI</small> helpers for each programme.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, Microsoft has a first-mover advantage. It has been quicker to deploy <small>AI</small> than rivals, thanks to its tie-up with Chat <small>GPT</small> and possibly also because Mr Nadella feels that it was slow to react to smartphones and the cloud. Whatever the reason, Microsoft&#39;s speed has made Open <small>AI</small> the default for big firms trying out the technology. A recent survey of <small>IT</small> managers by JPMorgan Chase, a bank, found that over the next three years they expected 56% of their spending on generative <small>AI</small> to go to Microsoft compared with 13% for <small>AWS</small> and 12% for Google Cloud Platform ( <small>GCP</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another survey by Sequoia, a venture-capital firm, of 33 startups that it invests in, found that 90% of them used Open <small>AI</small> . Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley, a bank, argues that an ecosystem is beginning to form around Open <small>AI</small> ’s <small>GPT</small> -4 model. That includes consultants who specialise in its tools and recommend that clients use them, as well as software sellers, such as HubSpot, which build bespoke programmes that use Open <small>AI</small> ’s models.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is some evidence for the idea that Copilots could help cement Microsoft&#39;s lead. In June 2022 it launched a code-generating Copilot on GitHub, a repository for code which Microsoft had bought in 2018 for $7.5bn. The model was trained using the reams of code stored on GitHub. It has quickly become an essential tool for software developers. In a survey, 90% of users told GitHub that the Copilot improved their productivity. The firm also conducted a small study that found that coders completed tasks 55% more quickly when using the tool. Some 27,000 businesses have a subscription, twice the number of three months ago. It is so popular in tech circles that the term “copilot” has become shorthand for an <small>AI</small> assistant, whether provided by Microsoft or not.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Microsoft says firms testing a Copilot for its “productivity” software (meaning, for email, spreadsheets, word-processing and the like) report similar benefits. Kate Johnson, the boss of Lumen, a telecoms firm, describes it as a “step function change” in the way her staff work. She uses it to look back at Teams meetings and see whether quieter employees are being given a chance to speak. It also takes instant minutes and draws up to-do lists for attendees. That helps with accountability, adds Ms Johnson: the tasks staff were meant to complete after the last meeting are “right there for everyone to see”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Copilots can also act as software coaches, teaching workers how to insert charts in spreadsheets, for example. The goal is that they will eventually be able to learn users&#39; preferences and even their writing style. “We hope one day to deliver a highly effective alter ego—an agent that knows you deeply,” Mr Nadella wrote in his book “Hit Refresh”, published in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All this does not come cheap. At $30 per user per month, Copilots may mean a 52-83% mark-up, depending on the software package a firm uses. Jason Wong of Gartner, a research firm, says, “That is expensive compared to the licences but cheap if it is going to save you hours a week.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other way Microsoft will make money from Copilots is from the underlying infrastructure. In May it announced its “Copilot Stack” on Azure. This makes it easy for developers to build Copilots in their own applications or to create “plugins” for Microsoft&#39;s Copilots. The hope is that lots of firms use this infrastructure, sending much more business to Azure. Another advantage of this “platform” approach is that Microsoft may be able to strike deals to use the data of Azure&#39;s clients to bring, say, legal expertise into a Word document or email. That creates an advantage that “competitors are going to find very difficult or impossible to replicate”, a research note from Bernstein argues.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Hammerhead</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the second quarter of the year <small>AI</small> added roughly $120m to Microsoft&#39;s cloud revenues. That is expected to double in this quarter. In 2025, Mr Weiss estimates, <small>ai</small> could boost revenue by $40bn, largely through Azure&#39;s <small>AI</small> tools and 365&#39;s Copilots.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such growth would not be cheap. New Street Research, a firm of stockmarket analysts, reckons that Microsoft is the biggest customer of Nvidia, the world&#39;s largest seller of <small>AI</small> chips. Its research suggests that Microsoft spent roughly $3bn on Nvidia&#39;s <small>AI</small> chips in the second quarter of 2023, up from about $1bn in the first quarter. In a call with investors in July, Amy Hood, the chief financial officer, noted that the <small>AI</small> build-out is putting pressure on Microsoft&#39;s puffy margins in the cloud. That is being offset, she says, by more efficient data-crunching. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft&#39;s head of cloud and <small>AI</small> , says, “We are seeing inference costs [those related to asking an <small>AI</small> model a question] going down and expect to see that continue and models get more accurate and more efficient.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if spiralling costs are contained, there are plenty of other risks. Competition is white-hot. One battle is for the $340bn market for business software. In May Google announced Duet for Workspace, its version of Copilots. Last week it released features allowing Bard, its chatbot, to access user&#39;s Gmail inboxes and Google Docs. Salesforce, a software giant, has Einstein. Slack, a messaging app and one of Salesforce&#39;s subsidiaries, has Slack <small>GPT</small> . ServiceNow, whose software helps firms manage their workflow, has Now Assist. Zoom offers Zoom Companion. Intuit is selling Intuit Assist. Startups such as Adept and Cohere offer <small>ai</small> assistants, too. Open <small>AI</small> launched its enterprise-focused Chat <small>GPT</small> in August.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Supplying the infrastructure to underpin such <small>ai</small> offerings will be another battlefield. <small>AWS</small> and <small>GCP</small> both offer access to <small>AI</small> models similar to those of Open <small>AI</small> . Analysts suspect these rivals have more experience deploying specialist <small>AI</small> chips than Microsoft. In August Google unveiled a new <small>AI</small> chip for training large models. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A flying kite in the shape of the Microsoft logo" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ryan Chapman</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All generative <small>AI</small> tools, including Copilots, must also be made “enterprise ready”, says Ken Allen of T. Rowe Price, a big investor in Microsoft. One issue is legal. Most <small>AI</small> models are trained on copyrighted materials, which users may inadvertently reproduce. The head of <small>IT</small> at a big oil-and-gas-services firm says he stopped employees from using GitHub&#39;s Copilot after his firm was sued in November for breach of copyright. Microsoft, for its part, has agreed to cover customers&#39; legal fees related to its Copilots, provided they use Microsoft&#39;s safety features, such as content filters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Models can also get things wrong. Microsoft has reduced such problems by training them on accurate, up-to-date information and including more citations. But that did not prevent your correspondent&#39;s promotion to <small>ceo</small> . Jared Spataro, who is in charge of Microsoft&#39;s productivity software, says that Copilots entail an “entirely new way of working”, in which the machine helps you produce more “but it isn&#39;t always right”. Humans must be alert to this and, if necessary, make corrections.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A third concern is data governance—making sure that only the right employees get access to the right information. An analyst notes that some early users of Copilots are discovering “really scary” results. Imagine personnel files or confidential emails coming up in a search, say.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is also the near-certainty that Microsoft will be accused of abusing its market power. (Endless competition headaches plagued its previous period of ascendancy, in the late 1990s.) The firm is already fighting on many fronts. In August it announced that it would “unbundle” Teams from its software packages, after complaints from Slack triggered an <small>EU</small> investigation. Customers have also complained about the way Microsoft&#39;s software licences nudge companies to use Azure, rather than <small>AWS</small> and <small>GCP</small> . Brad Smith, Microsoft&#39;s president, has called this a “valid concern” and the firm says it has made changes. But in June Google submitted comments to a probe by America&#39;s Federal Trade Commission, claiming that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in clients”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These types of disputes will no doubt intensify as <small>AI</small> -powered software becomes prevalent. If a Windows Copilot steers users to Outlook rather than Gmail, say, trustbusters may cry foul. The upshot of this could be to weaken Microsoft&#39;s ability to use a breadth of software offerings to make Copilots more useful, one of its big competitive advantages.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even so, Microsoft is in a strong position. It failed to seize on the advent of smartphones and was slow to grasp the potential of the cloud. Today it finds itself poised to exploit a technology that could transform the world of work. It must maintain a delicate balance, moving faster than competitors while ensuring that its advance into <small>ai</small> does not upset regulators, sap profits or ruffle clients. If it slips, plenty of rivals are ready to take its place. But if it succeeds, the reward will be huge. The Copilot will be the captain of its fortunes. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 18:27:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4faffuah59d4el3mb71mfc4bt67a2pr8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/27/how-microsoft-could-supplant-apple-as-the-worlds-most-valuable-firm </item><item><title><![CDATA[Western help for Ukraine is likely to diminish next year]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Ukraine%20and%20the%20West-1b5f0cd51f99f30c3e14c553e42eaefb-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he end</small> keeps receding. There was a time when some Ukrainian officials, having halted Russia&#39;s army outside Kyiv, thought it would take only a few more months to bring the war to a conclusion. “Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year,” predicted Lieutenant-General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of military intelligence, in May 2022. By last November, shortly after a spectacular Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defence minister at the time, was still expecting a swift victory. “My feeling is that by the end of the spring, this war will be over.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact, Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive did not even begin until June. Far from hastening the war&#39;s end, it has demonstrated just how long the fighting could drag on. Ukrainian forces, stymied by Russian minefields and other defences, have inched forward on foot. The deployment of reserves and spiffy Western weapons has not yet yielded any big breakthroughs. Wet weather and a shortage of ammunition will probably bring the Ukrainian advance, such as it is, to a halt by late October, if not earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another fighting season beckons. “We must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,” warned Jens Stoltenberg, <small>NATO</small> ’s secretary-general, on September 17th. “It&#39;ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine,” agreed Mark Milley, America&#39;s top general, the same day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America insists it will stay the course for “as long as it takes”, as Joe Biden, the president, has put it several times this year. Britain, France, Germany and other allies have all used the same phrase. As ironclad as these pledges sound, they depend on two uncertain variables. One is the West&#39;s ability to furnish Ukraine&#39;s army with enough weapons and ammunition. The other is the political will to keep handing them over.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the first. Russia&#39;s defence industry moved onto a war footing in the last quarter of 2022, says Richard Connolly, an expert on Russia&#39;s economy, who points to a big jump in steel production. British officials say that Russia can now produce around 200 tanks a year, twice as many as they had previously assumed. Mr Connolly says that, with refurbished tanks included, the true figure is probably 500 to 800. Western sanctions are not crimping output much, he adds, with crucial components such as semiconductors smuggled in via Hong Kong or Central Asia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In principle, Ukraine&#39;s friends should have no trouble helping it outgun Russia. The combined <small>GDP</small> of <small>nato</small> ’s members is 12 times that of Russia, even after accounting for Russia&#39;s lower prices. The difference is that Russia is willing to spend much more heavily on the war: military spending now takes up almost 40% of the national budget, far in excess of Western levels. <small>NATO</small> countries are trying to redress this imbalance by investing in arms production, which has been neglected since the cold war ended. But there are two snags.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One is cost. Estonia spends around $5,000 to $6,000 on every new artillery shell, says Kusti Salm, the senior civil servant in the country&#39;s defence ministry. That is relatively cheap by <small>NATO</small> standards, he notes. Russia, he says, spends 60,000 roubles, or around $620. The vast difference is largely down to cheaper labour and materials, lower quality products and lower profit margins for arms manufacturers, most of which are state-owned. Inflation is exacerbating the problem. “Prices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up,” complained Admiral Rob Bauer, a <small>nato</small> bigwig, on September 16th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second issue is timing. “After a slow start,” says Mr Connolly, “Russia has reached race pace and they&#39;re in gear now. They&#39;re now going to start churning stuff out at the rate approximating what they need.” American and European investments in new capacity, having started later, will not yield much extra supply until the second half of 2024 or 2025, giving Russia more time to mobilise, build new defences and pin down Ukrainian forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take the case of artillery shells. The good news is that American and European production is soaring. American officials say that their own output has risen from an annualised rate of 168,000 shells in the spring to 336,000 today. It will continue to rise, thanks both to new facilities and to more intensive use of existing ones. European production is set to double by the end of this year or the start of next, according to Estonia&#39;s defence minister. Between them, America and Europe should comfortably produce nearly 2m shells next year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shell shock</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trouble is, that is barely enough to keep up. Russia will produce 1m-2m shells next year, according to British estimates. That is on top of a stock of around 5m shells, new and refurbished. That should allow it to fire at least 15,000 rounds a day for a year, says Mr Salm. That is roughly on a par with Ukraine&#39;s heightened consumption during its counter-offensive, according to people familiar with the data. But Ukraine can probably sustain that tempo for only a couple more months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The gap could be bridged by borrowing from elsewhere. Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive was enabled by a massive transfusion of South Korean shells. America and its allies have discreetly purchased arms and ammunition from non-aligned countries such as Egypt and Pakistan on Ukraine&#39;s behalf. But such ready sources of weaponry are running out. Western armies&#39; stockpiles have been depleted, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the Western arms industry ramps up, this problem should ease. By 2025 there might even be a “glut” of shells, says a Western official. If most of the new output goes to Ukraine, and assuming that neither China nor North Korea bails out Russia, the Ukrainian army might then be able to out-pulverise the Russian army for the first time in the conflict. But 2025 is the military equivalent of a lifetime away. Next year, meanwhile, Ukraine will probably struggle to mount a big offensive.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The year after next is also a lifetime away in terms of politics. In Europe, the political winds seem favourable to Ukraine. Polls conducted in June and July showed that 64% of Europeans favour military aid to Ukraine, with strong support not just in countries with a long-standing suspicion of Russia, such as Sweden (93%), but also in more distant member states such as Portugal (90%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some hard-right parties, such as France&#39;s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and Germany&#39;s Alternative for Germany ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ), cast the conflict as a waste of European resources. “The German public is paying three times over for this war,” complains Gunnar Lindemann, an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> member of Berlin&#39;s regional assembly, “supporting 1m refugees, carrying huge energy bills and sending weapons to Ukraine.” Both parties are rising in the polls, but both remain far from power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Olaf Scholz, Germany&#39;s chancellor, has been mindful of anti-war sentiment, notably within his own Social Democratic Party. He dithered for months before agreeing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. He still refuses to send long-range Taurus missiles, even though Britain and France have given Ukraine comparable weapons. Yet Mr Scholz has by now realised that public scepticism is mushy: as soon as he sends a new weapon, approval broadly follows. On September 18th his government announced another €400m ($429m) of arms, including ammunition, armoured vehicles and mine-clearing equipment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Emmanuel Macron, France&#39;s president, who provoked grumbling in Kyiv last year over his frequent phone calls with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, and over his hesitation in sending weapons, is now among the most gung-ho of European leaders. France has long resisted expanding the <small>EU</small> , yet Mr Macron has become a fervent supporter of Ukraine&#39;s accession to the bloc. A poll in July showed that 58% of the French backed this approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s bid for <small>eu</small> membership is proceeding at a pace that would have astonished Europe-watchers just a few years ago. It formally became a candidate to join in June, 2022. This December, barring a shock, that status will be upgraded by the opening of detailed negotiations on accession. Ukraine is dazzling <small>EU</small> officials with its swift progress on the necessary reforms. It may still take years for Ukraine to become a fully fledged member, but the war seems to be speeding up the process rather than delaying it. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives at Skrydstrup Airbase in Denmark" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Now for Congress to get on board</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: EPA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In America, however, the outlook is much more divided and uncertain. On August 10th the White House asked Congress to authorise another $24bn “supplemental” budget for Ukraine, which would bring total American aid thus far to $135bn. Supporters of such assistance, among both Democrats and Republicans, constitute a clear majority of both chambers of Congress. Were the request put to a simple up-or-down vote, it would be approved relatively easily.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is unlikely to be, because of America&#39;s dysfunctional politics. A majority of the members of the House of Representatives may support Ukraine, but a small number of Republicans hold extreme anti-Ukrainian views, including Matt Gaetz, who has proposed inviting Russia to join <small>NATO</small> , and Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conspiracy theorist who has promoted the absurd notion that aid to Ukraine is actually being siphoned off by donors to the Democrats. Since the Republicans have only a slender majority in the House and since the Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, does not want to rely on Democratic votes to push legislation through, the pro-Russia fringe has much more influence than its numbers would imply.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The likeliest course is for Mr McCarthy to attach the supplemental budget to other important legislation, making it harder to derail. Past efforts in the House to deny Ukraine funding have been overcome, although each one attracts more Republican votes. Mr Biden already has congressional approval to send a further $6bn-worth of weapons to Ukraine from existing stockpiles. But after that there is likely to be a delay of several months while Congress contorts itself over the latest request. What emerges may be dribs and drabs of aid, rather than the big packages of last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the longer run, aid for Ukraine is fast becoming a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain. Republican voters, egged on by the scepticism of Donald Trump, their party&#39;s likeliest nominee for president next year, have begun to question further aid to Ukraine. Democrats remain broadly supportive. The big budget deficit and high interest rates make politicians of all parties reluctant to rack up more debt. And even Democrats support the notion that America&#39;s European allies should be the ones taking the initiative in conflicts on their own borders.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And then there is the possibility that Mr Trump wins next year&#39;s election. His policy on Ukraine is characteristically incoherent. In March he promised that he would settle the war in “no longer than one day”, before even entering office. “我们自己没有弹药，”他在五月份抱怨道，“我们放弃了太多。”但他否认自己会推动一项允许普京保留乌克兰领土的协议。 “没有人比我对俄罗斯更强硬，”他本周表示，并坚称他将达成“对每个人都公平的协议”。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，西方官员担心普京会等到特朗普是否再次当选总统后才同意谈判。这种情况已经在欧洲引发了激烈的争论。两位俄罗斯问题专家利亚纳·菲克斯和迈克尔·金马奇最近在<i>《外交事务》杂志</i>上表示，“如果美国试图通过谈判强行解决乌克兰问题，欧洲人几乎没有能力抵抗。”其他人则说这是过度的宿命论。法国官员认为，如果美国终止对乌克兰的支持，尽管欧洲无法取代美国的军事援助，但谨慎而理性的做法是，欧洲应该通过促进武器制造来保留自己的选择。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题是欧洲是否能够单独筹措足够的现金和武器来维持乌克兰的运转。尽管美国在战争的大部分时间里提供了大部分援助，但德国智库基尔世界经济研究所的最新分析发现，这种模式已经发生了逆转。欧洲人长期以来一直提供更多的财政援助。他们现在正在提供更多各种援助，部分归功于<small>欧盟</small>最近承诺提供 500 亿欧元，这是一项持续到 2027 年的多年承诺（见图表）。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">金钱不是一切</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，这些数字并不能说明全部情况。美国一直是盟军支持乌克兰的支点，在美国驻德国拉姆施泰因军事基地主持定期会议，承诺捐赠武器并进行协调。它为其他国家的援助提供了外交掩护：例如，肖尔茨先生坚称，除非拜登先生首先派遣一些美国<small>M</small> 1 <small>A</small> 1艾布拉姆斯坦克，否则他不会允许将德国制造的豹式坦克运送到乌克兰。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在某些情况下，欧洲人向乌克兰运送武器是因为他们将收到美国的新武器来取代捐赠的武器。美国以核武器为保障的安全保证让欧洲人有信心抵御俄罗斯的威胁。最后，美国提供了重要情报，帮助乌克兰发现并摧毁从将军到军舰等高价值目标。取代这种组织和援助将是一项艰巨的任务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这可能是不可避免的。 “西方的假设是——我想每个人都没有明言这一点——是我们为他们提供我们所能提供的一切，然后他们将继续发动大规模攻势，无论最终发生什么，我们都会满足于此， ”爱沙尼亚官员萨尔姆先生说道。 “这就是计划。”他建议，需要一种新的制裁，不仅涉及更多的武器，还涉及更多的技术，以抵消俄罗斯在大规模、更大胆的制裁方面的优势，例如取消巴黎奥运会的参赛资格，以及从夏季错误中吸取教训的新训练。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最重要的是，需要改变心态。 “这正是消耗战的意义所在：让西方相信我们可以比你们更受苦，我们可以比你们战斗，我们可以比你们更持久。他们知道民主国家的弱点，”萨尔姆先生说。他认为，任务是让普京相信事实恰恰相反。 “作为拉姆施泰因联盟，我们比俄罗斯富裕、强大、技术先进 25 倍……这并不是说我们口袋空空。” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

e190yofl0"><small>在秋日的</small>阳光<span>下</span>，基辅显得光彩夺目。绿树成荫的街道充满生机：时尚街区波迪尔的咖啡馆露台熙熙攘攘，时髦人士挤满酒吧。撇开奇怪的空袭警报不谈，与俄罗斯长达18个月的战争的主要标志是生锈的坦克变成了临时的战争纪念馆，以及穿着制服的人们与亲人一起享受假期。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于乌克兰高级士兵瓦列里·扎卢日尼来说，孩子们吃冰淇淋和男人们向心上人献花的场景是令人满意的。 “这就是我们为之奋斗的目标。我只是希望人们在整个乌克兰领土上过上正常的生活，”他说。关键是“整体”：乌克兰的反攻尚未产生他和其他人所希望的结果。俄罗斯防线并未崩溃。乌克兰近五分之一的领土仍然掌握在俄罗斯手中。在即将到来的消耗战中，尚不清楚哪一方更有持久力。当然，这在一定程度上取决于第二个不确定性：随着战争的继续，乌克兰盟友提供的<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year">军事和财政支持</a>将继续提供多少数量。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">云端的休息</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管表面上一切正常，基辅却充满了忧虑。乌克兰人知道，俄罗斯一直在储存导弹和无人机，以便在气温下降时攻击其能源基础设施。他们知道志愿者的供应已经枯竭，并且正在征召士兵来补充前线的伤亡人员。他们知道还看不到结束的迹象：一年前，50% 的人认为这将在一年内结束。现在只有 34% 的人相信这一点。俄罗斯独裁者弗拉基米尔·普京并不关心自己军队的生命，而乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基领导的民主社会则关心自己军队的生命。 “这不仅仅是[不惜一切代价]解除占领。这是关于解除占领，但不是失去很多人的生命，”他最近告诉<i>《经济学人》</i> 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">斗争减弱的前景已经开始渗透到泽连斯基的讲话中。 “我们需要学会忍受[冲突]，”他最近告诉乌克兰人。 “这取决于什么样的战争。我们准备继续战斗很长一段时间……[同时]尽量减少伤亡人数。例如在以色列。我们可以这样生活。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，一场持久战需要在军事规划、经济和更广泛的社会方面做出重大改变。战争初期英勇的即兴发挥和权力下放已不再足够。在军事方面，泽伦斯基先生通过任命新国防部长鲁斯泰姆·乌梅罗夫（Rustem Umerov）开始了明显的转变。和几乎所有乌克兰人一样，作为一名克里米亚鞑靼人，自俄罗斯 2014 年吞并克里米亚以来，克里米亚鞑靼人这个族群因同情乌克兰人而受到迫害，这场战争与他个人息息相关。但是，他说，“乌克兰与情感无关，而是与系统、物流和工业。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 41岁的前企业家和投资者乌梅罗夫表示，他的使命是建设乌克兰国防工业及其士兵的能力，以便西方盟友将乌克兰视为合作伙伴，而不是总是乞求援助的依赖者。 ，有能力塑造自己的命运。他之前的工作是管理政府的房地产投资组合，他希望为新角色带来高效的管理思维。必须消除繁文缛节。 “任何可以数字化的东西都需要数字化，”他说。他并不害怕掀起波澜：上任两周后，他更换了七名副手中的六名。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">爆炸性的遗产</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当乌克兰还是苏联的一部分时，它拥有庞大的国防工业。大约 150 万乌克兰人在 700 家军工企业工作，其中包括 205 家工厂和 130 家研发中心。乌克兰第二任总统列昂尼德·库奇马在苏联时期在第聂伯罗市经营着世界上最大的火箭工厂。哈尔科夫的一家旗舰工厂每年生产 900 辆坦克。但 1991 年苏联解体后，腐败和忽视逐渐扼杀了这些企业。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">现在乌克兰几乎从头开始重建其军火工业。 “任何可以本地生产的东西都必须本地生产，”乌梅罗夫先生坚称。其中一部分涉及国有企业改革，这是前投资银行家亚历山大·卡梅辛 (Oleksandr Kamyshin) 的工作，他曾经营国有铁路公司，追随西方管理潮流。 “战争的前一百天是关于勇敢的。接下来的 1000 天将是钢铁般的日子，”他宣称。六月，即他上任三个月后，乌克兰生产的炮弹数量与去年全年一样多。 Kamyshin 先生表示，7 月份这一数字达到了两倍。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌梅罗夫希望鼓励私营军火制造商，这些制造商仅占当地工业的20-30%。他说，如果当地公司能够证明自己有能力制造有用的工具包，他准备提前向他们付款。许多人都因缺乏有能力的管理人员而苦苦挣扎：国防部正在提出帮助将这些人从前线召回。 Kamyshin 先生预测，五年内，私营企业将生产当地 80% 的产出。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中一个焦点是无人机。乌克兰的此类产品产量呈指数级增长，尽管基数很小。 “我们将生产比去年多 120 到 150 倍的无人机，”负责协调这项工作的 32 岁数字化转型部长米哈伊洛·费多罗夫 (Mykhailo Fedorov) 说道。从事该行业的本地公司数量已从 12 月的 7 家增加到目前的 70 家，其中绝大多数是私营公司。为了鼓励这种增长，政府取消了进口零部件的关税，并以允许利润高达 25% 的价格购买无人机。 “我们可以在技术战争中获胜，”费多罗夫先生说。 “我们正在从经济规模大、自由度较高的国家获得帮助。技术喜欢自由，也喜欢移动性。我们两者都有。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">卡梅辛先生希望西方军事承包商也开始本地化生产。英国<small>BAE</small>系统公司是一家为乌克兰生产大量武器的英国国防公司，该公司在当地设立了一家子公司，希望生产在前线广泛使用的<small>L</small> 119和<small>M</small> 777榴弹炮。德国最大的武器制造商莱茵金属公司已经在乌克兰修理豹式坦克，并计划很快开设一家装甲车工厂。正如其<small>首席执行官</small>阿明·帕珀格 (Armin Papperger) 告诉<small>CNN 的</small>那样，“[乌克兰人]必须自助。如果他们总是不得不等待欧洲人或美国人在未来十年或二十年里帮助他们……那是不可能的。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">保护这些工厂免受俄罗斯的攻击需要独创性。卡梅辛先生表示：“我们不会拥有一座苏联式的巨型工厂，而是会在全国各地分布许多小型工厂。”无人机证明了一切皆有可能：费多罗夫表示，乌克兰侦察设备产量激增，有助于其与俄罗斯军队平起平坐。能够击中克里米亚和俄罗斯腹地目标的远程导弹的产量也在增长。 “这是一个重要的历史时刻，”他说，“当我们不仅仅是接受援助并希望[援助不会耗尽]，而是当我们将自己的生活掌握在自己手中并开始形成我们自己的能力。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰不断发展的无人机产业也使其武装部队能够采取新的战术，将战争带入俄罗斯境内。目标之一是打击军工厂，以扰乱整个供应链。最近的例子包括对生产十氢化萘（火箭必需的燃料添加剂）的设施以及为“匕首”和“伊斯坎德尔”导弹制造电路的工厂的攻击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个目标是心理上的：打破克里姆林宫试图维持的常态的表象，特别是在莫斯科等大城市。最近几周，由于无人机袭击该市，那里的机场几乎每天都不得不短暂暂停航班。 （卡梅辛先生说他想开一家商店，出售印有“莫斯科不夜城”口号的<small>T</small>恤。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰对俄罗斯基础设施的袭击还有第三个目标：阻止俄罗斯对其自身基础设施的袭击。自从俄罗斯7月退出允许乌克兰黑海港口出口谷物的协议以来，它一直在轰炸这些航线和其他出口航线，并威胁停靠乌克兰港口的船只。乌克兰的出口因此减少了一半，对本已陷入困境的经济造成了更大的损害。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰正试图打破俄罗斯的封锁。上个月，它开辟了一条新的海上航线，紧邻黑海西海岸，靠近罗马尼亚和保加利亚。如果乌克兰能够保护它，它的出口可能会增加到战前水平的70%左右。 9月17日，两艘船停靠在敖德萨附近的切尔诺莫斯克港，装载近2万吨小麦。几小时后，俄罗斯向附近其他港口发射了一系列无人机和导弹。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">翻天覆地的变化</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰战略家希望，如果他们能够威胁黑海的俄罗斯港口并打击对乌克兰港口发动袭击的军事基地，他们也许能够保持乌克兰的出口。本月早些时候，乌克兰导弹损坏了克里米亚俄罗斯海军基地的一艘潜艇、一艘船只和港口设施。它拥有不错的防空系统，但更远的俄罗斯设施可能没有得到如此保护。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对保护出口的关注反映了乌克兰官员的一种感觉，即经济也需要进行彻底改革以应对长期战争。乌克兰去年获得了 310 亿美元的财政援助，今年有望获得更多。但财政部长谢尔盖·马尔琴科 (Serhiy Marchenko) 认为，这种慷慨不会无限期地出现。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，军费开支占<small>GDP</small>的比例从战前的5%跃升至今年的26%。即使战斗停止，支出也可能不会减少太多。扎卢日内将军说：“我希望乌克兰军队强大到俄罗斯不敢朝我们这边看。”马尔琴科指出，萎缩的经济规模太小，无法产生足够的税收来维持乌克兰的安全，因此政府必须通过改善商业环境和培育工业来帮助其发展。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">马尔琴科表示，投资者主要担心的不是人身安全，而是不可靠的法律体系，这个问题早在战争之前就存在了。同样，大多数乌克兰人认为，经济复苏的主要障碍是腐败，而不是战争对乌克兰基础设施造成的破坏。乌克兰设立的独立反腐败调查员、检察官和法院正在取得进展，但更广泛的司法系统仍然效率低下且不可预测。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">也许战争对经济造成的最严重伤害是导致 700 万乌克兰人外逃——几乎是战前 3700 万人口的 20%。超过三分之二是女性，因为达到战斗年龄的男性被禁止离开该国。劳动年龄人口从2021年的1670万减少到今年的1240万。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">平静的呼唤</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了吸引人们回来，政府为企业提供启动补助，并为重建房屋的人提供抵押贷款补贴。但许多离开的人已经在<small>欧盟</small>更富裕、更稳定的地方定居，找到工作并让孩子上学。他们不太可能想要更多的动乱，无论乌克兰的安全局势如何，他们都可能会在新家里为自己和孩子看到更多的机会。最近的一项调查发现，至少约有一半移居德国的人打算在可预见的未来留在那里。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">人口外流不仅会带来经济成本，还会带来社会成本。泽连斯基先生的妻子奥琳娜·泽连斯卡（Olena Zelenska）是政府心理健康项目的负责人，她表示，离婚数量已经有所上升，“因为妇女和儿童在国外，而男人在国内”。泽伦斯基表示，消耗战确实存在风险，可能会加速乌克兰人口外流，造成进一步的经济问题，并扩大离开者与留下者之间的差距。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这并不是社会紧张局势的唯一根源。在战争第一周志愿参军的第 80 空降突击旅中尉罗曼·哈斯科 (Roman Hasko) 表示，他刚刚从巴赫穆特附近的前线休假抵达，对基辅夜间的喧嚣感到失望。 “我看到了很多潜在的新员工。我单位有很多空缺职位。并不是所有人都被杀了——有些人受伤或生病了……如果我们谈论赢得这场战争，这些空缺的队伍需要被填补。”

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在战争的头几周，像哈斯科这样的人就排队入伍。现在乌克兰正在通过征兵来填补队伍空缺。一些尚未被征召入伍的年轻人在离开家或通过检查站时感到紧张，因为担心被抓。许多人试图通过贿赂退出兵役并非法离开该国。上个月，泽连斯基解雇了所有地区征兵中心的负责人。他用经过情报部门审查、有战场经验的士兵取代了他们。本月早些时候，国防部大幅削减了医疗豁免的数量。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰人显然对国家的治理方式有些担忧。军队和总统的支持率仍然很高，但对该国政界人士的总体信心从 12 月的 60% 下降到 6 月的 44%。认为国家走在正确轨道上的乌克兰人比例也有所下降（见图表）。人们尤其对腐败感到不安。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但 76% 的人告诉民调机构，在战争结束之前他们不想举行新的选举。对乌克兰独立的支持率达到历史最高水平，达到 82%。大多数人并不抱怨行动限制或其他战时对公民自由的限制。 “战争已成为新的可怕常态的一部分，”基辅联合国开发计划署的社会学家达琳娜·索洛多娃说。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">抵抗俄罗斯的侵略仍然是绝大多数人的统一原则。 “问题不在于是否抵制，而在于谁为这种抵制做了或多或少的努力，”索洛多娃女士说。乌克兰各地 42% 的人表示，即使俄罗斯加强对城市的轰炸，乌克兰也应该继续战斗。约21%的人认为应该冻结冲突而不向俄罗斯做出任何让步。只有 23% 的人认为值得启动谈判。即使是在战争中首当其冲的东部和南部地区，支持谈判的比例也相对较低，分别为32%和39%。只有5%的乌克兰人愿意将任何领土割让给俄罗斯，只有18%的人愿意放弃加入<small>北约</small>。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">塞浦路斯智库可持续和平与民主发展中心的研究表明，尽管经历了战争，乌克兰人对未来变得更加乐观。大多数人相信子孙后代会过得更好。泽伦斯卡女士并不感到惊讶：“人们知道他们在为什么而战，而不仅仅是反对什么。” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 9 月 2 日，在布鲁塞尔南部山区的一个富裕的通勤小镇<span>圣</span><small>热内斯罗德</small>，大约 50 人聚集在教区大厅里喝香槟，宣扬肢解比利时。这次会议是由弗拉芒利益党 (Vlaams Belang) 组织的，该党是一个右翼政党，反对伊斯兰教、移民以及最有害的法语等对弗拉芒生活方式的威胁。该镇位于佛兰德斯（比利时一半讲荷兰语的地区），但讲法语的人已经搬进了几十年，现在占了大多数。佛兰德斯地区议会议员克拉斯·斯洛特曼斯 (Klaas Slootmans) 解释说，阻止腐败的唯一方法是佛兰德斯宣布独立。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

22%。除非出现突然逆转，否则它应该会在明年同时举行的国家、欧洲和地区议会选举中获胜。迄今为止，其他比利时政党都宣称该党太过极端，无法与其做生意，并拒绝将其纳入联盟。但如果该党赢得五分之一或更多议会席位，这种所谓的<i>封锁线</i>可能不得不放弃。不管怎样，这种排斥实际上可能对弗拉芒人有所帮助。过去五年，其支持率增加了两倍。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">正确的时机</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是一种常见的模式。在欧洲大部分地区，曾经一度被边缘化的弗拉姆斯·贝朗（Vlaams Belang）等民粹主义右翼政党正在不断壮大。在匈牙利、意大利和波兰，他们掌握着权力。在芬兰、瑞典和瑞士，他们也有份额。在德国，<small>民调</small>显示<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/germanys-rampant-hard-right-afd-puts-other-parties-in-a-fix">德国另类选择</a>党 ( <small>AfD</small> ) 的支持率为 22%，高于 2021 年选举时的 10%。在法国，最大的极右翼政党国家集会 ( <small>RN</small> ) 的支持率为 24%。再加上另一个反移民政党“收复失地运动”(Reconquest) 的 5% 选票，极右翼成为该国最大的投票群体。在荷兰，少数右翼民粹主义者也拥有四分之一或更多的选票。即使是几十年来缺乏大型民族主义政党的新兴民主国家——葡萄牙、罗马尼亚和西班牙——现在也有了它们。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">极右翼的前进既不是一律的，也不是单向的。例如，丹麦和西班牙对民粹主义民族主义者的支持最近大幅下降。这些政党也不尽相同：有些是热切的大西洋主义者，另一些则亲俄罗斯；有些人是自由主义者，另一些人则希望有一个更慷慨的福利国家，尽管只是针对土著人。更重要的是，极右翼团体往往越接近权力就会变得成熟，或者分裂，或者两者兼而有之。例如，意大利政府虽然由与法西斯主义有联系的意大利兄弟会（ <small>FdI</small> <small>）</small>领导，但事实证明，它比许多人担心的要温和得多。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

20%（见地图）。其次，当前的情况对民粹主义政党尤其有利，疫情期间移民中断后有所增加，通货膨胀高企，气候政策成本不断增加，成为民众愤怒的新焦点。第三，也是最重要的一点，极右翼不需要赢得权力就能对政治产生有害影响。仅仅通过吸引大量选民，它就已经扭曲了辩论，从而使欧洲各国政府更难就乌克兰战争、移民和气候变化等紧迫问题采取明智的政策。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">自由战士</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">2000年，当奥地利主要的极右翼组织自由党加入联合政府时，其他<small>欧盟</small>国家政府感到非常震惊，以至于将与奥地利的接触减少到最低限度以示抗议。但无济于事：自那以后，极右翼已经突破了一个又一个障碍。它于 2010 年首次领导政府，当时曾经中间派的青民盟 (Fidesz) 在匈牙利上台，该党曾经是中间派，后来转向民粹主义。去年，当<small>F</small> d <small>I</small>在意大利掌权时，那些说同样的事情永远不会发生在西欧成熟民主国家的人被证明是错误的。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt

<small>EPP</small> ）与极右翼的欧洲保守党和改革派联手。 <small>ECR</small> ），由她领导。这将使整个<small>欧盟</small>的立法机构走向民粹主义方向。与此同时，在法国，极右翼势力在每次总统选举中的表现都在改善（见图表）。过去两届比赛的亚军马琳·勒庞有可能在 2027 年赢得下一场比赛。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一系列外部因素正在帮助推动对极右翼的支持。非法移民在 2015 年激增时刺激了民粹主义政党的支持，但在疫情期间的平静期后又再次增长。今年已有超过 165,000 名未经授权抵达欧洲的人，尽管仍远低于 2015 年的水平，但与去年全年一样多。民粹主义者在经济动荡时期也往往表现良好，因此受益于经济动荡。过去两年来，高通胀一直困扰着欧洲，尤其是能源价格飙升。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">昂贵的汽油、暖气和电力引发了人们对应对气候变化政策的强烈抵制，而极右翼则抓住了这一机会。这始于 2018 年底法国的“<i>黄背心”</i>运动，最初是为了抗议提高汽车燃料的碳税。今年<small>德国</small><small>政府</small>的崛起是由政府提议禁止家庭使用石油和天然气锅炉引发的。在荷兰，农民公民运动（ <small>BBB</small> ）是一个新的民粹主义政党，最初是农民抗议氮排放限制。它在 3 月份的地区选举中赢得了惊人的 20% 的选票。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在疫情期间短暂回升后，许多欧洲国家对政府的信任度也出现了更广泛的下滑，这对极右翼有利。美国式的文化战争也变得更加激烈，这再次有利于民粹主义者。<small>德国</small><small>选择</small>党在欧洲选举中的主要候选人马克西米利安·克拉赫 (Maximilian Krah) 今年夏天在 TikTok 上发布的约会建议走红：“真正的男人都是右翼。不要看色情片。”在其他视频中，克拉先生认为“多元文化意味着多种犯罪”，对彩虹旗表示哀叹，并警告投资公司贝莱德希望用“少数族裔和移民”取代德国人。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最擅长利用这些想法来赢得和掌权的欧洲政治家是青民盟领导人欧尔班·维克多(Viktor Orban)，他自2010年起担任匈牙利总理。他毫不犹豫地抨击移民、同性恋者和<small>欧盟</small>，认为它们与朴素的匈牙利价值观相悖。他利用通过此类谈话赢得的议会多数席位，在法庭上塞满了效忠者，并对选举制度进行不公正划分。亲信收购了重要的媒体机构。除了破坏国内民主之外，欧尔班的统治还扰乱了<small>北约</small>和<small>欧盟</small>的政策制定，因为他对中国和俄罗斯都抱有友好态度。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但利用右翼民粹主义来控制一个国家并不容易。波兰法律与正义党 ( <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ) 于 2015 年上台时，遵循了欧尔班先生的剧本。它把官方媒体变成了宣传局，并试图挤满法庭。但<small>P</small> i <small>S</small>的努力还没有达到青民盟的效果。许多法官进行了反击，<small>欧盟</small>扣留了数十亿欧元的援助，以迫使<small>P</small> i <small>S</small>扭转部分法庭挤塞的情况。媒体并没有被吓倒。尽管<small>P</small> i <small>S</small>在下个月的选举中受到青睐，但反对派仍然具有竞争力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其他使用欧尔班先生模板的右翼民粹主义者也取得了好坏参半的结果。斯洛文尼亚前总理亚内兹·扬萨 (Janez Jansa) 因社交媒体风格让人想起唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump)，被昵称为“Marshal Tweeto”，于 2022 年失去权力。爱沙尼亚极右翼<small>EKRE</small>党在 2019 年执政期间曾试图对媒体发起攻击，但联盟崩溃了，该党在今年的选举中表现不佳。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使在选举中取得成功，极右翼也很难实施激进的政策，例如结束政治庇护或废除减少温室气体排放的措施。以瑞典为例，由于新纳粹运动的根源而长期受到其他政党回避的瑞典民主党在 2022 年获得了 21% 的选票。他们签署了一项信任和供应协议，以支持中右翼少数派政府，使他们对移民和犯罪政策产生直接影响。但在八月的一次演讲中，该党领导人吉米·阿克森不得不为政府执行该协议进展缓慢找借口。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">梅洛尼女士是西欧第一位拥有议会影响力来制定极右议程的领导人。但到目前为止，她管理着一个相当传统的政府。她唯一的民粹主义措施是对银行征收错误的税，限制一些航空公司的票价，并阻止同性父母将伴侣的孩子登记为自己的孩子。在某种程度上，她受到欧洲财政规则的限制。但<small>F</small> d <small>I</small>也不像以前那么极端了。 “这是一个务实的中右翼政府，时不时地推行一些身份主义（文化战争）政策，”罗马<small>路易斯</small>学校的乔瓦尼·奥尔西纳（Giovanni Orsina）辩称。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">特别是在欧洲问题上，许多极右翼政党的立场已经软化。一些最前卫的民粹主义者想要解散他们嘲笑地称为“<small>欧盟</small>”的联盟。但<small>F</small> d <small>I</small>在上台前放弃了离开欧元区和重组<small>欧盟</small>的想法。相反，梅洛尼女士希望<small>欧盟</small>采取更多措施来帮助意大利，阻止涌入意大利海岸的移民。今年夏天，她与欧盟委员会主席乌苏拉·冯德莱恩一起前往突尼斯，就移民协议进行谈判。她还希望欧盟放宽财政规则，以便她的政府能够增加支出。她甚至通过称赞欧盟是欧洲和平与文明的守护者来培养亲欧派。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>RN</small>以类似的方式不再呼吁法国离开<small>欧盟</small>和欧元。它的言论仍然是反欧洲的，但没有具体内容。这种对更激进政策的撤退可能正是为了扩大<small>注册护士</small>的吸引力，从而帮助其赢得权力。即使勒庞女士成为总统，尽管该办公室拥有巨大的正式权力，但她可能仍然难以执行她的政策。毕竟，现任总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙(Emmanuel Macron)倡导的国家养老金改革遭到了猛烈的反对，尽管他在去年的连任竞选期间明确宣传了这些改革。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">极右翼政党往往很年轻，充满了热心的理论家并依赖魅力型领导人，很容易出现分裂。 2015 年，芬兰党首次执政，导致该党一分为二。第二次选举于五月开始，但已经因丑闻和辞职而受到损害。在波兰， <small>P</small> i <small>S</small>的慷慨福利政策疏远了财政保守派，其中一些人已经叛逃到一个名为联邦的自由主义政党。勒庞女士的激进形象已经软化，现在面临着来自“收复失地运动”的右翼竞争，后者在欧洲选举中的主要候选人是她的侄女马里昂·马雷夏尔。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most vivid illustration of such chaos is in the Netherlands, which since 2002 has seen a series of right-wing populist parties rocket to prominence only to implode. In provincial elections in 2019 Forum for Democracy, a party led by Thierry Baudet, a dandyish Eurosceptic, finished first with 17%. Within months it had split into three. Mr Baudet now hawks conspiracy theories about covid-19 and immigration; his rump of the party is polling at 3%. Earlier this year the <small>BBB</small> had a brief moment as the standard-bearer of the right, but it has already slumped to 11% in the polls. It has been losing votes to yet another new party on the right with populist overtones, New Social Contract, which was launched by an <small>MP</small> famous for investigating abuses by the tax authority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What all these parties have in common is a vague sense that they stand with ordinary people against the elite. Their positions on hot-button issues can be hazy, as with the <small>RN</small> ’s new stance on Europe. At a local level their candidates are often pragmatic. In June the rural town of Raguhn-Jessnitz in Saxony-Anhalt became the first to elect an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> mayor. Hannes Loth is an energetic 42-year-old former vegetable farmer (“cabbage, sweetcorn, onions—all kinds of onions”). During the pandemic, when locals had trouble getting travel permits because of the lack of a covid-testing centre, Mr Loth opened one himself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Loth&#39;s main concerns are run-down streets and fire stations and the town&#39;s budget deficit, which was €1.5m ($1.6m) last year. That is partly because high energy prices sent heating bills for the <i>Rathaus</i> (town hall) through the roof. Mr Loth, toeing the <small>a</small> f <small>d</small> ’s line, says the solution is to restart the nuclear plants the government has closed and negotiate peace in Ukraine so gas pipelines to Russia can reopen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The disconnect between genuine problems and far-fetched solutions encapsulates something important about hard-right populist parties. Mr Loth is acutely sensitive to his constituents&#39; suffering from high energy costs. But the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s response is in part a fantasy: whatever it might wish, cheap Russian gas will not be an option for the foreseeable future. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="rotesters raising their hands making a Nazi salute while carrying a Spanish flag with the words"Long live the unity of Spain" are seen during a protest of far right wing party" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Making their presence felt</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similarly, the worries of the voters at the meeting in Sint-Genesius-Rode are natural. They have seen their town change its language around them; they have trouble finding good Dutch-language schools for their kids. But Vlaams Belang&#39;s solutions are illusory. Flemish independence is unlikely. Even if it happened, there is no way to force Sint-Genesius-Rode to speak mostly Dutch again. It has become French-speaking not because of a bureaucratic conspiracy, but because immigrants are more interested in learning French (a widely spoken language) than Dutch (a relatively obscure one).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The changes Europe&#39;s populist parties rail against tend to be inexorable or at least not easily reversed: demography, sexual liberation, gender equality, the shift away from fossil fuels. As with Vlaams Belang, the policies they propose to set the world to rights tend to be incoherent or unachievable. For populists, unrealistic programmes are no bad thing: candidates cannot thunder indignantly at election rallies about problems that have been solved.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Moreover, simply by railing and attracting support, far-right parties help to shift the debate. All across the continent, centre-right parties have toughened their immigration policies and heightened their culture-war rhetoric to stop voters defecting to the populists. The most glaring example of this was in Britain, where Brexit was set in train by the Conservative Party&#39;s decision to support a referendum on Brexit in an effort to diminish the appeal of the insurgents of the <small>UK</small> Independence Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is probably the biggest risk of the rising vote share of Europe&#39;s far-right parties. Certainly, they tend to be associated with bigotry and misogyny, and to undermine the rule of law. Occasionally they may win enough power to damage democracy, as in Hungary and Poland. But more often, big populist-right blocs simply impede countries from getting to grips with their most pressing problems by offering illusory solutions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is the last thing the <small>EU</small> needs. The next European Parliament must make grave decisions regarding institutional reform in the <small>EU</small> , energy security, climate, support for Ukraine and more. If a quarter of its members refuse to wrestle seriously with such problems, they are unlikely to be solved.

No longer: of the six countries invited to join the bloc at its annual summit on August 22nd, four—Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> )—are from the region. If they all accept, the Middle East will account for more than a third of the expanded bloc&#39;s members.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The invitations are one sign among many that the Middle East is changing. Wealthy Gulf states are trying to establish themselves as non-aligned middle powers. Saudi Arabia has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. The <small>UAE</small> , which will host this year&#39;s global climate summit, <small>cop</small> 28, wants to fashion a dual role as both oil exporter and green-energy powerhouse. The six-member Gulf Co-operation Council ( <small>GCC</small> ) is one of the world&#39;s economic hotspots, drawing the talented and the ultra-rich from east and west and deploying vast pools of capital abroad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even more striking is the Middle East&#39;s newfound (and relative) calm. A ceasefire has quietened the eight-year war in Yemen. Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to ease their 40-year feud in March. Qatar has repaired relations with its neighbours. The region has even reconciled with Syria&#39;s murderous dictator, Bashar al-Assad. America, meanwhile, is urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, under which four other Arab countries have established ties with Israel since 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Five years ago Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia&#39;s crown prince and de facto ruler, offered a hopeful vision of where things might go. “I think that the new Europe is the Middle East,” he said. “The next global renaissance will be in the Middle East.” His comments fit an increasingly popular narrative in the Gulf, that a “new” Middle East will be focused on economics rather than democratisation, Islamisation or other distracting ideologies. Diplomacy will bring stability, which will foster investment and growth that helps everyone move beyond the upheavals of decades past. The Gulf states have long applied this model at home; now they want to export it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Middle East has huge potential. First, and most obvious, it is awash with hydrocarbons. It accounts for 36% of world oil production, 46% of oil exports, 22% of natural-gas output and 30% of liquefied natural gas ( <small>LNG</small> ) exports. Those numbers will only rise. The region has vast reserves (52% of the world&#39;s total for oil and 43% for gas) and low production costs. At a time when Western oil majors are skittish about investing, Gulf firms are adding capacity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Location is important, too: the region connects Europe, Africa and Asia. Some 30% of the world&#39;s shipping containers pass through the Suez canal in Egypt, while 16% of its air cargo flies via airports in the Gulf. Its young population is another asset: 55% of Middle Easterners are under 30, compared with 36% of the population of the <small>OECD</small> , a club mostly of rich countries.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Monumental misfortune</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the story of the past two decades has been one of conflict and despair. First came America&#39;s ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003. The fury of the Arab spring followed, bringing upheaval but not democracy: all the countries affected eventually either reverted to dictatorship or collapsed into civil war. Islamist violence and sectarian strife compounded the region&#39;s woes. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The Middle East accounts for 6% of the world&#39;s population but just 4% of economic output. Strip out a few big oil producers and that figure falls below 2%. In much of the region <small>GDP</small> per person is stagnant or falling (see chart 1). Poverty rates have soared in Egypt and Lebanon, to say nothing of war-torn Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But three big shifts are under way that could change the place of the Middle East in the world. The first is the growing distance between the Gulf states and America.连续三任总统都寻求减少美国在中东的军事存在。 Joe Biden, the current one, is not trying to impose democracy on the region; he does not even seem too interested in reining in Iran&#39;s nuclear programme. America has other priorities: competition with China, the war in Ukraine, political turmoil at home.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s economic role is also decreasing. Over the past 30 years the share of Middle Eastern exports going to China and India has climbed from 5% to 26%, according to the <small>IMF;</small> the share sent to Europe and America has fallen from 34% to 16%. Much of this reflects Asia&#39;s booming appetite for oil, the region&#39;s main export. In the 1990s China took less than 1% of Saudi Arabia&#39;s crude exports, and India less than 3%; by 2021 those figures were 28% and 12%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Oil is at the heart of the second shift, in energy markets. The region is trying to become an even bigger force in oil and gas to finance a transition away from hydrocarbons, contradictory though that may sound. Recent high oil prices have brought a windfall. Aramco, the state-owned Saudi giant, posted a record $161bn profit last year, up from $110bn in 2021. It plans to expand its capacity by 1m barrels a day (roughly 10%) over the next three years. The <small>UAE</small> has a similar target. It has also made itself a transit point for Iranian and Russian oil, which are subject to Western sanctions. Qatar, already the world&#39;s biggest exporter of <small>LNG</small> , plans to boost production by 63% by 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The proceeds are being poured into new industries. Instead of parking its petrodollars in American treasuries, as it once did, Saudi Arabia is snapping up everything from European footballers to stakes in electric-car firms. This summer the kingdom struck a $2.6bn deal with Brazil&#39;s largest mining firm, part of a plan to spend $170bn on the industry by 2030.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final shift is in attitudes. Surveys show that Arabs view the economy as their top concern. About a third of young Arabs say the cost of living is the region&#39;s biggest problem and another third cite unemployment; almost half say it is hard to find a job in their country. Asked whether stability or democracy is more important, 82% choose the former. Growing numbers believe that democracy is bad for economic growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Citizens have lost interest in political Islam, too. Islamist parties have been forced out of government by Tunisian voters and Egyptian soldiers. Armed Islamists failed to take control of Iraq, Libya and Syria. <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/07/a-year-after-iran-was-shaken-by-protests-zealots-have-tightened-their-grip">Widespread protests</a> in Iran last year were a sign of popular frustration with its religious rulers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The leaders of the Gulf countries, too, seem to have a new outlook. Over the past decade they had sought to use force to change the region. They tried to impose a friendly government on Yemen; Saudi Arabia sent weapons to Syrian rebels; the <small>UAE</small> attempted to install Khalifa Haftar, a warlord, as Libya&#39;s leader. Each effort failed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At least for now, the era of macho foreign policy is over. The most unexpected diplomatic shift was the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. They have been at odds since the latter&#39;s Islamic revolution in 1979, fighting a proxy war that eventually spread to Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. With a nudge from China, though, they agreed in March to reopen their embassies, which had been closed since 2016, to tone down criticism of one another in state-backed media and to boost economic ties. They are hardly friends, but the deal has reduced the chance of conflict in the Gulf.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most unsavoury shift is Mr Assad&#39;s reintegration. He did nothing to earn it: after destroying Syria to keep power, he has made no gestures towards reform or reconciliation. But in May the Saudis let him reclaim Syria&#39;s seat at the Arab League.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The easing of tensions has nonetheless brought a measure of calm, which may help explain the improving economic outlook. The <small>IMF</small> expects the non-oil portion of the Gulf states&#39; economies to grow by 4.2% this year (unchanged from last year), even as the oily bit expands by just 1.9% (down from 10.3% in 2022). The region attracted 6% of global flows of foreign direct investment last year, up from 3% in 2019.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Capital markets are booming. Firms in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the <small>UAE</small> , accounted for 14% of the world&#39;s <small>IPO</small> s in the first quarter of 2023. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that foreign ownership of Middle Eastern equities climbed from 2% in 2017 to 10% last year. It sees the region&#39;s weight in emerging-market indices rising to 10% in the next few years, from 7% today.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Big domestic reforms are making headway: 31% of Saudi women were employed in the first quarter of this year, compared with 16% at the same point in 2017. Gulf states are also trying to be more exacting when doling out aid. Some still comes with few strings attached: Tunisia, for instance, secured a surprise $500m bail-out (most of it loans) from Saudi Arabia in July. But Egypt is having to raise money by selling stakes in state-run firms to sovereign-wealth funds from Qatar and the <small>UAE</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists muse about where this could lead.中东地区更加平静意味着全球贸易和能源流动的风险会减少，难民也会减少（全球 3500 万难民中，该地区难民人数超过 800 万）。 As Western firms seek to diversify supply chains, a youthful Middle East could become a new manufacturing base. Morocco&#39;s thriving car industry, which produces around 700,000 vehicles a year and sustains 220,000 jobs, shows what is possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The region could also do more business with itself. Trade within the Middle East is equivalent to only 2.9% of the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> , compared with 22% within the <small>EU</small> . Researchers at Majid al-Futtaim, an Emirati retail giant, and McKinsey, a consultancy, estimate that dropping barriers to trade could boost the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> by $230bn (5%). If Saudi Arabia and Israel buried the hatchet, commercial ties with the Middle East&#39;s most dynamic economy would become possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Infrastructure could be stitched together as well. The <small>GCC</small> countries have long mooted integrating their railways, which could easily be connected to those of Iraq, Israel and Jordan, too. Pipelines could bring low-cost Saudi hydrogen across the Mediterranean to consumers in Europe; upgraded transmission lines could allow a sun-baked region to export solar power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is an alluring vision, but there are many pitfalls. The first is that the economic progress of the past few years has been uneven. The Middle East has long been riven with political schisms, between revolutionaries and royalists, nationalists and Islamists, Sunnis and Shias. Today, though, the most important distinction is economic, between the prosperous states and the penurious ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Unfortunately, most of the Middle East is penurious. Even in a time of regional calm, dire economies threaten these countries&#39; stability. In the past five years alone, since Prince Muhammad first began talking about a regional renaissance, there have been big protests in Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Sudan.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pharaonic mismanagement</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt, the most populous country in the Arab world, is especially alarming. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the soldier who has run it since a coup in 2013, has consistently spent less than the constitution requires on health and education. But he has found the money for grandiose projects such as a new capital city in the desert and for big purchases of weapons for the army (Egypt is the world&#39;s sixth-largest arms importer).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt&#39;s debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratio has risen to 93%, with 36% of the loans denominated in foreign currencies. Its non-oil economy has been in contraction for 33 consecutive months and for 81 of the past 90 months. The currency has lost half its value over the past two years and will probably be devalued again soon. Annual inflation hit a record high of 38% in July. Citizens endured blackouts in sweltering heat this summer because the government could not afford to import enough fuel for power plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A fully fledged balance-of-payments crisis seems likely. Even if the government limps on, it will be hard to reinvent the region when its largest country is moribund. And should unrest erupt on a sufficient scale, it could even damage the economic prospects of the Gulf countries. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Another risk is that even the region&#39;s prosperous countries will fail to create the jobs and growth they have promised. They have undeniably done better to date than their counterparts elsewhere in the Middle East. In 1975 Saudis and Libyans had roughly the same <small>GDP</small> per person; today the Saudi figure is 353% higher. The Gulf and Israel (the region&#39;s other prosperous spot) account for just 14% of the Middle East&#39;s population, but 60% of its <small>GDP</small> , 73% of its exports of goods and 75% of its <small>FDI</small> (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Saudi Arabia, like its neighbours, is battling deep structural problems. Citizens still see a cushy public-sector job as a birthright. The government employs fully 53% of working Saudis, although that is down from 66% in 2019. Schools do not teach marketable skills. Wages are too high for the kingdom to become a manufacturing hub, at least without costly state subsidies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Prince Muhammad hopes annual foreign direct investment will be $100bn by 2030. Last year it was just $8bn. That leaves the government as the main agent of economic transformation, which is worrying in two respects. First, its finances are hostage to oil markets. Analysts estimate that the kingdom runs a deficit when the price drops below $100 a barrel, if off-budget spending by its sovereign-wealth funds is included. It is currently about $90—its highest for almost a year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, it is far from clear that the government&#39;s investments in diversification will pay off. Vision 2030, the kingdom&#39;s economic blueprint, predicts tourism will contribute 10% of Saudi <small>GDP</small> by the end of the decade. Officials claim the industry will generate 1m jobs, enough to hire one in 20 Saudis, a higher share than in France or Spain. But there is scant evidence of the hoped-for flood of 100m annual visitors. Last year there were just 16m, estimates the <small>UN</small> —about 1.5m fewer than in 2016, the year the vision was adopted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another worry is that the ideological arguments that leaders are so eagerly papering over will at some point resurface. Saudi Arabia is pursuing a détente with Iran even as the latter continues to produce highly enriched uranium for its rogue nuclear programme. Should the regime go further and manufacture a bomb, it could trigger a regional arms race—or even a war. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Collage juxtaposing an image of a tank and an excavator" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Anthony Gerace/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been relatively subdued for the past two decades, but it is unlikely to stay that way for ever. Serious conflict in the Holy Land could shake Arab agreements with Israel. Violence has ebbed in Libya, Syria and Yemen, but the underlying disputes remain unresolved. Mr Assad faced a wave of protests last month in Sweida, a restive southern province. And Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE</small> , although the main cheerleaders for the new Middle East, often disagree about both foreign policy and economic matters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final risk is that the region gets its geopolitical balancing act wrong. America is still the only country willing and able to project military power across the region, and its domination of the global financial system gives it unmatched economic clout. The Gulf states cannot risk losing it as a partner. Yet their dalliances with Russia and China are prompting mounting anger in Washington. America has imposed sanctions on a few firms in the <small>UAE</small> , including one accused of supplying drones to Russia. It has delayed a deal to sell <small>F</small> -35 fighter jets to the country because of allegations of a Chinese military presence at a port in Abu Dhabi.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Gulf states are “planning in part their future prosperity on the assumption that China&#39;s economic rise will continue”, notes Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. There are warning lights flashing over China&#39;s economy, though: slow growth, an ageing population, a moribund property market. A big gamble on China that alienates America could leave the Gulf in a difficult spot.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact is, Prince Muhammad is not the first regional leader to wax lyrical about a renaissance in the Middle East. There are many parallels between the current era and the 1990s, another time when the region seemed to be trying to put its violent past behind it. The Oslo accords appeared to herald an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Lebanon&#39;s long civil war had sputtered to a halt. Autocrats in Egypt, Jordan and Syria talked about opening their hidebound economies. So did Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, the Saudi crown prince of the day, who promised bold reforms and sought better relations with Iran.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 1993 Shimon Peres, then Israel&#39;s foreign minister, wrote a book called “The New Middle East” arguing that trade would pacify the region. “Ultimately, the Middle East will unite in a common market,” he stated. “And the very existence of this common market will foster vital interests in maintaining the peace over the long term.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> History, sadly, had other ideas. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process gradually ground to a halt. America invaded Iraq in 2003 and Israel sent its army into southern Lebanon in 2006. Supposedly modernising autocrats across the region proved quite bad at the modernising bit, which precipitated the Arab spring. Gulf economies stayed oily, save for Dubai, which never had much oil to begin with.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An era of peace and development is a tempting vision, but to attain it, the region&#39;s autocrats must be serious about keeping the peace and smart about fixing their economies. The present circumstances give them a chance to change, and technological and geopolitical forces provide an incentive. The rest is up to them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/holsuu85iuk0b8tu763gh7eqgambvsno</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/07/the-gulf-countries-want-to-reshape-the-middle-east-in-their-image </item><item><title><![CDATA[How cynical leaders are whipping up nationalism to win and abuse power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Nationalism%20and%20corruption-cc63480577ac61a926fc6b4c75cd5cf0.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>E</span> <small>ARLIER THIS</small> year Tunisia&#39;s president, Kais Saied, warned that “hordes of irregular immigrants” from sub-Saharan Africa were plotting to change Tunisia&#39;s demography, replacing the Arab majority. Black Africans, he added, brought “violence, crimes and unacceptable practices”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In effect, he gave Tunisians permission to be openly racist. Suddenly, many felt free to use slurs that were previously taboo, including one for black people that means, literally, “slave”. Most locals interviewed by <i>The Economist</i> in the street in August used this term. “The slaves are replacing us,” said Nizar, a furniture repair man in Tunis, the capital. “They are taking all the jobs.” Worse, “They stand on the balcony in their underwear drinking alcohol.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A wave of hatred has crashed over the country. In July, after an Arab was killed in a brawl with migrants in Sfax, Tunisia&#39;s second city, mobs torched homes where black Africans were lodging. Landlords, scared of losing their property, evicted black tenants. When <i>The Economist</i> visited, hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants were sleeping rough in the town centre, huddled together for protection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Look at my head,” said Muhammad, a painter from Guinea, pointing to a hammer-blow scar. He was driven from his flat by thugs wielding stones and petrol bombs, he said; then police grabbed him and dumped him in the desert with no water. Many migrants have died this way, but Muhammad somehow made it back to Sfax. He is desperate to get to Europe. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMcuv4eccCA?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s speech was pure fabrication. There is no plot to change Tunisia&#39;s demography. Black Africans are a tiny share of the population, and largely just passing through. If they linger, it is simply because they are saving for the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before the speech, Mr Saied was unpopular, thanks to a dire economy. After it, he appears to have won more support. Polls are unreliable, but one in November gave him less than 30% backing; a different one in June found that 69% would vote for him.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> By vowing to guard Tunisians from a phantom menace, he has rallied them behind him. He has also deflected blame for the country&#39;s ills. Economists think Tunisia&#39;s inflation is largely caused by the government, but Mustafa, from Sfax, blames black people, who he says are driving up prices by eating all the bread. He plans to vote for Mr Saied at the next election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s hate-mongering has also distracted attention from other controversial things he has been doing, such as muzzling the press, purging the judiciary and shutting down the national anti-corruption watchdog. He has been dismantling the checks and balances that promote good, clean governance, with predictable results. Tunisia has grown more fearful, less free and more corrupt. Its score on the Corruption Perceptions Index ( <small>CPI</small> ) compiled by Transparency International, a watchdog, has worsened significantly since 2021, when Mr Saied started dismantling its young, hopeful democracy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Tunisia reflects a global trend: more leaders are using nationalism as a tool to amass power—and to abuse it (see chart 1). Whereas nationalism was once a means to dismantle deplorable colonial empires, it is increasingly becoming a device to remove legitimate constraints on government power. Leaders who chafe at checks and balances need a pretext to scrap them. They cannot admit that they want to muzzle the press and purge the courts because they find it irksome to follow the rules and would prefer to rule with unfettered authority. So they accuse journalists and judges of being traitors, or agents of foreign powers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nationalism can be positive or negative. The positive sort—love of one&#39;s country—can be a force for good. “It is the strongest foundation for solidarity between people who might otherwise have few things in common,” writes Yascha Mounk in “The Great Experiment: How to Make Diverse Democracies Work”. “At its best, it can inspire a white Christian living in rural Tennessee to feel special concern for a Hispanic atheist living in Los Angeles—and vice versa.” Because it is benign and, except at a few Western universities, uncontroversial, positive nationalism is embraced by nearly all politicians. Hardly any would admit to not loving their country.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The danger is when they espouse negative nationalism: the fear and suspicion of outsiders. The outsiders could be foreigners or domestic minorities. Perhaps because this paranoid variant is based on a deep-seated instinct—the desire to protect one&#39;s tribe—it is highly potent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When people feel their country is threatened, they rise to defend it, sometimes heroically. When Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Ukrainians made great sacrifices to resist him. This benefited Ukraine, which would otherwise have become a vassal state. It also boosted the poll ratings of Ukraine&#39;s president, Volodymyr Zelensky: people rallied round the man who led their country&#39;s defence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Alas, unscrupulous leaders have found they can win similar poll bumps by vowing to defend people against confected threats. Mr Putin claims that his unprovoked attack on Ukraine is really about defending Russia from Western aggression and Ukrainian Nazis. Many Russians believe him. Despite the war&#39;s cost to Russia in blood, treasure and international isolation, independent polls suggest that Mr Putin&#39;s approval rating has risen since he started it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main drawback of paranoid nationalism is obvious. It is terrible for its targets, whether they be immigrants in Tunisia or Ukrainians whose land has been sown with mines. Neighbours of paranoid nationalist regimes have cause to be nervous, as anywhere that shares a border with Russia or China can attest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other big drawback is less well understood: politics based on bigotry opens the door to misrule and corruption. As Mr Putin has ratcheted up nationalist propaganda over the past two decades, his cronies have been plundering Russia. And though he is surely the most extreme example, he is far from alone. In fact, there is a clear statistical correlation between nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>The Economist</i> analysed data from the V-Dem Institute, a think-tank attached to the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. Every year it asks experts to describe how the world&#39;s governments justify themselves to voters or citizens. It then creates a scale with the results. After weighting countries by population, we found that between 2012 and 2021 governments became more reliant on nationalism to justify themselves. (Specifically, on an ideology that included a nationalist element. It could also include other elements, such as populism or Islamism.) The change was significant: a typical citizen has seen an increase in her state&#39;s use of nationalism roughly equivalent to what China has seen under its “Wolf Warrior” president, Xi Jinping. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> We combined our measure of how nationalist governments are with data on perceptions of public-sector corruption from Transparency International ( <small>TI</small> ) for the years 2012 to 2021. Using a statistical model, we found that where governments rely on nationalist rhetoric to stay in power, experts think the public sector is much more corrupt (see chart 2). Moreover, comparing countries with themselves over time, going back to 2012, we find that more nationalist rhetoric has been associated with more corruption, and less nationalism with less corruption. Both these findings remain true after controlling for average incomes, and changes in them, and worldwide trends in nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There were notable exceptions (China, for instance, became cleaner and more jingoistic) but the relationship is statistically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in nationalism was correlated with a jump of 5.31 (on a scale of 0 to 100) in corruption when comparing countries, and a 0.13 point jump when comparing within them. The latter may seem small, but corruption scores usually do not change much at all. Interestingly, when an increase in nationalism came first, it predicted a future increase in corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why might this be so? Daniel Eriksson, the head of <small>TI</small> , suggests three ways that nationalism can foster the abuse of power. Politicians may whip up nationalist passions to win office or hang on to it. By granting their kin or cronies influence, they may attempt to capture the state. And by branding critics as traitors, they may erode the checks and balances that prevent the looting of public funds.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Appeals to nationalism are effective because they are simple to understand, and far more emotive than any bread-and-butter policy proposal. “Vote for me and I&#39;ll make incremental improvements to schools” is a fine platform but a dull slogan. “The tribe next door are attacking us!” is an electrifying one.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pick your poison</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The enemy can take many forms. It could be immigrants, as in Tunisia. Or a geopolitical rival: Chinese and Russian propaganda constantly demonise America. Or a minority faith: India&#39;s ruling party plays up the non-existent threat that Muslims, less than 15% of the population, pose to the Hindu majority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Or the enemy could be cultural change. Many nationalist leaders describe any new social trend that makes people uncomfortable as foreign, or even a vicious attempt by foreigners to subvert their country&#39;s values. Iran&#39;s regime uses this argument about women&#39;s rights; Uganda&#39;s, about tolerance for gay people. Illiberal regimes habitually describe the values they oppose as alien, which is easier than explaining why they are wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Each nationalist leader is unique, and it is hard to tell which ones believe their own rhetoric. Either way, paranoid nationalism gives them tools to gain power, consolidate it, and disguise their abuse of it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Consider Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega, the president, was once a revolutionary Marxist. He shot his way to power in 1979 but lost an election in 1990. Determined to regain and retain power, he muffled his Marxism, dialled up the anti-American bombast, won an election in 2006 and has gradually throttled democracy ever since.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> His choice of bogeyman is shrewd. The United States really did sponsor violent revolutionaries in his country—four decades ago. That threat is long gone, but Mr Ortega still claims that his opponents are “agents of the Yankee empire” who “stopped being Nicaraguans long ago”. In February he had more than 300 dissidents stripped of their citizenship. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Following Mr Eriksson&#39;s script, Mr Ortega has put his kin in positions of power. His vice-president and likely successor is his wife, Rosario Murillo. Eight of their nine children help them run the country. Their son Laureano is a presidential adviser. He oversaw negotiations with a Chinese firm to build a $50bn canal across Nicaragua. The project collapsed in 2015 amid allegations of skulduggery. Laureano is also an opera singer. Not all opera fans are convinced of his talent. One critic likened his voice to the “shrieks of a goat giving birth”. But he regularly lands the starring role in operas backed by a foundation he runs, which is funded by Nicaraguan taxpayers.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Grand theft autocrat</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Ortega family run the main television channels in Nicaragua. This lets them slant the news in their favour. It is also lucrative. Between 2018 and 2020 Nicaragua&#39;s government bought advertising worth an estimated $59m from the three biggest <small>TV</small> channels owned or controlled by the Ortegas, while spending a measly $230,000 at channels not affiliated with them. In all, the family is thought to control 22 companies in industries from energy to property. Nicaragua is a whopping ten points more corrupt on <small>TI</small> ’s scale than in 2012, and now ranks lower than Congo.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In richer, more established democracies, too, paranoid nationalism offers a quick way for outsiders to grab attention and break into national politics, or remain on top. In May Viktor Orban, Hungary&#39;s prime minister, claimed at a conservative conference, “We are all under attack.” He vows to defend Hungarians against immigration, Islam and gay rights. He proclaims the unity of all ethnic Hungarians, including those in neighbouring countries. He gives them pensions and lets them vote in Hungarian elections; they tend to vote for him. Inflaming nationalism has thus helped him win four elections.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Hungarian media, which are now largely controlled by Mr Orban&#39;s cronies, parrot his claims of foreign plots. Tame courts raise few objections when rivers of aid from the European Union flow into the pockets of his chums and state assets are transferred to foundations controlled by his allies. Lorinc Meszaros, a former schoolmate of Mr Orban who owned a modest pipe-fitting business, has become the richest man in Hungary, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $1.4bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Hungary and elsewhere, nationalism offers a plausible-sounding excuse to weaken checks and balances. Watchdogs can be designated “foreign agents” and neutered. Honest public servants can be labelled “unpatriotic” and replaced with loyalists. Dodgy dealings can be kept secret in the name of national security.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Putin was a pioneer of this approach. In 2012 he introduced a law restricting the activities of <small>ngo</small> s that received money from abroad. In 2022 he broadened the law&#39;s scope. Now the state can declare any individual or group to be a “foreign agent” (which sounds to many ears like “spy”) if it deems them to be “under foreign influence”. So-called “foreign agents” can be banned from any kind of political activity, or simply shut down.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Elements of the Putin method have been widely imitated around the world. At least 50 countries have enacted rules to curb civil society in recent years, according to Amnesty International. More broadly, of the 31 countries that showed a significant deterioration on the Corruption Perceptions Index between 2012 and 2022, 80% also suffered a constriction of civil liberties, as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister organisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Labelling watchdogs “foreign agents” impedes their work. Nervous local donors grow reluctant to fund feisty <small>ngo</small> s; advertisers shun independent media, lest their brand names be tarnished by association. India has used its Foreign Contributions Regulation Act to harass and muzzle groups from Oxfam to Greenpeace. China&#39;s “foreign influence” rules restrict the activities of any foreign-linked <small>ngo</small> that might annoy the Communist Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In July Zimbabwe&#39;s president signed a “Patriotic Bill” allowing long jail terms for anyone caught “wilfully damaging the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe”. The opposition says it criminalised criticism of the government in the run-up to an election last week, which the ruling party “won” unfairly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Despite its name, the bill seems designed to make Zimbabwe worse-governed. It makes it hazardous for members of civil society, the principal check on a thieving ruling party, to have any contact with foreigners. If an independent journalist talks to a foreign diplomat, or a local election-monitoring group shares data with an international one, or an anti-corruption watchdog seeks advice from an expert abroad, jail may await. As a cherry on top, the law also makes it harder to punish predatory officials, by requiring prosecutors to prove that those who abuse office knew that their actions were wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In country after country, incumbents have found that nationalist or sectarian arguments can be used to harass or exclude from office those who challenge the status quo. Iran&#39;s corrupt theocracy insists that all presidential candidates meet its definition of Islamic piety. In 2021 it disqualified 585 of them, including all the would-be reformers, and allowed only seven to run. A new Polish law could bar from office politicians deemed to be unduly influenced by Russia; its probable target is Donald Tusk, a leading opposition candidate who is not pro-Russian at all. Since 2015, when Poland&#39;s nationalist ruling party took charge, the country has grown eight points grubbier on the Corruption Perceptions Index.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shades of greed</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A more nationalist government does not automatically mean a more corrupt one. It is possible for a country to become more tub-thumping, but no dirtier, at least for a while. However, in the long run, if a leader uses nationalism to erode checks and balances, it becomes easier for the people around him or his successors to plunder. This happened in Zimbabwe, where a nationalist autocrat who was far more interested in power than money, Robert Mugabe, failed to stop looting by his cronies and was ultimately overthrown by them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thus, regardless of the starting point, paranoid nationalism tends to make countries worse governed and less stable. A paper co-written by Abhijit Banerjee, a Nobel prize-winning economist, found that when voters pick candidates by ethnicity instead of, say, probity or competence, they end up with less honest, less competent representatives.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Andreas Wimmer of Columbia University crunched data from nearly 500 civil wars and found that when political parties are ethnically based, civil war is nearly twice as likely. And instability is perhaps 30 times as likely if the country in question is neither a dictatorship (which can crush unrest before it escalates) nor a full democracy (where disputes are typically resolved peacefully). In short, when a leader invokes blood and soil, expect things to get bloody, or soiled. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Inspect all our code, data and models on <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/the-economist-nationalism-and-corruption/tree/master">GitHub</a></i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 09:10:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ttf827decbkegnfcmlacnisovs2h4nbg</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/31/how-cynical-leaders-are-whipping-up-nationalism-to-win-and-abuse-power</item></channel></rss>
