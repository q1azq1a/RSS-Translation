e190yofl0"><span>当</span><small>俄罗斯</small>去年入侵乌克兰时，黑海似乎不太可能成为战场。毕竟，乌克兰海军只有一艘军舰，当俄罗斯军队逼近尼古拉耶夫市正在维修的造船厂时，乌克兰海军被迫将其凿沉。蛇岛是守卫乌克兰最大港口敖德萨西部通道的海上前哨基地，在战争的第一天就被俄罗斯攻击者攻陷。敖德萨本身就做好了两栖攻击的准备，这将完全切断乌克兰与海洋的联系。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">登陆从未到来的事实是俄罗斯对海洋的统治并不像看上去那么绝对的第一个迹象。去年四月，乌克兰用新开发的反舰导弹成功击沉了俄罗斯黑海舰队的旗舰“<i>莫斯科”</i>号，这更明显地表明了这一点。两个月后，乌克兰的猛烈轰炸将占领者赶出了蛇岛。但直到最近，乌克兰才开始展示打击黑海目标的能力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">八月初，一架乌克兰海军无人机——另一种新武器——在新罗西斯克附近击毁了一艘俄罗斯登陆舰，新罗西斯克是远离战区东部的一个俄罗斯大港口。第二天，另一架无人机在克里米亚附近损坏了一艘俄罗斯油轮，克里米亚是黑海半岛的主宰，俄罗斯于 2014 年从乌克兰手中夺取了克里米亚半岛。10 月 1 日，无人机袭击了索契的一个直升机基地，该基地距离最近的乌克兰控制点约 600 公里。领土。最引人注目的是，在过去的一个月里，乌克兰的导弹和无人机多次袭击克里米亚各地的目标，最终于9月22日摧毁了位于塞瓦斯托波尔的俄罗斯黑海舰队总部。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">俄罗斯似乎也在加剧海上战争。 7月，它退出了一项由<small>联合国</small>监督的协议，该协议允许乌克兰粮食出口安全过海。它威胁要击沉所有停靠乌克兰港口的货船，并多次轰炸乌克兰码头和粮仓，以扼杀乌克兰的海上贸易。由于俄罗斯和乌克兰都有能力打击航运，而且正如一位外交官所说，黑海对粮食的争夺就像波斯湾对石油的争夺一样，海战的升级可能会对全球粮食市场产生痛苦的影响。事实上，黑海也是石油的重要通道，不仅是俄罗斯和乌克兰的经济中心，也是土耳其和其他沿岸国家的经济中心。如果它真的成为战区，世界将会感受到影响。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">海胆</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在很大程度上，乌克兰战争主要由步兵、坦克和大炮以及远程无人机和导弹主导。但尽管俄罗斯在敌对行动爆发前部署到黑海的六艘两栖攻击舰尚未投入使用，但对乌克兰南部海岸的威胁在某种程度上影响了冲突。一方面，沿海登陆的可能性意味着俄罗斯可以从三个方向威胁乌克兰，并迫使乌克兰分散兵力作为回应。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">大致相同的逻辑也适用于空中战争。不包括伊朗制造的无人机，今年 1 月至 3 月期间，俄罗斯对乌克兰发动的所有导弹袭击中约有五分之一源自海上。来自海上、陆地和空中的攻击使俄罗斯能够对乌克兰的防空系统施加更大的压力，乌克兰的防空系统必须警惕来自除西方以外各个方向的攻击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰的反应在某些方面是一次胜利。<i>莫斯科号</i>的沉没迫使俄罗斯将其船只远离海岸。对塞瓦斯托波尔的持续轰炸使一个巨大的海军基地变成了某种负担。此前停泊在那里的几艘船只已被拉回新罗西斯克。 “他们就像逃跑的老鼠，”一名乌克兰海军军官嘲笑道。英国国防部副部长詹姆斯·希佩本周夸奖说，乌克兰已经实现了“对俄罗斯黑海舰队的功能性击败”。 </p><div

e190yofl0">但尽管取得了所有成功，乌克兰的主要目标——确保货船能够安全地进出敖德萨及其其他港口——仍然难以实现。俄罗斯退出<small>联合国</small>粮食计划后，乌克兰建立了一条新的航线，沿着其海岸线一直延伸到蛇岛以西的罗马尼亚边境（见地图）。其目的是让民用船只尽可能远离俄罗斯的枪支，并尽快让它们进入<small>北约</small>成员国罗马尼亚的领海，俄罗斯可能会犹豫是否要发动袭击。迄今为止，已有十艘船以这种方式抵达敖德萨，装载谷物并再次起航，尽管受到俄罗斯的威胁，没有发生任何事故。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一名乌克兰高级官员告诉<i>《经济学人》</i> ，情报显示俄罗斯正计划对民用航运发动袭击，试图破坏新的出口航线。俄罗斯军舰可以发射射程2500公里的导弹，这使得它们能够在安全距离内攻击货船。伦敦智库皇家联合军种研究所 ( <small>RUSI</small> ) 的西德哈斯·考沙尔 (Sidharth Kaushal) 表示，出于同样的原因，即使俄罗斯水面舰艇被迫远离，俄罗斯也可以使用潜艇布设水雷（尽管乌克兰人认为浅水区沿着新的出口路线将使这变得困难）。即使乌克兰以某种方式击沉了整个俄罗斯舰队，从克里米亚发射的导弹也可以轻松摧毁敖德萨附近一艘笨重的货船。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一位乌克兰官员指出，俄罗斯对乌克兰港口的袭击已经导致黑海沿岸的保险费上涨：“保险公司知道事情的发展方向。他们并不愚蠢。”但是，第一个补充道，“这个游戏可以两个人玩。”乌克兰警告称，如果俄罗斯袭击民用船只，它将以牙还牙。他说，它一直在展示其打击遥远海军目标的能力，不是为了让黑海战争升级，而是为了阻止俄罗斯这样做。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">两国的赌注都很高。战前，乌克兰约 60% 的出口通过黑海港口进行。此后，贸易量急剧萎缩，这既是因为俄罗斯的封锁，也是因为战争对农场、工厂和基础设施造成的更广泛破坏。即使在粮食计划实施期间，乌克兰的出口也只是以前的一小部分（见图表）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些失踪的书卷已被转移到多瑙河上的驳船上。乌克兰官员表示，目前他们每月可以通过这种方式出口超过 300 万吨谷物。另外 100 万吨通过火车出口，少量通过卡车出口。但这些替代方案都比在巨型货轮上堆放货物要慢得多，而且成本也高得多。例如，通过内河驳船出口一吨谷物的成本约为 120 美元，而通过海运出口则为 30-40 美元。俄罗斯也在轰炸新航线。更重要的是，乌克兰根本没有足够的公路、铁路和驳船能力来替代深海港口。其结果是对已经被战争摧毁的经济造成进一步打击，并导致不可持续借贷的政府进一步损失税收和外汇。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但俄罗斯也有很多损失。其80%以上的粮食出口和约30%的石油出口通过黑海港口。到目前为止，这些货物几乎没有受到战争的影响。俄罗斯在叙利亚的军事力量也依赖通过黑海运输的燃料和补给。如果海上战争范围扩大，这艘“叙利亚快车”可能会在乌克兰的潜在目标名单上名列前茅。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">克里米亚和惩罚</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了对俄罗斯经济造成严重伤害，乌克兰不需要击沉所有驶往俄罗斯的船只，而只需损坏足够多的船只，导致保险费飙升，俄罗斯港口变得缺乏商业吸引力。 “我们没有无人机来阻止所有俄罗斯贸易。但如果你问我们是否可以大幅增加财务风险？当然，没问题，”一位乌克兰官员说道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这不仅对俄罗斯不利，对全球食品市场也不利。战争初期，他们陷入了恐慌。毕竟，战争爆发时，俄罗斯和乌克兰的卡路里贸易量合计占全球卡路里贸易量的八分之一。 2021年，它们分别是全球第一和第五大小麦出口国，出口量分别为3900万吨和1700万吨，占全球贸易供应量的28%。两国还种植大量用于饲养动物的谷物，如玉米和大麦，并且是葵花籽的两大生产国，占据植物油市场 11.5% 的份额。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">几天之内，入侵导致小麦价格从两个月前的每蒲式耳 7 美元上涨至 12 美元以上；玉米价格升至十年来最高水平。这主要是因为俄罗斯封锁了乌克兰黑海港口。贸易商还担心战争和西方制裁可能会阻碍俄罗斯的出口。包括<i>《经济学人》</i>在内的许多人警告称，全球粮食短缺迫在眉睫。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管黑海局势升级的风险越来越大，但农产品市场现在平静得多。目前小麦的价格略高于每蒲式耳 5 美元，低于战争开始前的价格。事实上，价格在 2022 年夏季回落至战前水平，并一直保持在该水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这与其说是因为<small>联合国</small>恢复乌克兰粮食出口的协议，不如说是因为其他地方的丰收。农业不受西方制裁的俄罗斯在2022年收获了前所未有的1亿吨小麦。从巴西到印度，其他国家也获得了丰收。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今年看起来也很相似。由于谷物协议的废除，乌克兰的小麦产量比战前减少，其出口也大幅下降。但俄罗斯再次获得丰收，许多其他出口国也是如此。荷兰合作银行的卡洛斯·梅拉指出，去年农作物受到拉尼娜现象的威胁，拉尼娜现象是一种经常导致北半球大片谷物种植区减产的气候现象，而今年，相反的厄尔尼诺现象则预示着更多的农作物产量将下降。良性条件。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对黑海商业航运的袭击无疑会导致价格再次飙升。保险公司会提高费率或根本拒绝承保货物。粮食并不是唯一的受害者：每天通过黑海出口约 200 万桶石油和另外 100 万桶精炼石油产品。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但影响可能再次是短暂的。俄罗斯政府已经为许多停靠其港口的油轮投保，以帮助航运公司逃避西方制裁。对于其他出口也可以起到同样的作用。船舶跟踪公司 Kpler 的马修·赖特 (Matthew Wright) 表示，尽管紧张局势不断升级，受到西方压力，许多航运公司仍愿意运输俄罗斯货物。更重要的是，俄罗斯拥有非常密集的石油管道网络。它可能会将通常穿过黑海运输到波罗的海码头的大部分石油转移。 （精炼后的产品将更难以这种方式移动。）</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">战争与豌豆</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">通过公路将粮食从俄罗斯西部的农业中心地带运输到遥远的圣彼得堡、波罗的海或太平洋的码头将是缓慢且昂贵的。 （乌克兰已经很难在较短的距离内运输小得多的货物。）但俄罗斯在黑海和毗邻的亚速海拥有几个谷物码头，因此它可以利用不断变化的港口和航线来阻止货物进入俄罗斯。害之道。鉴于俄罗斯尽管拥有极其优越的海军和空军力量，但仍难以阻止乌克兰的粮食出口，因此很难想象乌克兰会扼杀俄罗斯的贸易。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">出于所有这些原因，咨询公司 Rystad Energy 的维克托·库里洛夫 (Viktor Kurilov) 认为，对商业航运的攻击可能会导致原油价格每桶仅上涨 5-7 美元，然后会比原本的价格上涨 1-2 美元。小麦市场可能会受到更严重的冲击，至少在一段时间内是这样。这并非没有痛苦：据<small>联合国</small>计算，去年粮食价格的短暂上涨导致全球面临严重饥饿的人数增加了 6500 万。但持久的灾难不太可能发生。 </p><div

e190yofl0">所有这一切的一个关键变量是土耳其的立场，土耳其实际上是黑海的看门人。根据一项名为《蒙特勒公约》的条约，土耳其有义务让商业航运不受阻碍地通过博斯普鲁斯海峡和达达尼尔海峡，这两个海峡是连接黑海和地中海的狭窄海峡。但该条约对过境军舰的数量和规模进行了限制。当黑海爆发战争时，土耳其有权阻止交战方派遣增援部队，并对非沿岸国家的军舰完全关闭该海峡。因此，当俄罗斯入侵乌克兰时，它禁止俄罗斯增援其黑海舰队，同时也阻止<small>北约</small>国家派遣舰艇，尽管它们本身也是北约成员国。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着粮食协议的破裂，土耳其面临着帮助阻止俄罗斯扼杀乌克兰贸易的压力。保加利亚和罗马尼亚这两个拥有黑海海岸线但海军实力相对较弱的<small>北约</small>成员国将欢迎联盟展示武力。一些乌克兰人呼吁西方海军护航队保护商业航运。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但土耳其不愿意允许任何增加更大范围战火风险并激怒俄罗斯的事情。通过骑墙观望，土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安赢得了俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京的宝贵让步。俄罗斯允许土耳其推迟支付俄罗斯天然气的部分款项，价值可能达数十亿美元，这一举措帮助埃尔多安在今年早些时候的选举前掩盖了其经济管理不善的规模。土耳其拒绝与其他<small>北约</small>成员国一起对俄罗斯实施严厉制裁也是有利可图的：去年两国之间的贸易额几乎翻了一番，达到 620 亿美元。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些分析人士怀疑，普京还向埃尔多安承诺，当土耳其的主要地区盟友阿塞拜疆于9月底从亚美尼亚叛乱分子手中夺取了对一个有争议省份的控制权时，派去执行停火的俄罗斯军队将袖手旁观。 “土耳其正在利用俄罗斯的弱点来获取让步，”博斯普鲁斯观察家咨询公司的负责人约鲁克·伊西克(Yoruk Isik)表示。他补充道：“只要继续获得它们，只要与俄罗斯的贸易继续下去，土耳其就会尽力不与俄罗斯对抗。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">俄罗斯同样不愿意破坏现状。如果俄罗斯攻击商业航运，埃尔多安允许<small>北约</small>船只进入黑海的压力将急剧增加。一种阻碍普京的想法可能是将埃尔多安推向不太宽松的境地。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这只是海上战争中双方都不可能完全获胜的另一种方式。乌克兰无人机将继续让俄罗斯难堪，但俄罗斯海军仍将对乌克兰城市和航运构成威胁。 <small>RUSI</small>的考沙尔先生认为，俄罗斯可能会将保险费推高，“无论乌克兰人会让塞瓦斯托波尔感到多么不舒服”。尽管海战永远不会成为战斗的主要焦点，但对令人震惊的爆发的担忧将永远挥之不去。

用户的工作世界。这将使微软能够吸引新客户并向他们收取更高的费用。反过来，这可能会推动微软高利润云业务 Azure 的业务发展，并可能帮助其超越亚马逊网络服务 ( <small>AWS</small> )，成为全球最大的云公司。它甚至可能帮助微软的估值高于当前的 2.3 万亿美元，从而有可能缩小与目前全球市值最高公司苹果公司的差距（见图 1）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伯恩斯坦经纪人马克·莫尔德勒 (Mark Moerdler) 认为，事实上，<small>人工智能</small>为微软提供了一个诱人的机会，可以做一些迄今为止一直未能实现的事情，并将其提供的所有功能整合在一起。如果 Microsoft 的视频会议服务 Teams 具有能够在 Outlook 中整理员工电子邮件并从 Word 文档和 PowerPoint 中调出信息的 Copilot，那么它可能比竞争对手 Zoom 对<small>IT</small>经理更有吸引力。所有这些魔法也可以通过 Azure 传递，进一步推动微软的业务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，微软还是下了一场豪赌。明年其资本支出预计将增加近五分之二，达到约 400 亿美元。这占该公司收入的 16% 接近创纪录的水平，比除 Facebook 母公司 Meta 之外的任何其他科技巨头都要高。其中大部分将用于新的<small>人工智能</small>芯片和高性能网络，以进入其计划上线的 120 多个额外数据中心。这样的投资是否会带来回报是一个悬而未决的问题。尽管副驾驶做出了所有承诺，但他们仍然面临很多问题。在雷德蒙德的演示中，<small>人工智能</small>生成的幻灯片将您的通讯员描述为“ <small>ABC</small>公司的<small>首席执行官</small>”，但他绝对不是。竞争对手，尤其是 Alphabet（谷歌的母公司），正在关注所有相同的市场。随着未来工作之争的白热化，微软的地位令人羡慕，但并非无懈可击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">将自己置于这个位置是经过长期努力的。微软的全盛时期是 20 世纪 90 年代。 Windows 作为操作系统的主导地位与残酷的商业心态相结合，使该公司变得强大但遭到全面鄙视。随后经历了一段停滞期，因为它依靠 Windows 的收入生存。 2014 年萨蒂亚·纳德拉 (Satya Nadella) 上任后，他彻底改变了现状。 Windows 将不再是公司的主要关注点。相反，该公司围绕 Azure 进行了重组，将 Office 等热门项目转向云。这涉及到数据中心的大规模扩建。微软的资本支出占收入的比例从 2014 年的 6% 上升到五年后的 11%。至关重要的是，该公司放弃了围墙花园的做法。纳德拉允许微软的软件在其他操作系统上运行，例如谷歌、苹果和Linux（Windows的开源竞争对手）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，微软也在投资<small>人工智能</small>。它于 2016 年首次宣布与 Open <small>AI</small>合作；此后，该公司已投资 130 亿美元，据报道持有 49% 的股份。该交易不仅允许微软使用Open <small>AI</small>的技术，还规定Open <small>AI</small>的模型和工具在Azure上运行，实际上使Open <small>AI</small>的客户成为微软的间接客户。这不仅仅是开放<small>人工智能</small>。自纳德拉接任以来，微软已经收购了 15 家<small>人工智能</small>相关公司。其中包括在 2022 年斥资 200 亿美元收购拥有尖端语音转文本技术的医疗保健公司 Nuance。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如今，微软的业务增长依赖于三个部门。第一个是蔚蓝。在过去的五年里，它一直在逼近<small>AWS</small> （见图 2）。随着<small>IT</small>经理紧缩开支，云支出正在放缓。尽管如此，最近一个季度的业务同比增长了27%。微软没有透露Azure的销售额，但分析师认为它约占该公司收入的四分之一，去年该公司收入达到2120亿美元。其云业务的毛利率也是秘密，但伯恩斯坦认为其高达 60% 左右。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次是 Microsoft 365，它也占收入的约四分之一。由于小型企业，尤其是餐馆等服务行业的采用，这一数字最近每年增长约 10%。第三个增长源是网络安全。微软高管在财报电话会议上表示，该公司的收入约为 200 亿美元（约占总收入的十分之一）。这比仅提供网络安全的五家最大公司的收入总和还要多。更重要的是，收入每年增长约 30%。 （由于英国反垄断监管机构已表示将批准以 690 亿美元收购另一家游戏制造商动视暴雪的交易，微软的视频游戏部门每年带来 150 亿美元的收入，也将大幅增长。）</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">蓝色微调器</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">使用Azure作为微软其他业务的底层基础设施有助于分摊成本、简化运营并提高利润。自 2014 年以来，营业利润率从 29% 上升至 43%，高于其他科技巨头（见图 3）。这让投资者兴奋不已。在纳德拉先生任职期间，微软的市值增长了约 2 万美元。微软的市盈率（反映投资者对未来利润的预期）在<small>纳德拉</small>执政期间增长了一倍多，达到 32。该比率高于<small>标准普尔</small>500 指数的平均水平，也高于除亚马逊之外的所有科技巨头。该公司的数字因其微薄的收入而受到扭曲。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">啦啦队人士表示，微软在生成<small>人工智能</small>方面有两大优势。首先是它销售的软件范围。要求单个聊天机器人仔细阅读电子邮件和电子表格以制作幻灯片放映比为每个程序处理不同的<small>人工智能</small>助手要容易得多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次，微软具有先发优势。由于与 Chat <small>GPT 的</small>合作，该公司部署<small>人工智能的</small>速度比竞争对手更快，也可能是因为纳德拉认为该公司对智能手机和云的反应缓慢。无论出于何种原因，微软的速度已经使开放<small>人工智能</small>成为尝试该技术的大公司的默认选择。摩根大通银行最近对<small>IT</small>经理进行的一项调查发现，未来三年他们预计 56% 的生成式<small>AI</small>支出将流向微软，而<small>AWS</small>的这一比例为 13%，谷歌云平台 ( <small>GCP</small> ) 的比例为 12% 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">风险投资公司红杉资本对其投资的 33 家初创公司进行的另一项调查发现，其中 90% 使用 Open <small>AI</small> 。摩根士丹利银行的 Keith Weiss 认为，围绕 Open <small>AI</small>的<small>GPT</small> -4 模型的生态系统正在开始形成。其中包括专门研究其工具并推荐客户使用这些工具的顾问，以及 HubSpot 等软件销售商，它们使用 Open <small>AI</small>的模型构建定制程序。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">有一些证据表明 Copilots 可以帮助巩固微软的领先地位。 2022 年 6 月，它在 GitHub 上推出了代码生成 Copilot，这是微软在 2018 年以 75 亿美元收购的代码存储库。该模型是使用 GitHub 上存储的大量代码进行训练的。它已迅速成为软件开发人员的必备工具。在一项调查中，90% 的用户告诉 GitHub，Copilot 提高了他们的工作效率。该公司还进行了一项小型研究，发现使用该工具时，程序员完成任务的速度提高了 55%。约有 27,000 家企业订阅了该服务，数量是三个月前的两倍。它在科技圈如此流行，以至于“副驾驶”一词已成为<small>人工智能</small>助手的简写，无论是否由微软提供。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">微软表示，测试 Copilot 的“生产力”软件（即电子邮件、电子表格、文字处理等）的公司也报告了类似的好处。电信公司 Lumen 的老板凯特·约翰逊 (Kate Johnson) 将其描述为员工工作方式的“阶跃功能变化”。她用它来回顾 Teams 会议，看看是否给安静的员工提供了发言的机会。它还可以即时记录并为与会者制定待办事项列表。约翰逊女士补充道，这有助于问责制：员工在上次会议后要完成的任务“就在那里，让每个人都可以看到”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">例如，副驾驶还可以充当软件教练，教员工如何在电子表格中插入图表。目标是他们最终能够了解用户的偏好，甚至他们的写作风格。纳德拉在 2017 年出版的《Hit Refresh》一书中写道：“我们希望有一天能够提供一个高效的另一个自我——一个深入了解你的代理人。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">所有这一切并不便宜。按照每位用户每月 30 美元的价格，Copilots 可能意味着 52-83% 的加价，具体取决于公司使用的软件包。研究公司 Gartner 的杰森·黄 (Jason Wong) 表示：“与许可证相比，这很昂贵，但如果能每周节省你的时间，那就便宜了。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">微软从 Copilots 赚钱的另一种方式是通过底层基础设施。 5 月份，它宣布在 Azure 上推出“Copilot Stack”。这使得开发人员可以轻松地在自己的应用程序中构建 Copilots 或为 Microsoft 的 Copilots 创建“插件”。希望许多公司使用此基础设施，向 Azure 发送更多业务。这种“平台”方法的另一个优点是，微软可能能够达成交易，使用 Azure 客户的数据，将法律专业知识引入 Word 文档或电子邮件中。伯恩斯坦的一份研究报告认为，这创造了一种“竞争对手将很难或不可能复制”的优势。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">锤头鲨</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今年第二季度，<small>人工智能</small>为微软的云收入增加了约 1.2 亿美元。预计本季度将翻一番。 Weiss 估计，到 2025 年，<small>人工智能</small>可以使收入增加 400 亿美元，这主要是通过 Azure 的<small>人工智能</small>工具和 365 的 Copilots 实现的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这样的增长并不便宜。股票市场分析师公司 New Street Research 认为，微软是全球最大的<small>人工智能</small>芯片销售商英伟达的最大客户。其研究表明，微软在 2023 年第二季度在 Nvidia 的<small>AI</small>芯片上花费了约 30 亿美元，高于第一季度的约 10 亿美元。在 7 月份与投资者的电话会议中，首席财务官艾米·胡德 (Amy Hood) 指出，<small>人工智能</small>的发展正在给微软云计算领域的浮夸利润带来压力。她说，这可以通过更高效的数据处理来抵消。微软云和<small>人工智能</small>主管 Scott Guthrie 表示：“我们看到推理成本（与向<small>人工智能</small>模型提出问题相关的成本）正在下降，并期望看到这种情况继续下去，模型变得更加准确和高效。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使不断上升的成本得到控制，仍然存在许多其他风险。竞争已经白热化。一场争夺价值 3400 亿美元的商业软件市场的战争。 5 月，谷歌发布了 Duet for Workspace，它的 Copilots 版本。上周，该公司发布了允许其聊天机器人 Bard 访问用户 Gmail 收件箱和 Google 文档的功能。软件巨头Salesforce有爱因斯坦。 Slack 是一款消息应用程序，也是 Salesforce 的子公司之一，拥有 Slack <small>GPT</small> 。 ServiceNow 的软件可以帮助公司管理他们的工作流程，它有 Now Assist。 Zoom 提供 Zoom Companion。 Intuit 正在销售 Intuit Assist。 Adept 和 Cohere 等初创公司也提供<small>人工智能</small>助手。 Open <small>AI</small>于 8 月推出了面向企业的 Chat <small>GPT</small> 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">提供支撑此类<small>人工智能</small>产品的基础设施将是另一个战场。 <small>AWS</small>和<small>GCP</small>都提供对类似于 Open <small>AI</small>的<small>AI</small>模型的访问。分析师怀疑这些竞争对手在部署专业<small>人工智能</small>芯片方面比微软拥有更多经验。八月，谷歌推出了一款用于训练大型模型的新型<small>人工智能</small>芯片。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t

Rowe Price 的 Ken Allen 表示，包括 Copilots 在内的所有生成式<small>人工智能</small>工具都必须“为企业做好准备”。其中一个问题是合法的。大多数<small>人工智能</small>模型都是根据受版权保护的材料进行训练的，用户可能会无意中复制这些材料。一家大型石油和天然气服务公司的<small>IT</small>负责人表示，在公司于 11 月份因侵犯版权而被起诉后，他阻止员工使用 GitHub 的 Copilot。微软方面已同意支付客户与其副驾驶相关的法律费用，前提是他们使用微软的安全功能，例如内容过滤器。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">模型也可能出错。微软通过对他们进行准确、最新信息的培训以及增加引用来减少此类问题。但这并不妨碍<small>本报记者晋升为首席执行官</small>。负责微软生产力软件的 Jared Spataro 表示，Copilots 带来了一种“全新的工作方式”，机器可以帮助你生产更多的东西，“但它并不总是正确的”。人类必须对此保持警惕，并在必要时进行纠正。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第三个问题是数据治理——确保只有合适的员工才能访问正确的信息。 An analyst notes that some early users of Copilots are discovering “really scary” results. Imagine personnel files or confidential emails coming up in a search, say.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is also the near-certainty that Microsoft will be accused of abusing its market power. (Endless competition headaches plagued its previous period of ascendancy, in the late 1990s.) The firm is already fighting on many fronts. In August it announced that it would “unbundle” Teams from its software packages, after complaints from Slack triggered an <small>EU</small> investigation. Customers have also complained about the way Microsoft&#39;s software licences nudge companies to use Azure, rather than <small>AWS</small> and <small>GCP</small> . Brad Smith, Microsoft&#39;s president, has called this a “valid concern” and the firm says it has made changes. But in June Google submitted comments to a probe by America&#39;s Federal Trade Commission, claiming that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in clients”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These types of disputes will no doubt intensify as <small>AI</small> -powered software becomes prevalent. If a Windows Copilot steers users to Outlook rather than Gmail, say, trustbusters may cry foul. The upshot of this could be to weaken Microsoft&#39;s ability to use a breadth of software offerings to make Copilots more useful, one of its big competitive advantages.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even so, Microsoft is in a strong position. It failed to seize on the advent of smartphones and was slow to grasp the potential of the cloud. Today it finds itself poised to exploit a technology that could transform the world of work. It must maintain a delicate balance, moving faster than competitors while ensuring that its advance into <small>ai</small> does not upset regulators, sap profits or ruffle clients. If it slips, plenty of rivals are ready to take its place. But if it succeeds, the reward will be huge. The Copilot will be the captain of its fortunes. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 18:27:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4faffuah59d4el3mb71mfc4bt67a2pr8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/27/how-microsoft-could-supplant-apple-as-the-worlds-most-valuable-firm </item><item><title><![CDATA[Western help for Ukraine is likely to diminish next year]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Ukraine%20and%20the%20West-1b5f0cd51f99f30c3e14c553e42eaefb-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he end</small> keeps receding. There was a time when some Ukrainian officials, having halted Russia&#39;s army outside Kyiv, thought it would take only a few more months to bring the war to a conclusion. “Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year,” predicted Lieutenant-General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of military intelligence, in May 2022. By last November, shortly after a spectacular Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defence minister at the time, was still expecting a swift victory. “My feeling is that by the end of the spring, this war will be over.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact, Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive did not even begin until June. Far from hastening the war&#39;s end, it has demonstrated just how long the fighting could drag on. Ukrainian forces, stymied by Russian minefields and other defences, have inched forward on foot. The deployment of reserves and spiffy Western weapons has not yet yielded any big breakthroughs. Wet weather and a shortage of ammunition will probably bring the Ukrainian advance, such as it is, to a halt by late October, if not earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another fighting season beckons. “We must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,” warned Jens Stoltenberg, <small>NATO</small> ’s secretary-general, on September 17th. “It&#39;ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine,” agreed Mark Milley, America&#39;s top general, the same day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America insists it will stay the course for “as long as it takes”, as Joe Biden, the president, has put it several times this year. Britain, France, Germany and other allies have all used the same phrase. As ironclad as these pledges sound, they depend on two uncertain variables. One is the West&#39;s ability to furnish Ukraine&#39;s army with enough weapons and ammunition. The other is the political will to keep handing them over.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the first. Russia&#39;s defence industry moved onto a war footing in the last quarter of 2022, says Richard Connolly, an expert on Russia&#39;s economy, who points to a big jump in steel production. British officials say that Russia can now produce around 200 tanks a year, twice as many as they had previously assumed. Mr Connolly says that, with refurbished tanks included, the true figure is probably 500 to 800. Western sanctions are not crimping output much, he adds, with crucial components such as semiconductors smuggled in via Hong Kong or Central Asia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In principle, Ukraine&#39;s friends should have no trouble helping it outgun Russia. The combined <small>GDP</small> of <small>nato</small> ’s members is 12 times that of Russia, even after accounting for Russia&#39;s lower prices. The difference is that Russia is willing to spend much more heavily on the war: military spending now takes up almost 40% of the national budget, far in excess of Western levels. <small>NATO</small> countries are trying to redress this imbalance by investing in arms production, which has been neglected since the cold war ended. But there are two snags.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One is cost. Estonia spends around $5,000 to $6,000 on every new artillery shell, says Kusti Salm, the senior civil servant in the country&#39;s defence ministry. That is relatively cheap by <small>NATO</small> standards, he notes. Russia, he says, spends 60,000 roubles, or around $620. The vast difference is largely down to cheaper labour and materials, lower quality products and lower profit margins for arms manufacturers, most of which are state-owned. Inflation is exacerbating the problem. “Prices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up,” complained Admiral Rob Bauer, a <small>nato</small> bigwig, on September 16th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second issue is timing. “After a slow start,” says Mr Connolly, “Russia has reached race pace and they&#39;re in gear now. They&#39;re now going to start churning stuff out at the rate approximating what they need.” American and European investments in new capacity, having started later, will not yield much extra supply until the second half of 2024 or 2025, giving Russia more time to mobilise, build new defences and pin down Ukrainian forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take the case of artillery shells. The good news is that American and European production is soaring. American officials say that their own output has risen from an annualised rate of 168,000 shells in the spring to 336,000 today. It will continue to rise, thanks both to new facilities and to more intensive use of existing ones. European production is set to double by the end of this year or the start of next, according to Estonia&#39;s defence minister. Between them, America and Europe should comfortably produce nearly 2m shells next year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shell shock</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trouble is, that is barely enough to keep up. Russia will produce 1m-2m shells next year, according to British estimates. That is on top of a stock of around 5m shells, new and refurbished. That should allow it to fire at least 15,000 rounds a day for a year, says Mr Salm. That is roughly on a par with Ukraine&#39;s heightened consumption during its counter-offensive, according to people familiar with the data. But Ukraine can probably sustain that tempo for only a couple more months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The gap could be bridged by borrowing from elsewhere. Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive was enabled by a massive transfusion of South Korean shells. America and its allies have discreetly purchased arms and ammunition from non-aligned countries such as Egypt and Pakistan on Ukraine&#39;s behalf. But such ready sources of weaponry are running out. Western armies&#39; stockpiles have been depleted, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the Western arms industry ramps up, this problem should ease. By 2025 there might even be a “glut” of shells, says a Western official. If most of the new output goes to Ukraine, and assuming that neither China nor North Korea bails out Russia, the Ukrainian army might then be able to out-pulverise the Russian army for the first time in the conflict. But 2025 is the military equivalent of a lifetime away. Next year, meanwhile, Ukraine will probably struggle to mount a big offensive.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The year after next is also a lifetime away in terms of politics. In Europe, the political winds seem favourable to Ukraine. Polls conducted in June and July showed that 64% of Europeans favour military aid to Ukraine, with strong support not just in countries with a long-standing suspicion of Russia, such as Sweden (93%), but also in more distant member states such as Portugal (90%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some hard-right parties, such as France&#39;s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and Germany&#39;s Alternative for Germany ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ), cast the conflict as a waste of European resources. “The German public is paying three times over for this war,” complains Gunnar Lindemann, an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> member of Berlin&#39;s regional assembly, “supporting 1m refugees, carrying huge energy bills and sending weapons to Ukraine.” Both parties are rising in the polls, but both remain far from power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Olaf Scholz, Germany&#39;s chancellor, has been mindful of anti-war sentiment, notably within his own Social Democratic Party. He dithered for months before agreeing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. He still refuses to send long-range Taurus missiles, even though Britain and France have given Ukraine comparable weapons. Yet Mr Scholz has by now realised that public scepticism is mushy: as soon as he sends a new weapon, approval broadly follows. On September 18th his government announced another €400m ($429m) of arms, including ammunition, armoured vehicles and mine-clearing equipment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Emmanuel Macron, France&#39;s president, who provoked grumbling in Kyiv last year over his frequent phone calls with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, and over his hesitation in sending weapons, is now among the most gung-ho of European leaders. France has long resisted expanding the <small>EU</small> , yet Mr Macron has become a fervent supporter of Ukraine&#39;s accession to the bloc. A poll in July showed that 58% of the French backed this approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s bid for <small>eu</small> membership is proceeding at a pace that would have astonished Europe-watchers just a few years ago. It formally became a candidate to join in June, 2022. This December, barring a shock, that status will be upgraded by the opening of detailed negotiations on accession. Ukraine is dazzling <small>EU</small> officials with its swift progress on the necessary reforms. It may still take years for Ukraine to become a fully fledged member, but the war seems to be speeding up the process rather than delaying it. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives at Skrydstrup Airbase in Denmark" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Now for Congress to get on board</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: EPA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In America, however, the outlook is much more divided and uncertain. On August 10th the White House asked Congress to authorise another $24bn “supplemental” budget for Ukraine, which would bring total American aid thus far to $135bn. Supporters of such assistance, among both Democrats and Republicans, constitute a clear majority of both chambers of Congress. Were the request put to a simple up-or-down vote, it would be approved relatively easily.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is unlikely to be, because of America&#39;s dysfunctional politics. A majority of the members of the House of Representatives may support Ukraine, but a small number of Republicans hold extreme anti-Ukrainian views, including Matt Gaetz, who has proposed inviting Russia to join <small>NATO</small> , and Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conspiracy theorist who has promoted the absurd notion that aid to Ukraine is actually being siphoned off by donors to the Democrats. Since the Republicans have only a slender majority in the House and since the Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, does not want to rely on Democratic votes to push legislation through, the pro-Russia fringe has much more influence than its numbers would imply.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The likeliest course is for Mr McCarthy to attach the supplemental budget to other important legislation, making it harder to derail. Past efforts in the House to deny Ukraine funding have been overcome, although each one attracts more Republican votes. Mr Biden already has congressional approval to send a further $6bn-worth of weapons to Ukraine from existing stockpiles. But after that there is likely to be a delay of several months while Congress contorts itself over the latest request. What emerges may be dribs and drabs of aid, rather than the big packages of last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the longer run, aid for Ukraine is fast becoming a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain. Republican voters, egged on by the scepticism of Donald Trump, their party&#39;s likeliest nominee for president next year, have begun to question further aid to Ukraine. Democrats remain broadly supportive. The big budget deficit and high interest rates make politicians of all parties reluctant to rack up more debt. And even Democrats support the notion that America&#39;s European allies should be the ones taking the initiative in conflicts on their own borders.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And then there is the possibility that Mr Trump wins next year&#39;s election. His policy on Ukraine is characteristically incoherent. In March he promised that he would settle the war in “no longer than one day”, before even entering office. “We don&#39;t have ammunition for ourselves,” he complained in May, “We&#39;re giving away so much.” But he denies he would push for a deal allowing Mr Putin to keep Ukrainian territory. “Nobody was tougher on Russia than me,” he said this week, insisting he would strike “a fair deal for everybody”. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Nevertheless, Western officials worry that Mr Putin will wait to see whether Mr Trump becomes president again before agreeing to negotiations. That scenario is already provoking frenetic debate in Europe. “If the United States tried to force a negotiated settlement on Ukraine,” argued Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage, a pair of Russia experts, in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> recently, “Europeans would have little capacity to resist.” Others say this is unduly fatalistic. French officials argue that, should America end its support for Ukraine, although Europe cannot replace American military aid gun for gun and missile for missile, the prudent and rational thing is for Europe to try to preserve its options by boosting arms manufacturing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The question is whether Europe alone can drum up enough cash and weapons to keep Ukraine going. Although America provided the lion&#39;s share of aid for much of the war, the latest analysis from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, finds this pattern has reversed. Europeans have long dispensed more financial aid. They are now providing more aid of all sorts, thanks in part to the <small>EU</small> ’s recent €50bn pledge, a multi-year commitment which stretches to 2027 (see chart).</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Money isn&#39;t everything</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the figures do not tell the whole story. America has been the fulcrum of the allied effort to support Ukraine, chairing the regular meetings at which donations of weapons are pledged and co-ordinated at Ramstein, an American military base in Germany. It has provided diplomatic cover for other countries&#39; aid: Mr Scholz, for instance, insisted that he would not allow German-made Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine unless Mr Biden first sent some American <small>M</small> 1 <small>A</small> 1 Abrams tanks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In some cases Europeans have sent arms to Ukraine on the understanding that they will receive new American weapons to replace the donated ones. America&#39;s security guarantees, underwritten by nuclear weapons, have given Europeans the confidence to stand up to Russian threats. Finally, America has provided vital intelligence that has helped Ukraine find and destroy high-value targets, from generals to warships. Substituting for this organisation and assistance would be a Herculean task.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may be unavoidable. “The assumption of the West was—and I think everyone has been unspoken on this—was that we give them everything we can, then they will go on this one large offensive and whatever happens at the end of this we will settle for that,” says Mr Salm, the Estonian official. “That was the plan.” A new one is required, he suggests, involving not just more arms, but also more technology to offset Russia&#39;s advantages in mass, bolder sanctions, such as expulsion from the Paris Olympics, and new training that learns from the mistakes of the summer.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Above all, a change in mentality is needed. “This is exactly what a war of attrition is about: convince the West that we can out-suffer you, we can out-fight you, we can out-last you. They know the weak points of democracies,” Mr Salm says. The task, he believes, is to persuade Mr Putin that the opposite is true. “We, as the Ramstein coalition, are 25 times richer, stronger and [more] technologically advanced than Russia…It&#39;s not that we are empty-pocketed here.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:38:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/e4olb392cfef30qkihtvtnms801edpp4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year </item><item><title><![CDATA[To endure a long war, Ukraine is remaking its army, economy and society]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Ukraine-33237edecb896a72ccd71824180b0500.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>n the autumn</small> sunshine Kyiv looks glorious. The leafy streets are full of life: café terraces bustle and hipsters throng the bars of Podil, a trendy neighbourhood. The odd air-raid siren aside, the main signs of the 18-month-old war with Russia are rusty tanks turned into makeshift war memorials and the various men in uniform enjoying some leave with their loved ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#39;s top soldier, the scenes of children eating ice cream and men presenting flowers to their sweethearts are satisfying. “This is what we are fighting for. I just want people to have a normal life in the whole of Ukrainian territory,” he says. The critical word is “whole”: Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive has not yet produced the results he and others had hoped for. Russian lines have not crumbled. Almost a fifth of Ukrainian territory remains in Russia&#39;s hands. In the war of attrition that looms, it is not clear which side has more staying power. In part, of course, that depends on a second uncertainty: in what quantities the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year">military and financial support</a> supplied by Ukraine&#39;s allies will keep flowing as the war grinds on.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A break in the clouds</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For all its superficial normality, Kyiv is awash with apprehension. Ukrainians know that Russia has been stockpiling missiles and drones to attack their energy infrastructure when temperatures drop. They know that the supply of volunteers has dried up, and that men are being conscripted to replace casualties at the front. And they know no end is in sight: a year ago 50% of them thought it would be over within a year. Now only 34% believe that. Whereas Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s dictator, does not care about the lives of his own troops, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine&#39;s president, presides over a democratic society which does. “It is not just about de-occupation [at any cost]. It&#39;s about de-occupation, but not losing a lot of lives,” he recently told <i>The Economist</i> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The prospect of an attenuated struggle has started to seep into Mr Zelensky&#39;s speeches. “We need to learn to live with [the conflict],” he told Ukrainians recently.  “It depends on what kind of war. We are prepared to keep fighting for a very long period of time…[while] minimising the number of casualties. Like in Israel, for example. We can live like that.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A war of endurance, however, will require big changes in military planning, the economy and society more broadly. The heroic improvisation and decentralisation of the early part of the war will no longer suffice. On the military side, Mr Zelensky has initiated a clear shift by installing a new minister of defence, Rustem Umerov. Like almost all Ukrainians, he has a personal stake in the war, as a Crimean Tatar, an ethnic group persecuted for Ukrainian sympathies since Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea in 2014. But, he says, “Ukraine is not about emotions, it is about a system, logistics and industries.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Umerov, a 41-year-old former entrepreneur and investor, says his mission is to build the capacity of both Ukraine&#39;s defence industry and its soldiers, so that Western allies see Ukraine not as a dependent always begging for aid, but as a partner, capable of shaping its own fortune. His previous job was managing the government&#39;s property portfolio, and he wants to bring an efficient managerial mindset to his new role. Red tape must be eliminated. “Anything that can be digitised, needs to be digitised,” he says. He is not afraid to make waves: after two weeks in the job, he replaced six of his seven deputies.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> An explosive legacy</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When it was part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had a vast defence industry. Some 1.5m Ukrainians laboured in 700 military enterprises, including 205 factories and 130 research and development sites. Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine&#39;s second president, ran the world&#39;s biggest rocket plant in the city of Dnipro in Soviet times. A flagship factory in Kharkiv produced 900 tanks a year. But corruption and neglect after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 gradually killed these businesses.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Now Ukraine is rebuilding its arms industry almost from scratch. “Anything that can be produced locally, must be produced locally,” Mr Umerov insists. In part that involves reforming state enterprises, the job of Oleksandr Kamyshin, a former investment banker who used to run the state railway company and follows Western management fads. “The first hundred days of the war were about bravery. The next 1,000 days are about steeliness,” he declares. In June, three months after his appointment, Ukraine produced as many shells as it had in the entire previous year. In July it reached double that, Mr Kamyshin says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Umerov wants to encourage private arms manufacturers, which account for only 20-30% of the local industry. He says he is prepared to pay local firms in advance if they can demonstrate their ability to make useful kit. Many are struggling with a dearth of capable managers: the defence ministry is offering to help bring such people back from the front lines. Within five years, Mr Kamyshin predicts, private firms will produce 80% of local output.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One focus is on drones. Ukraine&#39;s output of them has grown exponentially, albeit from a tiny base. “We will [produce] 120 to 150 times more drones than we did last year,” says Mykhailo Fedorov, the 32-year-old minister for digital transformation, who is co-ordinating the effort. The number of local firms in the business has risen from seven in December to 70 now, the vast majority of them private. To encourage this growth the government has eliminated tariffs on imported components and is buying drones at prices that allow margins of as much as 25%. “We can win in a technological war,” says Mr Fedorov. “We are getting help from countries with large economies and a greater level of freedom. Technologies like freedom and they like mobility. We have both.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Kamyshin wants Western military contractors to start localising their production, too. <small>BAE</small> Systems, a British defence firm which makes lots of weapons supplied to Ukraine, has set up a local subsidiary, hoping to produce <small>L</small> 119 and <small>M</small> 777 howitzers, which are both in wide use at the front. Rheinmetall, Germany&#39;s biggest arms manufacturer, is already repairing Leopard tanks in Ukraine and plans to open an armoured-vehicle factory soon. As Armin Papperger, its <small>CEO</small> , told <small>CNN</small> , “[Ukrainians] have to help themselves. If they always have to wait [for] Europeans or Americans [to] help them over the next ten or 20 years…that is not possible.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Protecting such factories from Russian attacks will require ingenuity. “We will not have one Soviet-style hypergiant plant but many smaller plants spread across the country,” says Mr Kamyshin. Drones are proof of what is possible: Ukraine&#39;s surging output of reconnaissance devices, Mr Fedorov says, has helped give it parity with Russia&#39;s forces. Production of longer-range ones, which can hit targets in Crimea and deep inside Russia, is also growing. “It is an important historical moment,” he says, “when we are not simply receiving aid and hoping [that it will not run out] but when we are taking responsibility for our own lives in our own hands and starting to form our own capability.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s growing drone industry also allows its armed forces to adopt new tactics, by taking the war inside Russia. One aim is to hit military factories in an effort to disrupt whole supply chains. Recent examples include an attack on a facility that produces decalin, a fuel additive essential for rockets, and a plant that makes circuitry for Kinzhal and Iskander missiles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second aim is psychological: to shatter the facade of normality the Kremlin tries to preserve, particularly in big cities such as Moscow. Airports there have had to suspend flights for brief spells almost daily in recent weeks owing to drone attacks on the city. (Mr Kamyshin says he would like to set up a shop selling <small>T</small> -shirts with the slogan “Moscow never sleeps”.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine also has a third goal in its strikes on Russian infrastructure: to deter Russian attacks on its own infrastructure. Since Russia withdrew in July from a deal allowing exports of grain from Ukraine&#39;s ports on the Black Sea, it has been bombarding those and other export routes and threatening ships calling at Ukrainian ports. Ukraine&#39;s exports have halved as a result, doing yet more damage to an already stricken economy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine is trying to break the Russian blockade. Last month it established a new sea route, hugging the western coast of the Black Sea close to Romania and Bulgaria. If Ukraine can protect it, it could raise its exports to some 70% of pre-war levels. On September 17th, two ships docked at the port of Chornomorsk near Odessa to load almost 20,000 tonnes of wheat. Hours later Russia unleashed a barrage of drones and missiles at other nearby ports.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A sea change</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukrainian strategists hope that, if they can threaten Russian ports on the Black Sea and strike at the military bases from which attacks on Ukrainian ports are launched, they may be able to keep Ukraine&#39;s exports afloat. Earlier this month Ukrainian missiles damaged a submarine, a ship and port facilities at a Russian naval base in Crimea. It had decent air defences, but more distant Russian facilities may not be as protected.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The focus on protecting exports reflects a sense among Ukrainian officials that the economy will also need a drastic overhaul to cope with a long war. Ukraine received $31bn in financial aid last year and is on course to receive even more this year. But Serhiy Marchenko, the finance minister, assumes that such largesse will not be forthcoming indefinitely.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile, military spending has leapt from 5% of <small>GDP</small> before the war to 26% this year. Even if the fighting stopped, spending might not drop much. General Zaluzhny says, “I want the Ukrainian army to be so strong that Russia does not even dare to look in our direction.” The shrunken economy is too small to generate sufficient tax revenue to pay for Ukraine&#39;s security, Mr Marchenko notes, so the government will have to help it grow by improving the business climate and fostering industry.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main concern for investors, says Mr Marchenko, is not physical security but the unreliable legal system, a problem that predates the war. Similarly, it is corruption rather than the damage done by the war to Ukraine&#39;s infrastructure that most Ukrainians see as the main obstacle to recovery. The independent corruption-fighting investigators, prosecutors and courts that Ukraine has put in place are making progress, but the broader judicial system remains inefficient and unpredictable.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Perhaps the worst injury that the war has inflicted on the economy has been to prompt an exodus of 7m Ukrainians—nearly 20% of the pre-war population of 37m people. More than two-thirds are women, since men of fighting age are barred from leaving the country. The working-age population has shrunk from 16.7m in 2021 to 12.4m this year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The call of the placid</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To lure people back, the government is offering startup grants for businesses and subsidised mortgages for those rebuilding homes. But many of the departed have settled in richer, more stable places in the <small>EU</small> , found jobs and put their children in school. They are unlikely to want more upheaval and they may see more opportunity for themselves and their children in their new homes, whatever the security situation in Ukraine. A recent survey found that about half of those who have moved to Germany, at least, intend to stay there for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is not just an economic cost to the exodus, but a social one as well. According to Olena Zelenska, Mr Zelensky&#39;s wife, who heads a government mental-health initiative, there has already been a rise in the number of divorces “because women and children are abroad and men are here”. Mr Zelensky says there is a real risk that a war of attrition could accelerate an outflow of people from Ukraine, creating further economic problems and widening the gap between those who left and those who have stayed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is not the only source of social tension. Roman Hasko, a lieutenant from the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade, who volunteered in the first week of the war, says he feels disappointed to see the bustle of night-time Kyiv, having just arrived on leave from the front line near Bakhmut. “I see a lot of potential recruits. I have many free positions in my unit. Not all have been killed—some are wounded or sick…If we are talking about winning this war, these empty lines need to be filled.” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">In the first weeks of the war men like Mr Hasko queued up to enlist. Now Ukraine is filling the ranks through conscription. Some young men who have not yet been called up are nervous about leaving home or passing checkpoints for fear of being dragooned. Many try to bribe their way out of military service and to leave the country illegally. Last month Mr Zelensky sacked the heads of all the regional military recruitment centres. He replaced them with soldiers with battlefield experience who had been vetted by intelligence services. Earlier this month the Ministry of Defence drastically cut the number of medical exemptions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukrainians clearly have some concerns about how the country is being run. Approval of the army and the president remain sky high, but confidence in the country&#39;s politicians in general is down from 60% in December to 44% in June. The share of Ukrainians who say the country is on the right track has also slipped (see chart). There is disquiet about corruption in particular.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But 76% tell pollsters they do not want new elections until the war is over. Support for Ukraine&#39;s independence is the highest it has ever been, at 82%. Most do not complain about restrictions on movement or other wartime curtailment of civil liberties. “War has become part of a new horrific normal,” says Darina Solodova, a sociologist with the United Nations Development Programme in Kyiv.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Resistance to Russia&#39;s aggression remains a unifying principle for the vast majority. “It is not the question of whether to resist or not, but who has done more or less for that resistance,” says Ms Solodova. Across Ukraine 42% say that even if Russia intensifies its bombing of cities Ukraine should keep fighting. Some 21% think that the conflict should be frozen without making any concessions to Russia. Only 23% think it is worth initiating negotiations. Even in the east and south, which have borne the brunt of the war, support for negotiations is relatively low, at 32% and 39% respectively. Only 5% of Ukrainians are willing to cede any territory to Russia and only 18% to forswear joining <small>NATO</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Research by the Centre for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development, a think-tank in Cyprus, suggests that Ukrainians have become more optimistic about the future despite the war. Most believe that future generations will be better off. Ms Zelenska is not surprised: “People know what they are fighting for, not just what against.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:14:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ppv93sn16mkmpo0os26ioqogg623s8kn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/to-endure-a-long-war-ukraine-is-remaking-its-army-economy-and-society </item><item><title><![CDATA[The hard right is getting closer to power all over Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Europe_s%20hard%20right-3da6c3966e318901bdd99c67b92e03ad.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>N SINT-GENESIUS-RODE</small> , a well-to-do commuter town in the hills south of Brussels, a crowd of 50 or so gathered on September 2nd in a parish hall to drink champagne and promote the dismemberment of Belgium. The meeting was organised by Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest), a right-wing party that rails against such threats to the Flemish way of life as Islam, immigration and—most pernicious of all—the French language. The town is in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking half of Belgium), but French-speakers have been moving in for decades and are now the majority. The only way to stop the rot, explains Klaas Slootmans, a member of the Flemish regional parliament from Vlaams Belang, is for Flanders to declare independence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may sound parochial, chauvinist and disruptive if not delusional, but it goes down well. People have a right “to be the boss in their own country”, Mr Slootmans proclaims; the crowd applauds. Vlaams Belang is Belgium&#39;s most popular party, with an average of 22% support in recent polling. Barring a sudden reversal, it should triumph in simultaneous elections next year for the national, European and regional parliaments. Other Belgian parties have hitherto declared it too extreme to do business with, and refused to include it in coalitions. But this so-called <i>cordon sanitaire</i> may have to be abandoned if the party wins a fifth or more of parliamentary seats. Anyway, the ostracism may in fact be helping Vlaams Belang. Its support has tripled over the past five years.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The right moment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a common pattern. Across much of Europe, populist right-wing parties like Vlaams Belang, once relegated to the fringe, are going from strength to strength. In Hungary, Italy and Poland they hold power. In Finland, Sweden and Switzerland they have a share of it. In Germany polls put the <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/germanys-rampant-hard-right-afd-puts-other-parties-in-a-fix">Alternative for Germany</a> ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ) party at 22%, up from 10% in the election in 2021. In France the National Rally ( <small>RN</small> ), the biggest hard-right party, has 24% support. Add in 5% for Reconquest, another anti-immigrant party, and the hard right becomes the biggest voting block in the country. In the Netherlands, too, a smattering of right-wing populists claim a quarter or more of the vote. Even newish democracies that for decades lacked big nationalist parties—Portugal, Romania and Spain—now have them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The advance of the hard right is neither uniform nor one-way. Support for populist nationalists has recently slumped in Denmark and Spain, for instance. Nor are all these parties the same: some are eager Atlanticists, others pro-Russian; some are libertarian, others want a more generous welfare state, albeit only for people of native stock. What is more, hard-right groups tend to mellow the closer they get to power, or to splinter, or both. The government of Italy, for one, although led by the Brothers of Italy ( <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> ), a party with links to fascism, has proved much more moderate than many had feared. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Nonetheless, the trend is alarming, for three reasons. First, it is remarkably broad. Four of the five most populous countries in the European Union have hard-right parties either in government or polling above 20% (see map). Second, the current circumstances are especially propitious for populist parties, with immigration rising after a hiatus during the pandemic, inflation high and the growing cost of climate policy creating a potent new focus for popular ire. Third, and most important, the hard right does not need to win power to have a baleful impact on politics. Simply by attracting a big share of voters, it is already skewing the debate, and so making it harder for European governments to adopt sensible policies on pressing problems, such as the war in Ukraine, immigration and climate change.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Freedom fighters</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When the Freedom Party, Austria&#39;s main hard-right outfit, joined a coalition government in 2000, other <small>EU</small> governments were so horrified that they reduced contact with Austria&#39;s to the bare minimum in protest. To no avail: the hard right has since broken through barrier after barrier. It first led a government in 2010, when Fidesz, a once-centrist outfit that had taken a populist turn, swept to power in Hungary. Those who said the same thing could never happen in mature democracies in western Europe were proved wrong last year when <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> took power in Italy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">More milestones loom. Hard-right parties are expected to do well in next year&#39;s European elections. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> and prime minister of Italy, is trying to persuade the centre-right alliance in the European Parliament, the European People&#39;s Party ( <small>EPP</small> ), to join forces with the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists ( <small>ECR</small> ), which she heads. That would move the legislature of all of the <small>EU</small> in a populist direction. In France, meanwhile, the hard right&#39;s performance is improving at each presidential election (see chart). It is possible that Marine Le Pen, the runner-up at the past two contests, may win the next one, in 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A series of external factors are helping to propel support for the hard right. Illegal immigration, which spurred support for populist parties when it surged in 2015, is growing again after a lull during the pandemic. There have already been more than 165,000 unauthorised arrivals in Europe this year, as many as in all of last year, although still well below the level of 2015. Populists also tend to do well in times of economic upheaval, and so are benefiting from the high inflation that has plagued Europe for the past two years, and especially from soaring energy prices.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Expensive petrol, heating and electricity have helped foment a backlash against policies to fight climate change, which the hard right has seized on. This began in France with the <i>gilets jaunes</i> movement in late 2018, initially a protest against a carbon-tax hike on motor fuel. The <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s rise this year was touched off by a proposed government ban on oil and gas boilers in homes. In the Netherlands the Farmer-Citizen Movement ( <small>BBB</small> ), a new populist party, began as a farmers&#39; protest against nitrogen-emission limits. It won an astounding 20% of the vote in regional elections in March.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There has also been a broader slide in trust in government in many European countries, after a brief resurgence during the pandemic, to the benefit of the hard right. American-style culture wars are becoming fiercer, too, which, again, helps the populists. Maximilian Krah, the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s lead candidate in the European elections, went viral over the summer with dating advice posted on TikTok: “Real men are right-wing. Don&#39;t watch porn.” In other videos Mr Krah argues that “multicultural means multi-criminal”, bemoans rainbow flags and warns that BlackRock, an investment firm, wants to replace Germans with “minorities and immigrants”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The European politician most adept at exploiting such ideas to win and hold power is Viktor Orban, Fidesz&#39;s leader and the prime minister of Hungary since 2010. He readily bashes migrants, gay people and the <small>EU</small> as at odds with homespun Hungarian values. He has used the parliamentary majorities he has won with such talk to pack the courts with loyalists and gerrymander the electoral system. Cronies have bought up critical media outlets. In addition to undermining democracy at home, Mr Orban&#39;s rule has scrambled policymaking at <small>NATO</small> and in the <small>EU</small> , owing to his friendliness with both China and Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But harnessing right-wing populism to take control of a state is not easy. When Poland&#39;s Law and Justice ( <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ) party came to power in 2015, it followed Mr Orban&#39;s script. It turned the state media into a propaganda bureau and tried to pack the courts. But <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s efforts have not got as far as Fidesz&#39;s. Many judges have fought back, and the <small>EU</small> has withheld billions of euros in aid to force <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> to reverse some of its court-packing. The media have not been cowed. The opposition remain competitive, even though <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> is favoured in next month&#39;s election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other right-wing populists using Mr Orban&#39;s template have also had mixed results. Janez Jansa, a former prime minister of Slovenia nicknamed “Marshal Tweeto” for a social-media style reminiscent of Donald Trump, lost power in 2022. Estonia&#39;s far-right <small>EKRE</small> party tried to go after the media while in government in 2019, but that coalition collapsed and the party did poorly in an election this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even where it has been electorally successful, the hard right has struggled to put in place radical policies such as ending political asylum or scrapping measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Take Sweden, where the Sweden Democrats, long shunned by other parties because of their roots in the neo-Nazi movement, took 21% of the vote in 2022. They signed a confidence-and-supply deal to back a centre-right minority government, giving them direct influence over policy on immigration and crime. But in a speech in August Jimmie Akesson, the party&#39;s leader, had to make excuses for the government&#39;s slow progress implementing the deal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ms Meloni is the first leader in western Europe with the parliamentary clout to enact a hard-right agenda. Yet so far, she has run a fairly conventional government. Her only populist measures have been to introduce a misconceived tax on banks, limit some airline fares and prevent same-sex parents from registering their partner&#39;s child as their own. In part, she is constrained by European fiscal rules. But the <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> is also simply less extreme than it once was. ”This is a pragmatic centre-right government with, now and again, some identitarian [culture-war] policies,” argues Giovanni Orsina of the <small>LUISS</small> school in Rome.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On the question of Europe, in particular, many hard-right parties have softened. A few of the edgiest populists want to dismantle the union they sneeringly refer to as the “ <small>EUSSR</small> ”. But <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> abandoned the idea of leaving the euro and restructuring the <small>EU</small> before coming to power. Ms Meloni instead wants the <small>EU</small> to do more to help Italy, by keeping out the migrants that flood Italy&#39;s shores. This summer she went to Tunisia with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission&#39;s president, to negotiate a migration deal. She also wants the bloc to relax its fiscal rules so that her government can spend more. She even cultivates Europhiles by praising the union as the guardian of European peace and civilisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>RN</small> , in similar fashion, no longer calls for France to leave the <small>EU</small> and the euro. Its rhetoric remains anti-European, but with few specifics. This retreat from more radical policies was presumably intended precisely to broaden the <small>RN</small> ’s appeal and so help it win power. And even if Ms Le Pen were to become president, she might still struggle to implement her policies, despite the immense formal powers of the office. After all, reforms to state pensions championed by Emmanuel Macron, the incumbent, met ferocious opposition even though he clearly advertised them during his re-election campaign last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Far-right parties, which are often young, full of zealous ideologues and dependent on charismatic leaders, are prone to schisms. The Finns Party&#39;s first stint in government, in 2015, split it in two. Its second, which began in May, has already been marred by scandals and resignations. In Poland, <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s generous benefits policies have alienated fiscal conservatives, some of whom have defected to a libertarian party called Confederation. Ms Le Pen, having softened her radical image, now faces competition on the right from Reconquest, whose lead candidate in the European election is her niece, Marion Maréchal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most vivid illustration of such chaos is in the Netherlands, which since 2002 has seen a series of right-wing populist parties rocket to prominence only to implode. In provincial elections in 2019 Forum for Democracy, a party led by Thierry Baudet, a dandyish Eurosceptic, finished first with 17%. Within months it had split into three. Mr Baudet now hawks conspiracy theories about covid-19 and immigration; his rump of the party is polling at 3%. Earlier this year the <small>BBB</small> had a brief moment as the standard-bearer of the right, but it has already slumped to 11% in the polls. It has been losing votes to yet another new party on the right with populist overtones, New Social Contract, which was launched by an <small>MP</small> famous for investigating abuses by the tax authority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What all these parties have in common is a vague sense that they stand with ordinary people against the elite. Their positions on hot-button issues can be hazy, as with the <small>RN</small> ’s new stance on Europe. At a local level their candidates are often pragmatic. In June the rural town of Raguhn-Jessnitz in Saxony-Anhalt became the first to elect an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> mayor. Hannes Loth is an energetic 42-year-old former vegetable farmer (“cabbage, sweetcorn, onions—all kinds of onions”). During the pandemic, when locals had trouble getting travel permits because of the lack of a covid-testing centre, Mr Loth opened one himself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Loth&#39;s main concerns are run-down streets and fire stations and the town&#39;s budget deficit, which was €1.5m ($1.6m) last year. That is partly because high energy prices sent heating bills for the <i>Rathaus</i> (town hall) through the roof. Mr Loth, toeing the <small>a</small> f <small>d</small> ’s line, says the solution is to restart the nuclear plants the government has closed and negotiate peace in Ukraine so gas pipelines to Russia can reopen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The disconnect between genuine problems and far-fetched solutions encapsulates something important about hard-right populist parties. Mr Loth is acutely sensitive to his constituents&#39; suffering from high energy costs. But the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s response is in part a fantasy: whatever it might wish, cheap Russian gas will not be an option for the foreseeable future. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="rotesters raising their hands making a Nazi salute while carrying a Spanish flag with the words"Long live the unity of Spain" are seen during a protest of far right wing party" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Making their presence felt</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similarly, the worries of the voters at the meeting in Sint-Genesius-Rode are natural. They have seen their town change its language around them; they have trouble finding good Dutch-language schools for their kids. But Vlaams Belang&#39;s solutions are illusory. Flemish independence is unlikely. Even if it happened, there is no way to force Sint-Genesius-Rode to speak mostly Dutch again. It has become French-speaking not because of a bureaucratic conspiracy, but because immigrants are more interested in learning French (a widely spoken language) than Dutch (a relatively obscure one).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The changes Europe&#39;s populist parties rail against tend to be inexorable or at least not easily reversed: demography, sexual liberation, gender equality, the shift away from fossil fuels. As with Vlaams Belang, the policies they propose to set the world to rights tend to be incoherent or unachievable. For populists, unrealistic programmes are no bad thing: candidates cannot thunder indignantly at election rallies about problems that have been solved.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Moreover, simply by railing and attracting support, far-right parties help to shift the debate. All across the continent, centre-right parties have toughened their immigration policies and heightened their culture-war rhetoric to stop voters defecting to the populists. The most glaring example of this was in Britain, where Brexit was set in train by the Conservative Party&#39;s decision to support a referendum on Brexit in an effort to diminish the appeal of the insurgents of the <small>UK</small> Independence Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is probably the biggest risk of the rising vote share of Europe&#39;s far-right parties. Certainly, they tend to be associated with bigotry and misogyny, and to undermine the rule of law. Occasionally they may win enough power to damage democracy, as in Hungary and Poland. But more often, big populist-right blocs simply impede countries from getting to grips with their most pressing problems by offering illusory solutions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is the last thing the <small>EU</small> needs. The next European Parliament must make grave decisions regarding institutional reform in the <small>EU</small> , energy security, climate, support for Ukraine and more. If a quarter of its members refuse to wrestle seriously with such problems, they are unlikely to be solved. The hard right does not need to seize control of the levers of power to gum them up. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i><b>Correction (September 18th, 2023):</b> A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Germany&#39;s election took place last year.

No longer: of the six countries invited to join the bloc at its annual summit on August 22nd, four—Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> )—are from the region. If they all accept, the Middle East will account for more than a third of the expanded bloc&#39;s members.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The invitations are one sign among many that the Middle East is changing. Wealthy Gulf states are trying to establish themselves as non-aligned middle powers. Saudi Arabia has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. The <small>UAE</small> , which will host this year&#39;s global climate summit, <small>cop</small> 28, wants to fashion a dual role as both oil exporter and green-energy powerhouse. The six-member Gulf Co-operation Council ( <small>GCC</small> ) is one of the world&#39;s economic hotspots, drawing the talented and the ultra-rich from east and west and deploying vast pools of capital abroad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even more striking is the Middle East&#39;s newfound (and relative) calm. A ceasefire has quietened the eight-year war in Yemen. Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to ease their 40-year feud in March. Qatar has repaired relations with its neighbours. The region has even reconciled with Syria&#39;s murderous dictator, Bashar al-Assad. America, meanwhile, is urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, under which four other Arab countries have established ties with Israel since 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Five years ago Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia&#39;s crown prince and de facto ruler, offered a hopeful vision of where things might go. “I think that the new Europe is the Middle East,” he said. “The next global renaissance will be in the Middle East.” His comments fit an increasingly popular narrative in the Gulf, that a “new” Middle East will be focused on economics rather than democratisation, Islamisation or other distracting ideologies. Diplomacy will bring stability, which will foster investment and growth that helps everyone move beyond the upheavals of decades past. The Gulf states have long applied this model at home; now they want to export it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Middle East has huge potential. First, and most obvious, it is awash with hydrocarbons. It accounts for 36% of world oil production, 46% of oil exports, 22% of natural-gas output and 30% of liquefied natural gas ( <small>LNG</small> ) exports. Those numbers will only rise.该地区储量丰富（石油储量占世界总量的52%，天然气储量占世界储量的43%）且生产成本低廉。 At a time when Western oil majors are skittish about investing, Gulf firms are adding capacity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Location is important, too: the region connects Europe, Africa and Asia. Some 30% of the world&#39;s shipping containers pass through the Suez canal in Egypt, while 16% of its air cargo flies via airports in the Gulf. Its young population is another asset: 55% of Middle Easterners are under 30, compared with 36% of the population of the <small>OECD</small> , a club mostly of rich countries.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Monumental misfortune</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the story of the past two decades has been one of conflict and despair. First came America&#39;s ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003. The fury of the Arab spring followed, bringing upheaval but not democracy: all the countries affected eventually either reverted to dictatorship or collapsed into civil war. Islamist violence and sectarian strife compounded the region&#39;s woes. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The Middle East accounts for 6% of the world&#39;s population but just 4% of economic output.

Poverty rates have soared in Egypt and Lebanon, to say nothing of war-torn Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But three big shifts are under way that could change the place of the Middle East in the world. The first is the growing distance between the Gulf states and America. Three successive presidents have sought to reduce America&#39;s military presence in the Middle East. Joe Biden, the current one, is not trying to impose democracy on the region; he does not even seem too interested in reining in Iran&#39;s nuclear programme. America has other priorities: competition with China, the war in Ukraine, political turmoil at home.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s economic role is also decreasing. Over the past 30 years the share of Middle Eastern exports going to China and India has climbed from 5% to 26%, according to the <small>IMF;</small> the share sent to Europe and America has fallen from 34% to 16%. Much of this reflects Asia&#39;s booming appetite for oil, the region&#39;s main export. In the 1990s China took less than 1% of Saudi Arabia&#39;s crude exports, and India less than 3%; by 2021 those figures were 28% and 12%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Oil is at the heart of the second shift, in energy markets. The region is trying to become an even bigger force in oil and gas to finance a transition away from hydrocarbons, contradictory though that may sound. Recent high oil prices have brought a windfall. Aramco, the state-owned Saudi giant, posted a record $161bn profit last year, up from $110bn in 2021. It plans to expand its capacity by 1m barrels a day (roughly 10%) over the next three years. The <small>UAE</small> has a similar target. It has also made itself a transit point for Iranian and Russian oil, which are subject to Western sanctions. Qatar, already the world&#39;s biggest exporter of <small>LNG</small> , plans to boost production by 63% by 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The proceeds are being poured into new industries. Instead of parking its petrodollars in American treasuries, as it once did, Saudi Arabia is snapping up everything from European footballers to stakes in electric-car firms. This summer the kingdom struck a $2.6bn deal with Brazil&#39;s largest mining firm, part of a plan to spend $170bn on the industry by 2030.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final shift is in attitudes. Surveys show that Arabs view the economy as their top concern. About a third of young Arabs say the cost of living is the region&#39;s biggest problem and another third cite unemployment; almost half say it is hard to find a job in their country. Asked whether stability or democracy is more important, 82% choose the former. Growing numbers believe that democracy is bad for economic growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Citizens have lost interest in political Islam, too. Islamist parties have been forced out of government by Tunisian voters and Egyptian soldiers. Armed Islamists failed to take control of Iraq, Libya and Syria. <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/07/a-year-after-iran-was-shaken-by-protests-zealots-have-tightened-their-grip">Widespread protests</a> in Iran last year were a sign of popular frustration with its religious rulers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The leaders of the Gulf countries, too, seem to have a new outlook. Over the past decade they had sought to use force to change the region. They tried to impose a friendly government on Yemen; Saudi Arabia sent weapons to Syrian rebels; the <small>UAE</small> attempted to install Khalifa Haftar, a warlord, as Libya&#39;s leader. Each effort failed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At least for now, the era of macho foreign policy is over. The most unexpected diplomatic shift was the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. They have been at odds since the latter&#39;s Islamic revolution in 1979, fighting a proxy war that eventually spread to Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. With a nudge from China, though, they agreed in March to reopen their embassies, which had been closed since 2016, to tone down criticism of one another in state-backed media and to boost economic ties. They are hardly friends, but the deal has reduced the chance of conflict in the Gulf.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most unsavoury shift is Mr Assad&#39;s reintegration. He did nothing to earn it: after destroying Syria to keep power, he has made no gestures towards reform or reconciliation. But in May the Saudis let him reclaim Syria&#39;s seat at the Arab League.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The easing of tensions has nonetheless brought a measure of calm, which may help explain the improving economic outlook. The <small>IMF</small> expects the non-oil portion of the Gulf states&#39; economies to grow by 4.2% this year (unchanged from last year), even as the oily bit expands by just 1.9% (down from 10.3% in 2022). The region attracted 6% of global flows of foreign direct investment last year, up from 3% in 2019.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Capital markets are booming. Firms in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the <small>UAE</small> , accounted for 14% of the world&#39;s <small>IPO</small> s in the first quarter of 2023. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that foreign ownership of Middle Eastern equities climbed from 2% in 2017 to 10% last year. It sees the region&#39;s weight in emerging-market indices rising to 10% in the next few years, from 7% today.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Big domestic reforms are making headway: 31% of Saudi women were employed in the first quarter of this year, compared with 16% at the same point in 2017. Gulf states are also trying to be more exacting when doling out aid. Some still comes with few strings attached: Tunisia, for instance, secured a surprise $500m bail-out (most of it loans) from Saudi Arabia in July. But Egypt is having to raise money by selling stakes in state-run firms to sovereign-wealth funds from Qatar and the <small>UAE</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists muse about where this could lead. A calmer Middle East would mean fewer risks to global trade and energy flows, and fewer refugees (the region accounts for over 8m of the world&#39;s 35m). As Western firms seek to diversify supply chains, a youthful Middle East could become a new manufacturing base. Morocco&#39;s thriving car industry, which produces around 700,000 vehicles a year and sustains 220,000 jobs, shows what is possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The region could also do more business with itself. Trade within the Middle East is equivalent to only 2.9% of the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> , compared with 22% within the <small>EU</small> . Researchers at Majid al-Futtaim, an Emirati retail giant, and McKinsey, a consultancy, estimate that dropping barriers to trade could boost the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> by $230bn (5%). If Saudi Arabia and Israel buried the hatchet, commercial ties with the Middle East&#39;s most dynamic economy would become possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Infrastructure could be stitched together as well. The <small>GCC</small> countries have long mooted integrating their railways, which could easily be connected to those of Iraq, Israel and Jordan, too. Pipelines could bring low-cost Saudi hydrogen across the Mediterranean to consumers in Europe; upgraded transmission lines could allow a sun-baked region to export solar power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is an alluring vision, but there are many pitfalls. The first is that the economic progress of the past few years has been uneven. The Middle East has long been riven with political schisms, between revolutionaries and royalists, nationalists and Islamists, Sunnis and Shias. Today, though, the most important distinction is economic, between the prosperous states and the penurious ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Unfortunately, most of the Middle East is penurious. Even in a time of regional calm, dire economies threaten these countries&#39; stability. In the past five years alone, since Prince Muhammad first began talking about a regional renaissance, there have been big protests in Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Sudan.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pharaonic mismanagement</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt, the most populous country in the Arab world, is especially alarming. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the soldier who has run it since a coup in 2013, has consistently spent less than the constitution requires on health and education. But he has found the money for grandiose projects such as a new capital city in the desert and for big purchases of weapons for the army (Egypt is the world&#39;s sixth-largest arms importer).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt&#39;s debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratio has risen to 93%, with 36% of the loans denominated in foreign currencies. Its non-oil economy has been in contraction for 33 consecutive months and for 81 of the past 90 months. The currency has lost half its value over the past two years and will probably be devalued again soon. Annual inflation hit a record high of 38% in July. Citizens endured blackouts in sweltering heat this summer because the government could not afford to import enough fuel for power plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A fully fledged balance-of-payments crisis seems likely. Even if the government limps on, it will be hard to reinvent the region when its largest country is moribund. And should unrest erupt on a sufficient scale, it could even damage the economic prospects of the Gulf countries. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Another risk is that even the region&#39;s prosperous countries will fail to create the jobs and growth they have promised. They have undeniably done better to date than their counterparts elsewhere in the Middle East. 1975年，沙特和利比亚的人均国内<small>生产总值</small>大致相同； today the Saudi figure is 353% higher. The Gulf and Israel (the region&#39;s other prosperous spot) account for just 14% of the Middle East&#39;s population, but 60% of its <small>GDP</small> , 73% of its exports of goods and 75% of its <small>FDI</small> (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Saudi Arabia, like its neighbours, is battling deep structural problems. Citizens still see a cushy public-sector job as a birthright. The government employs fully 53% of working Saudis, although that is down from 66% in 2019. Schools do not teach marketable skills. Wages are too high for the kingdom to become a manufacturing hub, at least without costly state subsidies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Prince Muhammad hopes annual foreign direct investment will be $100bn by 2030. Last year it was just $8bn. That leaves the government as the main agent of economic transformation, which is worrying in two respects. First, its finances are hostage to oil markets. Analysts estimate that the kingdom runs a deficit when the price drops below $100 a barrel, if off-budget spending by its sovereign-wealth funds is included. It is currently about $90—its highest for almost a year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, it is far from clear that the government&#39;s investments in diversification will pay off. Vision 2030, the kingdom&#39;s economic blueprint, predicts tourism will contribute 10% of Saudi <small>GDP</small> by the end of the decade. Officials claim the industry will generate 1m jobs, enough to hire one in 20 Saudis, a higher share than in France or Spain. But there is scant evidence of the hoped-for flood of 100m annual visitors. Last year there were just 16m, estimates the <small>UN</small> —about 1.5m fewer than in 2016, the year the vision was adopted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another worry is that the ideological arguments that leaders are so eagerly papering over will at some point resurface. Saudi Arabia is pursuing a détente with Iran even as the latter continues to produce highly enriched uranium for its rogue nuclear programme. Should the regime go further and manufacture a bomb, it could trigger a regional arms race—or even a war. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Collage juxtaposing an image of a tank and an excavator" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Anthony Gerace/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been relatively subdued for the past two decades, but it is unlikely to stay that way for ever. Serious conflict in the Holy Land could shake Arab agreements with Israel. Violence has ebbed in Libya, Syria and Yemen, but the underlying disputes remain unresolved. Mr Assad faced a wave of protests last month in Sweida, a restive southern province. And Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE</small> , although the main cheerleaders for the new Middle East, often disagree about both foreign policy and economic matters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final risk is that the region gets its geopolitical balancing act wrong. America is still the only country willing and able to project military power across the region, and its domination of the global financial system gives it unmatched economic clout. The Gulf states cannot risk losing it as a partner. Yet their dalliances with Russia and China are prompting mounting anger in Washington. America has imposed sanctions on a few firms in the <small>UAE</small> , including one accused of supplying drones to Russia. It has delayed a deal to sell <small>F</small> -35 fighter jets to the country because of allegations of a Chinese military presence at a port in Abu Dhabi.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Gulf states are “planning in part their future prosperity on the assumption that China&#39;s economic rise will continue”, notes Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. There are warning lights flashing over China&#39;s economy, though: slow growth, an ageing population, a moribund property market. A big gamble on China that alienates America could leave the Gulf in a difficult spot.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact is, Prince Muhammad is not the first regional leader to wax lyrical about a renaissance in the Middle East. There are many parallels between the current era and the 1990s, another time when the region seemed to be trying to put its violent past behind it. The Oslo accords appeared to herald an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Lebanon&#39;s long civil war had sputtered to a halt. Autocrats in Egypt, Jordan and Syria talked about opening their hidebound economies. So did Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, the Saudi crown prince of the day, who promised bold reforms and sought better relations with Iran.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 1993 Shimon Peres, then Israel&#39;s foreign minister, wrote a book called “The New Middle East” arguing that trade would pacify the region. “Ultimately, the Middle East will unite in a common market,” he stated. “And the very existence of this common market will foster vital interests in maintaining the peace over the long term.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> History, sadly, had other ideas. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process gradually ground to a halt. America invaded Iraq in 2003 and Israel sent its army into southern Lebanon in 2006. Supposedly modernising autocrats across the region proved quite bad at the modernising bit, which precipitated the Arab spring. Gulf economies stayed oily, save for Dubai, which never had much oil to begin with.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An era of peace and development is a tempting vision, but to attain it, the region&#39;s autocrats must be serious about keeping the peace and smart about fixing their economies.

Black Africans, he added, brought “violence, crimes and unacceptable practices”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In effect, he gave Tunisians permission to be openly racist. Suddenly, many felt free to use slurs that were previously taboo, including one for black people that means, literally, “slave”. Most locals interviewed by <i>The Economist</i> in the street in August used this term. “The slaves are replacing us,” said Nizar, a furniture repair man in Tunis, the capital. “They are taking all the jobs.” Worse, “They stand on the balcony in their underwear drinking alcohol.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A wave of hatred has crashed over the country. In July, after an Arab was killed in a brawl with migrants in Sfax, Tunisia&#39;s second city, mobs torched homes where black Africans were lodging. Landlords, scared of losing their property, evicted black tenants. When <i>The Economist</i> visited, hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants were sleeping rough in the town centre, huddled together for protection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Look at my head,” said Muhammad, a painter from Guinea, pointing to a hammer-blow scar. He was driven from his flat by thugs wielding stones and petrol bombs, he said; then police grabbed him and dumped him in the desert with no water. Many migrants have died this way, but Muhammad somehow made it back to Sfax. He is desperate to get to Europe. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMcuv4eccCA?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s speech was pure fabrication. There is no plot to change Tunisia&#39;s demography. Black Africans are a tiny share of the population, and largely just passing through. If they linger, it is simply because they are saving for the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before the speech, Mr Saied was unpopular, thanks to a dire economy. After it, he appears to have won more support. Polls are unreliable, but one in November gave him less than 30% backing; a different one in June found that 69% would vote for him.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> By vowing to guard Tunisians from a phantom menace, he has rallied them behind him. He has also deflected blame for the country&#39;s ills. Economists think Tunisia&#39;s inflation is largely caused by the government, but Mustafa, from Sfax, blames black people, who he says are driving up prices by eating all the bread. He plans to vote for Mr Saied at the next election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s hate-mongering has also distracted attention from other controversial things he has been doing, such as muzzling the press, purging the judiciary and shutting down the national anti-corruption watchdog. He has been dismantling the checks and balances that promote good, clean governance, with predictable results. Tunisia has grown more fearful, less free and more corrupt. Its score on the Corruption Perceptions Index ( <small>CPI</small> ) compiled by Transparency International, a watchdog, has worsened significantly since 2021, when Mr Saied started dismantling its young, hopeful democracy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Tunisia reflects a global trend: more leaders are using nationalism as a tool to amass power—and to abuse it (see chart 1). Whereas nationalism was once a means to dismantle deplorable colonial empires, it is increasingly becoming a device to remove legitimate constraints on government power. Leaders who chafe at checks and balances need a pretext to scrap them. They cannot admit that they want to muzzle the press and purge the courts because they find it irksome to follow the rules and would prefer to rule with unfettered authority. So they accuse journalists and judges of being traitors, or agents of foreign powers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nationalism can be positive or negative. The positive sort—love of one&#39;s country—can be a force for good. “It is the strongest foundation for solidarity between people who might otherwise have few things in common,” writes Yascha Mounk in “The Great Experiment: How to Make Diverse Democracies Work”. “At its best, it can inspire a white Christian living in rural Tennessee to feel special concern for a Hispanic atheist living in Los Angeles—and vice versa.” Because it is benign and, except at a few Western universities, uncontroversial, positive nationalism is embraced by nearly all politicians. Hardly any would admit to not loving their country.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The danger is when they espouse negative nationalism: the fear and suspicion of outsiders. The outsiders could be foreigners or domestic minorities. Perhaps because this paranoid variant is based on a deep-seated instinct—the desire to protect one&#39;s tribe—it is highly potent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When people feel their country is threatened, they rise to defend it, sometimes heroically. When Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Ukrainians made great sacrifices to resist him. This benefited Ukraine, which would otherwise have become a vassal state. It also boosted the poll ratings of Ukraine&#39;s president, Volodymyr Zelensky: people rallied round the man who led their country&#39;s defence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Alas, unscrupulous leaders have found they can win similar poll bumps by vowing to defend people against confected threats. Mr Putin claims that his unprovoked attack on Ukraine is really about defending Russia from Western aggression and Ukrainian Nazis. Many Russians believe him. Despite the war&#39;s cost to Russia in blood, treasure and international isolation, independent polls suggest that Mr Putin&#39;s approval rating has risen since he started it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main drawback of paranoid nationalism is obvious. It is terrible for its targets, whether they be immigrants in Tunisia or Ukrainians whose land has been sown with mines. Neighbours of paranoid nationalist regimes have cause to be nervous, as anywhere that shares a border with Russia or China can attest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other big drawback is less well understood: politics based on bigotry opens the door to misrule and corruption. As Mr Putin has ratcheted up nationalist propaganda over the past two decades, his cronies have been plundering Russia. And though he is surely the most extreme example, he is far from alone. In fact, there is a clear statistical correlation between nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>The Economist</i> analysed data from the V-Dem Institute, a think-tank attached to the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. Every year it asks experts to describe how the world&#39;s governments justify themselves to voters or citizens. It then creates a scale with the results. After weighting countries by population, we found that between 2012 and 2021 governments became more reliant on nationalism to justify themselves. (Specifically, on an ideology that included a nationalist element. It could also include other elements, such as populism or Islamism.) The change was significant: a typical citizen has seen an increase in her state&#39;s use of nationalism roughly equivalent to what China has seen under its “Wolf Warrior” president, Xi Jinping. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> We combined our measure of how nationalist governments are with data on perceptions of public-sector corruption from Transparency International ( <small>TI</small> ) for the years 2012 to 2021. Using a statistical model, we found that where governments rely on nationalist rhetoric to stay in power, experts think the public sector is much more corrupt (see chart 2). Moreover, comparing countries with themselves over time, going back to 2012, we find that more nationalist rhetoric has been associated with more corruption, and less nationalism with less corruption. Both these findings remain true after controlling for average incomes, and changes in them, and worldwide trends in nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There were notable exceptions (China, for instance, became cleaner and more jingoistic) but the relationship is statistically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in nationalism was correlated with a jump of 5.31 (on a scale of 0 to 100) in corruption when comparing countries, and a 0.13 point jump when comparing within them. The latter may seem small, but corruption scores usually do not change much at all. Interestingly, when an increase in nationalism came first, it predicted a future increase in corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why might this be so? Daniel Eriksson, the head of <small>TI</small> , suggests three ways that nationalism can foster the abuse of power. Politicians may whip up nationalist passions to win office or hang on to it. By granting their kin or cronies influence, they may attempt to capture the state. And by branding critics as traitors, they may erode the checks and balances that prevent the looting of public funds.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Appeals to nationalism are effective because they are simple to understand, and far more emotive than any bread-and-butter policy proposal. “Vote for me and I&#39;ll make incremental improvements to schools” is a fine platform but a dull slogan. “The tribe next door are attacking us!” is an electrifying one.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pick your poison</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The enemy can take many forms. It could be immigrants, as in Tunisia. Or a geopolitical rival: Chinese and Russian propaganda constantly demonise America. Or a minority faith: India&#39;s ruling party plays up the non-existent threat that Muslims, less than 15% of the population, pose to the Hindu majority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Or the enemy could be cultural change. Many nationalist leaders describe any new social trend that makes people uncomfortable as foreign, or even a vicious attempt by foreigners to subvert their country&#39;s values. Iran&#39;s regime uses this argument about women&#39;s rights; Uganda&#39;s, about tolerance for gay people. Illiberal regimes habitually describe the values they oppose as alien, which is easier than explaining why they are wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Each nationalist leader is unique, and it is hard to tell which ones believe their own rhetoric. Either way, paranoid nationalism gives them tools to gain power, consolidate it, and disguise their abuse of it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Consider Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega, the president, was once a revolutionary Marxist. He shot his way to power in 1979 but lost an election in 1990. Determined to regain and retain power, he muffled his Marxism, dialled up the anti-American bombast, won an election in 2006 and has gradually throttled democracy ever since.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> His choice of bogeyman is shrewd. The United States really did sponsor violent revolutionaries in his country—four decades ago. That threat is long gone, but Mr Ortega still claims that his opponents are “agents of the Yankee empire” who “stopped being Nicaraguans long ago”. In February he had more than 300 dissidents stripped of their citizenship. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Following Mr Eriksson&#39;s script, Mr Ortega has put his kin in positions of power. His vice-president and likely successor is his wife, Rosario Murillo. Eight of their nine children help them run the country. Their son Laureano is a presidential adviser. He oversaw negotiations with a Chinese firm to build a $50bn canal across Nicaragua. The project collapsed in 2015 amid allegations of skulduggery. Laureano is also an opera singer. Not all opera fans are convinced of his talent. One critic likened his voice to the “shrieks of a goat giving birth”. But he regularly lands the starring role in operas backed by a foundation he runs, which is funded by Nicaraguan taxpayers.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Grand theft autocrat</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Ortega family run the main television channels in Nicaragua. This lets them slant the news in their favour. It is also lucrative. Between 2018 and 2020 Nicaragua&#39;s government bought advertising worth an estimated $59m from the three biggest <small>TV</small> channels owned or controlled by the Ortegas, while spending a measly $230,000 at channels not affiliated with them. In all, the family is thought to control 22 companies in industries from energy to property. Nicaragua is a whopping ten points more corrupt on <small>TI</small> ’s scale than in 2012, and now ranks lower than Congo.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In richer, more established democracies, too, paranoid nationalism offers a quick way for outsiders to grab attention and break into national politics, or remain on top. In May Viktor Orban, Hungary&#39;s prime minister, claimed at a conservative conference, “We are all under attack.” He vows to defend Hungarians against immigration, Islam and gay rights. He proclaims the unity of all ethnic Hungarians, including those in neighbouring countries. He gives them pensions and lets them vote in Hungarian elections; they tend to vote for him. Inflaming nationalism has thus helped him win four elections.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Hungarian media, which are now largely controlled by Mr Orban&#39;s cronies, parrot his claims of foreign plots. Tame courts raise few objections when rivers of aid from the European Union flow into the pockets of his chums and state assets are transferred to foundations controlled by his allies. Lorinc Meszaros, a former schoolmate of Mr Orban who owned a modest pipe-fitting business, has become the richest man in Hungary, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $1.4bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Hungary and elsewhere, nationalism offers a plausible-sounding excuse to weaken checks and balances. Watchdogs can be designated “foreign agents” and neutered. Honest public servants can be labelled “unpatriotic” and replaced with loyalists. Dodgy dealings can be kept secret in the name of national security.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Putin was a pioneer of this approach. In 2012 he introduced a law restricting the activities of <small>ngo</small> s that received money from abroad. In 2022 he broadened the law&#39;s scope. Now the state can declare any individual or group to be a “foreign agent” (which sounds to many ears like “spy”) if it deems them to be “under foreign influence”. So-called “foreign agents” can be banned from any kind of political activity, or simply shut down.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Elements of the Putin method have been widely imitated around the world. At least 50 countries have enacted rules to curb civil society in recent years, according to Amnesty International. More broadly, of the 31 countries that showed a significant deterioration on the Corruption Perceptions Index between 2012 and 2022, 80% also suffered a constriction of civil liberties, as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister organisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Labelling watchdogs “foreign agents” impedes their work. Nervous local donors grow reluctant to fund feisty <small>ngo</small> s; advertisers shun independent media, lest their brand names be tarnished by association. India has used its Foreign Contributions Regulation Act to harass and muzzle groups from Oxfam to Greenpeace. China&#39;s “foreign influence” rules restrict the activities of any foreign-linked <small>ngo</small> that might annoy the Communist Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In July Zimbabwe&#39;s president signed a “Patriotic Bill” allowing long jail terms for anyone caught “wilfully damaging the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe”. The opposition says it criminalised criticism of the government in the run-up to an election last week, which the ruling party “won” unfairly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Despite its name, the bill seems designed to make Zimbabwe worse-governed. It makes it hazardous for members of civil society, the principal check on a thieving ruling party, to have any contact with foreigners. If an independent journalist talks to a foreign diplomat, or a local election-monitoring group shares data with an international one, or an anti-corruption watchdog seeks advice from an expert abroad, jail may await. As a cherry on top, the law also makes it harder to punish predatory officials, by requiring prosecutors to prove that those who abuse office knew that their actions were wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In country after country, incumbents have found that nationalist or sectarian arguments can be used to harass or exclude from office those who challenge the status quo. Iran&#39;s corrupt theocracy insists that all presidential candidates meet its definition of Islamic piety. In 2021 it disqualified 585 of them, including all the would-be reformers, and allowed only seven to run. A new Polish law could bar from office politicians deemed to be unduly influenced by Russia; its probable target is Donald Tusk, a leading opposition candidate who is not pro-Russian at all. Since 2015, when Poland&#39;s nationalist ruling party took charge, the country has grown eight points grubbier on the Corruption Perceptions Index.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shades of greed</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A more nationalist government does not automatically mean a more corrupt one. It is possible for a country to become more tub-thumping, but no dirtier, at least for a while. However, in the long run, if a leader uses nationalism to erode checks and balances, it becomes easier for the people around him or his successors to plunder. This happened in Zimbabwe, where a nationalist autocrat who was far more interested in power than money, Robert Mugabe, failed to stop looting by his cronies and was ultimately overthrown by them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thus, regardless of the starting point, paranoid nationalism tends to make countries worse governed and less stable. A paper co-written by Abhijit Banerjee, a Nobel prize-winning economist, found that when voters pick candidates by ethnicity instead of, say, probity or competence, they end up with less honest, less competent representatives.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Andreas Wimmer of Columbia University crunched data from nearly 500 civil wars and found that when political parties are ethnically based, civil war is nearly twice as likely. And instability is perhaps 30 times as likely if the country in question is neither a dictatorship (which can crush unrest before it escalates) nor a full democracy (where disputes are typically resolved peacefully). In short, when a leader invokes blood and soil, expect things to get bloody, or soiled. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Inspect all our code, data and models on <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/the-economist-nationalism-and-corruption/tree/master">GitHub</a></i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 09:10:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ttf827decbkegnfcmlacnisovs2h4nbg</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/31/how-cynical-leaders-are-whipping-up-nationalism-to-win-and-abuse-power </item><item><title><![CDATA[El Niño and global warming are mixing in alarming ways]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20El%20Ni_o-c8f29ab72a33fa5f13dc4d00f5112413.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>FTER YEARS</small> of praying for more rain, Californians unexpectedly found themselves wishing for less this week, when tropical storm Hilary blew in from Mexico on August 21st. Rainfall records were smashed in Los Angeles and San Diego. Death Valley, farther inland, was deluged with as much rain in a day as it normally receives in a year. Inundated roads completely cut off the nearby city of Palm Springs (pictured) for a time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hurricanes and tropical storms hit California only very rarely: none had even come close since 1997, and the previous one to make landfall was in 1939. Most of the few that have reached the state, however, including Hilary, have coincided with El Niño, a weather pattern that temporarily raises global temperatures while redistributing heat and moisture around the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meteorologists predict that the current El Niño, which began in June, will be a strong one—perhaps as severe as the one that ended in 2016, which helped make that year the hottest ever recorded. If they are right, the record is almost certain to fall this year or next. “We are in uncharted waters,” says Maarten van Aalst, director of the Dutch meteorological agency and former head of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “We have never had an El Niño on top of so much global warming, so we don&#39;t know what is going to happen.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> El Niños form and eventually dissipate owing to interactions between the trade winds that blow to the south of the equator and the ocean beneath them. The resulting accumulations of hotter- or colder-than-average water and high or low pressure in the atmosphere affect temperatures, winds and rainfall. Most of the time, the trade winds blow warm water from the central Pacific westward, towards Australia and Asia. That movement, in turn, helps draw cooler water up from the depths in the eastern Pacific, near South America. But every two-to-seven years, conditions conspire to create a vast pool of warmer-than-average surface water all the way across the Pacific, as far as South America.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> • <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/08/30/el-nino-is-back-and-could-bring-devastation-far-beyond-extreme-weather">Listen to experts on our science podcast discuss  why the current El Niño is alarming climatologists</a> .</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Peruvian fishermen named this phenomenon after the baby Jesus ( <i>el niño Jesus</i> in Spanish) because it tends to reach its peak around Christmas. It is of more than passing interest to them: the vast shimmering shoals of <i>anchovetas</i> on which their livelihood depends prefer colder water, and so vanish when El Niño appears.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent weeks small fishing boats in the port of Pisco have been unloading species rarely found nearby: butterfish, sierra, sardines. Meanwhile, the industrial fishing fleet, which relies on <i>anchovetas</i> , languishes in the harbour. Farther down the waterfront, factories that normally grind its catch into fishmeal are shuttered. No smoke billows from their chimneys; no fishy odour lingers in the air. An industry with exports of $2bn a year has been brought to a standstill.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The hiatus has contributed to an economic contraction in Peru and is likely to keep global fishmeal prices high for much of the year. That, in turn, will raise costs for the fish farms and livestock businesses around the world that use the stuff as feed. But those are only the beginnings of El Niño&#39;s impacts. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toKK4bGaKWQ?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tropical Pacific is so immense that the warming of its surface by an extra degree or two is enough to supercharge the global climate. More water evaporates, which warms the upper atmosphere and fuels tropical thunderstorms. Convection carries this additional energy to colder regions to the north and south, on either side of the equator. The spinning of the Earth spreads the energy east, as well. The net result is a vast redistribution of heat and moisture. In climate jargon, El Niño is a prime example of the “teleconnection” of the world&#39;s weather systems. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">No two El Niños are the same, but some general patterns exist. Broadly speaking, the Amazon Basin, Australia, the Indian subcontinent, the Sahel, South-East Asia and southern Africa often suffer drier conditions; Central and East Asia, the Horn of Africa, the southern cone of South America and the southern United States tend to get wetter (see map). Sometimes, the consequences can be devastating. A relatively mild El Niño in 2018-19 helped to fuel some of the worst wildfires in Australia&#39;s history. The exceptionally strong El Niño of 2014-16 brought droughts and floods that left some 60m people around the world short of food, drove huge outbreaks of Zika virus across South America and bleached 29% of Australia&#39;s Great Barrier Reef.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At times, the changes in the weather can also bring benefits. This year rains in Argentina are expected to increase grain production, breaking a long drought. El Niño years typically yield milder Atlantic hurricane seasons, reducing damage to property and crops (though that may not hold this year because of unusually hot waters in the North Atlantic). El Niño&#39;s impacts are hugely varied, too, going far beyond fisheries and agriculture. In 2015 production at a lithium plant in northern Chile that accounted for 30% of the world&#39;s output was disrupted by heavy rain. The ensuing jitters in the lithium market were not something forecasters had predicted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such diversity makes it hard to assess whether the overall effect of El Niño is positive or negative for the world economy. A study by researchers at the International Monetary Fund published in 2016 found that El Niño had little effect one way or the other. But a paper published earlier this year in <i>Science</i> by Christopher Callahan of Stanford University and Justin Mankin of Dartmouth College finds that the El Niño cycles of 1982-83 and 1997-98 permanently reduced global <small>gdp</small> by $4.1trn and $5.7trn respectively. The first cycle, however, coincided with a period when the Federal Reserve, America&#39;s central bank, was raising interest rates; the second with the Asian financial crisis. In both periods, in other words, as El Niño unfolded, other completely unrelated factors were also curbing economic growth in emerging markets. Disaggregating the impact of these different events is extremely difficult.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All analyses, however, agree that poor countries are hit harder by El Niño than rich ones. Even in the <small>IMF</small> study that found little overall impact, big costs in the developing world were offset by higher agricultural yields in the United States in particular. Inflation, meanwhile, rose almost everywhere as commodity prices jumped.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> ENSO on ENSO on</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The more severe the El Niño, naturally, the bigger the impact. According to the latest forecast from <small>NOAA</small> , the American government&#39;s meteorological agency, there is a 66% chance that the current one will be “strong”. The assessment rests on the rise in surface temperatures above the norm within a specific area of the Pacific known as “Niño 3.4”. A 1.5°C rise constitutes a strong event; more than 2°C counts as “very strong”, on a par with the biggest El Niños of the past century. The previous El Niño, in 2018-19, peaked inside Niño 3.4 at 0.9°C. A climatologist calls it a “little futz of an El Niño”. The one before that, in 2014-16, spanned two winters and peaked at 2.6°C (see chart). Global average temperatures reached successive records in 2015 and 2016. According to Michelle L&#39;Heureux, who co-ordinates <small>NOAA</small> ’s El Niño forecast updates, there is a 30% chance that this year&#39;s will end up just as mighty. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Three factors are likely to compound this El Niño, bringing new extremes. First, it arrives right on the heels of three consecutive years of La Niña, the inverse of El Niño, when winds propel warm Pacific water more strongly than usual westward, towards Asia, temporarily reducing global temperatures. The wind patterns that dominate during La Niña tend to push heat deeper into the ocean. Some of that heat resurfaces during subsequent El Niños. Three straight years of La Niña mean there is more heat to be released.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is not just La Niña that has been storing heat in the world&#39;s oceans. So has global warming. For decades researchers have been taking the temperature not only at the surface but also at depths of up to 2,000 metres. Since the 1990s these deeper waters have been running an ever-rising fever. Some climate researchers are wondering whether the off-the-charts surface temperatures observed in the past month or so around the world&#39;s oceans could be linked to this pelagic flu.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although El Niño does cause surface temperatures to rise outside the Niño 3.4 region, that usually does not happen until much later in the year. A possible explanation of the early surge in temperatures is that some of the heat accumulated in the deep ocean is starting to resurface. “Perhaps we&#39;re beginning to see some of that redistribution of heat now manifesting itself,” says Piers Forster of the University of Leeds in Britain.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The theory that shifting thermal dynamics within the oceans may be intensifying this El Niño is not yet proved, but there is no question that global warming more broadly is set to make El Niños worse. “As climate change unfolds, the impacts for a given El Niño are not the same, they&#39;re bigger,” says Adam Scaife of the Met Office, Britain&#39;s meteorological agency. Global warming means the air is more charged with water, rainfall fluctuations are increasing, “and therefore, a given El Niño with the same strength as we had in the past can dump more water or cause a bigger drought.” Whereas the “triple dip” La Niña masked some warming, making temperatures cooler than they would otherwise have been, an El Niño will amplify it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “I am confident that 2024 will be unprecedented in terms of global temperatures,” says Dr Scaife. Currently, the planet is 1.26°C warmer than before the invention of the steam engine. As a rule of thumb, climatologists say, every degree of warming in the Niño 3.4 region during an El Niño temporarily adds 0.07°C to global average temperatures. A strong or very strong event could therefore push the total rise in the average temperature to 1.4°C.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That means that the regions that often suffer drought and wildfires during El Niño—Australia, Indonesia and parts of the Amazon Basin—are at heightened risk. In Australia alone, even the weak El Niño of 2019 helped to incinerate 240,000 square kilometres of bush, killing nearly 500 people, destroying thousands of homes and wiping out A$5bn ($3.5bn) of crops and livestock. This year&#39;s El Niño is likely to be compounded by the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole ( <small>IOD</small> ), a weather pattern characterised by fluctuating surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean that further accentuates dry conditions in Australia and Indonesia. Three years of heavy rains under La Niña, meanwhile, have boosted plant growth. Lingering moisture in the soil and plants may offer some protection. But if all that vegetation dries out, it will fuel fiercer blazes. To make matters worse, heavy rain and shortening winters have shrunk the window to carry out controlled burns, which are used to reduce the amount of fire-prone vegetation. New South Wales, Australia&#39;s most populous state, has conducted only 20% of its scheduled burn this year, according to Greg Mullins, a former fire commissioner.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Dipolar disorder</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>IOD</small> can also reinforce the wet conditions that El Niño typically brings to east Africa. On the face of things, that should be a positive after years of drought. But the rainfall is likely to be excessive, and might flood farmland and damage the roads used to bring crops to market. “We are on watch,” says Laura Harrison of the Climate Hazards Centre at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disasters of this sort will also create havoc in agricultural markets. As it is, India&#39;s government has declared a ban on exports of certain types of rice, in anticipation of drier-than-usual conditions while the current crop is growing. The ban affects about half of India&#39;s annual exports, which in total account for 40% of the global trade in rice by volume. It has sent world rice prices to their highest level since 2011.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The outlook for the rice market may get worse before it gets better. El Niños have in the past driven down rice yields: in 2015-16 South-East Asia&#39;s crop declined by 15m tonnes, 7% of global stocks. The spectre of potential shortages has prompted panic-buying among Asian governments since the beginning of the year. Indonesia, for example, has been snaffling up rice from Vietnam, the third-largest exporter after India and Thailand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Wheat, too, could be in for a wild ride. Australia produces 12-15% of the global crop and yields can halve in El Niño years. “Given the precarious situation of the wheat market, with the Russia-Ukraine war and other things, that Australian wheat crop is a very important one, and one we&#39;re watching closely,” says Paul Hughes of <small>S&amp;P</small> Global Commodity Insights, a research firm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Palm oil is another vulnerable product. A drought in Indonesia and Malaysia, the two biggest exporters, would diminish yields. <small>S&amp;P</small> Global reckons that Malaysian exports could fall by 10% if the incipient El Niño is mild and double that if it is severe. After Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine last year, palm oil helped make up for a dearth of sunflower oil, 75% of which is normally produced by the two adversaries. El Niño will thus come as a second blow to the already stretched market for edible oils. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Fishermen take a break after fishing anchovy" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Not what they wanted for Christmas</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another likely outcome of a strong El Niño is an increase in disease. Viruses replicate more quickly in vectors like mosquitoes as temperatures rise. Mosquitoes also bite more in the heat. Heavy rainfall creates more places for insects to breed, as can droughts, as people collect more water in accessible receptacles. Research collated by the World Health Organisation found that the dry conditions associated with El Niños across two decades boosted malaria cases in Colombia and Venezuela by more than a third. A strong El Niño in 1997-98 was associated with big malaria epidemics in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. This year heavy rains and floods exacerbated Peru&#39;s worst-ever outbreak of dengue, overwhelming hospitals in the north.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Flooding can result in poor sanitation, causing an increase in diarrheal diseases. The displacement and overcrowding that occurs after disaster strikes makes such outbreaks worse. If the Horn of Africa is indeed drenched by rain, a surge in cholera cases is likely.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Malnutrition exacerbates vulnerability to disease, particularly in the very young or very old.慈善机构“救助儿童会”声称，2015-16 年厄尔尼诺现象造成的破坏导致全球另外 600 万儿童营养不良，这一数字是受到 covid-19 影响的儿童人数的三倍。 And the pandemic has left health services overstretched and weakened. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a health charity, estimates that covid led to the biggest sustained decline in immunisation rates in 30 years, prompting a surge in outbreaks of preventable illnesses such as measles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact that many of these ill-effects are foreseeable does at least mean that governments and aid agencies can try to prepare for them. Since 2015 the humanitarian community has increasingly been incorporating seasonal forecasts into their planning, explains Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a climate forecaster at Columbia University and the Red Cross. In Honduras, for instance, the Red Cross activated an emergency protocol at the end of June based on the El Niño forecast issued by <small>NOAA</small> . It is distributing cash and kits to sanitise water to places at risk of drought.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But careful preparation only gets you so far, especially in poor countries with weak institutions and widespread corruption. Since the last strong El Niño, Peru has shuffled through six presidents. Precious little of the $14bn set aside for rebuilding and climate-proofing had been invested before floods and landslides hit the same areas again this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> More climate-related disasters will probably only deepen popular discontent and dysfunctional politics in Peru, further eroding the government&#39;s capacity to respond. In fact, oscillations in the climate have spurred the rise and fall of civilisations in South America for thousands of years. El Niño, writes author Brian Fagan, “can destroy the people&#39;s faith in the legitimacy of their leaders and in the foundations of their society”. Fempellec, a legendary ruler of an ancient Peruvian kingdom, provides a salutary example. According to myth, after sustained, unseasonable rains laid waste to crops, his people decided he was to blame. So they tied him up and tossed him into the sea. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more coverage of climate change, sign up for the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-climate-issue">Climate Issue</a> , our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our <a href="https://www.economist.com/climate-change">climate-change hub</a> .</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 24 Aug 2023 12:47:07 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/d56htlo5ta05tv3jtuuopgtfdsgg62sh</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/24/el-nino-and-global-warming-are-mixing-in-alarming-and-unpredictable-ways </item><item><title><![CDATA[China’s defeated youth]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Generation%20Stagnation-5b74b0eeebb6f535254c9a4bbc148da0.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>N THE SOUTHERN</small> city of Huizhou an electronics factory is hiring. The monthly salary on offer is between 4,500 and 6,000 yuan (or $620 and $830), enough to pay for food and essentials, but not much else. The advertisement says new employees are expected to “work hard and endure hardship”. The message might have resonated with Chinese of an older generation, many of whom worked long hours in poor conditions to give their children a brighter future. But many of those children now face similar drudgery—and are unwilling to endure it. “I can&#39;t sit on an assembly line,” says Zhang, a 20-something barista with dyed-red hair at a local tea shop. He scoffs at the idea of making such sacrifices for so little gain. The job at the tea shop pays just 4,000 yuan a month, but he enjoys chatting up customers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before you dismiss Zhang as just another Gen <small>Z</small> moper, consider that he has been working for seven years, including time spent in a factory. He sends half of his wages after rent back home to support his parents. He sees no hope of buying a house or making enough money to get married and have children. Working at the electronics factory in Huizhou would not improve his situation by much; and in other ways it would make him miserable. “Hard work is important,” he says. “But eating bitterness will make you unhappy.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Across China young people are disillusioned. They have been raised on stories of economic dynamism and social mobility. The Chinese economy more than doubled in size every ten years from 1978, when Communist Party leaders first adopted market reforms, until 2018. City kids could study hard, get into a good university and expect a white-collar job upon graduation. Lucky students from small towns or the countryside might do the same and make their way into the middle class. Less-educated young people had fewer options. But they could travel to cities, where rising wages in factories or on building sites were enough to start a family.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the decades before Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China had also been more open. Party leaders Jiang Zemin (1989-2002) and Hu Jintao (2002-12) were hardly liberals. But they left some space for civil society, intellectuals and the media to operate. Private enterprise flourished. Firms were encouraged to go out into the world and learn from the West. More and more Chinese travelled and studied abroad. A dynamic, aspirational, even hedonistic consumer and digital culture emerged. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For young people today, though, the outlook is much gloomier. The economy is struggling and they are feeling the worst of it. Unemployment among urban Chinese aged 16 to 24 has been running at over 20% for months, about double the age group&#39;s pre-pandemic level (see chart 1). The official job numbers for this group are so stubbornly awful that China recently <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/17/chinas-consumers-officials-and-statisticians-all-lack-confidence">stopped publishing</a> them altogether. Higher education is no longer a reliable ladder to a solid career. Our calculations show that in 2021 over 70% of those unemployed youngsters were graduates. Along with scarce jobs, they face sky-high property prices. Their modest dreams of finding work, buying a house and supporting a family seem increasingly out of reach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To get a sense of how young people feel, we have interviewed dozens of them. Their message is strikingly consistent. “We have no hope,” says a 27-year-old in Huizhou. The malaise felt by him and his cohort has led to the emergence of a new nihilistic vocabulary, featuring phrases such as<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/03/china-urges-its-people-to-struggle-some-say-no"><i>tang</i> <i>ping</i> (lying flat)</a> and <i>bailan</i> (letting it rot). Using sentiment-analysis tools to extract feelings from text on social media, we found that the mood of young Chinese is growing ever darker.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That should trouble officials in Beijing. Some 360m Chinese (a quarter of the population) are between the ages of 16 and 35. Their gloom has profound implications for the future of China, its economy and the party&#39;s ambitions. But rather than soothe the young, the government tends to scold them. Last year Mr Xi said they must “abandon arrogance and pampering”. Editorials in state media encourage them to “embrace struggle” and sacrifice their youth to the cause of national rejuvenation, as defined by the party. Repression is increasing. “Eat bitterness,” Mr Xi tells youngsters. His admonition, though a worn Chinese cliché, is sure to strike a nerve among people such as the barista in Huizhou.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The grind</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not as if young Chinese do not work hard. From an early age they face enormous pressure to do well in school and ace China&#39;s notoriously tough university-entrance exam, known as the <i>gaokao</i> . Nearly 13m youngsters took it this year. Many of them will have spent years cramming at the expense of other activities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet there is a growing feeling among young people that no matter how hard they study or work, they will not be rewarded with a better quality of life. They speak of <i>neijuan</i> , or “involution”, an academic word used to describe a situation in which extra input no longer yields more output. The idea was captured in “A Love for Dilemma”, a popular <small>TV</small> drama released in 2021. In the show, two characters liken the competition in educational attainment to an unruly audience at a cinema: someone stands up to get a clearer view, which obliges everyone behind them to stand. Then people climb on seats and ladders. But in the end, despite all of their effort, no one is able to see the screen any better.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The data support this sense of <i>neijuan</i> . As the number of university graduates has increased, the number of jobs for which they are suited has not risen at anywhere near the same rate. It has not helped that a large number of youngsters who decided to extend their studies during the pandemic are also now joining the job market, creating an even bigger surfeit of graduates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One problem is a mismatch between the skills that graduates are acquiring from school and those required by employers. According to one academic study of Zhaopin, a recruitment portal, 39% of job-seekers in first-tier cities had at least two surplus years of education, over and above those required by the jobs they sought. Outside these big cities, the proportion was more like 70%. Tales abound on social media of educated young people taking low-skilled jobs, such as sorting trash. One cigarette-maker hired students with master&#39;s degrees for its production line.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Young Chinese once dreamed of being lucky enough to get jobs in tech. Jack Ma, the idolised founder of Alibaba, proudly espoused a “996” culture, referring to a work schedule of 9am to 9pm, six days a week, often without extra pay. But in recent years tech workers began to complain of feeling like drones with dim prospects (made dimmer more recently with lay-offs). During an online outpouring of grievances in 2019, Mr Ma responded, perhaps unconvincingly, that “being able to work 996 is a huge blessing.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many young people now seek poorly paid but more stable government jobs that were once scorned by ambitious types. About 2.6m people sat exams for such positions last year, up from 1.4ma decade earlier. Only one in every 70 got one. Even jobs in provincial backwaters have become more attractive. Wu Xiaomei, 23, is from Guizhou, a remote mountainous province in the south-west. She complains that more people have been moving there from nearby provinces where the exams to gain work as a teacher are more competitive. That has made it tougher for locals to get such jobs. Ms Wu ended up teaching in a small-town school in another nearby province with less competition.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Those born in such places have the most difficult time moving up in the world. They have little chance of getting into a good university in a big city, where the admissions system favours locals. Most are stuck in low-skilled service jobs, such as delivering food in cities. The <i>hukou</i> system, a household registry, forces most who migrate to cities to live precarious lives, without access to local benefits like medical insurance. Since the mid-2010s, the wage growth of blue-collar workers has slowed significantly, according to a study led by Scott Rozelle of Stanford University. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whether their collars are white or blue, few youngsters earn enough to buy a house in a good location (see chart 2). Between 1998 and 2021 homes in Chinese cities became four times less affordable, judged by the ratio of average house prices to median disposable incomes. In the capital, Beijing, this ratio rose to 25 in 2021, more than twice that of London. While ruing their inability to afford a nice home, the young can also look forward to a growing burden of caring for their parents and grandparents, due to the demographic distortions wrought by nearly 40 years of the one-child policy (see chart 3). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile, the relatively open cultural atmosphere of the Hu and Jiang eras has vanished under Mr Xi. He has replaced it with an “empire of tedium”, to borrow a phrase from Geremie Barmé, a noted sinologist. Censorship has become far more heavy-handed. Chatter on the internet has turned into a dreary chorus of nationalist talking points. On Chinese television depictions of “effeminate men” and women&#39;s cleavage have been banned. Video games have been deemed too much fun; authorities have ordered the removal of gore and tried to limit kids&#39; playing hours.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At entertainment venues, bands are asked to send authorities videos of their sets before gigs. Directors of plays know that in the audience there are people checking that actors stick to approved scripts. Comedians plead for their audiences not to record them. Earlier this year Li Haoshi, a Beijing-based comic, used an army slogan—“Forge exemplary conduct! Fight to win!”—in a joke about how his dogs eagerly chased a squirrel. That was deemed insulting to the armed forces. Media companies were told not to hire the comic. Police said he was under investigation for causing a bad influence on society.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Xi has also tightened control over China&#39;s education system. Foreign textbooks were banned in 2020. The same year, schools across the country undertook to remove books that authorities said could “damage societal stability” or promote “deviant” values. Since 2021 students at primary and secondary schools have been assigned turgid texts devoted to Mr Xi&#39;s personal ideology. Universities have been told to become “strongholds of the Communist Party&#39;s leadership”. Several liberal scholars have been dismissed. Officials want Chinese history to be taught in a way that glorifies the party. To do otherwise is deemed “historical nihilism”. In 2021 a government hotline was set up for citizens to report such nihilism if they see it online.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The conservative turn has been especially hard on young women. Feminist activists are under close scrutiny. Authorities kept a tight lid on #MeToo activism. Sexism is rampant. In a survey by Zhaopin, the recruitment portal, 61% of women graduates said they were asked about their marriage and child-bearing status when applying for jobs, compared with just 32% of men. Women were also less likely to secure a job before graduation. A discouraging message about their future comes straight from the top. For the first time in decades the Politburo has no female member.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Let it rot</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dejected and demoralised, young people still find places to vent online. Baidu Tieba is a Reddit-like forum where discussions take place in various sub-groups organised by subject. We wrote a program to download posts from three sub-groups focusing on people born in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. We analysed over 150,000 contributions from 2019 to mid-2023, applying an algorithm to detect the presence of positive, negative or neutral words. Terms like <i>bailan</i> (let it rot), for example, are tagged as negative. Using this information, the algorithm then classified the posts as positive, negative or neutral in sentiment. The results show an improvement in the collective mood after the government lifted its draconian zero-covid restrictions in December. But, in general, China&#39;s young people have been growing more pessimistic in recent years (see chart 4). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Our findings come with caveats. We have focused on a single platform, which may not be representative of other social media in China. Indeed, our results could be subject to selection effects, where users of different dispositions flock to certain sites. Baidu Tieba tends to attract an older crowd. And algorithms have trouble detecting irony and sarcasm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless, the results are worthy of discussion. Take the differences across generations. Those born in the 1980s are the least glum. Growing up in hardship, they experienced the benefits of reform and opening and took advantage of the opportunities presented by China&#39;s economic boom. Those born in the 1990s, by contrast, are the most downbeat. They grew up during the boom years, in the heyday of globalisation, but are entering the workforce just as the economy stagnates and China turns inward. Some may once have entertained hopes of political liberalisation, which were gradually snuffed out as Mr Xi consolidated power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disillusioned youngsters commonly express feelings of exhaustion and resignation. Some talk of “lying flat”, or dropping out of the rat race and abandoning material ambitions that do not seem attainable. The notion of “letting it rot” is even more nihilistic: it describes an attitude of self-indulgence. Those born in the 1990s used this phrase most often in our analysis. For a sense of what it means in practice, consider Qin, whom we met in Huizhou. He is 30 and used to work in a factory. The pay was not enough for him to afford much of a life. Clutching a beer outside an internet bar, he says he now has a part-time job in construction. “I work a few days, then play a few days.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Young people are pulling back in other ways, too. “Why would I get married? Why would I go on a date?” asks Qin, citing the cost of each. High house prices are a particular concern for young men because home-ownership is often seen as a prerequisite for marriage. Dowries, which more traditional families demand for marrying their daughters, have been increasing. Some ask for sums that would bankrupt prospective grooms and their families. Such economic burdens, along with changing societal views, have resulted in a decline in marriages. Around 6.8m couples got hitched last year, about half the number of a decade ago.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A surprising number of young couples are not even having sex. In a survey conducted in 2020, 14.6% and 10.1% of partnered men and women born between 1995 and 2003 reported having had no sex in the past year. A trio of scholars at Peking University and Fudan University, evaluating these figures, wrote, “Whether and why sex has lost its appeal for a large fraction of young people needs to be further studied.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> None of this bodes well for China&#39;s dismal fertility rate (the number of children a woman can be expected to have in her lifetime). It fell to a historic low of 1.2 in 2021—far below the replacement rate of 2.1. Besides home prices, analysts point to the rocketing cost of child-rearing as a factor. YuWa Population Research, a think-tank in Beijing, calculated the average cost of raising a first child to the age of 18 at 485,000 yuan ($67,000) in 2019. That equated to nearly seven times China&#39;s <small>gdp</small> per person, one of the highest rates in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Efforts to remedy the situation have been unsuccessful. In 2016 the government swapped the one-child policy for a two-children-per-couple limit. In 2021 it switched to a three-children policy, now more a goal than a cap. Incentives such as cash handouts, tax breaks and longer maternity leave have not made much difference. Last year, when a young man was told by police that the punishment for violating pandemic-control rules would affect his family for three generations, he responded, “We are the last generation, thank you.” The exchange, caught on video, went viral, his defiant words transformed into another cynical meme (until it was censored).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some young people who can afford to are looking to leave China. Last year netizens took to using a Chinese character that sounds like the English word <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/05/05/chinas-young-elite-are-considering-moving-abroad">“run”</a> as a coded way of talking about emigration. Reports of well-heeled Chinese leaving for places such as Singapore are common. The number of Chinese trying to get to the United States via Latin America has <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/08/14/return-to-china-xing-would-rather-die-in-the-jungle">surged</a> .</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Eat this</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s leaders are not blind to these trends, but they are not wholly sympathetic. Mr Xi cites the gruelling hardships suffered by previous generations of youngsters as a model to emulate, not a nightmare to leave behind. He came of age during the Cultural Revolution, a period of Maoist madness from 1966 to 1976. (Mr Xi&#39;s father was one of many officials deemed insufficiently loyal and tortured; his half-sister took her own life.) Only a teenager at the time, Mr Xi was sent to the countryside, along with millions of other city dwellers, to learn from the peasants. Unable to cope, he ran back to Beijing. But after being returned to the village, he learned the virtues of hard work, according to party lore. Mr Xi was supposedly the first to jump into the cesspool to shovel manure. He believes today&#39;s youngsters should seek their own enlightening hardships.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, he has tried to respond to some of the underlying causes of young people&#39;s despair. Policymakers have repeated the mantra that “housing is for living in, not for speculation”, a slogan that reflects concern for people priced out of owning a home by people who own several. Regulators have urged e-commerce firms like Meituan, a food-delivery company, to improve pay and conditions for gig workers, softening the algorithms that punish them for late deliveries. They also cracked down on private tutoring businesses after Mr Xi warned that the industry had become a “social problem”, exploiting the educational anxieties of China&#39;s parents.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This regulatory storm, as it became known, was part of Mr Xi&#39;s grander pursuit of “common prosperity”, an effort to narrow inequality and “improve the channels of upward mobility” that many disillusioned youngsters believe are blocked. Along the way authorities made examples of some of China&#39;s wealthiest business celebrities by arresting them or, as with Mr Ma of Alibaba, forcing them out of public life. Mr Ma gave up control of his company and now lives in relative obscurity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the government&#39;s moves have mostly backfired. The public humiliation of tech entrepreneurs was a punch in the stomach for ambitious youngsters inspired by their example (though young leftists have celebrated the party&#39;s humbling of billionaires). And the regulatory crackdowns on their companies, as well as on property developers, have hobbled some of the most reliable employers of China&#39;s university-educated youth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Communist Party propaganda has played down the young generation&#39;s jobless woes. The <i>Economic Daily</i> , a party newspaper, said in July that many youngsters were simply choosing “slow employment”—a phrase that was widely mocked online. A recent report from the China Macroeconomy Forum, a think-tank at Renmin University of China, takes a dimmer view. It concluded the problem of youth unemployment may not abate for a decade, with potentially bigger ramifications for the country&#39;s leadership. “If it is not handled properly, it will cause other social problems beyond the economy, and it could even ignite the fuse of political problems,” the report said.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disaffected young people are a <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/01/21/might-freedom-seeking-youths-rise-up-again">recurrent wild card</a> in Chinese politics. In 1919 thousands of students took to the streets to protest against China&#39;s harsh treatment by its allies at the end of the first world war and to demand modernising reforms.文化大革命期间，当毛泽东释放了他的红卫兵（其中许多是青少年）时，年轻人再次成为焦点。 And in 1989 students flocked to Tiananmen Square in Beijing to demand more freedoms. Thousands may have been killed in the crackdown that followed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Since then students have played a far more muted role in political life. Three years of harsh covid-19 controls pushed some to breaking point. In November, after deaths from a fire in Xinjiang were blamed on covid restrictions, young people <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows">gathered in the streets</a> and on campuses across China to protest. They held up blank sheets of paper in a nod to China&#39;s curbs on free expression. But these protesters probably numbered in the hundreds, not thousands, in a country of 1.4bn. More broadly there appears to be no real sense of revolutionary zeal among today&#39;s youth.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> No-motivation nation</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The danger China&#39;s leaders face is not so much a social eruption as social erosion, an unspectacular but unremitting loss of the “vitality, stamina and hope” that Mr Xi claims the young can impart to Chinese socialism. This enervation might manifest itself in a variety of ways. Chinese women may give birth later or not at all, contributing to a decline in population. Forecasts for China&#39;s economy often assume rates of childbirth will enjoy a modest rebound, based on the record of other low-fertility countries. But most of those reference points are European countries with strong welfare systems that permit a better balance between family and career.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China is relying on increases in “human capital” (like education) to offset its decrease in humans. But the lying-flat phenomenon and high graduate unemployment show that is not enough. The tightening grip of the authorities over civil society, popular culture and entrepreneurs also would seem to discourage the risk-taking that marked earlier generations.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some of China&#39;s best-educated youngsters will no doubt emigrate. Others are seeking a different kind of safe harbour. Applications for the civil service are expected to jump again this year. And the share of graduates ranking state-owned enterprises as their first-choice employer has increased for three years in a row, according to the survey by Zhaopin. These businesses offer stability and security over dynamism and ingenuity. If China is to become the more innovative economy Mr Xi demands, it cannot afford to lose too many of its best minds to its least efficient firms. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A delivery rider takes a rest on his bike in Beijing" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Phoning it in</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: AP</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Does Mr Xi understand this? His thoughts on how to achieve national greatness have evolved, along with his message to young people. A few months after coming to power in 2012 he met a group of young entrepreneurs, volunteers and students, telling them to “dare to dream, to bravely chase their dreams and to strive to fulfil them”. Their ambitions will make China great, he said. One beaming participant, who had recently climbed Mount Everest, said it was a good time to be young.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但现在，习近平表示，民族复兴的“中国梦”要通过关注集体目标来实现，而不是通过鼓励个人愿望来实现。他告诫年轻人要听党话、坚强起来，“像我们的父辈那样，把青春的热血刻在历史的丰碑上”。很少有年轻人将这一信息牢记在心。被告知要吃苦味，他们宁愿让它腐烂。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

e190yofl0"> <span>8</span><small>月</small><small>11日</small>，沙特阿拉伯最大的足球赛事——沙特职业联赛将在2023-24赛季拉开帷幕。上赛季的比赛并没有让人们兴奋不已。平均只有 9,300 名球迷观看比赛。过去五个赛季中的三个赛季，最佳射手都是摩洛哥人阿卜杜拉扎克·哈姆达拉（Abderrazak Hamdallah），他从未为任何世界顶级俱乐部效力过。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但这个赛季可能会有所不同。哈姆达拉先生的球队阿尔伊蒂哈德刚刚从皇家马德里签下了2022年世界最佳球员金球奖获得者卡里姆·本泽马和来自切尔西的明星中场球员恩戈洛·坎特。五次金球奖得主克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多 (Cristiano Ronaldo) 一月份从曼联转会到另一家沙特俱乐部阿尔纳斯尔 (Al Nassr)。前利物浦边锋萨迪奥·马内加入了他的行列，而利物浦队长乔丹·亨德森则与艾提法克签约。这样的例子还在继续。今年夏天，沙特联赛球队的转会费用已超过 4.8 亿美元，跻身全球足坛支出最高的球队之列。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">职业联赛的举措只是沙特阿拉伯斥资数十亿美元进军全球体育运动的一部分，该计划得到了沙特王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（ <small>MBS</small> ）的支持。它远远超出了足球的范围，正在席卷全球高尔夫、一级方程式赛车、拳击等领域。 <small>mbs</small>的目标是利用体育让沙特阿拉伯实现现代化，并改变外界对这个拥有 3600 万人口的沙漠王国的看法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特的挥霍发生之际，全球体育产业正受到数字颠覆和新一轮私募股权投资浪潮的冲击。愤世嫉俗者指责<small>王储</small>的虚荣工程和“体育洗牌”——利用体育来粉饰该国侵犯人权的声誉。沙特官员对此类批评感到愤怒。沙特驻<small>华盛顿</small>大使馆的法赫德·纳泽尔表示，沙特进行体育洗牌的想法“与事实相差甚远”。他说，这种说法充满了“种族中心主义”的味道：他说，一切都是为了沙特阿拉伯及其公民而不是西方人而做的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">许多观察家认为，这些举措不仅会改变沙特阿拉伯，还会改变全球体育本身，从古板的西方球队和锦标赛守护者手中夺取主动权，并引入一支充满活力的新力量。这项支出已经持续了好几年，但直到最近，其全部范围还被分散枪的方法所掩盖。体育产业的投资和谈判发生在多个层面，包括购买球员、购买国外俱乐部、发展国内俱乐部以及购买或发展国内外赛事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些交易是由一系列沙特实体发起的，其中包括政府本身、公共投资基金（ <small>pif</small> ）、主权财富基金，甚至是世界上最赚钱的石油公司沙特阿美公司。其规模令人印象深刻，在六项主要体育项目上花费了至少 100 亿美元。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">豪威，小伙子们</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">2021 年，沙特领导的财团以<small>3.91</small>亿美元的价格收购了纽卡斯尔联队，这是一支传奇但陷入困境的英超球队。除了发展国内联赛外，人们还强烈猜测沙特阿拉伯将效仿邻国卡塔尔在 2022 年举办世界杯的脚步，申办 2030 年世界杯。据信，海湾资金支持了 2021 年举办世界杯的尝试。创建了一个欧洲超级联赛，但在球迷的反对下崩溃了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在高尔夫领域，美国的主要机构<small>美巡赛</small>刚刚同意与沙特新贵锦标赛丽芙高尔夫<small>(liv</small> Golf) 合并，丽芙高尔夫 (liv Golf) 向顶级球员提供数亿美元来改变他们的忠诚度，从而使这项运动陷入混乱。另一个组织机构欧洲<small>dp</small>世界巡回赛也是该交易的一部分。唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 的课程经常举办<small>生活</small>活动，他将其描述为“美丽而迷人的交易”。两位左翼参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）和罗恩·怀登（Ron Wyden）最近在致<small>美国</small>司法部的公开信中谴责“沙特政权最近试图净化其暴行”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特阿拉伯在吉达举办了一场新的一级方程式大奖赛，并正在首都利雅得附近修建一条赛道；据报道，沙特投资者去年曾考虑出价 200 亿美元收购整个一级方程式赛车。沙特体育部长驳斥了这些报道，称其“纯粹是猜测”。沙特阿美公司仍然是<small>f</small> 1 的主要赞助商。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">男子<small>ATP</small>网球巡回赛的一名官员承认与可能的投资者进行了“积极”的谈判，其中包括<small>pif</small> 。女子网球巡回赛<small>WTA</small>正在考虑是否在沙特举办赛事，一位官员最近到访了沙特。该王国现在举办大型拳击比赛、摔跤比赛和电子竞技比赛。尽管气候恶劣，但它还是被选为2029年亚洲冬季运动会的举办地。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">他们自己的联盟</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国家为什么要大力发展体育事业？虚荣和嫉妒起了一定作用。许多沙特王室成员都是粉丝。他们已经在其他地方投资了团队，现在想要一些自己的团队。他们还希望受到全球体育精英的重视。 <small>PIF</small>州长亚西尔·鲁迈扬 (Yasir Al-Rumayyan) 是一位高尔夫球迷。最近国会就<small>PGA</small><small>图利夫</small>交易举行的听证会公布的文件表明，交易中提出的一个想法是，他可能会获得美国最尊贵的俱乐部奥古斯塔的会员资格。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特人目睹了邻国的挺身而出。卡塔尔乔治城大学的丹耶尔·雷奇 (Danyel Reiche) 表示，这项比赛始于 1993 年。那是卡塔尔首次举办<small>atp</small>男子网球锦标赛（鲍里斯·贝克尔获胜）。它花费了2000亿美元准备举办2022年世界杯。其中一位王室成员还拥有法国顶级俱乐部巴黎圣日耳曼队。曼城由阿布扎比皇室拥有，现在是世界上最有价值的足球品牌。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但沙特的计划远远超出了为其精英阶层提供福利和与邻国保持同步的范围。强劲的能源价格和产量意味着今年其石油出口预计将超过 1660 亿美元，即<small>GDP</small>的 16%。随着全球能源转型的迫在眉睫，沙特的“2030愿景”计划旨在通过发展新产业和经济自由化（包括让更多女性加入劳动力队伍），实现经济多元化，摆脱对石油的依赖。 <small>PIF</small>是一个关键参与者，利用其超过 7000 亿美元的资金将资本重新部署到新的经济领域，并对品牌和技术进行战略投资。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特王国希望沙特职业联赛能够吸引投资和球迷。它的目标是到 2030 年每年接待 1 亿游客（2021 年为 6400 万）。官员们希望到那时联盟的收入将翻两番，达到 4.8 亿美元，尽管与去年收入十倍的<small>英超联赛</small>相比，这仍然相形见绌。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">希望体育运动能够对其他经济领域产生溢出效应。其中一部分是在一个以宗教冲突、极端主义和战争闻名的地区进行品牌重塑。 “每个人都应该为该地区的繁荣而共同努力，而不是陷入冲突，而沙特希望被视为处于这一领域的最前沿，”纽约智库外交关系委员会的史蒂文·库克解释道。约克。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更好的品牌和更多的活动可以提振旅游业，政府希望旅游业占<small>GDP</small>的比重从 2019 年的 3% 增加到 2030 年的 10%。当你想成为度假胜地时，明星力量会有所帮助：莱昂内尔·梅西 (Lionel Messi)，也许是足球界的明星最伟大的球员是沙特旅游大使，他在 Instagram 上向他的 4.82 亿粉丝发布沐浴在阳光下的照片。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">体育甚至可以作为社会改革的补充机制。近年来，沙特政府越来越接受男女在公共场合混合，并采取了一些措施来遏制过于热心的宗教警察。 2018 年，女性终于被允许开车。现在，它不仅支持男性运动，还支持女性运动。沙特女足三月份首次获得<small>国际足联</small>排名。所有这些可能会让这个国家对女性游客更具吸引力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">卡塔尔大学体育管理助理教授瓦迪赫·伊沙克表示，在整个地区，举办体育赛事“普遍受到居民的积极评价”。沙特驻华盛顿大使馆纳泽尔先生指出，沙特70%的人口年龄在35岁以下，年轻人热爱体育赛事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">总体规划面临两大风险。首先是它的商业模式可能行不通。海湾业主显然可以经营好体育业务。曼城在阿联酋投资者的<small>带领</small>下蓬勃发展（尽管<small>英超联赛</small>在二月份指责其涉嫌违反财务规则，但俱乐部否认了这一指控）。在沙特拥有所有权的第一年，纽卡斯尔联队花费了大约 1 亿英镑（1.26 亿美元）并摆脱了降级区。在第二场比赛中，俱乐部获得第四名，20年来首次获得参加欧洲主要俱乐部赛事冠军联赛的资格。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，在沙特阿拉伯，体育是一个国家支持的项目，而不是一个企业关注的项目，可能会带来一些问题。 6月，一些此前由体育部控制的顶级足球俱乐部名义上被私有化。但<small>pif</small>拥有四支球队75%的股份。石油公司阿美公司(Aramco)还有另一支球队，而在沙漠中兴建的大都市尼奥姆( <small>neom)</small>也有一支乙级球队。巴黎斯科玛商学院的西蒙·查德威克 (Simon Chadwick) 表示：“这几乎就像沙特阿拉伯的足球俱乐部变成了 quangos。”体育运动可能不会成为经济的新动力引擎，而可能成为其旧的、国营赞助体系的体现。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了吸引明星，片酬必须很高。 Mr Benzema reportedly signed a two-year contract worth $440m and Mr Ronaldo is rumoured to be earning $200m per year.今年夏天，阿尔希拉尔向巴黎圣日耳曼队提出了创纪录的 3 亿欧元（3.3 亿美元）报价，收购法国球星凯利安·姆巴佩，但到目前为止，姆巴佩已拒绝。高尔夫球手菲尔·米克尔森 (Phil Mickelson) 从丽芙高尔夫<small>(liv</small> Golf) 中赚了 2 亿美元，尽管他曾形容沙特队是“可怕的混蛋”（他后来道歉）。巨额工资意味着即使是最成功的欧洲球队也很难赚钱。 2022 年，<small>英超</small>联赛中超过一半的球队都出现了亏损，意大利、德国和西班牙的联赛整体上都处于亏损状态。 （Exor 持有<i>《经济学人</i>》母公司的股份，也是意大利足球俱乐部尤文图斯和意大利汽车制造商法拉利的投资者。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由于拥有石油财富，沙特的实验不会让银行倾家荡产。根据<small>pif</small> 2021年年报，休闲娱乐仅占其资产的1.6%。但国内收入低和成本高可能意味着许多沙特体育企业在没有补贴的情况下无法维持自身或在全球竞争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特阿拉伯可能会面临一些与中国相同的足球问题，中国在过去十年中试图提高中超联赛的命运。身价昂贵的引进球星可能会抱怨足球的水平，并且人们会对当前支出水平的可持续性产生很多怀疑。但国家对联盟的支持将消除阻碍中国项目的财务问题和政治审查。沙特也在努力吸引年轻的天才，而不仅仅是像美国那样，许多来自欧洲俱乐部的顶级球员传统上都会去美国度过晚年。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但沙特国内观众较少也可能阻碍其雄心壮志。有一个新兴经济体在全球体育业务运营中发挥主导作用的例子。 2008年，印度推出了印度板球超级联赛（ <small>ipl</small> ）。去年，未来五年的比赛转播权以超过 60 亿美元的价格出售，使其成为世界上场均利润第二高的体育联盟，仅次于美式橄榄球比赛<small>NFL</small> 。印度的金融影响力使其在全球板球运动中拥有强大的话语权。但印度成功的基础在于其庞大的观众规模，有 14 亿热爱板球的公民。沙特无法与之匹敌。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="体育运动员达斯汀·约翰逊和乔丹·亨德森的拼贴画" width="1844"

2023 年世俱杯冠军。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是对旧观念的新诠释，即肮脏的政权利用体育来炫耀其政治模式，就像墨索里尼在 1934 年世界杯上所做的那样，希特勒在 1936 年奥运会上所做的那样。东德和苏联都有国家支持的兴奋剂20世纪70年代和80年代的节目。最近，中国在去年主办冬季奥运会时被指责进行体育洗牌，俄罗斯在 2018 年举办足球世界杯时也被指责。卡塔尔在 2022 年也面临着大量反击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如今，批评者指出沙特阿拉伯缺乏民主自由并压制妇女和同性恋权利。 2018 年，直言不讳的记者贾迈勒·卡舒吉 (Jamal Khashoggi) 在沙特驻伊斯坦布尔领事馆惨遭谋杀，人们并没有忘记沙特王国在<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/09/can-yemen-hold-together">也门血腥战争</a>中所扮演的核心角色。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">岛屿半岛</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而沙特阿拉伯的独裁政治可能不会阻止它在全球体育中发挥越来越重要的作用。欧冠资格已经在很大程度上平息了对沙特投资纽卡斯尔联队的批评。乔·拜登总统在 2019 年将沙特描述为“贱民”，现在热衷于修复美国的联盟。但它的声誉可能会让交易变得更加繁琐。美国职业高尔夫球协会<small>（PGA）</small>与图利夫高尔夫（ <small>Tourliv</small> Golf）的拟议合并引起了轩然大波，<small>美国</small>司法部正在对其进行评估，以确定其是否违反反垄断法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">上个月，<small>美巡赛</small>高管被传唤至参议院委员会。参议员理查德·布卢门撒尔抱怨说，该协议中的一项限制条款可能会阻止球员说沙特阿拉伯的坏话，“这几乎是我所见过的最广泛的非贬低条款”。<small>美巡赛</small>的这笔交易的支持者无疑热衷于暗示沙特将扮演后座角色：这可能与 mbs

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">三年前，随着<span>新</span><small>冠肺炎 (covid-19) 在全球蔓延</small>，许多人仔细研究了之前一场大流行病（1918-19 年的西班牙流感）的历史，以寻找有关这场灾难将如何展开的线索。现在瘟疫已经消退，历史也可能为灾后提供一些教训。随着第一次世界大战和西班牙流感的消退，利率较低，政府支出较高。通货膨胀飙升。为了使价格重新受到控制，美国央行行长提高了利率，引发了严重的衰退。美联储将其 1921 年的行动描述为“痛苦但……不可避免”，因为这是“前所未有的奢侈狂欢”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如今，美联储官员倾向于避免使用“狂欢”这个词，但他们也在努力应对类似的情况。他们一直在以 20 世纪 80 年代初以来最快的速度加息。鹰派经济学家认为，为了抑制通胀，美联储将不得不进一步提高通胀率，尽管这肯定会增加失业率并可能引发经济衰退。鸽派反驳说，美联储已经走得太远了，进一步的经济痛苦是不必要的。第三种可能性是，美联储正在采取正确的措施，经济将放缓，通胀消散，而不会出现衰退（行话是“软着陆”），直到最近还被认为几乎是不可能的。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">紧致狂欢</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">可能性仍然很大。自2022年3月以来，美联储已将短期利率从0%提高至5%。如此快速的增长往往与衰退同时发生。随着利率上升，借贷成本上升，消费者支出和企业投资都受到拖累。一般来说，利率增幅越大，阻力就越大。因此，在过去一年的大部分时间里，华尔街和企业董事会的主流观点是美国经济最终将陷入恐慌。截至 6 月，彭博社调查的经济学家预测未来 12 个月经济衰退的概率中值为 65% 左右。商业团体世界大型企业联合会 (Conference Board) 在 2 月份预测这一可能性为 99%。硅谷最受欢迎的宏观经济预测家斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒(Stanley Druckenmiller)最近表示，他预计经济将出现“硬着陆”，即企业利润下滑和失业率大幅上升。 </p><div

e190yofl0">最悲观的预兆是收益率曲线的极端倒挂。通常，长期债券的利率高于短期债券的利率，因为投资者期望持有未来成熟的证券的风险得到额外补偿。当短期收益率较高时，意味着投资者预计央行将降息，通常是因为他们认为经济增长将减弱。在过去的半个世纪里，倒挂在预示美国经济衰退方面有着近乎完美的记录，而且它们现在已经引起了麻烦一段时间了。 2022 年 10 月，收益率曲线在本次经济周期中首次出现倒挂，目前已严重倒挂。从倒挂开始到经济衰退开始的时间平均约为 350 天，这将使潜在的经济衰退在 9 月份开始。美联储纽约分行根据收益率曲线计算经济衰退的概率。 5 月份，它认为这一可能性超过 70%，是 1982 年以来的最高水平（见图 1）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其他指标也证实了这种黯淡的前景。根据密歇根大学一项备受关注的调查显示，消费者信心去年跌至历史最低点。硅谷银行和其他几家金融机构三月份的倒闭证明，快速加息正在损害脆弱的企业，而随之而来的金融不稳定加剧了经济逆风。银行提高了贷款标准，这是经济衰退迫在眉睫的另一个迹象。小型企业——美国经济的命脉——仍然极其悲观。自 2022 年底以来，制造业已经出现收缩，产出下降。经济学家之间的争论不再是关于经济衰退是否即将到来，而是关于经济衰退是长期还是短期、深度还是浅度。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，在过去几周里，人们的情绪发生了变化。尽管存在许多不祥的预兆，但经济健康状况最重要的指标——劳动力市场——仍然保持着惊人的弹性。失业率仅为 3.6%，略高于五年来的低点。春季失业保险申请人数的短暂上升已经逐渐减弱。美国连续30个月新增就业岗位，使总就业人数恢复至疫情前水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，通货膨胀正在消退。截至 2022 年 6 月的一年中，消费者价格上涨了 9.1%。截至今年 6 月的一年里，房价仅上涨了 3%，是两年多以来的最小涨幅。不包括能源和食品在内的核心通胀率较高，但经过几个月的停滞后，又再次朝着正确的方向发展。随着大流行后供应链的混乱，大多数商品的成本仅缓慢上升，在某些情况下甚至下降。根据私人指数，租金迄今为止是通货膨胀的一个重要因素，它正在下降，并且官方数据也可能很快开始下降。劳动力成本仍在上涨，但上涨速度已经放缓，这对餐厅餐饮、汽车维修、税务会计等价格来说是个好兆头。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">说通胀下降和劳动力市场强劲的结合是出乎意料的，这是一种轻描淡写的说法：许多经济学家认为这是不可能的。他们认为，就业和价格之间存在短期权衡：在其他条件相同的情况下，低失业率与通胀率上升相关，这种关系被称为菲利普斯曲线。在大流行之前的十年里，菲利普斯曲线就受到了质疑，因为尽管失业率大幅下降，通胀仍然保持静止。但去年通货膨胀的复苏使菲利普斯曲线重新流行起来，部分原因是大流行后劳动力市场的效率似乎降低了。争论的焦点不是失业率是否需要上升才能降低通胀，而是在物价得到控制之前需要有多少人失业。前财政部长拉里·萨默斯(Larry Summers)去年在一次备受讨论的演讲中表示，失业率可能需要攀升至10%。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">就业狂欢</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国确实有一个极度紧张的劳动力市场：太多的公司竞相雇用太少的工人。这通常会导致工资大幅上涨，从而导致通胀上升。反过来，抑制通货膨胀的明显方法是通过提高利率给企业带来足够的痛苦，从而使它们采取大范围裁员的方式。但平衡劳动力市场的另一个方法是增加工人的供给。这在一定程度上已经发生了：在 25-54 岁的人群中，84% 的人有工作或正在寻找工作，这是自 2002 年以来的最高比例。劳动力——已经回归：去年有超过 100 万人回流，这是 2017 年以来的最高数字。自 2020 年 2 月以来，经济增加了近 400 万个就业岗位，增长速度远远快于长期趋势。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

e190yofl0">与此同时，雇主们对于解雇工人一直犹豫不决。有些人很可能会囤积这些人才，因为他们发现过去几年很难招募到足够的人才。他们没有解雇员工，而是减少招聘。尽管没有裁员，但更多工人和更少招聘广告的最终结果是劳动力市场略微平静。高盛 (Goldman Sachs) 计算出，目前美国的就业岗位比工人多大约 320 万个。该数字仍高于 200 万，这被认为是就业市场不太紧张、不太宽松的最高水平，但这一超调远低于 2022 年初 570 万的峰值。随着职位空缺数量下降工资的持续上涨势头有所放缓（见图2）。鸽派经济学家即使没有完全宣布胜利，也开始大肆宣扬这些成就。国家经济委员会主席莱尔·布雷纳德 (Lael Brainard) 7 月 12 日表示：“经济正在违背预期，即如果就业机会没有大幅减少，通胀就不会下降。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另外两件事有助于解释美国的好运。首先，由于大流行的怪异现象，迫在眉睫的问题可能被夸大了。几个月来，经济学家关于经济衰退可能性的模型一直在闪烁红灯。但有理由认为这些模型可能给出了不可靠的信号。它们旨在在数据发生突然变化时预测出现问题。不过，最近这种转变反映了疫情过后经济的恢复正常，而不是经济的初现疲软。例如，与 2020 年相比，人们购买的笔记本电脑和健身自行车明显减少，这并不是因为他们大幅削减支出，而是因为他们在家工作的次数减少了。因此，制造业的疲软与其说是预兆，不如说是宿醉。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">收益率曲线倒挂也可能具有误导性。长期利率可能低于短期利率，并不是因为经济衰退迫在眉睫，而是因为一个更令人愉快的原因：随着通胀消退，美联储将能够降低利率。如果它能够在增长放缓之前实施这些削减，那么它将有很好的机会引导美国实现软着陆。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个因素与经济的潜在实力有关。货币政策可能从紧，但也存在抵消力量。一是政府支出。美国的预算赤字超过<small>GDP</small>的 5%——这在外界经济衰退和战争中是闻所未闻的。这就是把钱放到人们的口袋里。有很多理由担心这种财政慷慨的可持续性，但就目前而言，它对经济来说是一个缓冲。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乔·拜登担任总统头两年在民主党失去众议院控制权之前颁布的几项重大立法也开始影响经济。在 2021 年通过的基础设施法的推动下，高速公路、港口、发电厂等方面的支出约占每年<small>GDP</small>的 0.25%。对电动汽车、可再生能源和半导体的补贴似乎促进了私营部门投资的激增：与大流行前的水平相比，今年制造设施的支出实际增长了 70%，创下历史新高。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个抵消力量是家庭，其支出约占<small>GDP</small>的三分之二。他们为进入高通胀和利率上升时代做好了充分准备。在大流行期间，他们积累了价值约 2 万亿美元的“超额储蓄”，这是因为花钱的机会较少，而且接受了三轮刺激支票以及其他形式的政府支持。随着生活成本的上升，许多人已经动用了这些储蓄。尽管如此，美联储旧金山分行的研究人员估计，仍有剩余的额外储蓄——大约 5000 亿美元——足以维持今年的大部分时间。无论如何，这些储蓄的重要性已经不如以前了：几年来，名义工资增长首次超过了通货膨胀率，这意味着大多数美国人现在的实际收入在增加。 </p><div

e190yofl0">可能会出什么问题？政策滞后是一个已知的未知因素，但可能会拖累经济。滞后是指货币政策变化开始影响商业活动所需的时间长度。经济学家过去认为，利率上升可能需要两年多的时间才能波及经济。更严格的信贷标准尚未充分发挥其影响：例如，信用卡利率刚刚开始飙升，拖欠率可能还要过几个月才会随之上升。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但与此相反的是，有证据表明，在某些方面，由于金融市场的动荡，滞后性比以前要小得多。 For example, mortgage rates rose sharply in early 2022 prompted solely by the expectation that the Fed would soon begin raising rates, as indeed it did.房地产行业可以说是经济中对利率最敏感的部分，目前正处于小幅反弹的阵痛之中，销售和建设都开始增长（见图 3）。美联储制定的一项新的金融状况指数表明，总体而言，过去几个月，利率上升对经济增长的拖累实际上已经减弱，部分原因是美国股市的投资者预计美国股市上涨周期将会结束。费率。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">放荡的无精打采</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">值得注意的是，软着陆并不等于高速增长。离得很远。帮助控制通胀需要的是一段时期（可能是很长一段时期）增长放缓，这会降低经济温度。事实上，这样的插曲可能正在顺利进行。尽管<small>国内生产</small>总值在过去几个季度保持良好增长，但与其密切相关的国内总收入（ <small>GDI</small> ）却一直疲软。从理论上讲，两者应该是一致的。 <small>GDP</small>追踪经济中的所有最终支出，总结特定时期内的消费、投资、政府支出和净出口。 <small>GDI</small>跟踪与该支出相关的收入，汇总工资、利润和任何其他收入。事实上，两者永远不会完美匹配，因为它们来自不同的来源。最近，这种差距异常之大——这也许是与大流行相关的扭曲的另一个后果。今年第一季度<small>GDP</small>按年率计算增长2%，而<small>GDI</small>却下降1.8%。目前尚不清楚哪个数字更准确，但协调两者的一种常见方法是平分差异。这意味着增长已经非常低，进而可能进一步抑制通胀。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这种乐观的前景存在很大的风险。通货膨胀可能会再次变得顽固，就像过去两年一样。最近的乐观情绪很大程度上与六月份好于预期的通胀数据有关。从单一数据得出全面的结论从来都不是一个好主意，尤其是在潜在趋势如此不稳定的情况下。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使7月和8月通胀再次下降，也存在这样的问题：如果空缺职位数量继续大幅超过可用工人数量，那么通胀会降到多低。国际货币基金组织前首席经济学家奥利维尔·布兰查德和美联储前主席本·伯南克5月在一篇论文中估计，在目前劳动力市场紧张的情况下，失业率需要上升一段时间内将通胀率维持在4.3%以上，以将通胀率降至美联储的目标。这意味着大约 100 万人将不得不失业——这是一个不小的混乱。

e190yofl0">在这方面，经济的弹性令人不安。如果房地产反弹势头强劲，很容易刺激租金和商品价格上涨（所有这些新房都需要沙发、冰箱、地毯等）。如果工资继续以每年 5% 左右的速度增长，它们也将为服务业的价格设定一个底线。通胀预期虽然下降，但并不表明美联储一切都在掌控之中（见图 4）。强劲经济与粘性通胀之间的反馈循环将给美联储带来严峻挑战，使其别无选择，只能将利率提高到新的高度，届时对紧缩引发的衰退的担忧很可能成为现实。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">迄今为止没有出现经济衰退，这使得美联储能够避免在紧缩政策中面临任何严重的权衡。美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）和他的同侪因加息速度之快（尽管为时已晚）而受到高度评价。但考虑到就业市场的健康状况，他们很容易表现出坚决的态度。如果情况恶化，他们的决心将受到严峻考验。美联储前副主席理查德·克拉里达(Richard Clarida)表示，随着通胀率达到“两点目标”，美联储明年可能会逐步降息，而不是实际回到2%的目标。这可能有助于避免经济衰退。但这也代表着目标的转变，美联储容忍更高的通胀率，因为它不想造成痛苦的经济痛苦。这本身将使未来对抗通胀变得更加困难。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管存在所有这些风险，但美国迄今为止避免了硬着陆仍然值得注意。经济正从40年来通胀最高峰走上一条危险的道路。与传统观点相反，它在令人毛骨悚然的过程中成功地增加了数百万个就业岗位。它的下降还远未结束。但软着陆曾经是一个微弱的希望，现在已成为可能的结果之一。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>
