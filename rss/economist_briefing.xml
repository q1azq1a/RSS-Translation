class="article__body-text">但这个赛季可能会有所不同。哈姆达拉先生的球队阿尔伊蒂哈德刚刚从皇家马德里签下了2022年世界最佳球员金球奖获得者卡里姆·本泽马和来自切尔西的明星中场球员恩戈洛·坎特。五次金球奖得主克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多 (Cristiano Ronaldo) 一月份从曼联转会到另一家沙特俱乐部阿尔纳斯尔 (Al Nassr)。前利物浦边锋萨迪奥·马内加入了他的行列，而利物浦队长乔丹·亨德森则与艾提法克签约。这样的例子还在继续。今年夏天，沙特联赛球队的转会费用已超过 4.8 亿美元，跻身全球足坛支出最高的球队之列。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">职业联赛的举措只是沙特阿拉伯斥资数十亿美元进军全球体育运动的一部分，该计划得到了沙特王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（ <small>MBS</small> ）的支持。它远远超出了足球的范围，正在席卷全球高尔夫、一级方程式赛车、拳击等领域。 <small>mbs</small>的目标是利用体育让沙特阿拉伯实现现代化，并改变外界对这个拥有 3600 万人口的沙漠王国的看法。</p><p class="article__body-text">沙特的挥霍发生之际，全球体育产业正受到数字颠覆和新一轮私募股权投资浪潮的冲击。愤世嫉俗者指责<small>王储</small>的虚荣工程和“体育洗牌”——利用体育来粉饰该国侵犯人权的声誉。沙特官员对此类批评感到愤怒。沙特驻<small>华盛顿</small>大使馆的法赫德·纳泽尔表示，沙特进行体育洗牌的想法“与事实相差甚远”。他说，这种说法充满了“种族中心主义”的味道：他说，一切都是为了沙特阿拉伯及其公民而不是西方人而做的。</p><p class="article__body-text">许多观察家认为，这些举措不仅会改变沙特阿拉伯，还会改变全球体育本身，从古板的西方球队和锦标赛守护者手中夺取主动权，并引入一支充满活力的新力量。这项支出已经持续了好几年，但直到最近，其全部范围还被分散枪的方法所掩盖。体育产业的投资和谈判发生在多个层面，包括购买球员、购买国外俱乐部、发展国内俱乐部以及购买或发展国内外赛事。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些交易是由一系列沙特实体发起的，其中包括政府本身、公共投资基金（ <small>pif</small> ）、主权财富基金，甚至是世界上最赚钱的石油公司沙特阿美公司。其规模令人印象深刻，在六项主要体育项目上花费了至少 100 亿美元。</p><h2>豪威，小伙子们</h2><p class="article__body-text">2021 年，沙特领导的财团以<small>3.91</small>亿美元的价格收购了纽卡斯尔联队，这是一支传奇但陷入困境的英超球队。除了发展国内联赛外，人们还强烈猜测沙特阿拉伯将效仿邻国卡塔尔在 2022 年举办世界杯的脚步，申办 2030 年世界杯。据信，海湾资金支持了 2021 年举办世界杯的尝试。创建了一个欧洲超级联赛，但在球迷的反对下崩溃了。</p><p class="article__body-text">在高尔夫领域，美国的主要机构<small>美巡赛</small>刚刚同意与沙特新贵锦标赛丽芙高尔夫<small>(liv</small> Golf) 合并，丽芙高尔夫 (liv Golf) 向顶级球员提供数亿美元来改变他们的忠诚度，从而使这项运动陷入混乱。另一个组织机构欧洲<small>dp</small>世界巡回赛也是该交易的一部分。唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 的课程经常举办<small>生活</small>活动，他将其描述为“美丽而迷人的交易”。两位左翼参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）和罗恩·怀登（Ron Wyden）最近在致<small>美国</small>司法部的公开信中谴责“沙特政权最近试图净化其暴行”。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">沙特阿拉伯在吉达举办了一场新的一级方程式大奖赛，并正在首都利雅得附近修建一条赛道；据报道，沙特投资者去年曾考虑出价 200 亿美元收购整个一级方程式赛车。沙特体育部长驳斥了这些报道，称其“纯粹是猜测”。沙特阿美公司仍然是<small>f</small> 1 的主要赞助商。</p><p class="article__body-text">男子<small>ATP</small>网球巡回赛的一名官员承认与可能的投资者进行了“积极”的谈判，其中包括<small>pif</small> 。女子网球巡回赛<small>WTA</small>正在考虑是否在沙特举办赛事，一位官员最近到访了沙特。该王国现在举办大型拳击比赛、摔跤比赛和电子竞技比赛。尽管气候恶劣，但它还是被选为2029年亚洲冬季运动会的举办地。</p><h2>他们自己的联盟</h2><p class="article__body-text">国家为什么要大力发展体育事业？虚荣和嫉妒起了一定作用。许多沙特王室成员都是粉丝。他们已经在其他地方投资了团队，现在想要一些自己的团队。他们还希望受到全球体育精英的重视。 <small>PIF</small>州长亚西尔·鲁迈扬 (Yasir Al-Rumayyan) 是一位高尔夫球迷。最近国会就<small>PGA</small><small>图利夫</small>交易举行的听证会公布的文件表明，交易中提出的一个想法是，他可能会获得美国最尊贵的俱乐部奥古斯塔的会员资格。</p><p class="article__body-text">沙特人目睹了邻国的挺身而出。卡塔尔乔治城大学的丹耶尔·雷奇 (Danyel Reiche) 表示，这项比赛始于 1993 年。那是卡塔尔首次举办<small>atp</small>男子网球锦标赛（鲍里斯·贝克尔获胜）。它花费了2000亿美元准备举办2022年世界杯。其中一位王室成员还拥有法国顶级俱乐部巴黎圣日耳曼队。曼城由阿布扎比皇室拥有，现在是世界上最有价值的足球品牌。</p><p class="article__body-text">但沙特的计划远远超出了为其精英阶层提供福利和与邻国保持同步的范围。强劲的能源价格和产量意味着今年其石油出口预计将超过 1660 亿美元，即<small>GDP</small>的 16%。随着全球能源转型的迫在眉睫，沙特的“2030愿景”计划旨在通过发展新产业和经济自由化（包括让更多女性加入劳动力队伍），实现经济多元化，摆脱对石油的依赖。 <small>PIF</small>是一个关键参与者，利用其超过 7000 亿美元的资金将资本重新部署到新的经济领域，并对品牌和技术进行战略投资。</p><p class="article__body-text">沙特王国希望沙特职业联赛能够吸引投资和球迷。它的目标是到 2030 年每年接待 1 亿游客（2021 年为 6400 万）。官员们希望到那时联盟的收入将翻两番，达到 4.8 亿美元，尽管与去年收入十倍的<small>英超联赛</small>相比，这仍然相形见绌。</p><p class="article__body-text">希望体育运动能够对其他经济领域产生溢出效应。其中一部分是在一个以宗教冲突、极端主义和战争闻名的地区进行品牌重塑。 “每个人都应该为该地区的繁荣而共同努力，而不是陷入冲突，而沙特希望被视为处于这一领域的最前沿，”纽约智库外交关系委员会的史蒂文·库克解释道。约克。</p><p class="article__body-text">更好的品牌和更多的活动可以提振旅游业，政府希望旅游业占<small>GDP</small>的比重从 2019 年的 3% 增加到 2030 年的 10%。当你想成为度假胜地时，明星力量会有所帮助：莱昂内尔·梅西 (Lionel Messi)，也许是足球界的明星最伟大的球员是沙特旅游大使，他在 Instagram 上向他的 4.82 亿粉丝发布沐浴在阳光下的照片。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">体育甚至可以作为社会改革的补充机制。近年来，沙特政府越来越接受男女在公共场合混合，并采取了一些措施来遏制过于热心的宗教警察。 2018 年，女性终于被允许开车。现在，它不仅支持男性运动，还支持女性运动。沙特女足三月份首次获得<small>国际足联</small>排名。所有这些可能会让这个国家对女性游客更具吸引力。</p><p class="article__body-text">卡塔尔大学体育管理助理教授瓦迪赫·伊沙克表示，在整个地区，举办体育赛事“普遍受到居民的积极评价”。沙特驻华盛顿大使馆纳泽尔先生指出，沙特70%的人口年龄在35岁以下，年轻人热爱体育赛事。</p><p class="article__body-text">总体规划面临两大风险。首先是它的商业模式可能行不通。海湾业主显然可以经营好体育业务。曼城在阿联酋投资者的<small>带领</small>下蓬勃发展（尽管<small>英超联赛</small>在二月份指责其涉嫌违反财务规则，但俱乐部否认了这一指控）。在沙特拥有所有权的第一年，纽卡斯尔联队花费了大约 1 亿英镑（1.26 亿美元）并摆脱了降级区。在第二场比赛中，俱乐部获得第四名，20年来首次获得参加欧洲主要俱乐部赛事冠军联赛的资格。</p><p class="article__body-text">尽管如此，在沙特阿拉伯，体育是一个国家支持的项目，而不是一个企业关注的项目，可能会带来一些问题。 6月，一些此前由体育部控制的顶级足球俱乐部名义上被私有化。但<small>pif</small>拥有四支球队75%的股份。石油公司阿美公司(Aramco)还有另一支球队，而在沙漠中兴建的大都市尼奥姆( <small>neom</small> )也有一支乙级球队。巴黎斯科玛商学院的西蒙·查德威克 (Simon Chadwick) 表示：“这几乎就像沙特阿拉伯的足球俱乐部变成了 quangos。”体育运动可能不会成为经济的新动力引擎，而可能成为其旧的、国营赞助体系的体现。</p><p class="article__body-text">为了吸引明星，片酬必须很高。据报道，本泽马签署了一份为期两年、价值 4.4 亿美元的合同，而罗纳尔多则据传年薪为 2 亿美元。今年夏天，阿尔希拉尔向巴黎圣日耳曼队提出了创纪录的 3 亿欧元（合 3.3 亿美元）报价，收购法国球星凯利安·姆巴佩，但到目前为止，姆巴佩已经拒绝了。高尔夫球手菲尔·米克尔森 (Phil Mickelson) 从丽芙高尔夫<small>(liv</small> Golf) 中赚了 2 亿美元，尽管他曾形容沙特队是“可怕的混蛋”（他后来道歉）。巨额工资意味着即使是最成功的欧洲球队也很难赚钱。 2022 年，<small>英超</small>联赛中超过一半的球队都出现了亏损，意大利、德国和西班牙的联赛整体上都处于亏损状态。 （Exor 持有<i>《经济学人</i>》母公司的股份，也是意大利足球俱乐部尤文图斯和意大利汽车制造商法拉利的投资者。）</p><p class="article__body-text">由于拥有石油财富，沙特的实验不会让银行倾家荡产。根据<small>pif</small> 2021年年报，休闲娱乐仅占其资产的1.6%。但国内收入低和成本高可能意味着许多沙特体育企业在没有补贴的情况下无法维持自身或在全球竞争。</p><p class="article__body-text">沙特阿拉伯可能会面临一些与中国相同的足球问题，中国在过去十年中试图提高中超联赛的命运。身价昂贵的引进球星可能会抱怨足球的水平，并且人们会对当前支出水平的可持续性产生很多怀疑。但国家对联盟的支持将消除阻碍中国项目的财务问题和政治审查。沙特也在努力吸引年轻的天才球员，而不仅仅是像美国那样，许多来自欧洲俱乐部的顶级球员传统上都会去美国度过晚年。</p><p class="article__body-text">但沙特国内观众较少也可能阻碍其雄心壮志。有一个新兴经济体在全球体育业务运营中发挥主导作用的例子。 2008年，印度推出了印度板球超级联赛（ <small>ipl</small> ）。去年，未来五年的比赛转播权以超过 60 亿美元的价格出售，使其成为世界上场均利润第二高的体育联盟，仅次于美式橄榄球比赛<small>NFL</small> 。印度的金融影响力使其在全球板球运动中拥有强大的话语权。但印度成功的基础在于其庞大的观众规模，有 14 亿热爱板球的公民。沙特无法与之匹敌。</p><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1844"

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">第二大危险是激增引发反弹。体育可能是一个敏感的投资行业，而沙特阿拉伯作为独裁国家的地位也无济于事。一些人权组织指责沙特进行体育洗牌，例如<small>国际足联</small>授予沙特 2023 年世俱杯冠军。</p><p class="article__body-text">这是对旧观念的新诠释，即肮脏的政权利用体育来炫耀其政治模式，就像墨索里尼在 1934 年世界杯上所做的那样，希特勒在 1936 年奥运会上所做的那样。东德和苏联都有国家支持的兴奋剂20世纪70年代和80年代的节目。最近，中国在去年主办冬季奥运会时被指责进行体育洗牌，俄罗斯在 2018 年举办足球世界杯时也被指责。卡塔尔在 2022 年也面临着大量反击。</p><p class="article__body-text">如今，批评者指出沙特阿拉伯缺乏民主自由并压制妇女和同性恋权利。 2018 年，直言不讳的记者贾迈勒·卡舒吉 (Jamal Khashoggi) 在沙特驻伊斯坦布尔领事馆惨遭谋杀，人们并没有忘记沙特王国在<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/09/can-yemen-hold-together" data-tegid="tsb8tj5opcs6fqk613j30go04776tspp">也门血腥战争</a>中所扮演的核心角色。</p><h2>岛屿半岛</h2><p class="article__body-text">然而沙特阿拉伯的独裁政治可能不会阻止它在全球体育中发挥越来越重要的作用。欧冠资格已经在很大程度上平息了对沙特投资纽卡斯尔联队的批评。乔·拜登总统在 2019 年将沙特描述为“贱民”，现在热衷于修复美国的联盟。但它的声誉可能会让交易变得更加繁琐。美国职业高尔夫球协会<small>（PGA）</small>与图利夫高尔夫（ <small>Tourliv</small> Golf）的拟议合并引起了轩然大波，<small>美国</small>司法部正在对其进行评估，以确定其是否违反反垄断法。</p><p class="article__body-text">上个月，<small>美巡赛</small>高管被传唤至参议院委员会。参议员理查德·布卢门撒尔抱怨说，该协议中的一项限制条款可能会阻止球员说沙特阿拉伯的坏话，“这几乎是我所见过的最广泛的非贬低条款”。<small>美巡赛</small>的这笔交易的支持者无疑热衷于暗示沙特将扮演后座角色：这可能与 mbs 的愿景截然不同，在<small>mbs</small>中，沙特掌控一切，而不再只是“傻钱”。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4"

class="article__body-text">但即使一些交易没有像<small>本·萨勒曼</small>希望的那样改变这个国家，沙特阿拉伯也是正在改变全球体育的更广泛转变的一部分。来自沙特阿拉伯的资本激增是一批大规模投资体育的主权和私募股权基金崛起的一部分。彭博社报道称，2021 年私募股权公司在体育交易上花费了 510 亿美元，几乎是 2017 年总额的两倍。</p><p class="article__body-text">随着俱乐部和锦标赛寻求新的资金来源以保持竞争力，所有权规则正在放宽。美国体育联盟是世界上最赚钱的体育联盟（见图 1）。自2019年以来，美国几个大联盟放宽了规则，允许机构投资者进行少数股权投资。 7月，卡塔尔投资当局达成协议，购买美国篮球队华盛顿奇才队母公司5%的股份。</p></div><div

class="article__body-text">如今，美联储官员倾向于避免使用“狂欢”这个词，但他们也在努力应对类似的情况。他们一直在以 20 世纪 80 年代初以来最快的速度加息。鹰派经济学家认为，为了抑制通胀，美联储将不得不进一步提高通胀率，尽管这肯定会增加失业率并可能引发经济衰退。鸽派反驳说，美联储已经走得太远了，进一步的经济痛苦是不必要的。第三种可能性是，美联储正在采取正确的措施，经济将放缓，通胀消散，而不会出现衰退（行话是“软着陆”），直到最近还被认为几乎是不可能的。</p><h2>紧致狂欢</h2><p class="article__body-text">可能性仍然很大。自2022年3月以来，美联储已将短期利率从0%提高至5%。如此快速的增长往往与衰退同时发生。随着利率上升，借贷成本上升，消费者支出和企业投资都受到拖累。一般来说，利率增幅越大，阻力就越大。因此，在过去一年的大部分时间里，华尔街和企业董事会的主流观点是美国经济最终将陷入恐慌。截至 6 月，彭博社调查的经济学家预测未来 12 个月经济衰退的概率中值为 65% 左右。商业团体世界大型企业联合会 (Conference Board) 在 2 月份预测这一可能性为 99%。硅谷最受欢迎的宏观经济预测家斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒(Stanley Druckenmiller)最近表示，他预计经济将出现“硬着陆”，即企业利润下滑和失业率大幅上升。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">最悲观的预兆是收益率曲线的极端倒挂。通常，长期债券的利率高于短期债券的利率，因为投资者期望持有未来成熟的证券的风险得到额外补偿。当短期收益率较高时，意味着投资者预计央行将降息，通常是因为他们认为经济增长将减弱。在过去的半个世纪里，倒挂在预示美国经济衰退方面有着近乎完美的记录，而且它们现在已经引起了麻烦一段时间了。 2022 年 10 月，收益率曲线在本次经济周期中首次出现倒挂，目前已严重倒挂。从倒挂开始到经济衰退开始的时间平均约为 350 天，这将使潜在的经济衰退在 9 月份开始。美联储纽约分行根据收益率曲线计算经济衰退的概率。 5 月份，它认为这一可能性超过 70%，是 1982 年以来的最高水平（见图 1）。</p><p class="article__body-text">其他指标也证实了这种黯淡的前景。根据密歇根大学一项备受关注的调查显示，消费者信心去年跌至历史最低点。硅谷银行和其他几家金融机构三月份的倒闭证明，快速加息正在损害脆弱的企业，而随之而来的金融不稳定加剧了经济逆风。银行提高了贷款标准，这是经济衰退迫在眉睫的另一个迹象。小型企业——美国经济的命脉——仍然极其悲观。自 2022 年底以来，制造业已经出现收缩，产出下降。经济学家之间的争论不再是关于经济衰退是否即将到来，而是关于经济衰退是长期还是短期、深度还是浅度。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，在过去几周里，人们的情绪发生了变化。尽管存在许多不祥的预兆，但经济健康状况最重要的指标——劳动力市场——仍然保持着惊人的弹性。失业率仅为 3.6%，略高于五年来的低点。春季失业保险申请人数的短暂上升已经逐渐减弱。美国连续30个月新增就业岗位，使总就业人数恢复至疫情前水平。</p><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，通货膨胀正在消退。截至 2022 年 6 月的一年中，消费者价格上涨了 9.1%。截至今年 6 月的一年里，房价仅上涨了 3%，是两年多以来的最小涨幅。不包括能源和食品在内的核心通胀率较高，但经过几个月的停滞后，又再次朝着正确的方向发展。随着大流行后供应链的混乱，大多数商品的成本仅缓慢上升，在某些情况下甚至下降。根据私人指数，租金迄今为止是通货膨胀的一个重要因素，它正在下降，并且官方数据也可能很快开始下降。劳动力成本仍在上涨，但上涨速度已经放缓，这对餐厅餐饮、汽车维修、税务会计等价格来说是个好兆头。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">说通胀下降和劳动力市场强劲的结合是出乎意料的，这是一种轻描淡写的说法：许多经济学家认为这是不可能的。他们认为，就业和价格之间存在短期权衡：在其他条件相同的情况下，低失业率与通胀率上升相关，这种关系被称为菲利普斯曲线。在大流行之前的十年里，菲利普斯曲线就受到了质疑，因为尽管失业率大幅下降，通胀仍然保持静止。但去年通货膨胀的复苏使菲利普斯曲线重新流行起来，部分原因是大流行后劳动力市场的效率似乎降低了。争论的焦点不是失业率是否需要上升才能降低通胀，而是在物价得到控制之前需要有多少人失业。前财政部长拉里·萨默斯(Larry Summers)去年在一次备受讨论的演讲中表示，失业率可能需要攀升至10%。</p><h2>就业狂欢</h2><p class="article__body-text">美国确实有一个极度紧张的劳动力市场：太多的公司竞相雇用太少的工人。这通常会导致工资大幅上涨，从而导致通胀上升。反过来，抑制通货膨胀的明显方法是通过提高利率给企业带来足够的痛苦，从而使它们采取大范围裁员的方式。但平衡劳动力市场的另一个方法是增加工人的供给。这在一定程度上已经发生了：在 25-54 岁的人群中，84% 的人有工作或正在寻找工作，这是自 2002 年以来的最高比例。劳动力——已经回归：去年有超过 100 万人回流，这是 2017 年以来的最高数字。自 2020 年 2 月以来，经济增加了近 400 万个就业岗位，增长速度远远快于长期趋势。</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope=""

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，雇主们对于解雇工人一直犹豫不决。有些人很可能会囤积这些人才，因为他们发现过去几年很难招募到足够的人才。他们没有解雇员工，而是减少招聘。尽管没有裁员，但更多工人和更少招聘广告的最终结果是劳动力市场略微平静。高盛 (Goldman Sachs) 计算出，目前美国的就业岗位比工人多大约 320 万个。该数字仍高于 200 万，这被认为是就业市场不太紧张、不太宽松的最高水平，但这一超调远低于 2022 年初 570 万的峰值。随着职位空缺数量下降工资的持续上涨势头有所放缓（见图2）。鸽派经济学家即使没有完全宣布胜利，也开始大肆宣扬这些成就。国家经济委员会主席莱尔·布雷纳德 (Lael Brainard) 7 月 12 日表示：“经济正在违背预期，即如果就业机会没有大幅减少，通胀就不会下降。”</p><p class="article__body-text">另外两件事有助于解释美国的好运。首先，由于大流行的怪异现象，迫在眉睫的问题可能被夸大了。几个月来，经济学家关于经济衰退可能性的模型一直在闪烁红灯。但有理由认为这些模型可能给出了不可靠的信号。它们旨在在数据发生突然变化时预测出现问题。不过，最近这种转变反映了疫情过后经济的恢复正常，而不是经济的初现疲软。例如，与 2020 年相比，人们购买的笔记本电脑和健身自行车明显减少，这并不是因为他们大幅削减支出，而是因为他们在家工作的次数减少了。因此，制造业的疲软与其说是预兆，不如说是宿醉。</p><p class="article__body-text">收益率曲线倒挂也可能具有误导性。长期利率可能低于短期利率，并不是因为经济衰退迫在眉睫，而是因为一个更令人愉快的原因：随着通胀消退，美联储将能够降低利率。如果它能够在增长放缓之前实施这些削减，那么它将有很好的机会引导美国实现软着陆。</p><p class="article__body-text">第二个因素与经济的潜在实力有关。货币政策可能从紧，但也存在抵消力量。一是政府支出。美国的预算赤字超过<small>GDP</small>的 5%——这在外界经济衰退和战争中是闻所未闻的。这就是把钱放到人们的口袋里。有很多理由担心这种财政慷慨的可持续性，但就目前而言，它对经济来说是一个缓冲。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">乔·拜登担任总统头两年在民主党失去众议院控制权之前颁布的几项重大立法也开始影响经济。在 2021 年通过的基础设施法的推动下，高速公路、港口、发电厂等方面的支出约占每年<small>GDP</small>的 0.25%。对电动汽车、可再生能源和半导体的补贴似乎促进了私营部门投资的激增：与大流行前的水平相比，今年制造设施的支出实际增长了 70%，创下历史新高。</p><p class="article__body-text">另一个抵消力量是家庭，其支出约占<small>GDP</small>的三分之二。他们为进入高通胀和利率上升时代做好了充分准备。在大流行期间，他们积累了价值约 2 万亿美元的“超额储蓄”，这是因为花钱的机会较少，而且接受了三轮刺激支票以及其他形式的政府支持。随着生活成本的上升，许多人已经动用了这些储蓄。尽管如此，美联储旧金山分行的研究人员估计，仍有剩余的额外储蓄——大约 5000 亿美元——足以维持今年的大部分时间。无论如何，这些储蓄的重要性已经不如以前了：几年来，名义工资增长首次超过了通货膨胀率，这意味着大多数美国人现在的实际收入在增加。</p><div

class="article__body-text">可能会出什么问题？政策滞后是一个已知的未知因素，但可能会拖累经济。滞后是指货币政策变化开始影响商业活动所需的时间长度。经济学家过去认为，利率上升可能需要两年多的时间才能波及经济。更严格的信贷标准尚未充分发挥其影响：例如，信用卡利率刚刚开始飙升，可能还需要几个月的时间，拖欠率才会随之上升。</p><p class="article__body-text">但与此相反的是，有证据表明，在某些方面，由于金融市场的动荡，滞后性比以前要小得多。例如，抵押贷款利率在 2022 年初大幅上涨，仅仅是因为人们预期美联储将很快开始加息，而事实确实如此。房地产行业可以说是经济中对利率最敏感的部分，目前正处于小幅反弹的阵痛之中，销售和建设都开始增长（见图 3）。美联储制定的一项新的金融状况指数表明，总体而言，过去几个月，利率上升对经济增长的拖累实际上已经减弱，部分原因是美国股市的投资者预计美国股市上涨周期将会结束。费率。</p></div><h2>放荡的无精打采</h2><p class="article__body-text">值得注意的是，软着陆并不等于高速增长。离得很远。帮助控制通胀需要的是一段时期（可能是很长一段时期）增长放缓，这会降低经济温度。事实上，这样的插曲可能正在顺利进行。尽管<small>国内生产</small>总值在过去几个季度保持良好增长，但与其密切相关的国内总收入（ <small>GDI</small> ）却一直疲软。从理论上讲，两者应该是一致的。 <small>GDP</small>追踪经济中的所有最终支出，总结特定时期内的消费、投资、政府支出和净出口。 <small>GDI</small>跟踪与该支出相关的收入，汇总工资、利润和任何其他收入。事实上，两者永远不会完美匹配，因为它们来自不同的来源。最近，这种差距异常之大——这也许是与大流行相关的扭曲的另一个后果。今年第一季度<small>GDP</small>按年率计算增长2%，而<small>GDI</small>却下降1.8%。目前尚不清楚哪个数字更准确，但协调两者的一种常见方法是平分差异。这意味着增长已经非常低，进而可能进一步抑制通胀。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种乐观的前景存在很大的风险。 Inflation could prove stubborn again, as it has for the past two years. Much of the recent optimism has been tied to a better-than-expected inflation reading in June. Drawing sweeping conclusions from a single datum is never a good idea, not least when underlying trends are so volatile.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even if inflation falls again in July and August, there are also questions about how low it will go if the number of vacant jobs continues to outstrip the number of available workers to such a large extent. Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, and Ben Bernanke, a former chairman of the Fed, estimated in a paper in May that, at the current level of tightness in the labour market, the unemployment rate would need to rise above 4.3% for some time to bring inflation down to the Fed&#39;s target. That would imply that roughly 1m people would have to lose their jobs—no small dislocation. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230722_FBC036.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The resilience of the economy is, in this respect, discomfiting. If the rebound in housing gains steam, it could easily spur an increase in rents and goods prices (all those new homes need sofas, fridges, carpets and more). If wages continue to grow at about 5% annually, they, too, will put a floor under prices in the service sector. Expectations of inflation, although declining, do not suggest the Fed has everything under control (see chart 4). A feedback loop between a strong economy and sticky inflation would pose a stiff challenge for the Fed, leaving it with little choice but to raise rates to new heights—at which point fears of a tightening-induced recession might well come true.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The absence of a downturn to date has allowed the Fed to avoid confronting any serious trade-off in its tightening. Jerome Powell, the Fed&#39;s chairman, and his peers deserve high marks for raising rates as quickly, albeit belatedly, as they have. But it has been easy for them to be resolute given the health of the jobs market. Were conditions to deteriorate, their resolve would be sorely tested. Richard Clarida, a former vice-chairman of the Fed, says the central bank may ratchet down rates next year with inflation headed to a “two-point-something destination”, instead of actually back to its target of 2%. That might help to avoid a recession. But it would also represent a shifting of the goalposts, with the Fed tolerating a higher rate of inflation because it does not want to inflict wrenching economic pain. That, in itself, would make it harder to fight inflation in the future.</p><p class="article__body-text"> All these risks notwithstanding, it remains remarkable that America has so far avoided a hard landing. The economy is winding its way down a treacherous road from the highest peak in inflation in 40 years. Defying conventional wisdom, it has managed to add millions of jobs during the hair-raising ride. Its descent is far from over. But a soft landing, once a faint hope, is now among the plausible outcomes. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 08:54:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/a9d4lsdn2nop513pvmea6lvj87dvhrj6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/20/could-americas-economy-escape-recession </item><item><title><![CDATA[The meticulous, ruthless preparations for a second Trump term]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Silhouette of a Donald Trump statue being assembled" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">image: Ben Hickey</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">B</span> <small>ROOKE ROLLINS</small> is sitting at her desk in Fort Worth, Texas, at the back of an anonymous, low-rise building.

Mrs Rollins worked in the White House under Donald Trump and briefly ran his Domestic Policy Council. She purchased her West Wing furniture when she left. Towards the end of Mr Trump&#39;s first term, she was in charge of putting together a policy agenda for his second one. After Mr Trump lost his bid for re-election in 2020, she set up a think-tank to continue that work, the America First Policy Institute ( <small>AFPI</small> ).</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small> aspires to be an administration-in-waiting. Its staff of 172 includes eight former cabinet secretaries from the Trump administration and 20 other political appointees. “I will leave things ready for the next Republican president,” Mrs Rollins says. Campaign-finance laws prevent her from saying so, but she means Mr Trump. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small> is the newest think-tank preparing for a second term for Mr Trump, but it is not the biggest. The Heritage Foundation, which prides itself on having done the preparatory work for Ronald Reagan&#39;s “revolution”, has its own presidential transition project. This is led by Paul Dans, a lawyer who worked in the White House&#39;s Office of Personnel Management during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency. In 1981 copies of a manual for government produced by Heritage were placed on the chairs of each of Reagan&#39;s cabinet members before their first meeting. Heritage is updating that idea, co-ordinating an effort by 350 conservative wonks and former administration officials to write a plan for government in time for the Republican primaries next year. Those who have criticised Mr Trump or his agenda will not be part of it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As well as drafting policies for each department, Mr Dans and his colleagues are building a list of potential recruits to serve in the next Republican administration. He likes to describe the effort as a conservative LinkedIn. Fully staffing an administration requires about 4,000 political appointees, 1,200 of whom must be approved by the Senate. Heritage and its allied think-tanks are vetting the people to fill those jobs now.</p><h2> Dismiss that which insults</h2><p class="article__body-text"> What would prove disqualifying? “If you kind of have shown yourself to have fought against the Trump administration, or there are issues where you&#39;ve actually been counter to it,” says Mr Dans. “You know where people stand by where they sit, so to speak. Their postings and social media, their allegiances over time can give people a pretty good picture.” Blaming Mr Trump for the ransacking of the Capitol in 2021, or supporting his impeachment in the days that followed, for example, would be enough to keep someone off the list.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Thanks to these efforts, the next Trump administration, if there is one, will have fleshed-out plans and the know-how to advance them. That would make it very different from Mr Trump&#39;s first term. “We didn&#39;t have the people because nobody thought we would win,” says Steve Bannon, who managed Mr Trump&#39;s campaign and was an influential figure at the beginning of his presidency. (Mr Trump fired Mr Bannon, but later stopped him being tried for misuse of funds from a non-profit group he headed by pardoning him.) </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Bannon mentions the National Security Council ( <small>NSC</small> ) as an example of the staffing problems the Trump administration faced. It struggled to come up with half the necessary number of political appointees, he says. They were an odd mixture of people like Michael Anton, a corporate <small>PR</small> man and apocalyptic political commentator, and old foreign-policy hands who turned out to be queasy about Mr Trump&#39;s courting of North Korea&#39;s dictator and his hostility to American allies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What was true of the <small>NSC</small> applies to other agencies, too. “You have got to hit the beach with three or four thousand guys,” Mr Bannon says. Mr Dans agrees. “In Hollywood they like to describe things as &#39;this meets that meets the other&#39;. This is the Manhattan Project meets the Empire State Building meets <small>D</small> -Day.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> The initial objective for this invading force is to capture the civil service. One lesson that Mr Trump&#39;s backers drew from his first term is that no policy matters more than control of the bureaucracy, because no policies can be implemented without it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> To that end Mr Trump&#39;s commandos will “deconstruct” the administrative state—the 300 or more federal offices that issue and interpret regulations. The philosophical version of this idea is that, over time, as the role of the federal government has grown from fighting wars and running the postal service into the Leviathan it is today, unelected bureaucrats have assumed powers that should belong to Congress. The Twitter version is that the deep-state liberals who thwarted Mr Trump when he was in office and have persecuted him since he left must be vanquished. Either way, Mr Trump&#39;s shock troops will try to wrest power back from the bureaucracy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In practice it is hard to see how government would function without the administrative state. Congress struggles to fulfil basic responsibilities like passing a budget on time. To imagine that the same body could act as, say, the regulator of financial markets is a stretch. That may be the point. The <small>MAGA</small> movement is not libertarian, but in many ways it would like the federal government to do far less than it does now.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The would-be Trump appointees plan to subdue the bureaucracy using Schedule <small>F</small> , shorthand for an executive order issued by Mr Trump in 2020 and rescinded by Joe Biden when he became president. It reflects a view that the federal bureaucracy, whatever its size, should not have any entrenched authority. For the first century of its existence, civil servants were appointed to jobs by the government of the day based on an algorithm of personal contacts and favours owed known as the spoils system. Then in 1881 a deranged office-seeker assassinated the president, spurring the passage of the Pendleton Act, which created a class of professional bureaucrats who stayed in their posts even as the presidency changed hands. Since the 1940s, when Franklin Roosevelt was expanding the government, it has been hard to fire federal bureaucrats, <small>AFPI</small> complains.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Many political appointees in the Trump administration believe that a minority of civil servants used their protected status to thwart or undermine the president&#39;s wishes. James Sherk, a policy adviser in the Trump White House who is now at <small>AFPI</small> , cites two cases on which lawyers in various government departments reportedly refused to work: one against Yale University for allegedly discriminating against Asian-Americans, and one aimed at protecting nurses from having to perform abortions. Schedule <small>F</small> would empower Mr Trump&#39;s appointees to remove perceived obstructionists at will.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “Schedule <small>F</small> is now, I think, Republican doctrine,” says Russell Vought, who ran the Office of Management and Budget under Mr Trump. “I don&#39;t know how a Republican gets elected and doesn&#39;t do that.” It would also be straightforward to enact: Mr Trump could just reissue his old executive order. Again, there is a reasonable version of this idea, in which a small number of recalcitrant civil servants lose their jobs, and a campaign version, where Schedule <small>F</small> becomes the instrument of Mr Trump&#39;s righteous purge of Washington.</p><h2> To be with those I like is enough</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The combined effect of appointing only loyalists and cowing the bureaucracy would be both to remove constraints on Mr Trump and to ensure his wishes are acted on more often. In his first term Mr Trump&#39;s opponents took some comfort from the idea that not all the people around him were true believers, and were willing to stall his most alarming ideas. The <i>New York Times</i> ran an anonymous piece by a political appointee who claimed there was an internal resistance within the administration that acted as a check on presidential power. In a second Trump term, there will not be any “grown-ups in the room”, as Mr Trump&#39;s detractors called such people. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/778/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/512/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/768/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/819/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1024/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1280/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1638/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="Silhouette of a Donald Trump statue being handed a spear" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Once a second Trump administration had bent the bureaucracy to its will, what policies would it pursue? The department-by-department plans being drawn up at <small>AFPI</small> , Heritage and elsewhere give some guidance. They involve some predictable fusillades in the culture wars, such as completing a wall along the border with Mexico and directing all federal officials to consider only people&#39;s biological sex, rather than “self-identified” gender. But some of the putative policy agenda is both more sweeping in scope and more of a break with past Republican orthodoxy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One such area is the economy. The new right is enthusiastic about the kind of industrial policy the Biden administration has pursued. “No one in Ohio…cares that the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial board doesn&#39;t like the <small>CHIPS</small> bill on free-market economic grounds,” JD Vance, a senator, recently told a gathering at American Compass, a think-tank, referring to a law subsidising semiconductor factories. In some cases Mr Trump&#39;s supporters would go further: Mr Vance advocates taxing companies that shift work offshore.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The main partisan disagreement over industrial policy is no longer whether to have one at all, but over the Democrats&#39; habit of smuggling diversity requirements and environmental goals into it. As the Republicans have become a more working-class party than the Democrats, people like Mr Vance have tried to synthesise a <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/13/the-american-left-and-right-loathe-each-other-and-agree-on-a-lot" data-tegid="ltmo4cs1bur7up9uh1alvvsbhfce2cai">new Republican position</a> that is both pro-labour and hostile to union leaders. His advocacy of subsidies for industry without “the woke bullshit” is probably more popular than the Biden administration&#39;s approach.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That enthusiasm for an active state coexists with a more conventional Republican programme of lowering taxes, coupled with a belief that well-intentioned efforts to cut poverty usually backfire. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks of making permanent the tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, some of which are due to expire in 2025. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy wonks also advocate attaching work requirements to Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) and other government benefits. In Arkansas, the only state to have implemented work requirements for Medicaid, a quarter of those enrolled in the programme lost their health insurance and there was no noticeable increase in employment. The reforms would at least save some money, but not enough to have much impact on the federal deficit.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Expensive industrial policy, lower taxes and only small reductions in benefits—in other words, less revenue and more spending—would not balance the books, much less trim government debts or refill the funds that pay for Medicare (subsidised health insurance for the disabled and the old) and Social Security (the state pension), which are due to run dry in the early 2030s. On past evidence the bond market is likely to continue to finance the growing gap between the government&#39;s income and expenditure. Investors might become nervous, however, if the Federal Reserve&#39;s independence were in question. Some Trumpists think it should be, since they do not like to cede so much power to unelected bureaucrats. That is a minority view, Mr Vought concedes, but could gain ground: “I guarantee that if that debate was in front of President Trump, that he wouldn&#39;t just throw you out of the Oval Office.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Another area in which a second Trump term could bend the arc of history is in environmental policy. In his first term emissions of greenhouse gases kept falling, even though he reversed many of Barack Obama&#39;s policies to slow climate change. Investors assumed that government policy would soon revert to a greener norm and coal-fired power stations have lifespans of several decades, so the administration&#39;s fondness for them was not enough to get new ones built. In this respect, too, a second Trump administration would be more methodical and better organised.</p><h2> Whatever satisfies the soul is truth</h2><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about ending “the war on fossil fuels” and makes untethered assumptions about how much bigger the economy would be without it. ( <small>AFPI</small> estimates that America&#39;s <small>gdp</small> will be 6% smaller by the end of this decade than it would have been without the Obama administration&#39;s emissions-reductions targets.) The argument is presented in both pragmatic and moral terms. Why should American oil stay in the ground while Saudi oil flows? And why should the use of fuels which can bring so much prosperity to so many be circumscribed? Never mind that Mr Biden&#39;s administration has granted more permits to drill than Mr Trump&#39;s did, that America is the world&#39;s largest producer of oil or that it is in the national interest to limit global warming.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America Firsters like oil, gas and coal and the relatively well-paid, manly jobs for high-school graduates they bring. They are also opposed to the green transition, which they see as unnecessary government meddling that raises energy prices for ordinary Americans. Both Kevin Roberts, who runs Heritage, and Mrs Rollins, who started <small>AFPI</small> , used to be senior figures at the Texas Public Policy Foundation ( <small>TPPF</small> ), a think-tank which opposes the development of wind farms and solar plants. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Over a quarter of Texas&#39;s electricity is generated by renewables, and <small>TPPF</small> has helped to propagate the idea that this makes the state&#39;s power grid unstable. Investors in renewables say Texas&#39;s electricity regulator has become hostile to new projects. <small>TPPF</small> , meanwhile, is battling renewables as far afield as New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where it has initiated a lawsuit against a big offshore wind farm on behalf of fishermen. If the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department were run by people who shared these instincts, investors in renewables would face the same sort of political risks as owners of coal plants.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A third area which is likely to see great upheaval if Mr Trump becomes president again is foreign policy. Among America First types, there is deep disagreement about Ukraine. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about facing the threat from Russia. Yet Mr Bannon says, “I don&#39;t give a shit about Ukraine—what I give a shit about is the invasion of America&#39;s southern border.” Mr Vought makes the same point in a more wonkish way: “Ukraine is being subsidised by our taxpayers to fight and not make strategic calculations that they would otherwise make if we weren&#39;t subsidising it. And it&#39;s not in our interest to subsidise that conflict.” Mr Trump himself says he would end the war. He may not be able to do that. But Ukraine and its other allies ought to take seriously the possibility that America may no longer be with them in 18 months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Policy towards China is less contested. The Trump administration was more confrontational towards China than any of its predecessors. The Biden administration has continued in the same vein, albeit with less inflammatory rhetoric and more considered policies. “The difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration on protectionism is that the Biden administration is competent,” says Dan Drezner of Tufts University. A second Trump term would be more likely to build on what the Biden team have done rather than, say, loosening export controls.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/778/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/512/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/768/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/819/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1024/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1280/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1638/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="Silhouette of a laurel wreath being lowered onto a Donald Trump statue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Heritage&#39;s plan for 2025 foresees an immediate ban on TikTok and also on Confucius Institutes. American pension funds would be encouraged to divest from “problematic” Chinese entities. The government should be prepared “to employ punitive policy measures” to prevent American investment in sensitive areas in China and Chinese investment in America. American companies considering large-scale investments in anything deemed critical would have to submit information about counterparties and anticipated use of funds to the <small>US</small> government before investing, “under a presumption of denial”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Whether Mr Trump would authorise the use of force if China were to invade Taiwan is hard to say. Some who worked in his administration note that whenever they were about to adopt tougher policies on China, the bosses of big American firms would call the White House and tell him that the move would alarm financial markets and he would back down. The same dynamic may apply in a second term. In a memoir of his time as Mr Trump&#39;s national security adviser, John Bolton suggests the former president was not really committed to Taiwan&#39;s security. Others claim he would be “stronger” than Mr Biden.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other allies could expect the same peremptory treatment as in Mr Trump&#39;s first term. He reportedly told aides he wanted to leave <small>nato</small> . Even <small>AFPI</small> , which on foreign policy is closer to the old Republican orthodoxy, thinks that military support should be withdrawn from countries that do not spend at least 2% of <small>GDP</small> on defence, a level that neither Japan nor most countries in <small>nato</small> meet. The modern America First movement, like its namesake during the second world war, contains some true isolationists. But it also contains an influential clutch of people like Elbridge Colby, who served in the Department of Defence and believes in a muscular foreign policy. He thinks China is such a threat that America should pull back from its defence commitments in Europe and the Middle East to concentrate on the Pacific.</p><p class="article__body-text"> No matter how well-laid the plans for a second Trump term, nor how thoroughly vetted the people carrying them out, Mr Trump would still be in charge, which means there is a limit to how methodical it could be. But it would be altogether more formidable than the version of 2017-21. As for the candidate himself, he is aware of the plans being made on his behalf but has never been excited by the details of public policy. For the professional wonks in the movement, that is an opportunity.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> “ <i>The Economist</i> doesn&#39;t think that populists can govern, right?” asks Mr Vought. “We believe we&#39;re trying to be an answer to that viewpoint. So we&#39;re trying to look systemically: how does someone who has an American First perspective, a populist perspective, govern credibly and effectively? Because they know the inner workings of government so well.” The winner of next year&#39;s presidential election will be sworn in in 18 months. The institutions of the new right expect it to be Mr Trump, and this time they will be prepared. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>通过<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">《制衡》</a>掌握美国政治的最新动态，这是我们的每周仅限订阅者的时事通讯，它探讨了美国民主的状况以及对选民重要的问题。 You can also read other articles about the <a href="https://www.economist.com/us-election-2024">elections of 2024</a> and follow along as we track <a href="https://www.economist.com/president-joe-biden-polls" data-tegid="hcqvn8gl89s7jjstumps8is95685q07j">shifts</a> in Joe Biden&#39;s approval rating.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 09:15:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/34fdaqhpnfv8mqucvmtb54fk4r3206ap</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/13/the-meticulous-ruthless-preparations-for-a-second-trump-term </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why China should be friendlier to its neighbours]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Border-defence police officers on patrol in Heilongjiang province, north-east China" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style><span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">图片：盖蒂图片社</span></figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">N</span> <small>o country has</small> more neighbours than China, with 14 land borders.

The inner ones formed territory under the emperor&#39;s direct rule. Then came neighbouring kingdoms such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam, which acknowledged the emperor&#39;s ultimate authority by paying tribute. Outermost were foreigners whose trade with China was often seen as tribute, too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Xi Jinping, China&#39;s present-day potentate, puts a 21st-century spin on this worldview. At home he has made himself the “core” of the Communist Party and crushed dissent, especially in border areas. Globally, he has made China a more assertive power. But his efforts to bind China&#39;s neighbours more closely to it—“to warm people&#39;s hearts and enhance our affinity, charisma and influence”, as he ordered officials in 2013—have not gone to plan.</p><h2> Twitchy in Tokyo</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Several neighbours are aligning themselves more closely with America, to counteract China&#39;s growing assertiveness. Most of those friendliest to China are unstable. Others fear its intentions. In recent votes at the <small>UN</small> , half of China&#39;s immediate neighbours broke ranks with it to condemn Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and only five backed a statement rejecting criticism of its policies in Xinjiang. That all speaks to a weakness in Chinese foreign policy that could undermine Mr Xi&#39;s ambitions. Put simply, can China really challenge American leadership in the world if it cannot get its own neighbours on board? </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Powerful countries often try to enhance their own prosperity and security by dominating their region in economic, military, political and cultural terms. In the modern era France, Germany, Japan and Russia have all sought local hegemony by force, with devastating consequences. The European Union has expanded peacefully, but remains a marginal power on defence and security. Only America has managed to dominate its region for a long time.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is partly owing to geography, which has helped America to keep other big powers at bay. But it has also bound itself to its neighbours through mutually beneficial arrangements, including a free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, close defence relations with both (especially Canada) and relatively open borders. American soft power helps, too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s neighbourhood is far trickier. It has 22,800km of land borders, more than any other country. In addition, all eight of its maritime borders are disputed. China&#39;s neighbours include big economic and military powers, such as India and Russia, with their own regional ambitions.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/776/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/255/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/383/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/511/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/766/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/817/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1021/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1276/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1634/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s neighbours fall into three broad camps (see map): fragile or failing states (Afghanistan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea and Pakistan), frenemies that have close ties but fear Chinese domination (Mongolia, Russia and Central Asian states), and places with either defence treaties with America or military ties to it (India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Chinese officials deny seeking regional hegemony. In their telling, China wants only to reclaim its rightful borders, not to expand them or dominate neighbours. They blame America for frustrating Chinese ambitions. “Western countries—led by the <small>US</small> —have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression against us,” Mr Xi complained in a speech in March.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America has indeed worked hard lately to improve ties with countries near China. Yet many of Mr Xi&#39;s problems with his neighbours date back to a time when they felt either neglected by America (during the presidency of Barack Obama) or alarmed by it (during the presidency of Donald Trump). Reservations about China stem instead from its own missteps, according to officials and academics in neighbouring countries. In particular, they cite excessive muscularity on territorial issues, haphazard or coercive economic policies and a heavy-handed approach to diplomacy that is rooted in China&#39;s imperial past and grand assumptions about its future. Most are unconvinced by China&#39;s reassurances, especially given its support for Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and the implication that might is right.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For 30 years after its inconclusive war with Vietnam in 1979, China took a conciliatory approach to territorial disputes, opting for stability as it focused on economic reform. Between 1991 and 2002 it resolved disagreements about its land borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Tajikistan and Vietnam. Perhaps most remarkably, in 2008, it signed the last of a series of agreements affirming Russia&#39;s control over a Ukraine-sized region annexed from China in the 19th century. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The tilt towards confrontation began before Mr Xi took power, but he has accentuated it, making territorial issues central to his pledge of “national rejuvenation”. China has, without doubt, succeeded in altering the territorial status quo to its advantage in the short term. Its ships and aircraft now regularly patrol around rocky specks where its claims overlap with Japan&#39;s in the East China Sea. The seven fortified artificial islands that it built on disputed reefs in the South China Sea have enhanced its capacity to enforce its claims there. In some contested border areas, Indian troops no longer patrol.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Those gains have come at a cost, however, by alarming China&#39;s neighbours. Japan adopted a new security strategy in December which pledged a doubling of defence spending by 2027 and a new counterstrike capability, moving away from the pacifist principles it has embraced since the second world war. Japan is also co-ordinating more closely on defence with America, including over Taiwan, and stepping up security co-operation with American allies and other Chinese neighbours.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi&#39;s approach to the South China Sea has also triggered a change of course in the Philippines, the only formal American ally among the five countries whose claims there overlap with China&#39;s. Its previous president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a “separation” from America in 2016, pledging to align with China&#39;s “ideological flow”. But relations soured after China continued to harass Philippine ships and failed to build promised infrastructure.</p><h2> Leery on Luzon</h2><p class="article__body-text"> A new president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, is now re-emphasising relations with America. In February he gave it access to four new military bases, including three in its north that could be useful in a war over Taiwan. In April the two sides held their biggest-ever joint military drills, involving 12,000 American troops. They are planning to resume joint naval patrols in the South China Sea. China, meanwhile, has warned the Philippines that it is falling “into the abyss of geopolitical strife”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Vietnam also has claims in the South China Sea and had several maritime stand-offs with China there in the 2010s. It, too, has drawn closer to America militarily. In 2018 it let an American aircraft-carrier visit one of its ports for the first time in more than 40 years. Two more have visited since, including one in June this year. America has also supplied Vietnam with defence equipment, such as aircraft, drones and coastguard cutters.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is another neighbour reassessing ties, after a series of clashes with China on their disputed Himalayan frontier over the past four years, one of which killed at least 20 Indian troops and four from China. That was among the deadliest such skirmishes since China won a brief border war in 1962. Bilateral trade has continued to grow (by 8.6% last year), but India has limited investment from China, banned dozens of Chinese apps and launched tax raids on several Chinese firms.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is also now working more closely with America and its allies on defence, bilaterally and as part of the Quad, which includes America, Australia and Japan. During a state visit to Washington in June, Narendra Modi, its prime minister, signed a series of deals on the defence industry which could eventually turn India into a base for the joint manufacturing of Western-designed weapons. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s perturbed neighbours are also collaborating more closely with one another. India has trained Vietnamese submariners, supplied Vietnam with 12 high-speed patrol boats and agreed to give it a missile corvette. India also recently sold cruise missiles to the Philippines. Japan has provided patrol craft for Vietnam and radar for the Philippines, which has also received three navy ships from South Korea since 2020 and is getting several more.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The economic picture is less clear-cut. China is an indispensable partner to all its neighbours, including those with conflicting territorial claims. Bilateral trade in goods with its 20 terrestrial and maritime neighbours was just over $2trn in 2022, an increase of 74% over the past decade. That is more than the combined trade of America and the <small>EU</small> with the same countries. In poorer ones, China is also a big source of investment. A trade deal called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which came into force in 2022 and involves China and eight of its neighbours, will further boost cross-border commerce.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But in aggregate China&#39;s neighbours sell more to America and the <small>EU</small> combined than they do to China (see chart). What is more, China has an unsettling habit of using its economic clout to punish neighbours that rile it. That, too, did not start with Mr Xi. An early example came in 2010, when China banned exports of rare-earth minerals to Japan after a clash in the East China Sea. Mr Xi, however, has expanded the practice.

After it hosted the Dalai Lama in 2016, China held up loans and customs clearances. Mongolia has since become even more dependent on trade with China, which buys about 84% of its goods exports (mostly coal). But Mongolia&#39;s government hedges through a partnership with <small>Nato</small> , which is helping it build cyber-defences, train officers in English and operate in conjunction with <small>Nato</small> forces (Mongolian troops have served in Kosovo and Afghanistan).</p><p class="article__body-text"> The row over the Dalai Lama also reinforced anti-Chinese sentiment in a country where many resent the treatment of their ethnic kin in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. A ban on teaching the Mongolian language there is especially unpopular. A former Mongolian president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, has called it an “atrocity that seeks to dissolve and eliminate Mongolians as an independent ethnicity”.</p><h2> Bruised in Busan</h2><p class="article__body-text"> But it is South Korea that stands out as an example of ill-judged Chinese arm-twisting. After Park Geun-hye became president in 2013, she sought closer ties with China, even attending a military parade in Beijing. Yet in 2017 China instituted an economic boycott after America deployed an anti-missile battery in South Korea, intended chiefly to deter North Korea, but which China also saw as a threat. Until then a regular survey by South Korea&#39;s Asan Institute that rates public views of other countries consistently gave China more than five out of ten. Last year it scored 2.7.</p><p class="article__body-text"> South Korea is now strengthening its alliance with America, and setting aside long-running differences with Japan, its former colonial ruler. The two are also joining American-led efforts to reduce China&#39;s role in their supply chains. That is creating new opportunities for others on China&#39;s periphery. Hyundai, a South Korean carmaker, said in May that it would invest $2.5bn in India over the next decade. And Vietnam (where South Korea is already the biggest foreign investor) said in December that Samsung and <small>LG</small> , two South Korean electronics makers, would invest another $6bn between them.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For China&#39;s poorer neighbours, investments in infrastructure help compensate for its domineering ways. Success stories include a cargo rail link across Central Asia that carries 8% of China-Europe trade, a railway from China to Laos, which began passenger services in April and could boost Laotian <small>GDP</small> by 21% according to the World Bank, and power projects that have increased blackout-prone Pakistan&#39;s generation capacity by 8 <small>GW</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet such initiatives are often undermined by a tendency to over-promise and to ignore local sentiment. In Nepal, China has not completed any of its promised Belt and Road projects. Malaysia has ditched several of them, alleging that costs were inflated. Debt problems related to Belt and Road have pushed Pakistan and Laos to the brink of default. And a civil war in Myanmar has delayed several big Chinese projects and further sapped support for China, which backs the hated military junta. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> China has also failed to stop shady Chinese businesses and criminal gangs from piggybacking on Belt and Road. Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines have all seen a huge influx of Chinese money and workers into gambling ventures, leading to an uptick in crime. They and other poorer neighbours still crave development assistance. But as China confronts an economic slowdown and scales back Belt and Road, many are looking to Japan, whose aid comes with less baggage.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A recent survey by Singapore&#39;s <small>iseas</small> -Yusof Ishak Institute found little faith in China among its South-East Asian neighbours. More people expressed distrust than trust of it in Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines. Japan was more trusted in all six of China&#39;s neighbours in the region and America more so in five. China also ranked below America, Australia and the <small>EU</small> as a place to visit or study.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even in Kazakhstan, which does well from its ties with China, people are wary. The tension is striking at Khorgos, a border crossing with a five-square-kilometre duty-free zone spanning the frontier. Rising mirage-like from the steppe, the Chinese side features two dozen multistorey malls selling everything from leather jackets to flat-screen televisions. It teems with Kazakh shoppers, closely watched by Chinese riot police with shields and batons. The Kazakh side, meanwhile, has only a couple of half-built low-rise malls, where customers are scarce and employees mostly Chinese.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Kanat Agibayev, a 22-year-old Kazakh law student, likes the cheap winter clothes and rucksack he just bought on China&#39;s side. But ask about Chinese investment in Kazakhstan, or a recent deal for visa-free access, and he echoes the fears of other interviewees: “We&#39;ll get swamped.” Russian propaganda fans such Sinophobia. But China has contributed, too, not least with its recent detention of up to a million Chinese Muslims, including ethnic Kazakhs, in re-education camps. In 2022 a survey by Central Asia Barometer found that only 35% of Kazakhs supported Chinese involvement in energy and infrastructure projects, down from almost half in 2018.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Then there are the chest-beating declarations of China&#39;s “wolf warrior” diplomats. In April alone China&#39;s ambassador in Manila appeared to threaten Filipino workers in Taiwan and the one in Paris questioned the legitimacy of former Soviet states. A month later Mr Xi hosted five Central Asian leaders at a summit infused with imagery from the Tang Dynasty, when China ruled much of Central Asia.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “It looked like an emperor receiving tribal chieftains,” says Bekzat Maqsutuly, a Kazakh activist detained for planning a protest against a deal signed at the summit permitting visa-free travel between China and Kazakhstan. A Kazakh official dismisses his complaints as “irrational”. Only 3,412 Chinese nationals work in Kazakhstan, government figures show. The visa deal will benefit Kazakh lorry drivers and business people as much as Chinese visitors. Even so, the official adds, Kazakhstan&#39;s future lies not in subordination to either Russia or China, but in close relations with lots of big powers, including America, Japan and the <small>EU</small> (Kazakhstan&#39;s biggest trade partner and foreign investor), as well as Turkey, which jointly produces weapons in Kazakhstan and is a member of <small>nato</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> None of this means that China&#39;s neighbours are turning their backs on it. Given its economic heft, that is unthinkable. But it points to a future in which Mr Xi&#39;s hegemonic ambitions are frustrated as the more stable and dynamic countries on his borders either resist his initiatives or hedge their bets, while the most volatile ones, with the dimmest prospects, become increasingly reliant on China&#39;s support. The challenge for America and its allies is to offer China&#39;s neighbours ever more ways to hedge. For Mr Xi, the question is more existential: can China accept relations with its neighbours in which it is anything less than pre-eminent? <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p>

True, prices are rising more slowly than in 2022, when the pace hit 9.1% in America, 10.6% in the euro area and 10.4% globally. But the view that this was just a passing lurch looks ever less plausible. Britain&#39;s rate has been stuck at 8.7% for two months.

Sustained price rises do not affect all asset classes equally, so a relative repricing will be required. But those one-off profits and losses will not be the only consequence. In the <a href="https://www.economist.com/economy">real economy</a> , inflation corrodes trust by continually and arbitrarily redistributing wealth. In the financial one this corrosive dynamic is less obvious, but just as real.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Central bankers remain adamant that they will return inflation to their targets, <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/04/04/the-fed-may-not-get-inflation-down-to-2-says-richard-clarida">typically 2%</a> . Many on Wall Street, though, are sceptical. Jean Boivin, who runs the research arm of BlackRock, the world&#39;s biggest asset manager, makes his argument bluntly. “Central banks can always bring inflation back to 2% if they really want to, but now it would require too big of a demand crush to bear.” He believes it will instead settle around 3-4%. Richard Clarida, vice-chair of the Federal Reserve from 2018 to 2022, has a similar view. “Mr Powell&#39;s Fed…will eventually get the inflation rate it wants,” he recently wrote for this newspaper. “But it is likely to be something more like &#39;two point something&#39; than &#39;two point zero&#39;.” Asked what “something” means, he replies: “It could be 2.8% or 2.9% when they start to consider rate cuts.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The likelihood of monetary guardians explicitly admitting that they will tolerate inflation above 2% is low. Every time Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is asked about the possibility, he vehemently denies it. Such a shift, especially with prices already rising much faster than 2%, would immediately damage the Fed&#39;s credibility: if the target can be ignored once, why not again?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet the forces ranged against central bankers, which will push up prices by constraining supply and boosting demand, are fearsome. Demographic trends are shrinking workforces in much of the rich world, which may lead to shortages of labour. The fragility of global supply chains—exposed by the covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and fracturing Sino-American trade—has incentivised countries to replicate them locally. On the demand side, higher defence spending, the investment required to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and the costs of supporting ageing populations are all increasingly seen as essential.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> Read more of our package on inflation:<br> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/22/investors-must-prepare-for-sustained-higher-inflation">Investors must prepare for sustained higher inflation</a><br> <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/21/britains-inflation-pain-is-mostly-self-inflicted-and-getting-worse">Britain&#39;s inflation pain is mostly self-inflicted and getting worse</a><br> <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/22/annual-inflation-of-114-is-pushing-argentina-to-the-right">Annual inflation of 114% is pushing Argentina to the right</a></p></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Rate-setters could, through ultra-high interest rates, destroy enough demand in other parts of the economy to bring inflation down to 2%. But with so many structural factors pushing prices up, the sceptics argue, this would involve inflicting a politically unacceptable level of economic damage. And the longer inflation remains above target the more it raises expectations of future price rises, which can then become self-fulfilling. The world may thus have entered a regime in which central bankers pay lip-service to their inflation targets but shy away from measures severe enough to meet them. In other words, 4% may be the new 2%.</p><h2> Another roll of the price</h2><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> An extra percentage point or two in the annual rate of inflation may not seem much. Yet the impact on investment returns is huge. Buy a ten-year government bond when inflation is 2%, and the principal that is eventually returned will be worth 82% of its original value. When inflation is 4%, that figure falls to 68% (see chart 1). Over the longer run the gap yawns even wider. The principal on a 30-year bond will, when returned, be worth 55% of its original value if inflation averages 2% over that time. With 4% inflation, it will be worth 31%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the erosion of the value of both the principal and the fixed interest payments is not the only way that higher inflation affects investments in bonds. Rising prices fuel expectations that central banks will raise rates, which in turn pushes yields in the bond market up to match those expectations. Bond prices are an inverse function of yields: when yields rise, prices fall.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The scale of this second effect would depend on the duration of the bond. If markets think central banks are prepared to tolerate slightly elevated inflation, they will assume there will be fewer increases in rates in the immediate future, not more. This expectation would push short-term yields down and prices up. Meanwhile, in addition to the expectation of higher rates eventually, the volatility and uncertainty brought on by higher inflation would raise the “term premium” (financial jargon for the extra yield long-term lenders demand in return for taking on more risk). The overall effect would be that, during the initial adjustment, bond portfolios with shorter durations would do much better than those with more distant maturities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Could inflation-linked bonds offer more protection? In theory, yes, though in practice there are not enough of them to go around. Inflation-linked Treasuries, for example, comprise just 8% of the total. And even these can fare badly under inflation that is not merely high but also volatile and unpredictable, if this instability prompts large swings in real yields. Last year was a case in point. Real yields soared alongside inflation, hurting the value of inflation-linked bonds alongside the vanilla sort. An index of inflation-linked Treasuries compiled by Bloomberg, a data provider, fell by 12% over the course of the year. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> On the face of things, shares are ideally suited to weathering spells of high inflation. They derive their value from the underlying companies&#39; earnings, and if prices are rising across the economy then those earnings, in aggregate, ought to be rising as well. Suppose inflation stays elevated but stable and the economy is otherwise humming along, says Ed Cole of Man Group, an asset manager. Managers should be able to control costs and adjust prices in response. And in any case, “Equities are nominal beasts. If the numbers are going up, everyone pats themselves on the back.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the very long run, data compiled by Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, three academics, for Credit Suisse&#39;s <i>Global Investment Returns Yearbook</i> back this up. Globally, between 1900 and 2022, stocks beat inflation handily, posting an annualised real return of 5%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But there is a snag: the higher inflation rises, the less stable it tends to be. Take American consumer-price inflation going back to 1913, when official data begin. After years in which prices rose by between 0% and 5%, the average inflation rate for the subsequent 12 months was within 1.8 percentage points of the first one. (So a year of 2% inflation was, on average, followed by one of between 0.2% and 3.8%.) When prices rose by between 5% and 10%, the average change for the subsequent year jumped to 3.8 percentage points. Inflation of 4% would leave little room for error.</p><h2> Once bitten, price shy</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Such volatility is much harder for businesses to handle. Mr Cole points to industries with high fixed costs, such as <small>IT</small> outsourcing, commercial services and construction, in which firms can do little to trim wage bills while remaining in business. If those costs rise in line with inflation, but revenues are slower to adjust, volatile inflation can generate big swings in margins and earnings.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Moreover, during individual periods of high inflation, the historical record is less comforting for shareholders. Between 1900 and 2022, in years in which inflation rose above around 7.5%, the average real return on equities flipped from positive to negative. Even when inflation was lower than this, it tended to reduce the real returns from shares. In other words, though stocks tend to outpace inflation in the long term, in the short term they do not offer a true hedge against it.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1198/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/394/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/591/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/788/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1182/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1261/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1576/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1970/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2522/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Real assets will fare much better if inflation remains high (see chart 2). Property and infrastructure generate income streams, in the form of rents and usage charges, that can often be raised in line with inflation or may even be contractually linked to it. As the supply of such assets is constrained, their real prices are also likely to rise as investors seek out assets that carry some protection against inflation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is also true of commodities. Measured by returns on commodity futures (financial contracts that give investors exposure to commodities without the hassle and expense of owning actual iron ore or cattle), this class of assets has historically done even better in real terms than stocks. In years of above-average inflation, the excess real return of a diversified portfolio of commodity futures over cash has averaged 11.4%. The asset class even tends to do well when high inflation combines with low or negative growth, with excess returns averaging 10% in such “stagflationary” years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The trouble with all such physical assets is the difficulty of investing in them. The total value of all commodity futures is less than $500bn—barely 1% of that of America&#39;s stockmarkets. Should investors pile into them en masse, they would push prices up enough to render the exercise futile. Infrastructure, meanwhile, is dominated by private investment managers, who tend to focus on selling to big institutional investors, such as pension funds and university endowments. Individuals, in contrast, struggle to buy such assets despite their appeal in a high-inflation world.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other vendors poised to capitalise on churn in the financial markets are active asset-managers. They have had a miserable time during the years of easy money that followed the financial crisis of 2007-09. Data compiled by Strategas Securities, a brokerage and research firm, show that in each year from 2010 to 2021, the majority of active managers who measure their performance against the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 share index failed to beat it. Such underperformance is not limited to America. <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> Global, another research firm, reckons that in the ten years to 2022, 90% of European active managers produced worse returns than the broader market.</p></div><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In part this is down to arithmetic. Overall market performance is the average of each investor&#39;s, which makes beating the index a zero-sum affair. On top of this, active managers charge fees (often 1-2% or more a year), which brings their average performance down—so in aggregate, they are likely to underperform. Even accounting for this, though, the years of rock-bottom interest rates and relentlessly buoyant markets were hard on stockpickers. “If everything goes up together, it doesn&#39;t matter how much skill you&#39;ve got,” says Luke Ellis, Man Group&#39;s boss.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By contrast, the return of high inflation and the volatility it brings allow skilled investors to outperform. In particular “dispersion”, or big differences in performance among different assets, offers active managers the chance to prove their worth. “Lots of people having a tough time doesn&#39;t mean a bad opportunity set,” says Mr Ellis. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Yet even Mr Ellis does not think that “you&#39;ll suddenly see 70% of active managers outperforming the index”. Many will be wrong-footed by macroeconomic conditions that they have never had to grapple with before. More insidiously, their clients will only gradually adjust to the wealth-destroying effects of inflation. Jeremy Grantham, a veteran fund-manager, recently wrote of his surprise that money-managers have not yet started to routinely adjust share-performance charts for inflation, as was routine in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Do so, and the numbers look much worse. Nominally, the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 index fell by 19% in 2022, but it would need to rise by more than 30% over the course of this year to recoup its losses in real terms. And as investors see chunks of their savings being eaten away by inflation, paying another couple of percentage points to their fund-managers will become much harder to stomach. Just as, in the real economy, inflation prompts consumers to suspect firms of profiteering, in the financial one it will pit both retail and institutional investors against those managing their money.</p><h2> Sugar and price</h2><p class="article__body-text"> A surprising winner from sustained high inflation, argues Martin Jaugietis of BlackRock, might be defined-benefit pension schemes, which in America hold assets worth some $17trn. Such schemes invest regular payments from workers and their employers in return for the promise of a set income in retirement (usually a fixed percentage of the worker&#39;s final salary). The financial health is determined by their “funding ratio”, or the value of their assets relative to the present value of the future payments they must make to retirees. As interest rates rise, this present value shrinks, since schemes can buy higher-yielding bonds, locking in cash flows that will help pay future liabilities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Provided their assets do not fall too much, the higher nominal interest rates brought on by persistent inflation would therefore be a fillip for defined-benefit schemes. This is especially true for American ones, says Mr Jaugietis, since they do not typically raise payouts to pensioners in line with inflation. Sure enough, in 2022 the funding ratios of American schemes improved markedly as inflation and interest rates rose, despite plunging asset prices. Even in Britain, where retirement payouts tend to be linked more closely to inflation, funding ratios shot up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet, as in the real economy, each winner from inflation creates a loser. In this case, the workers who have contributed to defined-benefit schemes that are not inflation-linked will lose out. After ten years of 4% inflation, someone who expected to retire with an income of $50,000 a year would see the purchasing power of that income fall by around a third. In effect the boon for defined-benefit schemes would be paid for by an arbitrary reduction in their members&#39; wealth. Many pensioners would be in the same position as workers who struggle to secure pay rises that keep pace with inflation, and just as aggrieved.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The final category of participants in financial markets that might welcome higher inflation is governments. The world over, their debt burdens have ballooned—first in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-09 and then during the covid-19 pandemic, on which the rich world spent 10% of its <small>GDP</small> . Europe&#39;s energy crisis has triggered yet more spending. Six of the <small>G</small> 7 group of large, developed economies have gross government-debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratios above 100%; only Germany&#39;s is below.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The only ways to chip away at these vast piles of debt other than inflation are turbocharged growth, tax rises or spending cuts. The first is unlikely; the others are politically painful. So governments may quietly rejoice as the real value of their debt is inflated away.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet in doing so, they risk falling foul of two groups. One is voters, whose savings lose purchasing power at the same time. The more immediate danger comes from the bond market. Investors in sovereign debt will be acutely aware that inflation is eating into their returns. Expect them to rake through governments&#39; fiscal statements with ever finer-toothed combs for signs that worse is to come.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Emerging-market countries are used to this treatment, and to the wild swings in borrowing costs and exchange rates it can bring. But for the rich world the adjustment would be painful. Britain&#39;s flirtation with disaster in September, when an irresponsibly inflationary budget sent gilt yields soaring and the pound through the floorboards, may offer a taste of things to come. Governments that lose the trust of lenders are in for a rough ride.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The idea that central banks might quietly allow inflation to fester, taking a chunk of society&#39;s stability and trust with it, may seem speculative. But look back at the past century and you will struggle to find an instance of inflation rising as far as it did in 2022, then immediately coming back under control. The trade-offs required to get it there look nightmarish. The generation of investors that is learning for the first time how to deal with elevated inflation may have plenty of time to study it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8k3epir6ho28rqm9q8euf2t5f9ibhnh7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/21/inflation-is-as-corrosive-to-investing-as-it-is-to-the-real-economy </item><item><title><![CDATA[Pretending that everything is under control in Russia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Founder of Wagner private mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin makes a statement in Bakhmut" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Editor&#39;s note:</b> On June 23rd Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner, launched an open revolt against the Kremlin, accusing the Russian army of killing his troops.

A mixture of fierce repression and unrelenting propaganda have kept the public largely quiescent. But in recent weeks the war has been seeping into everyday life. In an affluent area in south-western Moscow military trucks roar past Teslas. Recruiters stationed outside supermarkets try to enlist passers-by in the army. At a speed-dating event young women complain of the difficulty of maintaining a steady relationship—because their boyfriends have been called up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> On May 30th a swarm of drones attacked Moscow. None hit its target: they were all either shot down or disabled by jamming. Some fell close to Barvikha Luxury Village, a posh suburb. Villages close to the border with Ukraine in Belgorod province have been shelled. A few have been briefly occupied by pro-Ukrainian militias making forays across the border. These incursions met little initial resistance: many of the troops who used to guard the border had been redeployed to Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-war">Ukraine war</a> .</i></p></aside><h2> Lieutenants at loggerheads</h2><p class="article__body-text"> There are also growing signs of disarray among Russia&#39;s elite. For months Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, a mercenary force fighting on Russia&#39;s behalf, has been denouncing Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, and Valery Gerasimov, Russia&#39;s top general, as incompetent foot-draggers. But his complaints are becoming steadily shriller. He recently claimed that Russian soldiers had laid mines behind Wagner&#39;s positions. Wagner has also released a video of a Russian officer, who looked as if he had been beaten, confessing that he had shot at a vehicle used by Wagner&#39;s forces while drunk. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The incursions in Belgorod have especially incensed Mr Prigozhin (pictured). “Why are tens of thousands of people, our Russian guys, dying advancing towards the West? So that we could start giving away, step by step, pieces of Belgorod province, our native Russian land? Why is everyone silent about the deaths of these civilians? Where is their explanation to the Russian people that we are handing over our territories and civilians to be devoured?”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has a habit of provoking conflict among his subordinates to reinforce his role as an indispensable arbiter. Mr Prigozhin also serves as a useful spur to the Russian army and as a scold for rich Russians unenthused by the war. But these conflicts typically do not spill into public view. Some speculate that Mr Prigozhin could be attacking the top brass in anticipation of territorial losses in Ukraine. By denigrating the generals, he may help deflect blame from Mr Putin. Alternatively, the bickering could be a reflection of infighting between powerful factions who sense weakness on the part of the arbiter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has been keeping a low profile of late, presumably to avoid any association with military setbacks. A visit to a children&#39;s clinic and meetings with regional officials have been his only recent public appearances. His apparent lack of interest in the war and the noisy squabbling in the top ranks, whatever the reason for them, are likely to have a demoralising effect on Russia&#39;s soldiers and civilians alike. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAPBBeHQy_o?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Russia&#39;s propagandists have been trying to reassure the public, insisting that Russia had thwarted the Ukrainian counter-offensive before it had even begun. But their jaunty footage of destroyed Ukrainian tanks has been scorned by Mr Prigozhin and military bloggers. Big territorial losses will presumably lead to further tension within the Russian elites. A weakened Mr Putin, in turn, would probably resort to even greater repression to compensate for losses at the front. Mr Prigozhin is calling for martial law, a general mobilisation and the restoration of the death penalty.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What comes next will depend not just on the progress of the counter-offensive, but on the pliability of the elite and the mood of the broader public. Mr Putin has had little trouble suppressing dissent so far. But the many military setbacks and the public disagreements among his own henchmen make that job harder. “We are moving into uncharted waters,” an American official says. “And it is not just Ukraine that needs liberation, so does Russia.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:48:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

In both countries the fertility rate (the number of children a typical woman will have over her lifetime) fell below 2.1 in the 1970s. That level is known as the replacement rate, since it keeps a population stable over time. Anything lower will eventually lead to a declining population, something both Italy and Japan have suffered for about a decade. The median Italian is now 47; the median<!-- --> Japanese 49. Earlier this year, Kishida Fumio, Japan&#39;s prime minister, warned that the country is “on the brink of being unable to maintain social functions” because of its baby bust.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But Italy and Japan are no longer the most extreme examples of demographic decline. In 2022 South Korea had a fertility rate of just 0.8. A rate below one means that the next generation will be less than half the size of its parents&#39;. As recently as 2012 the <small>UN</small> projected that South Korea&#39;s population would shrink by only a fifth or so by the end of the century, from 52m today to 41m by 2100. More recent forecasts, however, suggest that the population will fall by more than half over the same period, to just 24m (see chart 1).</p><p class="article__body-text"> South Korea may be an exceptional case, but demographic decline is becoming commonplace. In 2010 98 countries and territories recorded fertility rates below 2.1. By 2021 the number had grown to 124, more than half of the places for which the <small>UN</small> collects data (see map). By 2030 it expects the tally to reach 136.</p></div><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="828" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/828/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/129/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/194/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/259/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/388/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/414/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/518/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/647/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/828/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Matthias Doepke, an economist who studies the financial causes and effects of changes in fertility, notes that falling birth rates are no longer limited to richer countries or to wealthier families within a given country. “There&#39;s a global convergence in women&#39;s aspirations for careers and family life,” says Mr Doepke. Fertility rates for women with fewer years of formal education have fallen towards the levels of their more educated peers. In fact, women in America with exactly 16 years of schooling (mostly those with undergraduate degrees) have marginally fewer children on average than those with more schooling. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> By the same token, low fertility rates have spread from rich countries such as Italy and Japan to middle-income ones such as Thailand (1.3) and Brazil (1.6). Even more notably, India&#39;s fertility rate recently fell below 2.1 and is expected to keep falling. Since it accounts for a fifth of the world&#39;s population, that will have global repercussions. The 15 biggest economies in the world, including Brazil, China, India and Mexico, all have fertility rates below 2.1.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In 2021 there were 782m people aged between 21 and 30 in countries where fertility is below the replacement rate. By 2050 this group, in effect the potential number of home-grown entrants to the workforce, is expected to have dropped by a fifth, to 619m. This fall is not some subjective and questionable forecast: most members of that generation have already been born, and fertility rates do not tend to change rapidly. In countries in which the fertility rate is below 1.5, which includes almost all of East Asia and much of Europe, the decline will be more extreme, with the same cohort contracting by 37%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Instead of a population structure shaped like a pyramid, with each new generation bigger than the one that preceded it, or even a pillar, with all generations similar in size, these countries will become inverted pyramids, with older generations replaced by smaller and smaller cohorts. In parts of the world this has already happened: the number of Chinese aged between 21 and 30 has already fallen from 232m at its peak in 2012 to 181m in 2021. The decline will accelerate rapidly in the 2040s, leaving China with fewer than 100m people in the same pool in the mid-2050s. The population of Europe in the same age category will fall from around 85m to below 60m over the same period. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The obvious way to compensate for dwindling birth rates is <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/28/a-new-wave-of-mass-migration-has-begun">immigration</a> , which is on the rise in much of the rich world, despite the political tensions it has generated in recent years. But as demographic decline affects more and more countries, educated migrants will become harder to find, even as the shrinking of the native-born population accelerates in many rich countries. For China, with a population of some 1.4bn, the notion that enough immigrants could be found to reverse the effects of dwindling birth rates is fanciful. Although India&#39;s population is still growing, it will peak in the 2060s, if not sooner. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region of the world that seems likely to be a big source of potential migrants for many years to come. But even there, birth rates are falling more quickly than past projections predicted. Although immigration will continue to temper demographic decline in many countries for decades, in the long run, it cannot fully compensate for the baby bust in big economies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some of the consequences of these demographic shifts are well known. An ever greyer population will mean higher spending on public pensions and health care, but there will be fewer people of working age to pay the taxes required. The rich world currently has around three people between 20 and 64 years old for every one over 65. By 2050 this ratio will shrink to less than two to one. That will necessitate later retirement ages, higher taxes or both.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The economic consequences of demographic decline are not only fiscal, however. Labour is one of the three main determinants of growth, along with capital and the efficiency with which both are used (productivity). Shrinking workforces, other things being equal, automatically lead to lower economic growth. But demographic decline also has knock-on effects on capital and productivity that are much less well understood.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Many economists believe that a smaller working population will push down interest rates in real terms (meaning, after accounting for inflation), because there will be fewer investment opportunities and a large stock of savings accumulated by those in or near retirement. But others, such as Charles Goodhart, a former official at the Bank of England, believe the effect will be the opposite. As more people enter retirement and so stop saving but continue to consume, there will be less funding for investment, pushing real interest rates up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Both sides agree that an ageing population will reduce both savings and investment, but disagree about which will decline more quickly. But the balance of evidence points towards lower real interest rates: many developing economies still have decades of savings accumulation ahead of them, and retirees often cling to their savings rather than running them down. Either way, demographic changes will have huge implications for markets. Broadly speaking, low real interest rates are good for those who have already accumulated assets but bad for those still trying to save, including the increasing numbers of workers approaching retirement with inadequate nest eggs.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But it is on productivity that demographic decline may have the most troubling effect. Younger people have more of what psychologists call “fluid intelligence”, meaning the ability to solve new problems and engage with new ideas. Older people have more “crystallised intelligence”—a stock of knowledge about how things work built up over time. There are no precise cut-offs, but most studies suggest that fluid intelligence tends to peak in early adulthood and to begin to decline in people&#39;s 30s. Both types of intelligence are useful: companies, industries and economies need both youngsters able to respond to new challenges and seasoned veterans with a detailed understanding of their trade. But the two are not of equivalent value when it comes to innovation. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> In research published in 2021, Mary Kaltenberg and Adam Jaffe, both economists, and Margie Lachman, a psychologist, used a database of 3m patents filed over more than 40 years to explore the relationship between innovation and age. Depending on the scientific discipline, the authors note that patenting rates peak in a researcher&#39;s late 30s and early 40s. The rates of patenting then decline only gradually through their 40s and 50s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But for disruptive innovations, which fundamentally change a scientific field, the picture is very different. The researchers used<!-- --> a measure of disruptiveness based on the number of citations of a given invention in future patents. If a particular patent is cited by subsequent inventors, but that patent&#39;s technological predecessors are not, it is categorised as a disruptive rather than an incremental innovation. For instance, the work of Kary Mullis, a Nobel-prize-winning biochemist, on polymerase chain reactions underpins much modern genetic and medical testing. After Mullis published his work, citations of prior technologies in the same field nosedived. Mr Jaffe, Ms Kaltenberg and Ms Lachman find that patents filed by the very youngest inventors are much more likely to be completely novel, discipline-changing innovations, and that as inventors age the patents they file become increasingly incremental.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This matters, because innovation raises productivity. Improvements to existing processes and the invention of entirely new ways of doing things enable more to be produced with the same amount of labour and capital. In the long term, it is only by raising productivity that standards of living can be lifted. Demographic decline will chip away at that contribution over time by reducing the number of novel ideas stemming from the fluidly intelligent minds of young workers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even a fractionally lower rate of productivity growth will compound over the years to make an economy significantly smaller. During the particularly rapid post-war boom in economic growth in the rich world, between 1947 and 1973, productivity growth accounted for about 60% of the rise in output per worker in America, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany. America has grown much faster than the rest of the rich world since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, thanks in large part to its bigger gains in productivity.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If the decline in fertility was confined to a few countries, or a particular region, the impact on innovation might not be so severe. Technologies invented in one country eventually spread to others. The spinning jenny and the computer chip didn&#39;t have to be reinvented in every corner of the world to improve productivity globally. But the fact that fertility is declining simultaneously in a large proportion of countries means that the consequences in terms of reduced innovation will be felt globally.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some researchers believe such a demographically driven reduction in innovation is already under way in parts of the world. James Liang, a Chinese economist and demographer, notes that entrepreneurship is markedly lower in older countries: an increase of one standard deviation in the median age in a country, equivalent to about 3.5 years, leads to a decrease of 2.5 percentage points<!-- --> in the entrepreneurship rate (the proportion of adults who start their own business). That is a huge effect, considering the global entrepreneurship rate was around 6.1% in 2010.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What is more, this relationship does not seem to be simply a function of the relative lack of young people in ageing societies. Young people in such countries also seem to start businesses at lower rates than their peers in less wizened societies.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> This phenomenon, according to Mr Liang, may be the cause of Japan&#39;s “entrepreneur vacuum”.

Once-leading roles in hydrogen storage, self-driving vehicles and computer vision (a form of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret images) have been reduced to supporting roles behind America, China or both (see chart 2).</p></div><h2> Needling nabobs of natalism</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Governments are largely powerless to reverse declining birth rates. Attempts in various countries to prod women to have more children have typically yielded meagre results. Research on the expensive support provided by governments in Hungary and Poland, in the form of income-tax credits and flat payments respectively, suggests a limited effect on fertility. Singapore offers large grants to the parents of new children, which now run to S$11,000 ($8,300) for the first two children, and S$13,000 for any more, on top of tax rebates and child-care subsidies. Parents are given priority over other buyers in subsidised apartment sale schemes. But Singapore&#39;s total fertility rate is just 1.0: whatever the effect of the policies, it is nowhere near big enough to avert demographic decline. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Of course, birth rates are not the only, or even the main determinant of productivity. If they were, some of sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s poorest economies would be the world&#39;s most dynamic. Levels of education, the reliability of legal and financial systems and the existence of networks of innovators interacting with one another all matter. Japan is still more innovative than many rich countries with a lower average age. But demography can magnify or muffle a country&#39;s underlying potential.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That suggests ways to counteract the effects of demographic decline on innovation, by focusing on other factors that increase productivity. The most obvious is education, which allows ageing societies to make better use of the dwindling pool of young people. Especially in middle-income countries such as Brazil and China, there are millions who do not receive proper schooling, and whose contribution to the economy is therefore small. The same is true, albeit to a lesser extent, in much of the rich world. No matter how intelligent they are, uneducated workers cannot hope to come up with groundbreaking ideas in medicine or computing, say. As the potential workforce shrinks, maximising the output of everyone in it will become essential, and could help offset the effects of an ageing population for some time, at least in the realm of innovation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Technology can also provide ways to cope with demographic change, from telemedicine to the increased use of robots in service industries. Such innovations can undoubtedly ease the difficulties presented by an ageing society, whether by directly contributing to the care of the elderly or by automating the roles of young workers. But the shrinking number of innovative young thinkers will, ironically, reduce the number of such valuable new ideas.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A shortfall in human innovation may also be less damaging if offset by new ideas conceived by artificial intelligence. There seems no doubt that machines will soon be working out how to make incremental improvements in existing processes—indeed, in some spheres, they already are. Whether machines will ever learn how to generate disruptive new ideas, however, remains a matter of debate.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Plasmon&#39;s film, about the last child in Italy, ends with a discussion of children as a symbol of hope. It directs viewers to a website that suggests policies to promote bigger families. The website, in turn, asks readers to sign a petition calling for action. Scarcely 8,000 have done so. As the number of Italians continues to shrink, and especially the number of young ones, it is not just buyers of baby food who will be in short supply. Plasmon will struggle to find creative talents to dream up clever advertising campaigns, much less devise new policies to reverse the baby bust. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 30 May 2023 16:40:50 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/2hhac3i4ep1dnajm4n2d6tm8flduok94</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/30/its-not-just-a-fiscal-fiasco-greying-economies-also-innovate-less</item></channel></rss>
