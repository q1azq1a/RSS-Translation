class="article__body-text">但加沙人民根本无法做好应对这次大规模破坏的准备。以色列空军声称在战争第一周就在这片狭窄的土地上投放了近 6,000 枚炸弹，超过了 2014-17 年间美国军队在打击伊斯兰国行动中每年投放的炸弹数量。我们对卫星图像的分析表明，在这么短的时间内，至少 4.3% 的飞地建筑物被摧毁。</p><p class="article__body-text">为了评估袭击造成的损失，我们分析了来自欧洲卫星 Sentinel-1 的免费数据。它每 12 天至少飞越加沙 3 次，通过从地球表面反射微波并测量它们返回时的“回声”来创建图像。</p><p class="article__body-text">通过将战争开始前拍摄的图像与 10 月 12 日的最新图像进行比较，我们确定了信号发生剧烈变化的区域，这是损坏的标志。我们通过将其应用于 2022 年春季乌克兰马里乌波尔市的数据，并将其与人类编码的评估进行比较，验证了该方法的准确性。我们的方法并不完美。并非所有损坏都能从上方检测到。因此，我们的人数（如果有的话）可能太低了。 </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text">我们对加沙的分析表明，其北部的重要地区可能已遭到破坏或摧毁。拜特哈农市似乎是受灾最严重的城市。现场消息证实，苏西清真寺和艾哈迈德·亚辛清真寺（我们的分析强调这些清真寺已受损）已被夷为平地。总体而言，我们的估计表明加沙有 11,000 座建筑物已受损或被摧毁。</p><p class="article__body-text">加沙人民特别容易受到空袭。约 220 万人居住在构成该地带的狭长地带，长 40 公里（25 英里），宽 10 公里。所有边境口岸均已关闭。在一些难民营中，每 100 米见方的地方就有多达 400 人居住。已有数十万人流离失所。通过将我们的损害地图与细粒度的人口数据相结合，我们的分析表明，当战斗停止时，至少 92,000 人将无家可归。这大约是 2021 年战争同一时刻的数字的三倍。 </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text">以色列表示，袭击已杀死数百名恐怖分子并摧毁了哈马斯指挥中心。加沙卫生部报告称，约 3,500 名巴勒斯坦人丧生，比以色列-加沙其他任何一场大火中丧生的人数还要多。由于炸弹仍在落下，而且以色列预计将发动地面攻击，这一数字肯定会上升。 <span>■</span></p><p

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>乔</span>·拜登在 10 月 18 日闪电访问以色列期间发表的<small>公开</small>声明并未表明对以色列即将入侵加沙地带有太多疑虑。然而，私下里，美国总统的顾问希望就一个紧迫问题向以色列领导人施压：战后应该发生什么？</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列官员表示，他们的重点是推翻哈马斯权力，以对其 10 月 7 日在以色列南部犯下的大屠杀进行报复。 “加沙将不再对以色列构成威胁，”外交部长埃利·科恩表示。 “我们不会同意哈马斯在加沙拥有任何权力。” 10 月 17 日，加沙阿赫利阿拉伯医院发生致命爆炸，以色列指责巴勒斯坦火箭失手，这说明了在如此人口稠密的地方发生战斗的风险，但以色列宣称的战争目标并未改变。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">四路停车</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但以色列的战后计划仍然不确定。它有四个主要选项，全都是不好的选项。首先是对加沙的长期占领，就像1967年至2005年那样。以色列军队必须保卫这片飞地，在巴勒斯坦政府缺席的情况下，可能还必须监督基本服务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这可能会让以色列宗教右翼的一部分感到高兴，他们仍然对 2005 年从加沙撤出所有以色列士兵和定居者感到愤怒，认为这是放弃了犹太人的圣经家园的一小部分。但考虑到沉重的经济负担、可能会出现无休无止的负面报道以及不断出现的人员伤亡，没有人希望看到加沙重新被占领。拜登10月15日警告称，持久占领将是一个“大错误”。大多数以色列战略家都同意这一点。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二种选择是发动一场战争，斩首哈马斯，然后离开该领土。这可以说是最糟糕的前进方式。哈马斯的一些领导人和支持者可能会出现重组该组织。即使他们不这样做，其他一些不良力量也会取代它。中东地区有激进团体利用不受监管空间的历史。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从以色列的角度来看，最好的结果是巴勒斯坦权力机构（ <small>PA</small> ）的回归，该权力机构与以色列协调管理西岸部分地区。但这条道路充满了障碍。首先是巴勒斯坦总统马哈茂德·阿巴斯不愿意这样做。 “我认为没有人会那么愚蠢，认为他可以骑着以色列坦克返回加沙，”前巴勒斯坦部长加桑·哈提卜说。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使阿巴斯先生能够以这种方式掌权，他也可能不想这样做。巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>前主席、巴勒斯坦民族主义的长期代表人物亚西尔·阿拉法特 (Yasser Arafat) 对加沙情有独钟。 1994 年获准返回巴勒斯坦后，他在那里住了一段时间。与阿巴斯关系密切的人士表示，相比之下，他将加沙视为一个充满敌意的地方。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">加沙几乎肯定会对派来保卫加沙的巴勒斯坦警察怀有敌意。<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>在其安全部门雇用了约 60,000 名员工，其权力覆盖了西岸约三分之一的地区（见地图）。它甚至无法控制这一有限区域：约旦河西岸北部城市杰宁和纳布卢斯的部分地区局势十分动荡，<small>巴勒斯坦</small>权力机构的部队不敢巡逻，以免遭到袭击。士气低落。如果巴勒斯坦警察返回加沙，他们将成为哈马斯、伊斯兰圣战组织和其他武装分子残余分子的目标。 2006年哈马斯赢得议会选举后，哈马斯和巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>在加沙爆发了血腥内战。哈马斯最终获胜，并于2007年将巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>驱逐出加沙地带。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">安全也不是唯一的问题。哈马斯上台后，阿巴斯要求加沙的官僚停止工作。哈马斯雇佣了数万名支持者来填补公务员队伍，而<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>则继续向其工人支付工资，让他们坐在家里。保留这种官僚机构意味着要与大约 40,000 名因在意识形态上忠于哈马斯而被雇用的人合作；如果不予考虑，就会重蹈美国在伊拉克“去复兴党化”计划的覆辙，该计划导致大批愤怒的失业者流落街头。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第四种选择是组建某种替代政府，由与以色列和埃及密切合作的当地知名人士组成。以色列一直依赖这种安排，直到 20 世纪 90 年代，之后巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>开始接管被占领土的民事职能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">有人传言试图让在加沙长大的前巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>安全负责人穆罕默德·达赫兰接替哈马斯掌权。但达赫兰先生过去十年一直在阿拉伯联合酋长国（ <small>UAE</small> ）首都阿布扎比度过。他与<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>闹翻了； 2016年，巴勒斯坦法院判定他犯有腐败罪。他和加沙的家人之间也存在不和：2007 年，他领导了针对哈马斯的战斗。“我认为这是一种幻觉，”以色列军队预备役上校、摩西达扬中心 (Moshe Dayan Centre) 的分析师迈克尔·米尔斯坦 (Michael Milstein) 说。特拉维夫智囊团。 “我什至不确定他是否想回来。他担心人们会希望他死。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">达兰先生的案例指出了一个更大的问题。巴勒斯坦人的分裂已经近二十年了。分裂很大程度上是他们的错：尽管哈马斯和<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>领导人每隔几年会面一次，口头上表示和解，但双方都不想妥协。但以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的分而治之政策也加剧了分裂，他认为这是阻碍巴勒斯坦独立国家梦想的有用工具。以色列前总理埃胡德·巴拉克表示：“内塔尼亚胡在维持哈马斯活力方面的策略存在缺陷。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯和<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>均以一党专制政权统治其小国。 2021 年，阿巴斯先生的批评者尼扎尔·巴纳特 (Nizar Banat) 在希伯伦的家中被巴勒斯坦警察殴打致死。那些在加沙反对哈马斯的人面临着酷刑和处决的危险。大多数巴勒斯坦人选择保持沉默，回避政治并专注于他们的日常斗争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">巴勒斯坦政策和调查研究中心 ( <small>PCPSR</small> ) 的最新民意调查发现，65% 的加沙人将在与阿巴斯总统的正面交锋中投票给哈马斯领导人伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚 (Ismail Haniyeh)（阿巴斯将输掉选举）。西岸也是如此）。哈马斯将在加沙议会选举中赢得 44% 的选票，而阿巴斯的派系法塔赫仅获得 28%。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">在岩石和瓦罐之间</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乍一看，这表明对哈马斯的持久支持。但此类民意调查只提供了激进分子和无能者之间的二元选择。整整80%的巴勒斯坦人希望阿巴斯先生辞职。医院爆炸发生数小时后，约旦河西岸各城市爆发了抗议活动，示威者高呼：“人民要求总统下台。”他现年 87 岁，没有明确的继任者。他的继任者都没有激发太多热情。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在哈尼亚先生和<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>毫无特色的总理穆罕默德·什塔耶之间的一场假设竞选中，哈尼亚先生将在加沙以 45 分的优势获胜，在约旦河西岸以 21 分的优势获胜。同样，这与其说证明了哈尼亚先生的受欢迎程度，不如说证明了什塔耶先生缺乏受欢迎程度：2019 年哈尼亚上任 100 天后的一项民意调查发现，53% 的巴勒斯坦人甚至不知道他是总理。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">开放式问题会产生更有意义的结果。当<small>PCPSR</small>要求巴勒斯坦人选出他们首选的阿巴斯继任者时，多数人表示他们不知道。在约旦河西岸和加沙地带，第二个最受欢迎的答案是马尔万·巴尔古蒂（Marwan Barghouti），他是法塔赫成员，因策划导致以色列平民死亡的恐怖袭击而在以色列监狱服刑，多次被判无期徒刑。其他几位最佳人选，例如达赫兰和前哈马斯领导人哈立德·梅沙尔，甚至不住在巴勒斯坦领土上。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">流亡者、囚犯——或者无人：巴勒斯坦政治生活垂死挣扎。巴勒斯坦人将这种令人遗憾的局面归咎于以色列，认为缺乏有意义的和平谈判已经剥夺了巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>存在的<i>理由</i>。 “我认为阿巴斯先生将成为最后一位巴勒斯坦总统，”哈提卜先生说。 “巴勒斯坦权力机构的整体理念是，它是向巴勒斯坦国的过渡。如果没有政治视野，那么整个<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>就变得无关紧要。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列人认为，巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>通过猖獗的腐败行为削弱了自己的地位。过去三十年来，数十亿美元的外国援助被抽走，用于在约旦购买豪华别墅，并充实欧洲的银行账户。当被问及巴勒斯坦社会的主要问题时，更多的人提到自己政府的腐败（25%），而不是以色列的持续占领（19%）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">有足够的责备可以分享。然而，结果是，法塔赫在大多数巴勒斯坦人眼中可能是不可挽回的，一场解放运动变得僵化和颓废。近年来，甚至一些以色列人也开始怀疑哈马斯是否可以成为对话者，重蹈法塔赫几十年前的覆辙，从暴力激进分子转变为温顺的官僚。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯不仅似乎专注于改善加沙的经济，其一些领导人似乎也愿意接受两国解决方案。对于一个其章程曾经呼吁毁灭以色列的组织来说，这将是一个显着的转变。去年，该组织加沙政治领导层成员巴塞姆·纳伊姆 (Bassem Naim) 告诉本报记者，该组织愿意接受“在 1967 年边界上建立一个国家”。另一位政治官员加齐·哈马德一年前也说过同样的话。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">现在看来这样的想法很幼稚。米尔斯坦先生是为数不多的在大屠杀发生前警告哈马斯明显的实用主义只是一个诡计的以色列知名人士之一。他的观点被可怕的事件所证实，现在几乎成为以色列的普遍观点。即使哈马斯愿意参加和谈，愤怒、悲伤的以色列公众也不会成为愿意的伙伴：绝大多数以色列人希望消灭哈马斯，而不是奖励它。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另外两个问题将影响加沙的未来。一是阿拉伯国家将扮演什么角色。在过去一周的私下谈话中，几位阿拉伯官员提出了为这片飞地派遣外国维和部队的想法，但大多数人很快补充说，他们的国家并不急于参与。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃及在加沙并不受欢迎，一是因为它与以色列一起封锁了该领土，二是因为埃及曾在 1948 年至 1967 年期间担任加沙统治者。<small>阿联酋</small>对于扮演重要角色会犹豫不决。 “我们不会单独行动，”一位阿联酋外交官表示。沙特阿拉伯的情况可能也是如此。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列可能会否决卡塔尔这个在加沙最具影响力的国家之一的任何角色。多年来，在以色列的支持下，该酋长国帮助稳定了加沙的经济，每月发放高达 30 美元的福利金、公务员工资和免费燃油。但它对哈马斯的支持——该组织的一些领导人居住在那里——现在将使其受到怀疑。 “过去十年以色列的整体战略就是信任卡塔尔，”米尔斯坦先生说。 “我们应该从这场战争中吸取的教训之一是，我们不应该让卡塔尔再参与其中。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管阿拉伯国家不想保护加沙，但他们可能愿意帮助重建它。 2014 年上一次大战结束后，捐助者承诺提供 35 亿美元用于<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/19/israel-turns-to-financial-weapons-as-well-as-military-ones">重建</a>（尽管到 2016 年底他们只支付了其中的 51%）。这次的账单会更大。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个问题是<small>PA</small>会发生什么。一半的巴勒斯坦人告诉民意调查机构应该解散。这样做会剥夺他们中许多人的收入（巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>是西岸最大的雇主），并可能导致更多暴力。但这也会增加以色列占领的成本，或许还会迫使巴勒斯坦的长期未来重新回到以色列的政治议程上，而此前的二十年里，这个问题很少被讨论。 “这是他留下的唯一一张牌，”阿巴斯先生的一位前密友说道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">仅针对加沙问题没有持久的解决方案。尽管存在长期分裂，那里的巴勒斯坦人仍然将自己视为更大政体的一部分。无论如何，该地带太小，而且缺乏自然资源，无法自行发展。它的经济依赖于以色列：从草莓农场到家具工厂，一切都依赖于对其富裕邻国的出口。无论谁控制了加沙，作为一个孤立的小国，加沙既不会稳定，也不会繁荣。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为加沙带来持久平静的唯一途径是更广泛地解决以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突。哈提布警告说，如果通过谈判达成解决方案的前景完全消失，“温和的领导层也将随之消失。”以色列可以斩首哈马斯。但目前尚不清楚是否会有更好的东西取代它。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct

e190yofl0"> 40 多年来，<span>以色列</span>国防军 ( <small>IDF</small> )<small>首次</small>召集了整个装甲部队，据信其坦克数量超过 1,000 辆。还召集了整整36万名预备役军人，其中包括2万名民防部队。新增人力旨在扩充<small>以色列国防军</small>约 17 万名全职人员。尽管其中一些部队部署在以色列北部边境，以抵御真主党武装分子从黎巴嫩发起的潜在袭击，但更多部队正在以色列南部靠近加沙地带的地区集结。以色列准备开始预计将是自 1982 年入侵黎巴嫩以来最大规模的军事行动。以色列领导人表示，他们决心摧毁控制加沙的激进组织哈马斯，以报复其在以色列南部发动的血腥暴行。 10 月 7 日。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">截至<i>《经济学人》</i>付印时，尚未发生任何攻击事件。推迟的最明显原因是美国总统乔·拜登 10 月 18 日对以色列的短暂访问。他的存在既是为了表明对以色列的支持，也是为了试图达成某种协议来帮助被困在加沙的巴勒斯坦平民。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 10 月 17 日，正当拜登登上空军一号前往该地区时，加沙的一家医院发生了致命的爆炸。该领土卫生部表示，已有数百人死亡。哈马斯指责<small>以色列国防军</small>的轰炸。以色列表示，另一个巴勒斯坦激进组织伊斯兰圣战组织发射的一枚火箭发生故障，落在医院大院内。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">独立研究人员对图像和视频片段的分析表明，以色列的解释更为合理。<small>以色列国防军</small>还公布了火箭发射的跟踪数据，并截获了巴勒斯坦人之间的通讯，这些数据似乎证实了其说法。巴勒斯坦火箭是按照伊朗的设计在加沙的临时车间制造的。空中故障很常见：<small>以色列国防军</small>声称，自 10 月 7 日以来向以色列发射的 7,000 多枚火箭弹中，至少有 450 枚落在加沙境内。以色列指出，爆炸后果的图像显示，医院院落中心有一个烧焦的停车场，邻近的建筑物也受到很大程度的损坏，但没有出现弹坑或结构性破坏，而这正是其使用的弹药所预期的。空袭。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登支持以色列对事件的说法。美国官员引用了他们自己的红外卫星数据和拦截数据作为证据。但这场悲剧还是让他与阿拉伯领导人达成全面协议的希望落空，尽管以色列封锁了该领土，但仍向加沙提供援助并至少将一些平民送出。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">时机就是一切</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">任何协议都取决于埃及的默许，埃及与加沙的边界很短，而且那里的食品和医疗设备堆积如山。但阿赫利阿拉伯医院的屠杀事件在阿拉伯世界引起了极大的愤慨，以至于约旦迅速取消了拜登原定会见埃及总统阿卜杜勒-法塔赫·塞西和巴勒斯坦权力机构领导人<small>马哈茂德</small>·阿巴斯的峰会。 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">约旦外交部长艾曼·萨法迪表示：“此时除了停止这场战争之外，采取任何行动都没有任何意义。”最终，拜登能做的最好的事情就是确保以色列承诺不阻碍援助物资的运送，以及埃及承诺每天允许 20 辆卡车进入加沙。他还宣布美国将提供1亿美元的援助以缓解巴勒斯坦人的困境。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">医院的悲剧突显出以色列鼓励巴勒斯坦平民迁移到加沙地带南部以逃避迫在眉睫的战斗的冲击的努力进展缓慢。<small>以色列国防军</small>表示，加沙北部 110 万居民中只有 60 万左右响应了其号召。由于推迟了有关人道主义援助或平民可以避难的安全区的广泛协议，阿赫利阿拉伯的爆炸将挫败说服顽固分子的努力。事实上，自 10 月 7 日以来，<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/mapping-the-destruction-in-gaza">以色列的轰炸行动</a>造成的加沙人死亡人数比以往任何涉及该领土的冲突都要多。地面攻击将不可避免地导致更多人死亡。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">加沙南部已经变得极度拥挤，没有为来自北方的抵达者提供有组织的食物或住所。哈马斯告诉加沙人不要动。更重要的是，以色列对加沙南部的轰炸仍在继续，有报道称来自北部的难民在空袭中丧生。加沙人普遍认为，该地区没有任何地方是安全的，他们还不如呆在相对舒适的家中。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t

edweubf0">还有995张</span><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：EPA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列将军们的另一个担忧是两条战线爆发战争的风险。据知情人士透露，10 月 7 日，哈马斯的盟友伊朗感到措手不及。但此后它敦促黎巴嫩的一个大型激进组织真主党加入战斗。真主党拥有约 15 万枚火箭和导弹，其中包括比哈马斯部署的精度更高的火箭和导弹，这将严重加重以色列导弹防御系统的负担。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列内部人士表示，与真主党发生战争的可能性日益增加。尽管真主党可能不愿意让以色列对陷入严重经济衰退的黎巴嫩进行报复，但它最终要对伊朗的金主负责，而不是普通黎巴嫩人。 10 月 16 日，伊朗外交部长侯赛因·阿米尔-阿卜杜拉希安 (Hossein Amir-Abdollahian) 向伊朗国家电视台发出了不祥的警告：“预计未来几个小时内可能会采取先发制人的行动。”同一天，以色列政府史无前例地发布命令，要求撤离距黎巴嫩边境2公里以内的28个以色列村庄。 10 月 17 日，<small>以色列国防军</small>杀死了四名试图穿越安全围栏的人。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些部长和国防官员建议，以色列最好先发制人地攻击真主党，而不是等待另一次突然袭击，这次袭击来自北方。包括总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡和包括前将军在内的各种政治对手的以色列战时内阁似乎倾向于等待，同时向边境派遣更多部队。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列可能也在等待更多美国火力抵达该地区。一艘航空母舰率领的舰队已经抵达地中海东部。另一个正在路上。这些部队的目的是阻止伊朗、真主党以及伊拉克、叙利亚和也门境内其他与伊朗结盟的民兵组织参战，或攻击美国在海湾地区的利益。美国舰艇的防空系统即使不能提供一定程度的保护，也可能能够向以色列提供导弹袭击的额外警告。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列战争准备工作的另一个潜在干扰是约旦河西岸，这是巴勒斯坦领土的另一片地区，约有 270 万居民。以色列不直接管理的40%则掌握在巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>手中。但阿巴斯先生软弱且不受欢迎。阿赫利阿拉伯医院的悲剧发生后，针对他的政府爆发了广泛的抗议活动。<small>以色列国防军</small>担心的并不是第三条战线，即反对以色列的民众起义，而是需要更多以色列军队存在的混乱。约旦河西岸和耶路撒冷东部的巴勒斯坦人和近 70 万以色列定居者之间也持续存在暴力威胁。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列推迟进攻的最后一个原因是努力解救至少部分 10 月 7 日被俘的以色列人质。<small>以色列国防军</small>认为，哈马斯、伊斯兰圣战组织和其他组织拥有其中 203 枚。以色列间谍一直试图收集有关他们被关押地点的情报。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">讨论被打乱</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为确保人质获释而举行的静悄悄谈判正在进行中。卡塔尔是哈马斯政治领导层的所在地，与该组织关系密切，一直充当中间人的角色。但这些外交努力似乎在 10 月 17 日阿赫利阿拉伯医院发生悲剧后崩溃了。尽管以色列详细否认责任，但大多数阿拉伯国家，包括阿拉伯联合酋长国等此前表现出同情以色列的国家，都将这场灾难归咎于以色列<small>国防军</small>。既然拜登已经离开该地区，这既使以色列更难为地面战争建立外交支持，也让其没有理由拖延。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">无论如何，以色列指挥官们已经手痒痒了。 10 月 7 日暴行发生后数小时内，<small>以色列国防军</small>开始集结。它的部队已经基本到位近一周了。“我们真的应该在这个周末出发，”一位上校说。 “你最多可以保持这种准备状态两周。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当入侵到来时，将会是一场艰苦而血腥的战斗。以色列领导人多次大声承诺将彻底摧毁哈马斯的军事能力并结束其 16 年的统治。这意味着这次行动与之前2009年和2014年入侵加沙的行动不同，这次行动的目的只是削弱哈马斯的军事能力，随后逐渐恢复现状。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但由于多种原因，加沙地带是一个很难作战的地方。首先，它充满了密集的城市，由紧密排列的公寓楼组成。这些地方会限制入侵者的视线并阻碍他们的通讯，高楼大厦会阻碍无线电信号。平民可能在任何地方，哈马斯战士也将有无穷无尽的藏身之处。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更重要的是，哈马斯在加沙地下修建了一个长达 500 公里的隧道网络——这片领土只有 40 公里长、10 公里宽。其目的部分是为了削弱以色列在空中观察和打击方面的技术优势。即使是最先进的无人机也无法提供有关地下情况的大量信息。进入隧道的部队无法通过<small>GPS</small>导航或通过无线电通信。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt

edweubf0">四十年后，黎巴嫩的民兵仍然是一个威胁</span><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">形象：Magnum/Micha Bar-Am</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 2014 年入侵加沙时，<small>以色列国防军</small>在处理此类隧道时遇到了困难。此后，它在地下战方面投入了大量资金，为这项任务设立了特种部队，并建造了哈马斯隧道的模拟模型进行训练。它开发了各种技术手段来追捕他们，包括一些模仿石油工业进行的地下调查的方法，以及基于老式情报的方法——例如寻找武装分子手机信号突然消失的地点。即便如此，寻找和拆除隧道网络将需要数月甚至数年的时间，当然也不是几天的时间。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个担忧是存在如此多的巴勒斯坦平民。伊拉克战争期间美国领导的对城市的袭击以及伊拉克领导的、西方支持的2016-17年从伊斯兰国手中夺取摩苏尔的行动都是在大量情报的帮助下精心策划和实施的。尽管如此，还是有大量平民死亡——仅在摩苏尔之战中就有多达 10,000 人死亡。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从理论上讲，规范军队在发动战争时的行为的国际人道法要求士兵一方面区分战斗人员和军事物体，另一方面区分平民和民用物体。故意针对那些人始终是非法的。但是，如果出于某种军事目的而有必要，并且“与预期的具体和直接军事优势相称”，那么杀死平民（甚至是大量平民）的攻击就可以是合法的。换句话说，只要平民在交火中丧生且行动中没有使用不成比例的武力，以色列就可以在法律上为平民的死亡辩护。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，无论国际法如何规定，随着平民伤亡的增加，以色列撤军并接受停火的压力也会随之增加。它之前于 2009 年和 2014 年入侵加沙的时间相当短暂。在这两次事件中，<small>以色列国防军</small>在地面停留了大约 18 天。这几乎没有足够的时间来实现以色列这次既定的目标。伊拉克军队经过九个月的挨家挨户战斗才征服了摩苏尔。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这也许是以色列军队在加沙面临的最大挑战：不要陷入困境。 9/11 恐怖袭击后美国对阿富汗和伊拉克的入侵以及以色列 1982 年在黎巴嫩的战争（最后一次部署所有这些坦克）都提供了警示。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的“全球反恐战争”胜利打响。 2001年9月基地组织袭击美国仅两个月后，美国领导的部队就控制了阿富汗首都喀布尔。塔利班政府已经不复存在了。基地组织遭到追捕。其领导人奥萨马·本·拉登 (Osama bin Laden) 于 2011 年被追踪到巴基斯坦并被击毙。但塔利班却与日益壮大的叛乱活动作斗争。美国在失去 2,400 多名军事人员后于 2021 年撤离。阿富汗政府几乎立即垮台，塔利班重新掌权。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊拉克战争也是不光彩的，而且更加血腥。 2003年4月，美国军队再次迅速占领首都巴格达。布什总统在<i>亚伯拉罕·林肯号</i>航空母舰的飞行甲板上昂首阔步，上面写着“任务完成”。事实上，该国即将陷入内战。美军抓获了伊拉克独裁者萨达姆·侯赛因，但很快就面临逊尼派和什叶派民兵的血腥叛乱。总共，美国失去了大约 4,500 名军人，更不用说大约 30 万伊拉克人死亡，其中大多数是平民。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">历史课</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列自身的历史也提出了类似的警告。 1982年，在民族主义保护伞组织巴勒斯坦解放组织（<small>巴解组织</small>）的一系列袭击中，枪手开枪打伤了以色列驻伦敦大使。以色列政府将这起杀戮视为入侵黎巴嫩并瓦解<small>巴解组织的</small><i>宣战理由</i>，尽管这起事件被归咎于竞争对手阿布·尼达尔组织的武装分子。以色列军队围困贝鲁特西部的<small>巴解组织</small>，迫使其领导人亚西尔·阿拉法特和数千名战士流亡。以色列的基督教盟友巴希尔·杰马耶勒当选黎巴嫩总统。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后一切都崩溃了。杰马耶勒被炸毁。在以色列军队的注视下，他的长枪党战士通过杀害萨布拉和查蒂拉难民营中的巴勒斯坦人来进行报复。以色列调查委员会发现以色列国防部长阿里尔·沙龙负有间接责任。一年之内，在反战抗议的压力下，总理梅纳赫姆·贝京宣布辞职。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">黎巴嫩纷争的影响之一是<small>巴解组织</small>被真主党取代，真主党是一支更强大的什叶派民兵组织，并于 2000 年成功将以色列赶出黎巴嫩。另一个影响是对以色列占领的约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人。他们的第一次起义，即“摆脱”，是 1987 年开始的投掷石块的起义，为 1993 年以色列和<small>巴解组织</small>之间达成奥斯陆协议奠定了基础。次年，阿拉法特凯旋返回加沙。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯成为暴力拒绝主义的主要力量，并为破坏奥斯陆协定做了很多事情。 2005年，它迫使以色列撤出加沙，并在2006年赢得了巴勒斯坦立法选举。次年，它驱逐了巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于美国智库阿拉伯海湾国家研究所的侯赛因·伊比什来说，教训是显而易见的。他认为，恐怖分子和叛乱组织诉诸大规模暴力来引发非理性反应。 “他们知道他们对主导力量造成的伤害是有限的，”他说。 “他们明白，主导力量对自己造成的伤害要大得多。” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

war]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">请访问我们报道以色列和哈马斯的<a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">专用中心</a>。</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>新闻</span>频道整夜<small>循环</small>播放这些场景：救护车、尸体、照亮夜空的爆炸。哈马斯指责以色列对 10 月 17 日加沙阿赫利医院发生爆炸负责。加沙卫生部表示，数百人死亡。以色列后来否认正在该地区进行空袭；据称，爆炸是由<a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/10/people-in-gaza-hate-the-night-all-they-can-see-are-explosions">加沙</a>另一个武装组织伊斯兰圣战组织发射的火箭失火造成的。然而，当以色列发表否认时，细节已经不再重要。这场灾难引发了约旦河西岸和约旦以及远至突尼斯的抗议活动。这就是乔·拜登10月18日抵达以色列进行短暂访问时所陷入的漩涡。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is hard to generalise about “the Arab world”, a collection of 450m people spread across thousands of kilometres and nearly two dozen countries. But it is safe to say that most Arabs still sympathise with the Palestinian cause. Their dispossession remains a totemic political issue across the Middle East, able to mobilise popular anger and protest like little else.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war between Israel and <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas">Hamas</a> , now in its 12th day, has been no different. Covered around the clock on television, discussed endlessly on social media, it has sparked an outpouring of support for Palestinians. Still, compared with past conflicts, like the 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, a few things look different.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One is geopolitics. Since 2020 four Arab states—Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> )—have established relations with Israel, which previously had ties with just two (Egypt and Jordan). Saudi Arabia has been in talks to do the same. That has changed the way some Arab media outlets cover the conflict.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Al Jazeera, the Qatari broadcaster, has given ample time to Hamas, which is supported by Qatar. Meanwhile, channels run by Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE</small> have tried to walk a tightrope. Though they cover scenes of devastation in Gaza, they do not book Hamas officials for interviews (Arabic-speaking Israeli Jews are frequent guests, though). There have been heated debates in newsrooms over language: where once they might have used the phrase <i>jaish al-ihtilal</i> (“occupation army”), for example, today they just refer to it as the Israeli army.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second difference is fear of a broader conflict. The 2014 war was limited to the holy land. It may not stay there this time—and that has complicated the discussion, at least in those countries close to Israel. Take Egypt. America and several Arab countries are urging it to open Rafah, the sole border crossing with Gaza not controlled by Israel, to allow civilians to escape the fighting.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But a broad swath of Egyptian society is adamant that their country should resist such pressure. “Why did you impose this war on me?” asked Ibrahim Eissa, a pro-government talk-show host, in a message directed at Hamas. “You want me to risk 100m Egyptians for your sake?” Other pundits have made similar remarks. One could dismiss them as mere mouthpieces for the regime—but their words have been widely echoed by the public.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The discourse is similar in Lebanon, which is four years into one of the worst economic crises in modern history. Many Lebanese are worried that Hizbullah, the powerful Shia militia and political party, will open a second front against Israel, thus dragging their country into another ruinous war like the one in 2006. “Don&#39;t enter us into this hell,” wrote Dima Sadek, a well-known journalist who is both deeply supportive of the Palestinians and deeply critical of Hizbullah.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That points to a third shift: the region is more polarised today. Many Syrians, in particular, are appalled by the scenes in Gaza, where Israel&#39;s siege warfare reminds them of the tactics deployed by Bashar al-Assad. But they are simultaneously loth to cheer for Hamas, a group backed by Iran, which did so much to destroy their country. And they fume at commentators across the Arab world who abhor Israeli atrocities but cheered Mr Assad&#39;s. In Lebanon, too, some people are focused on the wider politics: whatever their views of Israel, they hope Iran (and thus Hizbullah) will emerge weakened.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In off-the-record conversations over the past 12 days, some Arab officials have spoken about Hamas and Gaza in the sort of language one would expect to hear from right-wing Israelis. They harbour no sympathy for an Islamist group backed by Iran. But they dare not repeat such remarks in public.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The disconnect between palace and public helps explain why Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, received a frosty reception on his recent round of shuttle diplomacy. First it was Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, who kept Mr Blinken and his entourage waiting hours for a planned Saturday-night meeting (the prince did not receive them until the next morning).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not unusual for Prince Muhammad, a night owl with an erratic schedule, to leave guests to cool their heels. That he did it to such a high-profile visitor, though, was seen as a pointed message. Then, after landing in Cairo, Mr Blinken was subjected to an unusual public lecture by Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the Egyptian president, who lamented the plight of the Palestinians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Biden will not even receive that chilly welcome. He had been scheduled to fly to Jordan after Israel, where he was to meet King Abdullah; Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president; and Mr Sisi. But Mr Abbas backed out shortly after the hospital blast, and then Jordan announced that the whole summit was off. Whatever Mr Biden had hoped to say to Arab leaders, they are in no mood to hear it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet behind the public posturing lies deep unease. Since October 7th many analysts have drawn parallels with the Yom Kippur war, the last time Israel experienced such a calamitous intelligence failure. But there is also a profound contrast with that moment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 1973 Arab states were able to launch a war that seemed, to Israel, an existential threat. Historians have argued ever since about whether that was true. But it felt that way at the time—enough so that Moshe Dayan, the defence minister, is said to have mooted the use of nuclear weapons. Half a century later, Israel was dragged to war by a militant group, and the region now faces the prospect of a broader conflict waged by other non-state actors supported by non-Arab Iran.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for Arab states, they are nervous onlookers. Najib Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, was blunt about the possibility of war in Lebanon: “These decisions are not in my hands,” he told al-Jadeed, a local television network. The leaders of Egypt and Jordan fear fallout from the war will destabilise their own brittle regimes. Gulf states are nervous about antagonising Iran, lest its proxies lash out at Riyadh or Abu Dhabi. This is not an existential moment for Israel—but some Arab rulers fear it might be for them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:18:01 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/f91l15fjgd7ptb5652b934gph5sid6vs</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/18/the-arab-world-thinks-differently-about-this-war </item><item><title><![CDATA[Mapping Israel’s war in Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div><div id="g-20231021_GDC100-Artboard_1_copy_2" class="g-artboard svelte-1kjtrrq"><img id="g-20231021_GDC100-Artboard_1_copy_2-img" class="g-20231021_GDC100-Artboard_1_copy_2-img g-aiImg svelte-1kjtrrq" alt src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=="></div><div id="g-20231021_GDC100-Artboard_1_copy_3" class="g-artboard svelte-1kjtrrq"><img id="g-20231021_GDC100-Artboard_1_copy_3-img" class="g-20231021_GDC100-Artboard_1_copy_3-img g-aiImg svelte-1kjtrrq" alt src="/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war/images/20231021_GDC100-Artboard_1_copy_3.png"></div></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 16:24:39 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ctin1lkmop61dvhpgi48dpak2k36ufdt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war </item><item><title><![CDATA[Vladimir Putin’s plan to profit from the Israel-Hamas war]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he past</small> 48 hours have seen a burst of diplomacy by Russia regarding the Middle East crisis. On October 16th Vladimir Putin spoke to <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/16/wartime-leaders-usually-get-a-popularity-bump-israels-hasnt">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> , Israel&#39;s prime minister, and the leaders of Egypt, Iran, Syria and the Palestinian Authority. Mr Putin expressed his condolences for the murdered Israelis, but failed to denounce Hamas&#39;s attacks. Russia&#39;s autocrat also called for a ceasefire, and blamed the crisis on America.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">了解有关以色列和哈马斯之间战争的更多信息</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The calls confirm two things: Russia&#39;s estrangement from Israel, and that the Kremlin sees the Israel-Hamas war as an opportunity to undermine and distract the West. This effort will be applauded by China: indeed Mr Putin has just arrived in Beijing to attend the Belt and Road summit, hosted by Xi Jinping. Meanwhile Joe Biden will tomorrow fly to Israel to meet Mr Netanyahu, seeking to shape Israel&#39;s military response, get a flow of aid to Gaza and deter Iran and its proxies. The rival jet-setting travel schedules illustrate a world that is divided over Ukraine, the Middle East and more.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Netanyahu used to call Vladimir Putin his “dear friend”. He has visited Russia a dozen times in recent years. So he must have been surprised that it took Russia&#39;s president nine days after Hamas&#39;s deadly rampage in southern Israel to pick up the phone. Russia has had scarcely a word of censure for the militants, despite reports that among so many others they killed 16 of its nationals, and that eight more may be missing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Netanyahu had been courting Mr Putin because of Russia&#39;s role in Syria, Israel&#39;s most unstable immediate neighbour. Russia has been propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Syria&#39;s murderous dictator, through indiscriminate bombing of various rebel groups. Mr Netanyahu wanted to be sure that Israel would be free to pursue its own interests in Syria, including periodic air strikes, without Russian hindrance. Some argue that Mr Netanyahu, the dominant politician in Israel for the past two decades, also has an affinity for strongmen like Mr Putin. He was hesitant to criticise Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and muted when he did so. Nor did he supply Ukraine with weapons, despite Ukrainian requests.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is plenty of potential affinity between Russia and Israel: 15% of Israelis speak Russian, owing to their origins in the former Soviet Union. Mr Putin seems to admire Israel as a muscular regional power not afraid to throw its weight around and welcomed Mr Netanyahu&#39;s apparent indifference to Russia&#39;s democratic failings.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But for all the shows of warmth, Russian support for Palestinian nationalism has not wavered since the Soviet era, when Russia helped train Palestinian fighters and armed the Arab countries that attacked Israel in 1973. Russia has long been closer to the likes of Syria than it has to Israel. And Mr Putin&#39;s soft spot for Israel has not stopped him cosying up to Iran, the Middle East&#39;s most fervently anti-Israeli regime.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is no suggestion that Russia gave any direct help to Hamas in either the planning or execution of its assault in southern Israel. But Russia has maintained friendly relations with the Iranian-backed organisation since it came to power in Gaza, believing that it might one day come in useful. Russia&#39;s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warmly welcomed a member of Hamas&#39;s leadership, Khaled Meshaal, to Moscow in 2007. When Israeli forces entered Gaza in 2014 in a seven-week operation, they found themselves on the receiving end of a large number of Russian anti-tank missiles, supplied by Iran.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia&#39;s ever warmer relationship with Iran has already been creating tensions with Israel and might have caused a falling-out even without the atrocity of October 7th. Last year, as Russia ran low on missiles with which to pulverise Ukraine, it turned to Iran to provide it with hundreds of Shahed self-detonating drones to attack infrastructure and population centres. It is now making a version of its own with assistance from Iran. In return, it is thought that Russia will furnish Iran with attack helicopters and air-defence systems. Those weapons, in turn, would increase Iran&#39;s capabilities should it ever fight a war with Israel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Putin may not want that, but he probably would not mind if Israel&#39;s war against Hamas escalates and widens to other parts of the Arab world. Hamas has already helped take the West&#39;s focus off the war in Ukraine. Joe Biden, America&#39;s president, is trying to secure Congress&#39;s approval for further help for Ukraine by tying it to an emergency aid package for Israel. But even if that succeeds, an expanded conflagration in the Middle East is bound to reduce the flow of munitions to Ukraine, much to Russia&#39;s advantage.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> By sending two aircraft-carriers to the region, plus its top diplomat, Antony Blinken, America has shown how eager it is to prevent the conflict from broadening. It is hoping to deter Hizbullah, another Iranian proxy, which controls southern Lebanon and has an arsenal of up to 150,000 rockets and missiles pointed at Israel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A wider war would probably bring two benefits to both Russia and Iran. The first would be a spike in oil and gas prices that would help both ailing economies and give Mr Putin extra money to fund his war in Ukraine. The second would be to disrupt America&#39;s plans for the Middle East. Already, Hamas has served Iranian and Russian interests by deferring indefinitely the mooted peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia that America has spent much time and effort attempting to bring about.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is for very much the same reasons that China has also declined to offer Israel comfort by condemning Hamas. China has so far merely expressed concern “over the current escalation of tensions and violence between Palestine and Israel”. According to a report in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> , by juxtaposing the preparations of heavily armed Israeli forces soon to enter Gaza with pictures of American warships apparently steaming towards the conflict zone, Chinese news outlets give the impression that the operation is Washington-led.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Like Russia, China will be happy to see America bogged down in the region and its authority challenged. China helped to broker a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia earlier this year partly in the hope of undermining the American-led world order. It may not have had any inkling of Hamas&#39;s plans, but it is unlikely to be regretting the turmoil they have caused. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 15:41:59 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/v37kicgjk3oa345b6rmmje1egv10024q</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/17/putins-plan-to-profit-from-the-israel-hamas-war </item><item><title><![CDATA[Hamas tunnels under Gaza will be a key battlefield for Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>S</span> <small>TUDENTS OF urban</small> <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza">warfare</a> divide the battlefield into four planes. One is the sky above cities, increasingly thick with drones. Next are the buildings that extend upwards, offering vantage points and hiding places. A third is the streetscape: the lattice of roads, alleys and paths that form a city&#39;s peacetime arteries. It is the fourth—the tunnels lying beneath—that will present the greatest challenge to the Israel Defence Forces ( <small>IDF</small> ) when they begin <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/10/12/what-will-a-successful-ground-invasion-look-like-for-israel">their invasion</a> of the Gaza Strip in the coming days.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">了解有关以色列和哈马斯之间战争的更多信息</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The first smuggling tunnels in the area were built by Bedouin clans on both sides of the Egypt-Gaza border after 1981, when Israel and Egypt demarcated the border. The first known tunnel attack from the strip occurred in 1989. But it was in 2001 that Hamas, the militant group that would later take over the territory, after Israel withdrew in 2005, began construction of a remarkable subterranean network. Its initial aim was to smuggle in material and arms from Egypt. But the tunnels had manifold other uses.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Commanders could hide in them and use them to communicate without relying on Gaza&#39;s phone network, tapped by Israel. They provided hiding places for weapons and ammunition. Hamas could use them for ambushes during Israeli ground wars in Gaza. And they allowed cross-border raids into Israel for attacks and abductions—such as the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit in 2006, a raid that later helped Hamas secure the release of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hizbullah, the Lebanese militant group, built similar tunnels on the Israel-Lebanon border, though most were destroyed in 2018-19.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The military rationale of such tunnels was ultimately to erode Israel&#39;s way of war. “In 2008”, said a Hamas commander, reflecting on a brief but intense war over Gaza that winter, “the air strike and air surveillance [by Israel] took us by surprise…so we made strategic plans to move the battle from the surface to underground.” By 2014 the group&#39;s tunnelling effort employed 900 full-time staff, with each tunnel taking three months and an average of $100,000 to build, according to a study by the <small>RAND</small> Corporation, a think-tank. Hamas raised capital for the tunnels, pitching them as commercial investment schemes, complete with contracts drafted by lawyers, through mosques in Gaza. Iran and North Korea are thought to have helped with construction, supplying money and engineers. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQguXCKggpc?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 2014 the <small>IDF</small> launched Operation Protective Edge, an air and ground war targeting the tunnels. It destroyed around 32 of them, stretching for 100km in total, 14 of which penetrated Israeli territory. That was a tiny fraction of the whole network, which was thought to number 1,300 tunnels extending, according to Hamas, 500km in all—more than ten times the length of Gaza itself. A commission of inquiry after the war found that the <small>IDF</small> was unprepared for the danger presented by the tunnels, despite having warned the country&#39;s political leadership that they presented one of the five most serious threats to the state. Israel&#39;s defence minister at the time boasted that it would take just a few days for the <small>IDF</small> to destroy the tunnels it had targeted; it took weeks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Locating tunnels proved extremely difficult. “We were familiar with the tunnels mainly in theory,” noted General Nadav Padan, who commanded a division in 2014. “We did not have operational experience.” (General Padan, since retired in New York, returned to Israel on October 8th to rejoin the <small>IDF</small> .) The <small>IDF</small> used “geophones”, as well as ground-penetrating radar, which turn ground vibrations into voltage, and detection of echoes from controlled explosions, a technique honed in the oil industry. But many tunnels were discovered thanks to human intelligence—sources inside Gaza—or infantry patrols that happened to find the entrances. Israeli signals-intelligence units also looked for occasions when Palestinian phone signals would suddenly disappear.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even when a tunnel was found, destroying it was another matter. Israel&#39;s air force attempted to drop precision bombs along the tunnel&#39;s route, a practice dubbed “kinetic drilling”, but some failed to detonate at the right depth. The <small>IDF</small> also used “Emulsa”, a gel-like explosive, but each tunnel required nine to 11 tonnes of the stuff on average, notes <small>RAND</small> , with ground troops forced to secure entrances for long periods. Units often had to improvise; some borrowed trolleys and agricultural equipment from Israeli border villages to shuttle explosives into Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the past, <small>IDF</small> personnel generally sought to avoid fighting in tunnels, many of which were booby-trapped. The army&#39;s high command barred troops from entering them unless one end had been blown up or secured; this order was disregarded only once, in 2014, when an Israeli officer&#39;s body was snatched into a tunnel in Rafah, Gaza&#39;s southern crossing with Egypt. The prohibition made sense. In many ways, subterranean warfare epitomises the trickiest aspects of urban warfare.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Cities involve limited lines of sight, close-quarters battle and poor communications, with radio signals travelling poorly between tall buildings. Tunnels exacerbate all those things. Even the most sophisticated drones cannot see underground. Navigating by <small>GPS</small> is impossible. Radio signals for communication do not penetrate far.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The experience of British soldiers involved in a recent tunnel exercise in Leeds, a northern city in England, highlighted the challenges that <small>IDF</small> soldiers are likely to face. The total darkness made night-vision goggles all but useless, for instance, since such devices rely on amplifying the faint ambient light that is present above ground even at night. Disturbing stagnant water risks releasing toxic gases into the air. The air is colder than above ground by as much as ten degrees Celsius. “You realise that unless you are properly drilled, and have spent a long time down there, you&#39;re not moving fast,” noted one British soldier in the Leeds exercise.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The sound of weapons fire is also amplified in an enclosed space, observes Joe Vega, the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s top expert on underground warfare. That, he says, is why larger teams are needed to clear tunnels, “because you have to continually replace people in and out—they just can&#39;t last.” The effect, known as overpressure, also causes weapons fire to kick up dust and dirt, reducing visibility.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The techniques once used to clear tunnels—America used tear gas in Vietnam; the Soviets a variety of chemical agents in Afghanistan—“would likely be regarded as unlawful today”, says Daphné Richemond-Barak in “Underground Warfare”, a book on the topic. (Despite its frequent use against domestic protesters, tear gas is largely illegal in war.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>IDF</small> increasingly relies on technology to help. It has remote-controlled ground robots, for instance, which can look for booby traps or ambushes lying in wait. “To enter a tunnel after a robot has combed through it…makes the situation a lot less stressful,” says a soldier from the <small>IDF</small> ’s elite Samur (weasel in Hebrew) tunnelling unit, quoted in a recent study. “It lowers the tension and the environment becomes much more sterile.” But tech is unreliable. “More than once a soldier was operating a robot that got stuck inside a tunnel,” complained another officer. “Now try and go in and retrieve a robot that is 400 metres inside a tunnel complex. It&#39;s like running 150 metres where each metre is like crossing a desert for a month.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the nine years since Operation Protective Edge, the <small>IDF</small> has invested heavily in tunnel operations; it has introduced new doctrine, techniques and specialised units. It has constructed its own version of Hamas tunnels for training. Its Yahalom battalion, an elite combat engineering unit, which includes Samur, was reorganised, notes Omer Dostri of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy &amp; Security, a think-tank, with its size doubled from 400 to 900 personnel and new tunnel reconnaissance units attached to the <small>IDF</small> ’s Gaza division.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It faces a forbidding task. On October 16th Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, the <small>IDF</small> ’s chief of staff, promised “to enter Gaza, to go to the places where Hamas is preparing, acting, planning, launching” and to “attack them everywhere, every commander, every operative, destroy infrastructure.” In practice, identifying, clearing and collapsing several hundred kilometres of underground warrens will be the work of years—not weeks or months. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 12:44:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/dq083q2h33ej3jclup6toov2l5i0djo5</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/17/hamas-tunnels-under-gaza-will-be-a-key-battlefield-for-israel </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s tank commanders are studying Russia’s mistakes]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>L</span> <small>IKE EVERY</small> modern army, <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/netanyahu-wages-war-and-fights-for-his-own-survival">Israel&#39;s generals</a> have been watching the battles in Ukraine over the past year and a half closely and taking notes. Now that the tank battalions of the Israel Defence Forces ( <small>IDF</small> ) are poised to enter Gaza in force, following the <a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">terror attack</a> on Israeli communities on October 7th in which more than 1,400 were murdered, those lessons are particularly relevant. Tanks, though increasingly vulnerable to drones, loitering munitions and modern anti-tank guided missiles, which strike from the top, remain the only platform on the battlefield combining mobility, protection and serious firepower. They will form the vanguard of Israel&#39;s ground invasion of Gaza, blasting a path for the infantry units behind them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “We saw how the Russians fought in Ukraine and the mistakes they made,” says Brigadier General Hisham Ibrahim, commander of the <small>IDF</small> ’s Armoured Corps, who has the job of preparing Israel&#39;s tanks and their crews for war. “They fought there in a single-corps fashion, instead of using combined arms tactics,” he explains. In other words, Russia&#39;s armoured regiments operated as separate tank units instead of working in integrated formations with infantry, combat-engineering and artillery units, and without co-ordination with intelligence and air power. In some cases, tank columns were sent single-file down a road without any support, leaving them to be picked off by Ukrainians. Russian tank crews were poorly trained and showed little sign of following their own doctrine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Israel&#39;s armoured corps has a different shape than it used to,” says General Ibrahim. “We have been training in a combined-arms fashion at all levels for some years now. We no longer see the tank as being capable of doing everything. The battlefield has changed; it&#39;s much more crowded and built-up. There are many challenges to these big platforms and I expect the infantry and engineers to make up for my disadvantages. Our soldiers in all the courses and exercises are now accustomed to fighting in a combined-arms environment.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many of these ideas were originally learned from Israel&#39;s large-scale tank battles during the Yom Kippur war, 50 years ago. During that conflict the <small>IDF</small> ’s armoured battalions, sometimes operating on their own, took major losses from Egypt&#39;s then-novel Sagger anti-tank missiles, supplied by the Soviet Union, as well as from opposing tanks. The IDF quickly adapted, and its tactics were widely studied and adopted by the US Army in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, Israeli tank crews are widely seen as being among the best trained and prepared in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the <small>IDF</small> is not alone in having learned from Ukraine. At the start of Hamas&#39;s assault on the Israeli border, the attackers used drones carrying large grenades to take out observation posts. In one case at least, there is footage of such a grenade hitting an Israeli Merkava tank. Similar tactics have been used by the Ukrainians against Russian tanks. General Ibrahim insists that while some of the tanks on the border were hit “two or three times”, none was destroyed and all will be back in action shortly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless, in some of the staging areas, Merkava tanks have been seen with “cope cages”, slatted metal barriers fixed over the turret, the most exposed part of the vehicle, to block such attacks from above. Russia&#39;s resort to such improvised devices provoked sniggering last year, but Israel&#39;s adoption suggests that armour professionals take the threat from drones increasingly seriously. The more advanced version of the Merkava used by the <small>IDF</small> ’s regular armoured brigades, as opposed to those crewed by reservists, is equipped with the <small>TROPHY</small> , an extremely sophisticated Israeli-designed “active protection system” system which has proven effective at defeating incoming anti-tank missiles with explosive panels that blow outwards. Not all of the tank units have the system, however. And every tank, including earlier versions of the Merkava, in Israel&#39;s storage depots is now being deployed, suggesting the large scale of the operation to come and the need to guard Israel&#39;s northern border with Lebanon.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Within two hours of the start of the Hamas attack, General Ibrahim had notified all the <small>IDF</small> ’s armoured-brigade commanders that they should start mobilising, even before the official order had arrived from the army bosses. Now, for the first time in over four decades, since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the entire armoured corps has been called up.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is a massive force, and although the IDF, keen to protect its operational security, is not giving out numbers, it is understood to include over 1,000 main battle tanks. Many of these are not intended for the ground offensive in Gaza, but are being positioned in northern Israel for the possibility of war flaring up also with Hizbullah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese movement, which has been provoking an Israeli response with daily rocket and mortar shelling since the Hamas attack on October 7th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If a second front does erupt, Israeli tank-crews will be fighting two types of war. While both Hamas and Hizbullah have used similar tactics and weaponry in previous encounters with Israeli tanks—small ambush teams firing Russian-made (and Iranian-supplied) anti-tank missiles—the terrain will make a lot of difference. Facing Hizbullah in the hilly, woodland areas of the Galilee and southern Lebanon is a very different prospect from fighting in densely built-up urban areas of Gaza City, where attacks can come from close quarters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For many years, the consensus among military experts was that fighting with lumbering tanks in narrow city streets was a liability. But the more informed view is that if used properly, and in conjunction with other ground forces, nothing can replace the tank&#39;s firepower and breaching capabilities when fighting in an urban environment defended by heavily armed opponents. American commanders say that tanks proved vital in key urban battles in the Iraq war, including situations where lighter armoured vehicles proved inadequate. In Sadr City, a hostile suburb of Baghdad, American tanks and other armour formed what one study calls “roving, armoured boxes” which could move slowly, steadily and safely without exposing dismounted troops to danger.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel&#39;s tank corps has at least two advantages over many other tank operators. One is that Hamas is not thought to possess “top-attack” anti-tank missiles like the American Javelin and Anglo-Swedish <small>NLAW</small> , supplied to Ukraine, which strike a tank at the weakest part of its armour—the top of the hull. The other is that Israeli tanks are designed to fight on the country&#39;s borders, rather than far from home, and to give high levels of protection. That makes them relatively bulky and heavy, and potentially less mobile, but capable of withstanding serious hits.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In addition to their “active” protection, the more advanced Israeli tanks and infantry fighting vehicles also have sophisticated communications systems. These connect them to a network which supplies troops, on screens in the tank, with all the information being collected by sensors on other Israeli platforms, including footage from drones hovering overhead. “Today&#39;s tank can use information collected from other sources to fire on its targets and collect information itself which will be used by other sources of fire,” says General Ibrahim. That overcomes the traditional problem of urban warfare: short lines of sight, in which one tank platoon may have little idea of what is going on around the next block.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Like tank generals the world around, he deeply disagrees with those who inferred from Russia&#39;s failures that the day of the tank was over, and cites the events of October 7th as proof. As thousands of fighters were charging into Israel through 29 breaches along the border fence, he argues that at some points, the small number of tanks stationed that morning on the border “were the only remaining layer of protection, and they were using all their weapons, cannon, machineguns and simply running over, to try and stop hundreds of terrorists around them who were trying to get into the communities.” With most of the observation and cameras on the border knocked out, the tanks were often carrying the only surveillance systems still operating to pass along vital information.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ultimately the <small>IDF</small> ’s failure that morning was one of intelligence assessment and a lack of forces within quick reach of the border.

Israeli jets and artillery have been pounding the coastal enclave. “The scenes out of Gaza will be hard to stomach,” warned a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces ( <small>IDF</small> ) on October 12th. Hamas, which has deliberately massacred civilians, and whose founding charter commits it to the destruction of Israel, is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes. How far can Israel go in response?</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">了解有关以色列和哈马斯之间战争的更多信息</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Israel&#39;s initial actions have prompted a wave of criticism. B&#39;tselem, an Israeli human-rights group, has accused Israel of “a criminal policy of revenge”, arguing that the scale of its air strikes and blockade constitute “war crimes openly ordered by top Israeli officials”. Médecins Sans Frontières, a humanitarian organisation, has accused Israel of unlawful “collective punishment” of Gaza “in the form of total siege, indiscriminate bombing, and the pending threat of a ground battle.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In practice, though, international law and the specific rules that govern warfare—the law of armed conflict ( <small>LOAC</small> ), also known as international humanitarian law ( <small>IHL</small> )—give Israel considerable latitude to attack Hamas, according to legal experts. Article 51 of the United Nations charter gives states the right of self-defence against armed attack, provided that, according to customary international law, the force they use is necessary and proportionate. Proportionality does not mean symmetry in the type of weapons used or the number of casualties caused. It means that the defending state can use as much force as is needed to address the threat—and no more. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_WOC992.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Drawing that line is a subjective and contentious process. But Israel&#39;s campaign so far would meet those criteria, argues Aurel Sari, a law professor at the University of Exeter who lectures to <small>NATO</small> armed forces. The scale of Hamas&#39;s attack, its demonstrated intent and proven capability means that <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza">invading Gaza</a> or even occupying it temporarily to destroy the group “will be relatively easy to justify” legally, he says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nonetheless, some measures are particularly contentious. Israel, helped by Egypt, which controls a southern crossing, has maintained a ground, air and naval blockade of Gaza for years, with only some goods and people permitted to cross. Sieges and blockades are not in themselves illegal. But on October 9th Yoav Gallant, Israel&#39;s defence minister, said that would turn into a “complete siege”, with “no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed”. Three days later Israel Katz, the energy minister, warned that no “electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter” until Hamas <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/08/israeli-hostages-now-face-a-terrifying-ordeal">freed hostages</a> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israeli officials justify this move on the basis that Hamas diverts civilian goods for military use. “Clearly” says Amichai Cohen, a law professor at the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, “there is some level of supply that Israel should allow. The question is whether Israel should provide electricity to areas which are clearly controlled by Hamas, and where Hamas will use the electricity in order to attack Israel.” Others, such as Tom Dannenbaum, a law professor at Tufts University in Boston, argue that Mr Gallant&#39;s order plainly violates a prohibition on starving civilians—even if the goal is to squeeze Hamas. That may be one reason why, despite Mr Gallant&#39;s combative rhetoric, Israeli officials are privately working with Egypt to ensure that some supplies can come in from the south. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQguXCKggpc?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second source of legal dispute is the <small>IDF</small> ’s decision, late in the evening of October 12th, to tell 1.1m civilians living in the northern part of Gaza <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/as-war-looms-israel-calls-for-11m-people-to-evacuate-northern-gaza">to move south</a> . (Hamas called on civilians to ignore the call.) The grave humanitarian consequences of this decision are not in doubt. Gaza&#39;s infrastructure is in ruins and there are few places for so many people to go. But the legal aspects are more complicated.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lawyers distinguish between temporary evacuation of civilians in warzones, which can be lawful, and permanent displacement, where the intent is to prevent them from returning, which is not. However the International Committee of the Red Cross ( <small>ICRC</small> ), a humanitarian group, says that the evacuation instructions, combined with the siege, “are not compatible with international humanitarian law”. It is also not always safe to move while the bombardment continues. Video footage verified by the <i>Washington Post</i> showed a number of people including several children who had been killed, apparently by an Israeli strike while they were fleeing to the south on Friday.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The question of evacuation is tangled up with the specific conditions of Gaza, where Hamas is deeply intermingled with the civilian population. <small>IHL</small> , which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting the latter on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians—even lots of them—can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportional “in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel&#39;s targeting is “broadly within the mainstream of contemporary state practice” and in line with American doctrine, argued Michael Schmitt of the University of Reading and Lieutenant-Colonel John Merriam, a <small>US</small> Army Judge Advocate, in papers published after they visited the <small>IDF</small> ’s headquarters and studied its procedures shortly after Operation Protective Edge, Israel&#39;s 50-day war on Hamas in 2014.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the same legal principles, even interpreted in broadly the same way, can result in different and sometimes jarring outcomes because of local circumstances. Hamas&#39;s large rocket force, capable of striking most of Israel, means that the anticipated “military advantage” of attacks is seen to be high, note Mr Schmitt and Lt-Col Merriam. That can justify, in the <small>IDF</small> ’s view, high levels of collateral damage that would appear excessive to an army whose civilian population did not face a comparable threat—though, conversely, the effectiveness of the country&#39;s Iron Dome missile-defence system can have the opposite legal effect. Similarly, Israel&#39;s conscript-heavy armed forces are casualty averse and sensitive to soldiers being taken prisoner. That can result in a greater reliance on firepower.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hamas&#39;s way of war also plays a role in Gaza. “It&#39;s not a regular city,” argues Avichai Mandelblit, who served as Israel&#39;s chief military advocate general ( <small>MAG</small> ) from 2004 to 2011 and attorney-general from 2016 to 2022. “It&#39;s a military city. There are thousands of legal military targets inside the neighbourhoods of Gaza. You cannot distinguish them.” Israel&#39;s war aim is to destroy Hamas. “If you want to do it,” says Mr Mandelblit, “then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas.” Evacuation of civilians is thus unavoidable, he says. “There is no other way—the other way is they&#39;re going to be killed.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The law nonetheless demands discrimination. Each target must be judged individually. But the scale of Israel&#39;s bombardment—6,000 bombs dropped in six days, compared with 2,000 to 5,000 per month across Iraq and Syria during the American-led air campaign against Islamic State from 2014 to 2019—has given rise to concern that the definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point. “It is very hard to see a legal basis for many of these strikes,” argues Adil Haque of Rutgers Law School in New Jersey. “It&#39;s hard to believe that all of these buildings were in active use by Hamas when they were levelled, or that their military value would outweigh the foreseeable harm to civilians in or near them.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Sari says that the <small>IDF</small> , in his experience, is “world-class” in its legal expertise and professional ethics. “I have a lot of faith in the Israeli military, lawyers and their system. It is very robust.” Military lawyers are present at Israeli military headquarters from the brigade-level up to advise on targeting. “Every target is legally examined,” insists Mr Mandelblit. Legal policy is set by the <small>MAG</small> and civilian attorney general together, with the latter getting the last word.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But this system is likely to face its greatest test in the weeks ahead. On October 10th an Israeli official told a television station: “Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents. There will be no buildings.” Daniel Hagari, an <small>IDF</small> spokesperson, boasted that “hundreds of tons of bombs” had been dropped on Gaza. Then, he added: “the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy.” Neither statement can be squared with the law. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="TOPSHOT-ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN-CONFLICT-FESTIVAL" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_MAP519.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: AFP via Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Major acts of terrorism can unmoor even the most professional armed forces. America engaged in torture after 9/11. American, Australian and British special forces have all faced allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. A video published on October 10th appears to show Israeli troops executing Palestinian gunmen who were on their knees and waving a flag of surrender. “If you send tens of thousands of conscript soldiers on a revenge mission into a dense urban area that civilians can&#39;t leave, the results are entirely predictable,” warns Jack McDonald of the Department of War Studies at King&#39;s College London.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Restraints that applied in previous military operations may not apply in this war. Mr Mandelblit gives the example of the <small>IDF</small> ’s policy of giving prior warning for some strikes. Armies are generally obliged to provide warning of attacks when they can, though not if surprise is essential. “You cannot do it in such a war,” he says. “It&#39;s more like Lebanon now,” he says, alluding to Israel&#39;s war with Hizbullah, the militant group, in 2006. “All we can say to civilians is: look, go away from your cities or your homes, where Hamas is mixed.” The <small>IDF</small> has already abandoned its earlier practice of “roof knocks”—the use of smaller bombs a few minutes ahead of larger strikes—in favour of general warnings to entire neighbourhoods.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel&#39;s war has acquired an existential quality. “This time it&#39;s going to be a war to the end,” says Mr Mandelblit. “It&#39;s either us or them because we know what they&#39;re going to do to us.” Yet Mr Cohen warns that the law is not the only consideration in waging war. “The fact that a lot of children in Gaza, Palestinian children, will die in an attack—even if it&#39;s legal—is destructive for Israel&#39;s legitimacy around the world.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 10:53:29 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/jiht1q96cv6jqlk3ijh24ar30bc6cfcl</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/is-israel-acting-within-the-laws-of-war-in-gaza </item><item><title><![CDATA[Hamas’s attack was the bloodiest in Israel’s history]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1ey6m750"><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span>I</span> <small>Sraelis know</small> they cannot take their physical safety for granted.

Most were clustered around the border with Gaza, but some reached as far as the southern suburbs of Tel Aviv.</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Blood stains a wall at an Israeli police station in Sderot, a city in Israel"></span><figcaption> Blood stains a wall at an Israeli police station in Sderot</figcaption></figure><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP504.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Cars strewn on the side of the road in the aftermath of an attack on a music Festival by Hamas militants."></span><figcaption> The aftermath of the attack on the Nova music festival</figcaption></figure><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP501.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Palestinian militants transport a reportedly captured Israeli woman by motorcycle in the southern Gaza Strip."></span><figcaption> Hamas militants return to Gaza by motorcycle with an Israeli hostage</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The assault dwarfs all other mass murders of Israeli civilians. The bloodiest atrocity committed by Arabs during Israel&#39;s war of independence, a massacre at Kfar Etzion, an Israeli settlement, in May 1948, left 127 people dead. And the deadliest previous attack by Palestinian terrorists, a bomb detonated at a Passover seder at a hotel in the city of Netanya in 2002, killed 30. The death toll from October 7th has already surpassed the total number of Israelis killed during the second intifada, a Palestinian uprising that lasted from 2000 to 2005. As a share of Israel&#39;s population, it is equivalent to 12 September 11th attacks—a daily mortality rate exceeded only by full-scale wars, genocides or natural disasters.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The most searing historical comparison predates Israel&#39;s founding. Not all of Hamas&#39;s victims were Israeli, and not all of the Israeli dead were Jewish. But under reasonable assumptions about the ethnic make-up of those killed in this and previous attacks, the last time before October 7th that this many Jews were murdered on a single day was during the Holocaust. <span>■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <em>Chart sources: <i>B&#39;tselem</i> ; <i>Pikud HaOref</i> ; NASA; OpenStreetMap</em></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 14:05:49 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/47fe7h2nqplk9iadhnkrc86ed7u3odcv</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history </item><item><title><![CDATA[Hamas’s atrocities and Israel’s retaliation will change both sides for ever]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Israel%20and%20Gaza-cb43f63e7a1ce7b296c29c9a674f11ad.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE FIRST</small> hours were chaos. Residents of southern Israel, near the border with Gaza, woke to the sound of incoming rockets and mortars. They rushed to shelters—a grim routine in this part of the country, but a routine nonetheless. Then, a few minutes later, they heard gunfire drawing steadily closer and shouting in Arabic. That was not routine at all.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nor were the unimaginable scenes outside their homes, snippets of which began to trickle out on social media: Palestinian militants on the bed of a pickup truck, driving through an Israeli town firing at passers-by; a pile of bodies at a bus stop, another at an army post. The morning dragged on, and no help arrived. Frantic Israelis called television-news shows from their safe rooms and asked, in hushed tones, where their army was.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Then, no less shocking, came the reports of abductions. A mother said her two sons, one of them just 12 years old, had been kidnapped and dragged across the border. A video showed an elderly woman, her stiff smile belying her shock, paraded through the streets of Gaza on a golf cart, an armed man seated behind her.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The death toll went up and up and up. Almost a week later, authorities were still counting bodies. In Be&#39;eri, a small kibbutz of around 1,000 people, militants went door-to-door and slaughtered some 10% of the population. An even greater number may have been killed in Kfar Azza, eight kilometres to the north.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Israelis October 7th was a day without precedent. More than 1,300 people were killed, in a country of just 10m. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history">death toll</a> exceeds the number of Israelis killed in all violence between Israelis and Palestinians over the prior 20 years. Another 3,300 people were wounded. Israelis had thought Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that controls Gaza, was a manageable threat. Now it has carried out the deadliest terror attack in their country&#39;s history. The mightiest army in the Middle East lost control of its own towns, and needed days to regain it. Authorities have recovered the bodies of at least 1,500 Palestinian militants—more than a battalion&#39;s worth of gunmen who managed to flood across the supposedly well-defended boundary.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As shock gives way to anger, the immediate question is how Israel will respond. It has already begun a campaign of retaliatory air strikes, which has killed more than 1,200 Palestinians, many of them civilians, and displaced more than 300,000. Israel will not stop there, although its military options are unappealing. There is bound to be more suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians in the weeks ahead.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the consequences of October 7th will be much more sweeping. The massacre could reshape not only Israel&#39;s approach to the Palestinians but also its own domestic politics. It <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause">threatens Hamas&#39;s grip on power</a> in Gaza; it also risks a regional war.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The assault began with a barrage of rockets: 2,200 of them in a matter of hours. That would have been shocking enough: it took Hamas almost a month to fire that many during its war against Israel in 2014. But Israelis soon discovered that the launches were cover for a bigger operation. Bulldozers breached the border fence and hundreds of militants streamed across. Others flew over it in paragliders or sailed round it in dinghies. They fanned out to Israeli cities and towns and started killing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It took Israel hours to organise a defence. Some units had to be rushed south from the northern border. Once they arrived, they languished in staging areas while commanders tried to work out a battle plan. Several retired generals took matters into their own hands, donning their old uniforms and driving to besieged villages to lead impromptu counter-attacks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even before it reclaimed its own territory, Israel started air strikes on Gaza. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, announced that Israel was at war, and his government began to prepare for a possible ground offensive. The army has mobilised 360,000 reservists and has spent days shifting tanks and other kit to the Gaza border. Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, promised a total siege of Gaza. “No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel, everything is closed.” On October 11th its sole power plant ran out of fuel and shut down.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Erez, the sole border crossing between Israel and Gaza, is closed indefinitely. Israel told civilians in Gaza to flee via the Rafah crossing with Egypt, but has repeatedly bombed it. Egypt anyway severely restricts the numbers permitted to cross. It is hard for Palestinians to leave Gaza even in peacetime. Now it is impossible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As it prepares to fight in Gaza, the Israeli army must keep an eye on its northern border. On October 8th Hizbullah, a Shia militant group and political party in Lebanon, shelled the Shebaa Farms, a disputed sliver of territory. By unspoken rules of engagement, what happens in Shebaa stays in Shebaa: Hizbullah could show support for the Palestinians but also show Israel it did not want a broader conflict.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A day later, though, the Israeli army killed a group of gunmen who crossed the border from Lebanon. Three Hizbullah militants were then killed in Israel&#39;s retaliatory bombardment, which led the group to fire rockets at an Israeli army post. Neither side may want a war, but escalation is not always guided by logic. Lebanese citizens have rushed to stockpile food and fuel. Israel has evacuated towns near the northern border. Hamas has called loudly for others to join its attack on Israel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israeli forces may take time to prepare, but a ground offensive against the Gaza Strip seems all but certain. Israeli troops occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005, when they withdrew, forcing about 8,000 Jewish settlers to retreat with them. Since then, Israel has largely blockaded the territory by air, land and sea, while allowing some Palestinians to work in Israel and goods of a non-threatening nature to enter. (Egypt is almost as restrictive.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel&#39;s most recent incursion into Gaza, in 2014, was to destroy tunnels Hamas had dug under the border fence to infiltrate Israel. Israeli forces did not penetrate very far into the territory, which is only about 10km wide and 40km long, but home to 2m people. Even so, the operation showed how ground assaults can go wrong. A Hamas unit attacked an Israeli patrol near Rafah and captured an officer, Hadar Goldin. Israel subsequently shelled Rafah for days, killing dozens of Palestinians. Goldin was later declared dead. Israelis dubbed the incident “Black Friday”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The impending attack will be much bigger. Israel is likely to deploy two armoured divisions and one lighter airborne division, each of which has five brigades. Some of these units are waiting for their tanks and other equipment to reach staging areas around Gaza. Others took losses over the past several days of combat.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Assuming Israel&#39;s leaders do order a large-scale invasion, one or two armoured brigades with tanks would probably try to cut the strip in two by pushing west at its narrowest point—6km—near Deir al-Balah. Two or three other brigade-sized units—a few thousand men each—would probably focus on the north, including around Gaza City, and one or two others on Khan Yunis or Rafah in the south. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Cars strewn on the side of the road in the aftermath of an attack on a music Festival by Hamas militants" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP003.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Monuments to a massacre</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Their aim would probably be to target both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a separate militant group, focusing on leaders and infrastructure beyond the reach of air strikes. Hamas has claimed that it has several hundred kilometres of tunnels in Gaza. Locating their entrances and dropping in explosives will be a priority. The biggest challenge will be urban warfare, a notoriously difficult task. Gaza is more densely populated than London or Tokyo, giving militants lots of places to hide and civilians few places to take refuge.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hamas may be counting on a relatively cautious assault. The group assumes that Israel will not have the stomach for the high casualties a ground invasion would entail. “We know that they are cowards,” says Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official based in Qatar. “We know that they can&#39;t fight on the ground.” It also expects the presence of more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages in Gaza will restrain the Israeli forces. Hamas hopes to exchange these prisoners for many, if not all, of the 5,200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. It has also threatened to kill one each time Israel bombs civilian homes in Gaza “without advance warning”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The catastrophic death toll of recent days may change the Israeli calculus, however. “The Israeli willingness to bear—and exact—costs is much higher than in the past,” says Natan Sachs of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington. As for the hostages, many Israelis still burying loved ones say they are in no mood to haggle with the group that killed them.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Ignore at your peril</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indeed, Israel is having to re-examine many long-held assumptions, most notably the belief that Gaza could safely be left to fester. After Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from the Palestinian Authority ( <small>pa</small> ), the Palestinian government-in-waiting, Israel and Egypt drastically tightened border restrictions, asphyxiating Gaza&#39;s economy. Despite the repeated bouts of violence since then, Israeli officials had come to think that Hamas had become more pragmatic. “Above all, they want to keep control of Gaza,” an army officer said last year. “To do that they need to improve the economy.” If Israel allowed Arab governments to bankroll basic social services in Gaza, the thinking ran, and issued more permits for Gazans to work in Israel, the territory would remain quiescent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not only was that view completely wrong, but Israel&#39;s vaunted security services also failed to spot that an elaborate attack was in the works. Every phone call in Gaza is routed through Israeli networks, which simplifies eavesdropping. Drones frequently fly over the strip. Israel also has a vast network of informants in the territory—all to no avail.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Part of the problem, no doubt, was a conceptual failure: the belief that Hamas had lost interest in large-scale conflict. In fact, even some Hamas leaders seem surprised. Mr Abu Marzouk says he and other senior leaders in Qatar were not told about the attack in advance. Since 2017, when Yahya Sinwar became the leader of Hamas in Gaza, a small number of hardliners, mostly based in Gaza, have consolidated power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second error was the divide-and-rule policy towards the Palestinians of Binyamin Netanyahu, who has been Israel&#39;s prime minister for 12 of the past 14 years. He has long sought to undermine the <small>PA</small> , which still runs parts of the West Bank. He has refused to resume peace negotiations since half-hearted talks broke down in 2014. He has frozen transfers of the tax revenues Israel collects on the <small>pa</small> ’s behalf. At the same time, he has treated Hamas like a legitimate power in Gaza. In 2011, for instance, he approved a deal to swap 1,027 Palestinian prisoners for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier the militants had captured in 2006. The exchange, naturally, raised Hamas&#39;s standing among Palestinians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Mr Netanyahu, the logic was clear. The <small>PA</small> is committed to negotiating a two-state solution with Israel, which is anathema to the prime minister&#39;s right-wing supporters. Undermining the <small>PA</small> and boosting its militant rival would help him to claim that Israel has no “partner for peace”. But Palestinians drew a different, if predictable lesson: that the only way to extract concessions from Israel is through force.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hamas may now have overreached, however. Some observers believe it did not expect its assault to be so successful and is not sure how to proceed. It may have hoped to frighten Israel into concessions, but has instead steeled it for war. The Israeli army told foreign defence attachés on October 10th that its aim was to “eliminate” the leadership of Hamas. “The military end-goal is to destroy Hamas&#39;s capability, no matter how long it takes,” the army said, according to someone who attended. That is easier said than done, though, as America learned during its long war in Afghanistan, or Israel during its 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="An Israeli soldier prays next to an armoured personnel carrier near the Israeli-Gaza border." width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">The next battle looms</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: AP</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if Israel could uproot Hamas, no one is sure what would replace it. The <small>PA</small> is too weak to assert authority in Gaza; it is not even strong enough to control the West Bank, parts of which have fallen into anarchy. A plurality of Palestinians, and a majority of Gazans, want to dissolve it. Mahmoud Abbas, the 87-year-old president, has not set foot in Gaza in almost 20 years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There has been some idle talk of sending Arab peacekeepers to secure Gaza, but few Arab regimes would want to do so. Egypt occupied Gaza from 1949 to 1967; both sides have bitter memories of that time. Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have no desire to rule over 2m Palestinians. Nor do most Israelis wish to reoccupy the territory.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To invade and then leave, however, would not change the status quo. Hamas&#39;s leaders and a large proportion of its fighters are likely to emerge from their bunkers and restore control over the strip the minute the Israelis depart. That is an unpalatable outcome, but it is the most likely one.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Charting a clear path forward would be difficult for any Israeli government, but especially for the current one. This has been a year of deep political turmoil. Mr Netanyahu won a plurality of seats in a snap election in November, after more than a year in opposition. He presides over a government comprised entirely of right-wing and religious parties. His minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was banned from serving in the Israeli army because of his extreme nationalist views.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Netanyahu has since pursued a divisive agenda, which includes curtailing the Supreme Court&#39;s authority to overturn government policies and giving politicians more say in the appointment of judges. Critics dubbed this a judicial “coup” and have staged mass protests every Saturday this year—until October 7th, when they were suspended. Army reservists threatened to boycott their mandatory service (that tactic, too, has been shelved).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists hope this month&#39;s carnage will help shift Israeli politics back to the centre. “If there can be one conciliation after this darkest of days, it will be Israel returning to its senses, ending the political crisis and forming a unity government,” wrote Shimrit Meir, an adviser to Naftali Bennett, who replaced Mr Netanyahu in 2021 for a brief stint as prime minister. In a prime-time address on October 9th Mr Netanyahu urged centrist parties to join his government “without preconditions”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On October 11th, after a couple of days of negotiation, Benny Gantz, a former army chief who leads the second-biggest centrist party, National Unity, agreed to join an “emergency government”. But Yair Lapid, leader of the biggest opposition party, Yesh Atid, has so far declined to participate.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> United in suspicion</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The dilemma, for both parties, lies in joining a government that their supporters have spent the past year protesting against. Mr Netanyahu has promised not to pursue any legislation unrelated to the war, but has refused to jettison his most extreme coalition partners. That makes sense for a prime minister concerned, as ever, with his political survival. The unity government will only last as long as the fighting does. Mr Netanyahu does not want to alienate the parties he will then need to form another right-wing coalition. Mr Gantz has held his nose and joined anyway, lending military expertise to a government that lacks it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although that will steady the government for the time being, the events of recent days may yet put an end to Mr Netanyahu&#39;s long and comeback-filled career. He has spent a year fighting a needless political battle instead of focusing on real threats—and many years before that labouring to make Palestine a problem with no solution. Security is his watchword and he has overseen the Israeli armed forces and intelligence services for more than a decade, with only a brief interruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hamas, for its part, has opted for murderous nihilism. To talk to its leaders is to slip into a fantasy world where Gaza is “liberated”, even though its inhabitants are trapped in penury in a 365 square-kilometre cell. Victory over Israel is imminent and until then Gazans will gladly endure their lot. Since the massacre the group has made clear that, apart from the hope of sparking a broader attack on Israel, it has no plan beyond continued violence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The unfolding cataclysm, in short, seems likely to lay bare the poverty of thinking on both sides. Alas, the appalling bloodshed of recent days, and the likelihood of further horrors to come, will also make adopting a more constructive approach to the conflict that much harder. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 10:28:19 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/j3vtaf9f098u4n7jtcbvjrnrk61lurgg</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-atrocities-and-israels-retaliation-will-change-both-sides-for-ever</item></channel></rss>
