2.1。该水平被称为替代率，因为它使人口随着时间的推移保持稳定。任何更低的水平最终都会导致人口下降，意大利和日本都遭受了大约十年的苦难。意大利人的中位数现在是 47 岁；中位数<!-- -->日语 49. 今年早些时候，日本首相岸田文雄警告说，由于婴儿潮，该国“处于无法维持社会功能的边缘”。</p><p class="article__body-text">但意大利和日本不再是人口下降的最极端例子。 2022 年，韩国的生育率仅为 0.8。低于一的比率意味着下一代的人口将少于其父母的一半。就在 2012 年，<small>联合国</small>预测到本世纪末韩国人口将仅减少五分之一左右，从今天的 5200 万减少到 2100 年的 4100 万。然而，最近的预测表明，人口将减少一半以上同期，仅为

“女性对职业和家庭生活的渴望在全球范围内趋同，”多普克先生说。受正规教育年限较少的女性的生育率已下降到受教育程度较高的同龄人的水平。事实上，在美国，受过 16 年教育的女性（主要是那些拥有本科学位的女性）平均生育的孩子比那些受过更多教育的女性要少。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">出于同样的原因，低生育率已经从意大利和日本等富裕国家蔓延到泰国（1.3）和巴西（1.6）等中等收入国家。更值得注意的是，印度的生育率近期已跌破2.1，并有望继续下降。由于它占世界人口的五分之一，这将产生全球影响。世界上最大的 15 个经济体，包括巴西、中国、印度和墨西哥，生育率都低于 2.1。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 2021 年，生育率低于替代率的国家有 7.82 亿人年龄在 21 岁至 30 岁之间。到 2050 年，这一群体，实际上是本土进入劳动力市场的潜在人数，预计将减少五分之一，至 6.19 亿。今年秋天并不是什么主观和有问题的预测：那一代人中的大多数人已经出生，生育率不会迅速变化。在生育率低于 1.5 的国家（几乎包括整个东亚和欧洲大部分地区），降幅将更为极端，同一群体将收缩 37%。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些国家将不再是金字塔形的人口结构，每一代都比之前的一代更大，甚至成为支柱，所有世代的规模都差不多，这些国家将变成倒金字塔，老一代被越来越小的群体所取代.在世界部分地区，这种情况已经发生：中国 21 岁至 30 岁的人口数量已经从 2012 年高峰期的 2.32 亿下降到 2021 年的 1.81 亿。到 2040 年代，下降速度将迅速加快，使中国人口不足 1 亿在 2050 年代中期的同一个游泳池中。同期，欧洲同一年龄段的人口将从 8500 万左右下降到 6000 万以下。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">补偿下降的出生率的明显方法是<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/28/a-new-wave-of-mass-migration-has-begun">移民</a>，尽管近年来产生了政治紧张局势，但在许多富裕国家，移民人数仍在增加。但随着人口下降影响到越来越多的国家，受过教育的移民将越来越难找到，即使许多富裕国家的本土出生人口正在加速萎缩。对于拥有约 14 亿人口的中国来说，认为可以找到足够多的移民来扭转出生率下降的影响的想法纯属天方夜谭。尽管印度的人口仍在增长，但它将在 2060 年代达到顶峰，甚至更早。撒哈拉以南非洲地区是世界上唯一一个在未来许多年内可能成为潜在移民重要来源的地区。但即使在那里，出生率的下降速度也比过去预测的要快。尽管移民将在未来几十年继续缓解许多国家的人口下降，但从长远来看，它无法完全弥补大经济体的婴儿潮。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些人口变化的一些后果是众所周知的。人口老龄化意味着公共养老金和医疗保健支出增加，但需要缴纳税款的工作年龄人口将减少。富裕国家目前大约有 3 个 20 至 64 岁的人与 1 个 65 岁以上的人相对应。到 2050 年，这一比例将缩小到不到 2 比 1。这将需要推迟退休年龄、提高税收或两者兼而有之。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，人口下降的经济后果不仅仅是财政方面的。劳动力是增长的三个主要决定因素之一，另外两个是资本和两者的使用效率（生产率）。在其他条件相同的情况下，劳动力缩减会自动导致经济增长放缓。但人口下降也会对资本和生产力产生连锁反应，而这种影响却鲜为人知。</p><p class="article__body-text">许多经济学家认为，工作人口减少将压低实际利率（即在考虑通货膨胀后），因为投资机会将减少，而那些已退休或即将退休的人将积累大量储蓄。但其他人，例如英格兰银行前官员查尔斯·古德哈特 (Charles Goodhart)，认为效果会适得其反。随着越来越多的人退休并停止储蓄但继续消费，投资资金将会减少，从而推高实际利率。</p><p class="article__body-text">双方都同意人口老龄化会同时减少储蓄和投资，但对于哪一个下降得更快，双方意见不一。但证据的平衡表明实际利率较低：许多发展中经济体仍需积累数十年的储蓄，退休人员往往会紧握储蓄而不是耗尽储蓄。无论哪种方式，人口变化都将对市场产生巨大影响。从广义上讲，低实际利率对那些已经积累了资产的人有利，但对那些仍在努力储蓄的人不利，包括越来越多即将退休但储备金不足的工人。</p><p class="article__body-text">但人口下降可能对生产力产生最令人不安的影响。年轻人拥有更多心理学家所说的“流体智力”，即解决新问题和接受新想法的能力。年长的人有更多的“结晶智力”——随着时间的推移积累的关于事物如何运作的知识储备。没有精确的界限，但大多数研究表明，流体智力往往在成年初期达到顶峰，并在 30 多岁时开始下降。两种类型的情报都是有用的：公司、行业和经济体既需要能够应对新挑战的年轻人，也需要对他们的行业有详细了解的经验丰富的老手。但在创新方面，两者并不具有同等价值。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">在 2021 年发表的研究中，经济学家 Mary Kaltenberg 和 Adam Jaffe 以及心理学家 Margie Lachman 使用一个包含 40 多年来提交的 300 万项专利的数据库来探索创新与年龄之间的关系。根据科学学科的不同，作者指出，专利申请率在研究人员 30 多岁和 40 多岁时达到顶峰。然后专利申请率只会在他们 40 多岁和 50 多岁时逐渐下降。</p><p class="article__body-text">但对于从根本上改变科学领域的颠覆性创新，情况就大不相同了。研究人员使用<!-- -->一种基于特定发明在未来专利中被引用次数的颠覆性衡量标准。如果一项特定专利被后续发明人引用，但该专利的技术前辈没有引用，则该专利被归类为破坏性创新，而不是渐进式创新。例如，获得诺贝尔奖的生物化学家卡里·穆利斯 (Kary Mullis) 在聚合酶链反应方面的工作为许多现代基因和医学测试奠定了基础。在 Mullis 发表他的作品后，同一领域中对现有技术的引用急剧下降。 Jaffe 先生、Kaltenberg 女士和 Lachman 女士发现，最年轻的发明家申请的专利更有可能是全新的、颠覆性的创新，而且随着发明家年龄的增长，他们申请的专利越来越多。</p><p class="article__body-text">这很重要，因为创新可以提高生产力。改进现有流程并发明全新的做事方式，可以用相同数量的劳动力和资本生产更多产品。从长远来看，只有提高生产力才能提高生活水平。随着时间的推移，人口下降将削弱这种贡献，因为年轻工人灵活的头脑所产生的新颖想法的数量会减少。</p><p class="article__body-text">即使生产率增长率稍微低一点，多年来也会复合，从而使经济规模显着缩小。 1947 年至 1973 年间，在富裕国家战后经济增长特别迅速的繁荣时期，美国、英国、法国、意大利、日本和西德的生产率增长约占人均产出增长的 60%。自 2007-09 年全球金融危机以来，美国的增长速度远高于其他发达国家，这在很大程度上要归功于其生产力的更大提高。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果生育率的下降仅限于少数国家或特定地区，那么对创新的影响可能不会那么严重。一个国家发明的技术最终会传播到其他国家。纺纱珍妮和计算机芯片不必在世界每个角落都重新发明来提高全球生产力。但事实上，大部分国家的生育率同时下降，这意味着全球都会感受到创新减少的后果。</p><p class="article__body-text">一些研究人员认为，这种由人口驱动的创新减少现象已经在世界部分地区发生。中国经济学家和人口学家梁建章指出，老龄国家的创业精神明显较低：一个国家的中位年龄每增加一个标准差，相当于大约 3.5 岁，会导致下降 2.5 个百分点<!-- -->在创业率（成年人创业的比例）中。考虑到 2010 年全球创业率约为 6.1%，这是一个巨大的影响。</p><p class="article__body-text">更重要的是，这种关系似乎不仅仅是老龄化社会中年轻人相对缺乏的结果。这些国家的年轻人开办企业的比率似乎也低于不那么发达的社会中的同龄人。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">梁先生认为，这种现象可能是日本“企业家真空”的原因。就在 2010 年，日本发明家<!-- -->根据<small>联合国</small>机构世界知识产权组织的数据，中国是全球 35 个行业中最大的专利生产者。到 2021 年，他们仅在三个方面处于领先地位。日本不仅落后于现在占据大部分榜首的中国，也落后于美国。</p><p class="article__body-text">只关注最有可能出现激进创新的最新颖的领域，情况也好不到哪里去。在伦敦经济学院经济绩效中心发表的一份分析报告中，Antonin Bergeaud 和 Cyril Verluise 指出，日本对基因组编辑和区块链技术的贡献几乎缩水为零。曾经在储氢、自动驾驶汽车和计算机视觉（一种训练计算机解读图像的人工智能）领域处于领先地位的国家已经沦为落后于美国、中国或两者的配角（见图 2）。</p></div><h2>针刺出生主义的贵族</h2><p class="article__body-text">政府基本上无力扭转出生率下降的趋势。各国试图鼓励妇女生育更多孩子的努力通常收效甚微。对匈牙利和波兰政府分别以所得税抵免和固定付款形式提供的昂贵支持的研究表明，对生育率的影响有限。新加坡向新孩子的父母提供大笔补助，现在头两个孩子的补助金高达 11,000 新元（8,300 美元），超过 13,000 新元，此外还有退税和儿童保育补贴。在补贴公寓销售计划中，父母优先于其他买家。但新加坡的总生育率仅为 1.0：无论政策的影响如何，它都远未大到足以避免人口下降的程度。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">当然，出生率并不是生产力的唯一，甚至不是主要的决定因素。如果是这样，撒哈拉以南非洲一些最贫穷的经济体将成为世界上最具活力的经济体。教育水平、法律和金融体系的可靠性以及创新者互动网络的存在都很重要。日本仍然比许多平均年龄较低的富裕国家更具创新精神。但人口结构可以放大或抑制一个国家的潜在潜力。</p><p class="article__body-text">这表明可以通过关注提高生产力的其他因素来抵消人口下降对创新的影响。最明显的是教育，它让老龄化社会能够更好地利用日益减少的年轻人群体。尤其是在巴西和中国这样的中等收入国家，有数以百万计的人没有接受适当的教育，因此他们对经济的贡献很小。在大部分富裕国家，情况也是如此，尽管程度较轻。例如，无论他们多么聪明，未受过教育的工人都不能指望在医学或计算机领域提出突破性的想法。随着潜在劳动力的减少，最大限度地提高其中每个人的产出将变得至关重要，并且可能有助于在一段时间内抵消人口老龄化的影响，至少在创新领域是如此。</p><p class="article__body-text">技术还可以提供应对人口变化的方法，从远程医疗到服务行业机器人的使用增加。这些创新无疑可以缓解老龄化社会带来的困难，无论是通过直接为老年人的护理做出贡献，还是通过自动化年轻工人的角色。但具有讽刺意味的是，具有创新精神的年轻思想家数量的减少将减少此类有价值的新想法的数量。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果被人工智能构想的新想法所抵消，人类创新的不足也可能会减少破坏性。毫无疑问，机器很快就会研究出如何对现有流程进行渐进式改进——事实上，在某些领域，它们已经在这样做了。然而，机器是否会学习如何产生颠覆性的新想法仍然是一个有争议的问题。</p><p class="article__body-text"> Plasmon 的电影讲述了意大利最后一个孩子的故事，结尾讨论了孩子是希望的象征。它将观众引导至一个网站，该网站建议促进更大家庭的政策。该网站反过来要求读者签署一份呼吁采取行动的请愿书。只有不到 8,000 人这样做了。随着意大利人口的持续减少，尤其是年轻人的数量，供应短缺的不仅仅是婴儿食品的买家。 Plasmon 将很难找到创意人才来设计巧妙的广告活动，更不用说制定新政策来扭转婴儿潮。 <span

class="article__body-text">就在不久前，德桑蒂斯先生似乎成功地设计了一种没有特朗普的特朗普主义形式。 11 月，他以 19 个百分点的优势在佛罗里达州赢得连任。与此形成鲜明对比的是，特朗普先生试图在中期选举中扮演拥王者的角色却大错特错，他支持的许多候选人都输掉了共和党原本认为包揽的竞选。特朗普先生于 11 月 15 日在他位于佛罗里达州棕榈滩的庄园 Mar-a-Lago 开始他的总统竞选活动时显得有些泄气。当时一些民意调查显示这两位候选人在初选选民中势均力敌。 </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZ8j_CZLFm8?enablejsapi=1"

class="article__body-text">六个月后，一直跌跌撞撞的是德桑蒂斯先生。他因将乌克兰战争视为纯粹的“领土争端”而被批评为孤立主义者，因与迪士尼挑起争端而被批评为反社团主义者，并因签署怀孕六周后禁止堕胎的禁令而被批评为极端主义者。与此同时，特朗普先生恢复了他的步伐，凯旋而归。他和他的团队花了几个月的时间来抨击德桑蒂斯先生。回想起来，州长决定等到佛罗里达州立法机构本月早些时候完成年度会议后再宣布参选，这看起来像是一个误判，尽管推迟的部分原因是为了让立法者能够通过一项法案，允许他在不辞职的情况下竞选总统。省长。在漫长的间歇中，他忍受了长时间的电视广播攻击，却没有提供太多的防御。就好像布鲁图斯在三月十五日睡过头，给了尤利乌斯凯撒穿上盔甲的机会，但他仍然试图继续他的打击工作。曾经看似合理的推翻特朗普的阴谋现在看起来毫无希望。</p><h2>把你的欢呼借给我</h2><p

年党内建制派避开特朗普不同，如今他在精英代言竞赛中占据主导地位。许多大捐助者已经转投德桑蒂斯先生等替代方案，但这并不像听起来那么具有破坏性。特朗普先生将毫不费力地从他的小额捐助者大军中筹集资金，并将再次将自己描绘成真正的人民保民官，遭到脱离现实的精英追随者的攻击。在共和党基地中，他享有普遍的知名度和近乎普遍的钦佩。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种对特朗普先生的崇敬使得他的竞争对手很难攻击他。他们中的大多数人不是来埋葬特朗普主义，而是来赞美它。但由此产生的混乱削弱了他们的吸引力。特朗普竞选团队的发言人贾森·米勒这样说：“当滚石乐队还在巡演时，你为什么还要去看滚石乐队的致敬乐队呢？”</p><p class="article__body-text">初选还没开始就结束了吗？有些人是这么认为的。 “希望不是一种策略，”里克威尔逊说，他是前共和党特工，现在负责林肯计划，这是一个除了特朗普之外的任何人的组织。他认为特朗普先生必须失去能力才能失败。 “唐纳德·特朗普将开始在辩论中砍下德桑蒂斯的头，然后像踢足球一样踢它。共和党基础选民想要那个节目，”他说。询问华盛顿周围的秘密反特朗普共和党人，初选将如何进行，许多人会联想到值得高卢战争的野蛮场面。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，更乐观的人指出，还有很长的路要走，即使特朗普的战车正在加速。 “我们距离投票还有几个月又几个月的时间。全国民意调查毫无意义——一旦投票开始，它们就会有意义，”爱荷华州（第一个投票的州）的共和党顾问大卫科切尔说，他曾与米特罗姆尼和杰布布什共事。苦苦挣扎的竞选活动的顾问交换了灰姑娘的故事，讲述了最新候选人的支持率在一个月内从爱荷华州的 2% 上升到 20%。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

的初选选民的支持。这比德桑蒂斯先生的平均水平高出 30 个百分点以上。在过去 40 年竞争激烈的初选中，八位候选人中有六位在投票前获得超过 30% 的支持率，最终获得了本党的提名。未能利用如此大的领先优势的两位候选人是泰德肯尼迪，他在 1980 年与现任总统吉米卡特竞争，而希拉里克林顿最终在 2008 年被魅力四射的巴拉克奥巴马抢了风头。今年最接近卡特式在位和奥巴马式吸引力的共和党候选人当然是特朗普先生。</p><p class="article__body-text">问题不仅仅是一个分裂的领域。尽管已经宣布了六位半途而废的候选人，而且很可能还会有更多候选人，但即使是两匹马的比赛也会对特朗普有利。 YouGov 最近为<i>《经济学人》</i>进行的民意调查发现，在一场正面交锋中，共和党初选选民更喜欢特朗普先生，而不是德桑蒂斯先生，比例为 58% 对 25%。而这位前总统的支持，一点也不勉强，也不三心二意。尽管有很多选择，但仍有 64% 的共和党人希望特朗普再次参选。相比之下，民主党人对他们的推定候选人乔·拜登的热情要低得多：只有 53% 的人希望总统再次参选。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 2016 年，特朗普的反对者认为他的离谱言论和混乱的竞选活动将不可避免地导致政治失败。这被证明是无可救药的盲目乐观。大多数人现在认为，特朗普先生可以说或做的事情很少能疏远他的支持者。但一些反对者仍然希望他的竞选活动会因为他在白宫期间的那种混乱的内斗而破裂。</p><p class="article__body-text">难点在于这次混乱的候选者更加有序了。 2016 年，特朗普先生的竞选活动吸引了相当多的江湖骗子。目前的管理比较稳定。其领导人之一苏西·威尔斯 (Susie Wiles) 在 2016 年和 2020 年成功领导了特朗普先生在佛罗里达州的行动。她还在 2018 年领导了德桑蒂斯先生竞选州长，当时他是特朗普先生的门徒。几乎没有家庭参与：伊万卡·特朗普和前总统的女儿兼女婿贾里德·库什纳预计不会在竞选活动中发挥任何作用，后者曾在白宫担任高级顾问。特朗普先生也有更多的个人经历：这是他第三次竞选总统（如果算上他在 2000 年与改革党的失败竞选，则是第四次）。他的共和党对手都是第一次参选。 </p></div><div

“在我当选后不久，第二天或几天后，我收到了特朗普总统发来的祝贺我的语音邮件，”堪萨斯州共和党主席迈克布朗说。他说，特朗普竞选团队在宣传该州的初选方面一直“非常出色”。将各州初选和党团会议（实际上是权力下放的政党会议）的结果转化为党的全国代表大会提名竞争者投票的规则是神秘且不断变化的。与民主党初选不同，在民主党初选中，一个州的选票通常按候选人的选票份额分配给候选人，许多共和党初选遵循赢者通吃的制度。这可以将在选票份额方面相对微弱的领先优势转变为对代表的压倒性优势。在特朗普担任总统期间，他鼓励各州采用此类系统或其他有助于领先者的规则。初选的日期不断向前推进，给叛乱候选人建立势头的时间越来越少（见图表 2）。</p><p class="article__body-text">特朗普的团队也一直在其他方面赶超对手，通过打电话和邀请前往海湖庄园的宫廷，努力征求党内高层人物的支持。这种支持在 2016 年没有出现，但在明年的比赛之前已经大量涌入。特朗普先生已经获得众议院 222 名共和党议员中的 51 名和 49 名共和党参议员中的 10 名的支持。他的对手只有七名代表和两名参议员。特朗普竞选团队对佛罗里达州国会代表团的成功感到特别自豪，他们基本上拒绝了他们州的州长。佛罗里达州的 20 名共和党代表中有 11 名支持特朗普，而只有一名支持德桑蒂斯。当然，德桑蒂斯先生和斯科特先生在参加竞选之前不可能期望获得很多支持，但他们还有很多工作要做。</p><p class="article__body-text">至少在运营上，德桑蒂斯先生当然有希望迎头赶上。他是一位了不起的筹款人，在 2022 年担任州长期间筹集了惊人的 2.17 亿美元，其中大部分都没有花掉。因为德桑蒂斯先生是财力雄厚的捐助者的最爱（尽管他在堕胎、迪士尼和乌克兰问题上的立场让一些人感到恼火），他将严重依赖一个名为“永不退缩”的组织，这是一个所谓的超级<small>PAC</small> ，可以不受限制地接受捐款，只要它不与官方活动相协调。一位熟悉德桑蒂斯先生想法的人士表示，他可以在他的正式竞选活动和超级<small>政治行动委员会</small>之间筹集 2.5 亿美元。 Never Back Down 的策划人是 Jeff Roe，他是一家名为 Axiom Strategies 的咨询公司的创始人，该公司参与了德克萨斯州共和党参议员特德克鲁兹 2016 年失败的总统竞选和 2021 年格伦杨金成功竞选弗吉尼亚州州长. Never Back Down 预计将用广告铺天盖地地轰炸电视，并为必须在提前投票的州游荡数月的拉票员和组织者支付费用。</p><p class="article__body-text">官方竞选活动将由德桑蒂斯先生在佛罗里达州的核心圈子成员主持。可能的竞选经理佩克将军领导了他最近的州长竞选活动。他的民意调查大师可能是另一位本土人才瑞恩泰森。德桑蒂斯先生是赢得捐赠军备竞赛的热门人选。他将拥有大量知道如何使用他的收入的竞选老手。</p></div><h2>我来，我见，我挥霍</h2><p class="article__body-text">如果只需要现金就可以成为总统，那么美国将在迈克尔·布隆伯格的第一个任期中途完成，迈克尔·布隆伯格是纽约大亨和前市长，他在 2020 年民主党提名失败的竞选活动中挥霍了 11 亿美元。说服共和党选民叛逃像德桑蒂斯先生现在必须做的那样，从特朗普先生那里接手是一项艰巨的任务。许多明显的攻击途径，可能会在大选中吸引摇摆不定的选民，在初选中是不可能的。特朗普先生对 2021 年 1 月 6 日袭击国会的暴民的鼓励几乎没有危及他在党内的地位，其中大多数人认为 2020 年的选举被偷走了。他的反对者也无法从总统离任以来一直困扰着总统的质询、调查和诉讼中获益，从<small>联邦调查局</small>在海湖庄园搜索机密文件到他最近被曼哈顿地方检察官起诉欺诈书——保持。 These indignities, far from diminishing Mr Trump in Republicans&#39; eyes, have turned him into a martyr. Even political rivals like Mr DeSantis have felt obliged to come to his defence. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Florida Governor Ron DeSantis listensduring a press conference to sign several bills related to public education and teacher pay, in Miami, Tuesday, May 9, 2023.

The old neoconservative and business-friendly order has been swept away. The other candidates&#39; failure to present a “value proposition”, says Mr Miller of the Trump campaign, “will impede their ability to build coalitions and actually go and challenge the president…Saying that you&#39;re Trump without the drama, which is kind of where it seems Ron DeSantis is going—that just doesn&#39;t work.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Presidential primaries are often popularity contests more than they are policy debates—and this one will be little different. All the candidates agree that Mr Biden is intentionally wrecking the country, that wokeness has run amok and that the southern border must be sealed. There are only modest signs of disagreement. Mr Trump is attacking Mr DeSantis from the left on fiscal matters, arguing that he will endanger Social Security (the state pension) and Medicare (free health care for the elderly), two sacrosanct programmes among older voters. Mr Scott is calling for less confrontational politics. More internationalist candidates such as Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, argue that continuing to back Ukraine is vital for America&#39;s national security. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Others are more isolationist than Mr Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy Indian-American entrepreneur from Ohio, says, “We&#39;ve got to be willing to ban most <small>US</small> businesses from doing business in China until the <small>CCP</small> [Chinese Communist Party] falls or until the <small>CCP</small> radically reforms itself.” That is a harder decoupling than the other candidates have proposed. He also wants to ban affirmative action, shut down the <small>FBI</small> and use the army to dismantle Mexican cartels that ship fentanyl across the border. Early polls show some success in peeling off Trump voters, but it is a delicate operation. “We rally behind America first for a reason. It&#39;s not Trump first,” says Mr Ramaswamy. “I&#39;m running against him, but to be clear, I still recoil at the idea that the nominee should somehow be the product of some plot of Republican donors.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the conspirators must at some point coalesce if they are to be rid of Caesar. In 2016 the fractured field, combined with winner-take-all primary rules, helped Mr Trump triumph. Whereas Democrats united behind Mr Biden in 2020 when it became apparent that Bernie Sanders, a left-wing ideologue, might secure the nomination, Republicans may be hard to corral. At the moment, Mr DeSantis certainly looks like the strongest rival to Mr Trump. But the other candidates seem much keener to attack him than the former president, for fear of alienating the base. Ms Haley has taken to denouncing Mr DeSantis for feuding with Disney, for instance. Other prominent Republicans, such as Kari Lake, a failed candidate for governor of Arizona last year, and Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, have taken to swiping at Mr DeSantis as well. They may be auditioning for the job of vice-president to Mr Trump, and see such attacks as a quick way into his good graces.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Despite his stumbles in recent months, Mr DeSantis is a clever and driven man. He may regain his lean and hungry look and let slip the dogs of war. Many voters will pay close attention to the televised debates, the first of which will be held in August in Wisconsin (although the former president may not participate). Mr DeSantis could point out that the national debt soared by $8trn during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency; that crime and illegal immigration both increased despite all the former president&#39;s big talk on both scores; that covid-19 was poorly contained and that another epidemic, of wokeness, became more rather than less contagious during his presidency. It might help to point out that Mr Trump, a man famous for peremptory sackings, failed to dismiss Anthony Fauci, the public face of efforts to repress covid, who is about as popular in conservative circles as gun seizures and sharia law.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such barbs could draw some blood. If wielded with enough force and frequency, they might even fell a man as mighty as Caesar. Luckily for Mr Trump, he is facing a fractious, squabbling and timid bunch. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Editor&#39;s note (May 25th 2023):</b> This article was updated after Ron DeSantis&#39;s announcement.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 24 May 2023 18:57:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rl58dgle0sccdmq1um7jogm86d0fcdjt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/24/ron-desantis-has-little-chance-of-beating-donald-trump </item><item><title><![CDATA[Henry Kissinger explains how to avoid world war three]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Henry Kissenger photographed by Vincent tullo for The Economist, New York 2023.Credit: The Economist/Vincent Tullo" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230520_FBP503.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>N BEIJING THEY</small> have concluded that America will do anything to keep China down.

Nobody alive has more experience of international affairs, first as a scholar of 19th-century diplomacy, later as America&#39;s national security adviser and secretary of state, and for the past 46 years as a consultant and emissary to monarchs, presidents and prime ministers. Mr Kissinger is worried. “Both sides have convinced themselves that the other represents a strategic danger,” he says. “We are on the path to great-power confrontation.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the end of April <i>The Economist</i> spoke to Mr Kissinger for over eight hours about how to prevent the contest between China and America from descending into war. These days he is stooped and walks with difficulty, but his mind is needle-sharp. As he contemplates his next two books, on artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> ) and the nature of alliances, he remains more interested in looking forward than raking over the past. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger is alarmed by China&#39;s and America&#39;s intensifying competition for technological and economic pre-eminence. Even as Russia tumbles into China&#39;s orbit and war overshadows Europe&#39;s eastern flank, he fears that <small>AI</small> is about to supercharge the Sino-American rivalry. Around the world, the balance of power and the technological basis of warfare are shifting so fast and in so many ways that countries lack any settled principle on which they can establish order. If they cannot find one, they may resort to force. “We&#39;re in the classic pre-world war one situation,” he says, “where neither side has much margin of political concession and in which any disturbance of the equilibrium can lead to catastrophic consequences.”</p><h2> Study war some more</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger is reviled by many as a warmonger for his part in the Vietnam war, but he considers the avoidance of conflict between great powers as the focus of his life&#39;s work. After witnessing the carnage caused by Nazi Germany and suffering the murder of 13 close relatives in the Holocaust, he became convinced that the only way to prevent ruinous conflict is hard-headed diplomacy, ideally fortified by shared values. “This is the problem that has to be solved,” he says. “And I believe I&#39;ve spent my life trying to deal with it.” In his view, the fate of humanity depends on whether America and China can get along. He believes the rapid progress of <small>AI</small> , in particular, leaves them only five-to-ten years to find a way.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>More on this:</b></p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/kissinger-highlights">Eight highlights of the conversation</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/kissinger-transcript">A full transcript</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/05/20/henry-kissinger-on-averting-world-war" data-tegid="d627nbqe60ospoqtvd42npr5unob63al">Our daily podcast on the interview</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger has some opening advice to aspiring leaders: “Identify where you are. Pitilessly.” In that spirit, the starting-point for avoiding war is to analyse China&#39;s growing restlessness. Despite a reputation for being conciliatory towards the government in Beijing, he acknowledges that many Chinese thinkers believe America is on a downward slope and that, “therefore, as a result of an historic evolution, they will eventually supplant us.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> He believes that China&#39;s leadership resents Western policymakers&#39; talk of a global rules-based order, when what they really mean is America&#39;s rules and America&#39;s order. China&#39;s rulers are insulted by what they see as the condescending bargain offered by the West, of granting China privileges if it behaves (they surely think the privileges should be theirs by right, as a rising power). Indeed, some in China suspect that America will never treat it as an equal and that it&#39;s foolish to imagine it might.</p><p class="article__body-text"> However, Mr Kissinger also warns against misinterpreting China&#39;s ambitions. In Washington, “They say China wants world domination…The answer is that they [in China] want to be powerful,” he says. “They&#39;re not heading for world domination in a Hitlerian sense,” he says. “That is not how they think or have ever thought of world order.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> In Nazi Germany war was inevitable because Adolf Hitler needed it, Mr Kissinger says, but China is different. He has met many Chinese leaders, starting with Mao Zedong. He did not doubt their ideological commitment, but this has always been welded onto a keen sense of their country&#39;s interests and capabilities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger sees the Chinese system as more Confucian than Marxist. That teaches Chinese leaders to attain the maximum strength of which their country is capable and to seek to be respected for their accomplishments. Chinese leaders want to be recognised as the international system&#39;s final judges of their own interests. “If they achieved superiority that can genuinely be used, would they drive it to the point of imposing Chinese culture?” he asks. “I don&#39;t know. My instinct is No…[But] I believe it is in our capacity to prevent that situation from arising by a combination of diplomacy and force.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> One natural American response to the challenge of China&#39;s ambition is to probe it, as a way to identify how to sustain the equilibrium between the two powers. Another is to establish a permanent dialogue between China and America. China “is trying to play a global role. We have to assess at each point if the conceptions of a strategic role are compatible.” If they are not, then the question of force will arise. “Is it possible for China and the United States to coexist without the threat of all-out war with each other? I thought and still think that it [is].” But he acknowledges success is not guaranteed. “It may fail,” he says. “And therefore, we have to be militarily strong enough to sustain the failure.” </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/513/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/769/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/820/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1025/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1281/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1640/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The urgent test is how China and America behave over Taiwan. Mr Kissinger recalls how, on Richard Nixon&#39;s first visit to China in 1972, only Mao had the authority to negotiate over the island. “Whenever Nixon raised a concrete subject, Mao said, &#39;I&#39;m a philosopher. I don&#39;t deal with these subjects. Let Zhou [Enlai] and Kissinger discuss this.&#39;…But when it came to Taiwan, he was very explicit. He said, &#39;They are a bunch of counter-revolutionaries. We don&#39;t need them now. We can wait 100 years. Someday we will ask for them. But it&#39;s a long distance away.&#39;” </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/01-china.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger believes that the understanding forged between Nixon and Mao was overturned after only 50 of those 100 years by Donald Trump. He wanted to inflate his tough image by wringing concessions out of China over trade. In policy the Biden administration has followed Mr Trump&#39;s lead, but with liberal rhetoric.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger would not have chosen this path with respect to Taiwan, because a Ukrainian-style war there would destroy the island and devastate the world economy. War could also set back China domestically, and its leaders&#39; greatest fear remains upheaval at home.</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite><i>“</i> It is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text"> The fear of war creates grounds for hope. The trouble is that neither side has much room to make concessions. Every Chinese leader has asserted his country&#39;s connection to Taiwan. At the same time, however, “the way things have evolved now, it is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s way out of this impasse draws on his experience in office. He would start by lowering the temperature, and then gradually build confidence and a working relationship. Rather than listing all their grievances, the American president would say to his Chinese counterpart, “Mr President, the two greatest dangers to peace right now are us two. In the sense that we have the capacity to destroy humanity.” China and America, without formally announcing anything, would aim to practise restraint. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Never a fan of policymaking bureaucracies, Mr Kissinger would like to see a small group of advisers, with easy access to each other, working together tacitly. Neither side would fundamentally change its position on Taiwan, but America would take care over how it deploys its forces and try not to feed the suspicion that it supports the island&#39;s independence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s second piece of advice to aspiring leaders is: “Define objectives that can enlist people. Find means, describable means, of achieving these objectives.” Taiwan would be just the first of several areas where the superpowers could find common ground and so foster global stability.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In a recent speech Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, suggested that these should include climate change and the economy. Mr Kissinger is sceptical about both. Although he is “all for” action on the climate, he doubts it can do much to create confidence or help establish a balance between the two superpowers. On the economy, the danger is that the trade agenda is hijacked by hawks who are unwilling to give China any room to develop at all.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That all-or-nothing attitude is a threat to the broader search for detente. If America wants to find a way to live with China, it should not be aiming for regime change. Mr Kissinger draws on a theme present in his thought from the very beginning. “In any diplomacy of stability, there has to be some element of the 19th-century world,” he says. “And the 19th-century world was based on the proposition that the existence of the states contesting it was not at issue.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some Americans believe that a defeated China would become democratic and peaceful. Yet, however much Mr Kissinger would prefer China to be a democracy, he sees no precedent for that outcome. More likely, a collapse of the communist regime would lead to a civil war that hardened into ideological conflict and only added to global instability. “It&#39;s not in our interest to drive China to dissolution,” he says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Rather than digging in, America will have to acknowledge China has interests. A good example is Ukraine.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s president, Xi Jinping, only recently contacted Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Many observers have dismissed Mr Xi&#39;s call as an empty gesture designed to placate Europeans, who complain that China is too close to Russia. By contrast, Mr Kissinger sees it as a declaration of serious intent that will complicate the diplomacy surrounding the war, but which may also create precisely the sort of opportunity to build the superpowers&#39; mutual trust. </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/02-inevitable.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger begins his analysis by condemning Russia&#39;s president, Vladimir Putin. “It was certainly a catastrophic mistake of judgment by Putin at the end,” he says. But the West is not without blame. “I thought that the decision to…leave open the membership of Ukraine in <small>NATO</small> was very wrong.” That was destabilising, because dangling the promise of <small>NATO</small> protection without a plan to bring it about left Ukraine poorly defended even as it was guaranteed to enrage not only Mr Putin, but also many of his compatriots.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The task now is to bring the war to an end, without setting the stage for the next round of conflict. Mr Kissinger says that he wants Russia to give up as much as possible of the territory that it conquered in 2014, but the reality is that in any ceasefire Russia is likely to keep Sevastopol (the biggest city in Crimea and Russia&#39;s main naval base on the Black Sea), at the very least. Such a settlement, in which Russia loses some gains but retains others, could leave both a dissatisfied Russia and a dissatisfied Ukraine. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/513/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/769/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/820/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1025/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1281/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1640/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In his view, that is a recipe for future confrontation. “What the Europeans are now saying is, in my view, madly dangerous,” he says. “Because the Europeans are saying: &#39;We don&#39;t want them in <small>NATO</small> , because they&#39;re too risky. And therefore, we&#39;ll arm the hell out of them and give them the most advanced weapons.&#39;” His conclusion is stark: “We have now armed Ukraine to a point where it will be the best-armed country and with the least strategically experienced leadership in Europe.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> To establish a lasting peace in Europe requires the West to take two leaps of imagination. The first is for Ukraine to join <small>NATO</small> , as a means of restraining it, as well as protecting it. The second is for Europe to engineer a rapprochement with Russia, as a way to create a stable eastern border. </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/03-weird-position.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Plenty of Western countries would understandably balk at one or other of those aims. With China involved, as an ally of Russia&#39;s and an opponent of <small>NATO</small> , the task will become even harder. China has an overriding interest to see Russia emerge intact from the war in Ukraine. Not only does Mr Xi have a “no-limits” partnership with Mr Putin to honour, but a collapse in Moscow would trouble China by creating a power vacuum in Central Asia that risks being filled by a “Syrian-type civil war”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Following Mr Xi&#39;s call to Mr Zelensky, Mr Kissinger believes that China may be positioning itself to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. As one of the architects of the policy that pitted America and China against the Soviet Union, he doubts that China and Russia can work together well. True, they share a suspicion of the United States, but he also believes that they have an instinctive distrust of one another. “I have never met a Russian leader who said anything good about China,” he says. “And I&#39;ve never met a Chinese leader who said anything good about Russia.” They are not natural allies. </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/04-russia.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The Chinese have entered diplomacy over Ukraine as an expression of their national interest, Mr Kissinger says. Although they refuse to countenance the destruction of Russia, they do recognise that Ukraine should remain an independent country and they have cautioned against the use of nuclear weapons. They may even accept Ukraine&#39;s desire to join <small>NATO</small> . “China does this, in part, because they do not want to clash with the United States,” he says. “They are creating their own world order, in so far as they can.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> The second area where China and America need to talk is <small>AI</small> . “We are at the very beginning of a capability where machines could impose global pestilence or other pandemics,” he says, “not just nuclear but any field of human destruction.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He acknowledges that even experts in <small>AI</small> do not know what its powers will be (going by the evidence of our discussions, transcribing a thick, gravelly German accent is still beyond its capabilities). But Mr Kissinger believes that <small>AI</small> will become a key factor in security within five years. He compares its disruptive potential to the invention of printing, which spread ideas that played a part in causing the devastating wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite>“There are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable…[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text"> “[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness,” Mr Kissinger warns. Despite the doctrine that a human should be in the loop, automatic and unstoppable weapons may be created. “If you look at military history, you can say, it has never been possible to destroy all your opponents, because of limitations of geography and of accuracy. [Now] there are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AI</small> cannot be abolished. China and America will therefore need to harness its power militarily to a degree, as a deterrent. But they can also limit the threat it poses, in the way that arms-control talks limited the threat of nuclear weapons. “I think we have to begin exchanges on the impact of technology on each other,” he says. “We have to take baby steps towards arms control, in which each side presents the other with controllable material about capabilities.” Indeed, he believes that the negotiations themselves could help build mutual trust and the confidence that enables the superpowers to practise restraint. The secret is leaders strong and wise enough to understand that <small>AI</small> must not be pushed to its limits. “And if you then rely entirely on what you can achieve through power, you&#39;re likely to destroy the world.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s third piece of advice for aspiring leaders is to “link all of these to your domestic objectives, whatever they are.” For America, that involves learning how to be more pragmatic, focusing on the qualities of leadership and, most of all, renewing the country&#39;s political culture.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s model for pragmatic thinking is India. He recalls a function at which a former senior Indian administrator explained that foreign policy should be based on non-permanent alliances geared to the issues, rather than tying up a country in big multilateral structures.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such a transactional approach will not come naturally to America. The theme running through Mr Kissinger&#39;s epic history of international relations, “Diplomacy”, is that the United States insists on depicting all its main foreign interventions as expressions of its manifest destiny to remake the world in its own image as a free, democratic, capitalist society.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem for Mr Kissinger is the corollary, which is that moral principles too often override interests—even when they will not produce desirable change. He acknowledges that human rights matter, but disagrees with putting them at the heart of your policy. The difference is between imposing them, or saying that it will affect relations, but the decision is theirs. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="2300" height="1536" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/134/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/401/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/534/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/668/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/855/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> “We tried [imposing them] in Sudan,” he notes. “Look at Sudan now.” Indeed, the knee-jerk insistence on doing the right thing can become an excuse for failing to think through the consequences of policy, he says. The people who want to use power to change the world, Mr Kissinger argues, are often idealists, even though realists are more typically seen as willing to use force.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is an essential counterweight to China&#39;s growing power. Yet it also has a worsening record of religious intolerance, judicial bias and a muzzled press. One implication—though Mr Kissinger did not directly comment—is that India will therefore be a test of whether America can be pragmatic. Japan will be another. Relations will be fraught if, as Mr Kissinger predicts, Japan takes moves to secure nuclear weapons within five years. With one eye on the diplomatic manoeuvres that more or less kept the peace in the 19th century, he looks to Britain and France to help the United States think strategically about the balance of power in Asia.</p><h2> Big-shoe-fillers wanted</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership will matter, too. Mr Kissinger has long been a believer in the power of individuals. Franklin D. Roosevelt was far-sighted enough to prepare an isolationist America for what he saw as an inevitable war against the Axis powers. Charles de Gaulle gave France a belief in the future. John F. Kennedy inspired a generation. Otto von Bismarck engineered German unification, and governed with dexterity and restraint—only for his country to succumb to war-fever after he was ousted.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger acknowledges that 24-hour news and social media make his style of diplomacy harder. “I don&#39;t think a president today could send an envoy with the powers that I had,” he says. But he argues that to agonise about whether a way ahead is even possible would be a mistake. “If you look at the leaders whom I&#39;ve respected, they didn&#39;t ask that question. They asked, &#39;Is it necessary?&#39;”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He recalls the example of Winston Lord, a member of his staff in the Nixon administration. “When we intervened in Cambodia, he wanted to quit. And I told him, &#39;You can quit and march around this place carrying a placard. Or you can help us solve the Vietnam war.&#39; And he decided to stay… What we need [is] people who make that decision—that they&#39;re living in this time, and they want to do something about it, other than feel sorry for themselves.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership reflects a country&#39;s political culture. Mr Kissinger, like many Republicans, worries that American education dwells on America&#39;s darkest moments. “In order to get a strategic view you need faith in your country,” he says. The shared perception of America&#39;s worth has been lost.</p><p class="article__body-text"> He also complains that the media lack a sense of proportion and judgment. When he was in office the press were hostile, but he still had a dialogue with them. “They drove me nuts,” he says. “But that was part of the game…they weren&#39;t unfair.” Today, in contrast, he says that the media have no incentive to be reflective. “My theme is the need for balance and moderation. Institutionalise that. That&#39;s the aim.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Worst of all, though, is politics itself. When Mr Kissinger came to Washington, politicians from the two parties would routinely dine together. He was on friendly terms with George McGovern, a Democratic presidential candidate. For a national security adviser from the other side that would be unlikely today, he believes. Gerald Ford, who took over after Nixon resigned, was the sort of person whose opponents could rely on him to act decently. Today, any means are considered acceptable.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think Trump and now Biden have driven [animosity] over the top,” Mr Kissinger says. He fears that a situation like Watergate could lead to violence and that America lacks leadership. “I don&#39;t think Biden can supply the inspiration and…I&#39;m hoping that Republicans can come up with somebody better,” he says. “It&#39;s not a great moment in history,” he laments, “but the alternative is total abdication.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> America desperately needs long-term strategic thinking, he believes. “That&#39;s our big challenge which we must solve. If we don&#39;t, the predictions of failure will be proved true.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> If time is short and leadership lacking, where does that leave the prospects for China and the United States finding a way to live together in peace?</p><p class="article__body-text"> “We all have to admit we&#39;re in a new world,” Mr Kissinger says, “for whatever we do can go wrong. And there is no guaranteed course.” Even so he professes to feel hope. “Look, my life has been difficult, but it gives ground for optimism. And difficulty—it&#39;s also a challenge. It shouldn&#39;t always be an obstacle.” </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/05-kant.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> He stresses that humanity has taken enormous strides. True, that progress has often occurred in the aftermath of terrible conflict—after the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic wars and the second world war, for example, but the rivalry between China and America could be different. History suggests that, when two powers of this type encounter each other, the normal outcome is military conflict. “But this is not a normal circumstance,” Mr Kissinger argues, “because of mutually assured destruction and artificial intelligence.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think it&#39;s possible that you can create a world order on the basis of rules that Europe, China and India could join, and that&#39;s already a good slice of humanity. So if you look at the practicality of it, it can end well—or at least it can end without catastrophe and we can make progress.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is the task for the leaders of today&#39;s superpowers. “Immanuel Kant said peace would either occur through human understanding or some disaster,” Mr Kissinger explains. “He thought that it would occur through reason, but he could not guarantee it. That is more or less what I think.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> World leaders therefore bear a heavy responsibility. They require the realism to face up to the dangers ahead, the vision to see that a solution lies in achieving a balance between their countries&#39; forces, and the restraint to refrain from using their offensive powers to the maximum. “It is an unprecedented challenge and great opportunity,” Mr Kissinger says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The future of humanity depends on getting it right. Well into the fourth hour of the day&#39;s conversation, and just weeks before his birthday celebrations, Mr Kissinger adds with a characteristic twinkle, “I won&#39;t be around to see it either way.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 17 May 2023 14:41:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ljr6qha8c5njtiqbn0u45vjmrjjcduc6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/17/henry-kissinger-explains-how-to-avoid-world-war-three </item><item><title><![CDATA[China learns to manage decline]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">T</span> <small>HE DEMOGRAPHIC</small> milestones come thick and fast in “My Home in the Forest”, the official tourism anthem of Yichun, a sprawling city in China&#39;s far north-east. The song was released in 2018 to promote the area&#39;s pine-clad hills and temperate summers. It follows a couple from their courtship in a holiday treehouse to their marriage, then years of child-rearing (the lyrics hint at repeated family visits to a local lake). It ends with their contented old age, holding hands as the sun sets over Yichun. </p><style data-emotion="css 1lm38nn">.css-1lm38nn{margin:1.3125rem 0 2.1875rem;}.css-1lm38nn figure{margin:0;min-width:100%;}.css-1lm38nn figure figcaption{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-weight:500;}.css-1lm38nn audio{display:block;margin-top:0.75rem;width:100%;}.css-1lm38nn +figure,.css-1lm38nn +.g-fallback+figure{margin-top:0;}</style><div class="css-1lm38nn e1lug06p0"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。 </figcaption><style data-emotion="css 1fs0t47">.css-1fs0t47{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-border-link);}.css-1fs0t47 a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;-webkit-transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);}.css-1fs0t47 a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);}.css-1fs0t47 a:focus{text-decoration-color:transparent;box-shadow:0 0 0 0.125rem var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);outline:solid transparent;}.css-1fs0t47 a:active{text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);box-shadow:none;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}</style><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0">享受更多音频和播客</span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0"><a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a></span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0">或者</span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0"><a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">安卓</a>。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/016%20Briefing%20-%20Chaguan-af546f21a57bf19fbf320ac61775688b.mp3" title="China learns to manage decline" controlslist="nodownload"><p>您的浏览器不支持 &lt;audio>; 元素。 </p></audio><style data-emotion="css 1h1me4y">.css-1h1me4y{text-align:center;height:0;}.css-1h1me4y>div{top:-0.625rem;}</style><div class="css-1h1me4y e1lug06p1"><style data-emotion="css vu6x35">.css-vu6x35{position:relative;display:inline-block;text-align:left;}</style><div class="css-vu6x35 e5tfikp0"></div></div></figure></div><p class="article__body-text"> This musical sales pitch is revealing and poignant, for several reasons. Its focus on ecotourism reflects hopes and fears that are specific to Yichun, a city trying to reinvent itself after its vast state-owned timber mills closed about a decade ago. Its boosterism shows off the entrepreneurial side of Chinese bureaucrats, who for several decades now have earned bonuses and promotions by presiding over local economic growth. When Chaguan visited recently, city officials tirelessly showed off Yichun&#39;s attractions, from tasty blueberries to its dinosaur museum. By way of emphasis, officials unexpectedly interrupted an interview to break into “My Home in the Forest”, clapping and swaying as they sang. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Still, the ballad&#39;s wistful evocation of family life should haunt Communist Party bosses all across China. Chaguan was not in Yichun to talk about berries, but because the city is at the leading edge of a demographic crisis that will soon hit the whole country. Birth rates are falling in China. The most recent national census, in 2020, revealed a total fertility rate (births per woman) of 1.3. The <small>UN</small> put the number at 1.2 last year. That is among the world&#39;s lowest and far below that needed to maintain a stable population, namely, just over two children per woman.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/is-chinese-power-about-to-peak">Is Chinese power about to peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak">At what height will China&#39;s economy peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap">How Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power">How China measures national power</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/the-fall-of-empires-preys-on-xi-jinpings-mind">The fall of empires preys on Xi Jinping&#39;s mind</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> The census found an extreme situation in Yichun. No Chinese city has as few children, as a share of its population. Just 7.4% of its 879,000 residents are under 14. For comparison, children in the same age range account for almost 18% of the Chinese population as a whole. Even in some of the greyest cities in Japan or South Korea, children are more common than in Yichun. The latest numbers are grim. In 2021 just 2,321 babies were born there, against 8,817 deaths. A generation earlier, in 2000, the city&#39;s overall population was about a third larger than today. Yichun saw over 17,000 births that year, or eight times as many babies as now.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Though exceptionally bad, Yichun&#39;s baby bust reflects demographic woes across China&#39;s north-east rustbelt. The total fertility rate in the province of Heilongjiang, of which Yichun is part, is just 0.76 babies per woman of child-bearing age. One cause is working adults heading south. Marriage rates are also falling among those who stay.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A shrinking population will test China&#39;s growth-orientated political system. On May 5th President Xi Jinping signalled new realism about this challenge at a meeting of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs, a powerful body that he chairs. The commission heard that lower birth rates, an ageing population and demographic disparities between regions are a “new normal” to which policymakers must adapt. Officials were told to focus on education, on building a “childbirth-friendly society” and on helping the old to lead active lives. Rather than growth, the talk is of “high-quality population development”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Few cities like to admit to shrinking. That is in part because officials are rewarded for <small>GDP</small> growth, and in part because land sales are a big source of local-government revenue. As long as cities kept expanding, officials could easily justify auctioning new plots to developers. But the latest census leaves less room for denial.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yichun is a good place to see these trends. In 2001 the city published a plan predicting that the population would grow to 1.4m by 2020: a spectacular overestimate. In person, officials still dodge questions about birth statistics, preferring to offer anecdotes about friends having babies. Wang Hao, head of the city&#39;s Communist Youth League branch, enthuses about Yichun supporting new jobs that appeal to the young, such as tagging traffic lights on maps and street-view images for makers of autonomous cars. Tellingly, though, Mr Wang admits that he has only one child, murmuring that he and his wife are too busy for more.</p><h2> The politics of contraction</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, Yichun has quietly merged some urban districts and combined some schools. In January it shed a series of outlying subdistricts, turning them into rural townships: a rare example of de-urbanisation. Dusty, apparently deserted housing estates are not hard to spot on the edge of town. Long Ying, an urban planner at Tsinghua University, co-wrote a recent study that used satellite images of night-time lighting to identify over 750 cities in China that shrank between 2013 and 2018. He describes different causes. Some cities lose people because natural resources run out. Others shed working-age adults to nearby big cities. Remote border towns are a third category. Not all are economic laggards. Professor Long wonders if China will see a fourth category in the near-future: coastal cities that lose workers to robots while still booming. Managing decline is very new for Chinese officials, he says. But he sees examples of pragmatism, pointing to north-eastern cities that turned derelict neighbourhoods into large parks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s one-child policy limited births from 1980 to 2016. It left a heavy mark on cities like Yichun, with large state employers that enforced family-planning rules strictly. Now Heilongjiang offers subsidies to promote second and even third births. The money offered does not offset the economic pain of losing Yichun&#39;s timber industry, says a man collecting his only grandchild from primary school. Before, he scoffs, “people wanted to have children but weren&#39;t allowed. Now they allow it but people can&#39;t afford children”. Politically, expansion is an easier sell than squeezing more from less. Party bosses are becoming more open about the task ahead. Do not expect them to sing about it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>阅读我们的中国专栏作家 Chaguan 的更多内容：</b><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/04/chinas-new-top-gun-normalises-war-with-america">中国新的“壮志凌云”使与美国的战争正常化</a>（5 月 4 日）</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/27/chinas-rulers-play-the-law-and-order-card-and-lose" data-tegid="fk0q22c84m8jn5hrgkbgvn9h3n1i8t1i">中国统治者打治安牌，输了</a>（4月27日）</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/20/why-china-wants-to-be-a-risk" data-tegid="mtt5pupasojrfrq4d50i3pl59krm8789">Why China wants to be a risk</a> (Apr 20th)</i></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>另：茶馆专栏是如何<a href="https://www.economist.com/column-names">得名的</a></i></p>]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 11:16:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ps7r7oq04g1i13qdbn5pbii8unp5iut4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/china-learns-to-manage-decline </item><item><title><![CDATA[The fall of empires preys on Xi Jinping’s mind]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="USSR.

He insists that China&#39;s “great rejuvenation”, to be achieved by the 100th anniversary of Communist rule in 2049, is “irreversible”. That is, the country will, by then, become even stronger and more influential. But he has stressed the need to avoid mistakes that caused the fall of dynasties during the country&#39;s 2,100-year-long imperial era, which ended in 1911, as well as those that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union 80 years later. Since he took power more than a decade ago, he has often mused on the inconstancy of national greatness and threats to the party&#39;s rule. History clearly haunts him. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi talks of the “cyclical nature of history”, whereby strong and prosperous regimes sooner or later unravel. The speech he gave a year ago, to the party&#39;s chief enforcers of internal discipline, was about how China must “jump out” of this historical pattern. State media summarised Mr Xi&#39;s remarks shortly after he delivered them, but the (still only partial) text that was published in January was fuller and more dramatic. In it, Mr Xi&#39;s anxiety is clear. He told the officials that the cyclical tendency was a “major issue”, relating to “the life and death of the party, and the rise or fall or success or failure of our country&#39;s socialist system”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Discussion of this cycle has a long history in China. Official literature traces it back to the party&#39;s days as a guerrilla force at the end of the second world war when its leader, Mao Zedong, was reportedly asked by an inquisitive visitor to his base how the party would avoid the trap. His (disingenuous) answer was “democracy—only if people are allowed to supervise the government will it dare not to relax”. Mr Xi insists that China has become democratic already, far more so than Western countries. But state media credit him with another means of avoiding decline. He calls it “self-revolution”, a euphemism for endless purges of officials who are corrupt or disloyal.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/is-chinese-power-about-to-peak">Is Chinese power about to peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak">At what height will China&#39;s economy peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap">How Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power">How China measures national power</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/china-learns-to-manage-decline">China learns to manage decline</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi dwells on the collapse of the Soviet Union even more than his predecessors did. In his view, its causes were chiefly political: ideological laxity and a lack of discipline within its ruling party. In his published speeches, he does not spend much time on other problems that may have played a part, such as the financial burden of military competition with the West, or the costs of having swathes of the economy under the control of inefficient state-owned enterprises. To Mr Xi, the simple moral is that China&#39;s Communist Party needs to be much tougher. As he puts it, nobody in the Soviet Union was “man enough” to crush opposition when the crunch came. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Statue of KGB founder Feliks Dzerzhinsky falls in front of KGB Lubyanka headquarters.

But he also warns of mounting perils ahead. “At present and in the future, we are facing many contradictions, risks and challenges at home and abroad, and we must not take it lightly,” he said in 2016, even before Donald Trump was elected as president and tensions with America began to escalate. If China were to fail to respond effectively, he added, problems in areas such as the economy, society and the environment could “evolve into political contradictions, risks and challenges that will ultimately endanger the party&#39;s ruling status and national security”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> As more difficult years loom—with an ageing society, shrinking population and slowing growth—logic might seem to prod Mr Xi to consider economic and social reforms. Useful ones would include scaling back state-owned firms, giving private businesses freer rein in critical parts of the economy and providing rural migrants with fairer access to state-funded health care and education in cities. But his end-of-dynasty fears will complicate decision-making. He views state enterprises as a bulwark of party rule and big private firms, notably those in the tech industry, with suspicion. He sees the middle class as another pillar of support: he may not want to alienate it by appearing to splurge on urban society&#39;s underdogs.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The dilemma is captured in a mid-19th-century book by Alexis de Tocqueville: “The Old Regime and the Revolution”. Translations of the French historian&#39;s classic work about his country&#39;s revolution in 1789 have been hot sellers in China since the months before Mr Xi took over. It owes its popularity to an unexplained recommendation by Wang Qishan, a party bigwig who became Mr Xi&#39;s chief enforcer of discipline and, later, vice-president (he stepped down in March). Readers comb Tocqueville&#39;s analysis of France&#39;s turmoil for insights into China&#39;s future.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One clause is usually highlighted. It is that “experience teaches that the most critical moment for bad governments is the one which witnesses their first steps toward reform.” It is unlikely that Mr Wang meant to imply that the party was ruling badly, or that reforms should cease. But he could have been suggesting that a period of relative prosperity, such as France experienced before the revolution, can be fraught with political danger. The party must be on its guard.</p><h2> Learning from Tacitus</h2><p class="article__body-text"> There is little sign of regime-threatening discontent brewing in China. But Mr Xi is certainly watchful. In 2019 China&#39;s head of public security said that preventing a “colour revolution” in China was a priority for the police. Protests in November against the zero-covid policy, though small and scattered, will have reinforced Mr Xi&#39;s concerns. Such open displays of dissent are rare. Even more unusually, some demonstrators called on Mr Xi to step down.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As economic growth slows in the years ahead, unease over living standards is likely to grow, and with it Mr Xi&#39;s anxiety. In 2014 he referred to what Chinese scholars call the “Tacitus trap”. This is the idea, taken from the Roman historian&#39;s writings, that “when a ruler once becomes unpopular, all his acts, be they good or bad, tell against him.” Mr Xi said: “Of course, we haven&#39;t got to this stage yet, but the problems we face can&#39;t be described as unserious. We must use huge energy to resolve them.” Since then, his warnings have become more strident. “The more we proceed, the harder and more dangerous it gets,” he said in 2018. Mr Xi has yet to refer publicly to the Peak China concept, but the risks of stalling are clearly on his mind. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>订阅者可以订阅我们新的每周时事通讯<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">《鼓楼》</a> ，以了解世界对中国的影响以及中国对世界的影响。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 11:16:37 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/bhma0j6088tai5o65e5pcgv54u68rla0</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/the-fall-of-empires-preys-on-xi-jinpings-mind </item><item><title><![CDATA[How China measures national power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="XI'AN, CHINA - APRIL 12: A general view of the Terracotta Warriors are seen on April 12, 2017 in Xi'an, China (Ian Hitchcock/Getty Images)" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>N “GUANZI”,</small> a text from the seventh century <small>BC</small> , a statesman thought to be called Guan Zhong lays out the “eight views” needed to assess a country&#39;s status. “Tour its mountains and lakes,” he says, “observe its agriculture, and calculate its production of six types of livestock.

A formula devised by Ray Cline, a <small>CIA</small> analyst, was dismissed for being too narrow in scope and too subjective. Deng Xiaoping, China&#39;s reformist leader, had stated: “In measuring a country&#39;s national power, one must look at it comprehensively and from all sides.” To cater to these demands, Chinese experts started to design their own models.</p><p class="article__body-text"> They ran into some problems. One is that the more complete the range of variables, the harder it is to allocate weights to them. In a paper from 2002, Hu Angang and Men Honghua, then of Tsinghua University, listed eight categories of resources, taking in everything from farmland to computers. <small>CNP</small> is calculated as a weighted average of these resources as a share of the world&#39;s total. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has a similar model, but uses different indicators and weightings. Who is right? Some indexes rely for their weightings on polls of experts, but that&#39;s just a sophisticated version of the conventional wisdom. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1156/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1156/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/380/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/570/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/761/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1141/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1217/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1521/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1901/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2434/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Another problem is that the calculation of <small>CNP</small> produces a single number, but the components that make it up are not interchangeable.

Drawing inspiration from an article by Michael Beckley of Tufts University, we zoom in on the three essential ingredients of national power: economic heft, productive efficiency and military might.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A country cannot be powerful if its economy is inefficient. In the 19th century China lost two opium wars to Britain, despite having a <small>GDP</small> twice the size. On the other hand, neither can a country be powerful if its economy is efficient but small. Luxembourg has not won many wars. And countries cannot fight without a decent army.

These are multiplied, so that countries suffer for their deficiency in any one of them. In the extreme, if any element is zero, then a country&#39;s power is zero, too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Of course, old weapon stocks and nuclear arms also convey might. And <small>GDP</small> does not always translate into economic heft or efficiency. But, at least in the current era, our proxies seem reasonable enough.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By our measure, China has been gaining on America, but the latter is still comfortably on top.

China&#39;s workforce has already peaked, according to official statistics. It has 4.5 times as many 15- to 64-year-olds as America. By mid-century it will have only 3.4 times as many, according to the <small>UN</small> ’s “median” forecast. By the end of the century the ratio will drop to 1.7.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But China&#39;s demographic prospects have not changed much over the past decade, even as forecasts for economic growth have shrunk. In fact, Goldman Sachs&#39;s new predictions assume a gentler decline in China&#39;s workforce than the old ones, because improvements in health may keep older workers at the grindstone for longer. The bank believes the labour supply in China will drop by about 7% from 2025 to 2050. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The biggest swing in sentiment relates not to population but to productivity. Back in 2011 Goldman Sachs thought labour productivity would grow by about 4.8% a year on average over the next 20 years. Now the bank thinks it will grow by about 3%. Mark Williams of Capital Economics takes a similar view. China will fall “off the path of an Asian outperformer onto the path of a solidly respectable emerging economy”, he says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are good reasons to be gloomy about Chinese workers&#39; productivity. As China ages, it will have to devote more of its economic energies to serving the elderly, leaving less to invest in new kit and capacity. What is more, after decades of rapid capital accumulation, the returns to new investments are diminishing. A new high-speed rail line across mountainous Tibet yields far smaller benefits at much greater cost than connecting Beijing and Shanghai, for instance.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s rulers are trying to impose more discipline on local governments, which build much of China&#39;s questionable infrastructure. Unfortunately, they seem equally keen to impose their will on China&#39;s private enterprises. In China, unlike elsewhere, firms earn a smaller return on their assets as they grow bigger, points out Capital Economics: “Get to a certain size and companies have to give as much thought to meeting the needs of officials as those of consumers.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> It is not just their own government that is hobbling Chinese businesses. In October America imposed controls on sales of advanced computer chips to China. This will hurt Chinese firms making products like mobile phones, medical equipment and cars. Goldman Sachs has not incorporated this damage into its long-term forecasts, but estimates that China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> towards the end of this decade could be about 2% smaller than it would otherwise have been.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The tech war could go further. Diego Cerdeiro of the <small>IMF</small> and his co-authors have examined a scenario in which America curtails its own technology trade with China, persuades other <small>OECD</small> members to follow suit, and forces countries outside this club to pick sides in the battle. Under this extreme scenario, China&#39;s economy could be about 9% smaller in ten years&#39; time than it otherwise would be. The idea that China&#39;s productivity growth might be closer to 3% than 5%, in other words, is not far-fetched.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Any predictions of the economic future must, of course, be taken with a pinch of salt. Forecasts often go awry. Small differences in the evolution of productivity or population when combined and compounded over many years can yield starkly different outcomes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Forecasts are also sensitive to prices—especially the relative price of currencies. Unexpected shifts in exchange rates can make a mockery of predictions of relative economic heft. At the moment, a basket of goods and services that costs $100 in America costs only about $60 in China. That suggests its currency, the yuan, is undervalued. Capital Economics thinks this undervaluation will persist. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, believes it will narrow, either because the yuan strengthens or because prices rise faster in China than in America. This process will, in Goldman&#39;s view, add about 20% to China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> by mid-century. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> If China&#39;s prices or exchange rate fail to rise as Goldman Sachs expects, then China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> might never overtake America&#39;s. If China&#39;s labour productivity grows just half a percentage point slower than Goldman Sachs envisages, its <small>GDP</small> , everything else constant, will also never surpass America&#39;s (see chart). The same is true if America grows half a point faster (as Capital Economic projects). If China&#39;s fertility rate declines further (to 0.85 children per woman by mid-century), it might eke out a lead in the 2030s only to lose it in the 2050s. Even if China&#39;s economy does become the biggest in the world, its lead is likely to remain small. It is unlikely to establish an edge over America equivalent to the 40% lead America now enjoys over it, Mr Rajah and Ms Leng argue.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It also seems safe to say that China and America will remain in a position of near-parity for decades. In Goldman Sachs&#39;s scenario, China maintains a small but persistent lead over America for more than 40 years. Even in Capital Economics&#39;s projection, China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> will still be over 80% of America&#39;s as late as 2050. China will remain a geopolitical rival to be reckoned with. That is crucial: if China&#39;s peak is more Table Mountain than <small>K</small> 2, its leaders will have little incentive to rush to confrontation before decline sets in. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>订阅者可以订阅我们新的每周时事通讯<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">《鼓楼》</a> ，以了解世界对中国的影响以及中国对世界的影响。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 10:37:50 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/gnrpiemprbp0a4nps2vir4luvk15nhmf</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak </item><item><title><![CDATA[China v America: how Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="(230331) -- QINGDAO, March 31, 2023 (Xinhua) -- A soldier shoots during an actual combat training of the 42nd fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, on Jan. 31, 2023.

It has risen by an average of over 9% annually since Chinese leaders launched an ambitious military modernisation programme in the late 1990s. In 2023 China&#39;s official military budget is projected to be $224bn, second only to America&#39;s, which is about four times bigger. Increasing defence spending at such a pace is harder with a slowing economy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Nonetheless defence spending is budgeted to rise this year by 7.2%, roughly in line with China&#39;s forecast rate of nominal <small>GDP</small> growth. The military budget excludes some key items such as weapons development. Still, it is a useful trend indicator, suggesting that Mr Xi is ring-fencing core defence spending at 1.6-1.7% of <small>GDP</small> —roughly the same as for the past decade.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If he can maintain that, based on the <small>IMF</small> ’s current <small>GDP</small> forecasts, China&#39;s annual military spending will still be far smaller than America&#39;s by 2030, according to the Asia Power Index compiled by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. But China will narrow the gap substantially by then, it predicts, increasing military expenditure in purchasing-power-parity terms by $155bn, compared with America&#39;s $123bn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even if his economy grows slower than forecast, Mr Xi has considerable leeway to divert resources to the armed forces from the civilian economy. And within the armed forces, he can prioritise areas that he considers more strategically important, for example by downsizing the army, which accounts for almost half of the <small>PLA</small> ’s 2.2m active-duty personnel.</p></div><h2> <b>Naval gazing</b></h2><p class="article__body-text"> Defence spending does not always translate into military power. That depends on many other factors, including technology, alliances and goals. But in China&#39;s case, another useful indicator is the navy. It uses lots of different equipment, including missiles and aircraft, and would spearhead any effort to take Taiwan or project power globally. Building ships is costly and needs a strong industrial base, so it reflects economic health. It is also possible to compare China&#39;s naval shipbuilding plans with America&#39;s, which are made public.</p><p class="article__body-text"> So what do the numbers show? China&#39;s navy has grown in the past two decades from a puny coastal force of outdated ships to a largely modern, home-made one that can conduct some missions far from China&#39;s shores, such as evacuating its citizens from Sudan in April. But it still falls short of Mr Xi&#39;s needs in several key ways—in particular by not having enough large amphibious ships to guarantee a successful invasion of Taiwan. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> That will change over this decade, the Pentagon predicts, as the Chinese navy retires the last of its older ships and adds larger, modern, multi-role ones. It now has about 340 “battle force” vessels (ones that can contribute to combat), including carriers, submarines, frigates and destroyers. That number is likely to reach 400 by 2025 and 440 by 2030, according to the Pentagon. Among the new ships will be about a dozen more large amphibious ships.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even assuming low defence-budget growth, China&#39;s navy would still grow to an estimated 356 ships by 2033, adding three carriers and nine big amphibious ships, according to the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments ( <small>CSBA</small> ), a think-tank in Washington that has designed a digital tool for assessing China&#39;s military procurement choices. “I don&#39;t think the resource constraints are so formidable that Chinese leaders will begin to think that their relative power advantages are eroded,” says Jack Bianchi of <small>CSBA</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> America&#39;s navy, by comparison, had a battle force of 296 ships in April (about half its cold-war peak) and expects that number to drop to about 290 by the end of this decade. Thereafter, America may start to narrow the gap. Its navy still has an official goal of 355 ships. But budget constraints, political changes and other factors could make that difficult to achieve even by 2040. And while China is focusing its military build-up on Taiwan, America has to maintain a global presence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ship numbers can be misleading. America&#39;s vessels are still bigger and more capable. Yet China is likely to catch up on those counts too in the coming decade. It is already “largely composed of modern multi-role platforms featuring advanced anti-ship, anti-air, and anti-submarine weapons and sensors,” says the Pentagon. The Office of Naval Intelligence states that Chinese naval-ship design and material quality is in many cases comparable to America&#39;s “and China is quickly closing the gap in any areas of deficiency.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> One of China&#39;s advantages is its vast shipbuilding industry, which is the world&#39;s largest, accounting for 44% of commercial ships produced worldwide in 2021. A single state-run company, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation ( <small>CSSC</small> ), accounted for more than a fifth of global orders that year. But it also produces most of China&#39;s navy ships, often at the same shipyards as commercial vessels. For instance, the <small>CSSC</small> -owned Jiangnan shipyard (the one founded by Li Hongzhang in 1865) completed China&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/03/chinas-next-aircraft-carrier-will-be-its-biggest">third aircraft-carrier</a> in 2022 but has also made dozens of cargo ships, including for Taiwanese customers. Combining production in this way helps to sustain the shipyards in economic downturns, to apply civilian technology and mass-production techniques to naval shipbuilding, and to circumvent sanctions targeting the <small>PLA</small> , says Monty Khanna, a retired rear-admiral in the Indian navy. America&#39;s naval shipbuilders, meanwhile, focus almost exclusively on defence contracts, making it hard to scale up production or to sustain a stable supply of skilled workers.</p><h2> <b>Forged in battle</b></h2><p class="article__body-text"> Yet there is one crucial area in which China will struggle to match America for many years, if not decades: experience. China has not been to war since one with Vietnam, fought largely on land, in 1979. It has not yet perfected carrier operations in peacetime, let alone combat. And it has not mastered the art of keeping its submarines hidden, while tracking potentially hostile ones. America, by comparison, has honed those capabilities over decades. China is also struggling to attract enough well-educated recruits to operate its new ships.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is still, of course, a risk that Mr Xi goes to war before his armed forces are ready. The most likely triggers for that would be Taiwan formally declaring independence or America taking steps to significantly enhance the island&#39;s status or defences. As he grows older and more vulnerable to ill health and political challenges, there is the possibility that he miscalculates or grows impatient, as Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s president, apparently did over Ukraine. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Some see signs of such impatience already in Mr Xi, who American officials say has ordered his armed forces to develop the capability to take Taiwan by 2027, the <small>PLA</small> ’s centenary. But that does not mean he plans to attack by then, says the <small>CIA</small> . Many <small>PLA</small> experts believe that 2027 is more of a short-term milestone designed to maintain momentum towards the medium-term target of complete <small>PLA</small> modernisation by 2035. His ultimate goal is still to build a <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/27/xi-jinping-wants-chinas-armed-forces-to-be-world-class-by-2050">“world class” fighting force</a> by 2049, the centenary of Communist rule.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Recent war games suggest that China could perhaps win a conflict over Taiwan this decade, but not for sure, and losses on all sides would be devastating. The longer Mr Xi waits, the more the military balance tips in China&#39;s favour—and not just in conventional terms. The Pentagon predicts China&#39;s nuclear arsenal will almost quadruple in size by 2035. Chinese strategists hope that will facilitate a peaceful solution by persuading both Taiwan and America that conflict would be too costly. “Peak China” proponents may be correctly predicting a fraught decade ahead. But Mr Xi still has time on his side. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>订阅者可以订阅我们新的每周时事通讯<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">《鼓楼》</a> ，以了解世界对中国的影响以及中国对世界的影响。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 08 May 2023 15:23:19 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rib9js830hnjq4c7b61p8avjtlmj3g5e</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap</item></channel></rss>
