“他们正在抢走所有的工作。”更糟糕的是，“他们穿着内衣站在阳台上喝酒。”</p><p class="article__body-text">仇恨的浪潮席卷全国。 7月，在突尼斯第二城市斯法克斯，一名阿拉伯人在与移民的斗殴中被杀，暴徒烧毁了非洲黑人住宿的房屋。房东害怕失去财产，驱逐了黑人房客。当<i>《经济学人》</i>访问时，数百名撒哈拉以南的移民正在市中心露宿，挤在一起寻求保护。</p><p class="article__body-text"> “看看我的头，”来自几内亚的画家穆罕默德指着锤击留下的疤痕说道。他说，暴徒用石头和汽油弹将他赶出了公寓；然后警察抓住了他，把他扔到了沙漠里，没有水。许多移民就这样死去，但穆罕默德却以某种方式回到了斯法克斯。他迫切地想要去欧洲。 </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360"

class="article__body-text">总统的讲话纯属捏造。没有计划改变突尼斯的人口结构。非洲黑人只占人口的一小部分，而且大部分只是过客。如果他们犹豫不决，那只是因为他们正在为穿越地中海的危险旅程存钱。</p><p class="article__body-text">在演讲之前，由于经济不景气，赛义德先生不受欢迎。此后，他似乎赢得了更多支持。民意调查并不可靠，但 11 月份的一项民意调查显示他的支持率还不到 30%； 6 月份的另一项调查显示，69% 的人会投票给他。</p><p class="article__body-text">他发誓要保护突尼斯人民免受幽灵威胁，从而将他们团结在自己身后。他还转移了对该国弊病的指责。经济学家认为突尼斯的通货膨胀主要是由政府造成的，但来自斯法克斯的穆斯塔法将责任归咎于黑人，他说黑人吃光了所有面包，推高了物价。他计划在下次选举中投票给赛义德先生。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

class="article__body-text">总统散播仇恨的行为也分散了人们对他一直在做的其他有争议的事情的注意力，例如压制媒体、清洗司法机构和关闭国家反腐败监管机构。他一直在废除促进良好、廉洁治理的制衡机制，并取得了可预见的结果。突尼斯变得更加恐惧、更加不自由、更加腐败。自2021年赛义德开始废除其年轻而充满希望的民主以来，其在监督机构透明国际编制的清廉指数（

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">突尼斯反映了一种全球趋势：越来越多的领导人正在利用民族主义作为积累权力并滥用权力的工具（见图 1）。尽管民族主义曾经是瓦解可悲的殖民帝国的一种手段，但它正日益成为消除对政府权力的合法限制的手段。对制衡感到不满的领导人需要一个借口来废除它们。他们不能承认他们想要压制媒体并清洗法院，因为他们发现遵守规则令人厌烦，并且更愿意以不受约束的权威进行统治。因此他们指责记者和法官是叛徒或外国势力的代理人。</p><p class="article__body-text">民族主义可以是积极的，也可以是消极的。积极的一面——热爱自己的国家——可以成为一股向善的力量。亚沙·蒙克在《伟大的实验：如何让多元化民主发挥作用》一书中写道：“这是人们之间团结的最坚实基础，否则他们可能没有什么共同点。” “最好的情况是，它可以激励生活在田纳西州农村的白人基督徒对生活在洛杉矶的西班牙裔无神论者感到特别关心，反之亦然。”因为它是良性的，而且除了少数西方大学外，几乎所有政治家都拥护毫无争议的、积极的民族主义。几乎没有人会承认自己不爱自己的国家。</p><p class="article__body-text">危险在于他们拥护消极的民族主义：外来者的恐惧和怀疑。局外人可能是外国人，也可能是国内少数民族。也许因为这种偏执的变体是基于根深蒂固的本能——保护自己部落的愿望——所以它非常有效。</p><p class="article__body-text">当人们感到自己的国家受到威胁时，他们就会奋起保卫国家，有时甚至是英勇的。当弗拉基米尔·普京入侵乌克兰时，乌克兰人为抵抗他做出了巨大牺牲。这对乌克兰有利，否则乌克兰就会成为一个附庸国。它还提高了乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽伦斯基的民意支持率：人们团结在这位领导国家国防的人周围。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">唉，不择手段的领导人发现，他们可以通过发誓保护人民免受虚假威胁来赢得类似的民意调查。普京声称，他对乌克兰的无端攻击实际上是为了保卫俄罗斯免受西方侵略和乌克兰纳粹的侵害。许多俄罗斯人相信他。尽管这场战争给俄罗斯带来了鲜血、财富和国际孤立的代价，但独立民意调查显示，自战争开始以来，普京的支持率有所上升。</p><p class="article__body-text">偏执的民族主义的主要缺点是显而易见的。这对于其目标来说是可怕的，无论他们是突尼斯的移民还是土地上埋有地雷的乌克兰人。偏执的民族主义政权的邻国有理由感到紧张，与俄罗斯或中国接壤的任何地方都可以证明这一点。</p><p class="article__body-text">另一个大缺点不太为人所知：基于偏执的政治为暴政和腐败打开了大门。过去二十年来，随着普京加强民族主义宣传，他的亲信一直在掠夺俄罗斯。尽管他无疑是最极端的例子，但他并不孤单。事实上，民族主义和腐败之间存在明显的统计相关性。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>《经济学人》</i>分析了瑞典哥德堡大学附属智库 V-Dem 研究所的数据。每年它都会要求专家描述世界各国政府如何向选民或公民证明自己的合理性。然后它会根据结果创建一个比例。按人口对各国进行加权后，我们发现 2012 年至 2021 年间，各国政府变得更加依赖民族主义来为自己辩护。 （具体来说，是包含民族主义元素的意识形态。它还可能包含其他元素，例如民粹主义或伊斯兰主义。）这种变化是重大的：一个典型的公民看到她的国家使用民族主义的增加大致相当于中国的增加在“战狼”国家主席习近平的领导下。</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image"

class="article__body-text">我们将民族主义政府的衡量标准与透明国际 ( <small>TI</small> ) 2012 年至 2021 年公共部门腐败认知数据结合起来。利用统计模型，我们发现，如果政府依靠民族主义言论来维持权力，专家认为公共部门的腐败程度要高得多（见图2）。此外，回顾2012年，通过比较不同时期的国家，我们发现民族主义言论越多，腐败越多，民族主义越少，腐败越少。在控制了平均收入及其变化以及全球民族主义和腐败趋势后，这两个发现仍然成立。</p><p class="article__body-text">也有明显的例外（例如，中国变得更廉洁、更沙文主义），但这种关系在统计上是显着的：民族主义每增加一个标准差，腐败就会猛增 5.31（范围从 0 到 100）在比较国家时，在内部比较时跃升 0.13 个百分点。后者可能看起来很小，但腐败分数通常不会有太大变化。有趣的是，当民族主义首先出现时，它就预示着未来腐败的增加。</p><p class="article__body-text">为什么会这样呢？ <small>TI</small>的负责人丹尼尔·埃里克森 (Daniel Eriksson) 提出了民族主义助长权力滥用的三种方式。政治家可能会煽动民族主义热情来赢得或保住职位。通过给予他们的亲属或亲信影响力，他们可能会试图夺取国家。通过将批评者称为叛徒，他们可能会削弱防止掠夺公共资金的制衡机制。</p><p class="article__body-text">诉诸民族主义是有效的，因为它们简单易懂，而且比任何基本的政策建议都更加情绪化。 “投票给我，我将为学校做出渐进式的改进”是一个很好的平台，但却是一个乏味的口号。 “隔壁的部落正在攻击我们！”是一个令人振奋的。</p></div><h2>选择你的毒药</h2><p class="article__body-text">敌人可以有多种形式。可能是移民，就像突尼斯那样。或者是地缘政治对手：中国和俄罗斯的宣传不断妖魔化美国。或者少数派信仰：印度执政党夸大占人口不到 15% 的穆斯林对占多数的印度教徒构成的不存在的威胁。</p><p class="article__body-text">或者敌人可能是文化变革。许多民族主义领导人将任何令人不舒服的新社会趋势描述为外国人，甚至是外国人企图颠覆其国家价值观的恶毒企图。伊朗政权利用这一论点来讨论妇女权利；乌干达关于对同性恋者的宽容。非自由政权习惯性地将他们反对的价值观描述为外来价值观，这比解释他们为什么错了要容易。 </p><div

class="article__body-text">每个民族主义领导人都是独一无二的，很难判断哪些人相信自己的言论。无论哪种方式，偏执的民族主义都为他们提供了获得权力、巩固权力并掩饰滥用权力的工具。</p><p class="article__body-text">以尼加拉瓜为例。总统丹尼尔·奥尔特加曾经是一位革命马克思主义者。他于 1979 年一路上台，但在 1990 年的选举中失利。为了重新获得并保留权力，他压制了自己的马克思主义，加大了反美的夸夸其谈，赢得了 2006 年的选举，并从那时起逐渐扼杀了民主。</p><p class="article__body-text">他对妖怪的选择是精明的。四十年前，美国确实资助了他的国家的暴力革命者。这种威胁早已不复存在，但奥尔特加先生仍然声称他的对手是“洋基帝国的代理人”，“很久以前就不再是尼加拉瓜人了”。今年二月，他剥夺了 300 多名持不同政见者的公民身份。</p><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image"

class="article__body-text">按照埃里克森先生的剧本，奥尔特加先生让他的亲属掌握了权力。他的副总统和可能的继任者是他的妻子罗萨里奥·穆里略(Rosario Murillo)。他们的九个孩子中有八个帮助他们管理国家。他们的儿子劳雷亚诺是总统顾问。他监督了与一家中国公司就修建横跨尼加拉瓜、耗资 500 亿美元的运河的谈判。该项目于 2015 年因诈骗指控而失败。劳雷亚诺也是一位歌剧歌手。并非所有歌剧迷都相信他的才华。一位评论家将他的声音比作“山羊分娩时的尖叫声”。但他经常在由他经营的基金会支持的歌剧中担任主角，该基金会由尼加拉瓜纳税人资助。</p><h2>盗窃独裁者</h2><p class="article__body-text">奥尔特加家族经营着尼加拉瓜的主要电视频道。这让他们能够偏向对自己有利的消息。这也是有利可图的。 2018年至2020年间，尼加拉瓜政府从奥尔特加斯家族拥有或控制的三大<small>电视</small>频道购买了价值约5900万美元的广告，而在与他们无关的频道上花费了区区23万美元。据信该家族总共控制着从能源到房地产等行业的 22 家公司。按照<small>TI</small>的规模计算，尼加拉瓜的腐败程度比 2012 年高出 10 个百分点，目前排名低于刚果。</p><p class="article__body-text">在更富裕、更成熟的民主国家，偏执的民族主义也为局外人提供了一种吸引注意力、闯入国家政治或保持领先地位的快捷方式。五月，匈牙利总理维克多·欧尔班在一次保守派会议上声称，“我们都受到了攻击。”他发誓要捍卫匈牙利人免受移民、伊斯兰教和同性恋权利的侵害。他宣布匈牙利各民族团结一致，包括邻国的匈牙利人。他给他们养老金，并让他们在匈牙利选举中投票；他们倾向于投票给他。因此，煽动民族主义帮助他赢得了四次选举。</p><p class="article__body-text">匈牙利媒体现在主要由欧尔班先生的亲信控制，鹦鹉学舌地重复他关于外国阴谋的说法。当来自欧盟的大量援助流入他的密友的口袋，国家资产被转移到他的盟友控制的基金会时，温和的法院很少提出反对意见。洛林克·梅萨罗斯 (Lorinc Meszaros) 是欧尔班先生的前同学，拥有一家规模不大的管道配件企业，现已成为匈牙利首富，福布斯估计其财富为 14 亿美元。</p><p class="article__body-text">在匈牙利和其他地方，民族主义为削弱制衡提供了一个听起来合理的借口。看门狗可以被指定为“外国代理人”并被绝育。诚实的公务员可能会被贴上“不爱国”的标签，并被忠诚者取代。不正当交易可以以国家安全的名义保密。</p><p class="article__body-text">普京先生是这种方法的先驱。 2012年，他出台了一项法律，限制从国外接受资金的<small>非政府</small>组织的活动。 2022 年，他扩大了该法律的范围。现在，如果国家认为任何个人或团体“受到外国影响”，就可以宣布他们为“外国代理人”（这在许多人听来就像“间谍”）。所谓的“外国代理人”可以被禁止参与任何类型的政治活动，或者干脆被关闭。</p><p class="article__body-text">普京方法的要素已被世界各地广泛模仿。据国际特赦组织称，近年来至少有 50 个国家颁布了限制公民社会的规则。更广泛地说，根据我们的姊妹组织经济学人智库的衡量，在 2012 年至 2022 年间清廉指数显着恶化的 31 个国家中，80% 的国家的公民自由也受到限制。</p><p

class="article__body-text"> 7月，津巴布韦总统签署了一项“爱国法案”，允许任何“故意损害津巴布韦主权和国家利益”的人被判处长期监禁。反对派表示，他们将上周选举前对政府的批评定为犯罪，执政党不公平地“赢得”了选举。</p><p class="article__body-text">尽管名称如此，该法案似乎旨在让津巴布韦的治理更加恶化。这使得公民社会的成员——对盗窃执政党的主要制约因素——与外国人进行任何接触变得危险。如果一名独立记者与外国外交官交谈，或者当地选举监督组织与国际组织分享数据，或者反腐败监督机构向国外专家寻求建议，那么监狱可能会等待着您。除此之外，该法律还要求检察官证明那些滥用职权的人知道自己的行为是错误的，从而加大了惩罚掠夺性官员的难度。</p><p class="article__body-text">在一个又一个国家，现任者发现民族主义或宗派论点可以用来骚扰那些挑战现状的人或将他们排除在公职之外。伊朗腐败的神权政治坚持要求所有总统候选人都符合其对伊斯兰虔诚的定义。 2021 年，它取消了其中 585 人的资格，其中包括所有潜在的改革者，只允许 7 人参选。波兰的一项新法律可能会禁止被认为受到俄罗斯不当影响的政客任职；它的可能目标是唐纳德·图斯克，一位根本不亲俄罗斯的主要反对派候选人。自2015年波兰民族主义执政党上台以来，该国的清廉指数已上升了八个百分点。</p><h2>贪婪的阴影</h2><p class="article__body-text">一个更加民族主义的政府并不必然意味着一个更加腐败的政府。一个国家有可能变得更加喧闹，但不会变得更加肮脏，至少在一段时间内是这样。然而，从长远来看，如果一个领导人利用民族主义来削弱制衡，他周围的人或他的继任者就更容易进行掠夺。这种情况发生在津巴布韦，那里的民族主义独裁者罗伯特·穆加贝对权力的兴趣远大于金钱，他未能阻止亲信的掠夺，最终被他们推翻。</p><p class="article__body-text">因此，无论出发点如何，偏执的民族主义往往会使国家治理更差、更不稳定。诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿比吉特·巴纳吉 (Abhijit Banerjee) 与人合着的一篇论文发现，当选民根据种族而不是诚实或能力等因素来挑选候选人时，他们最终会选出不诚实、能力较差的代表。</p><p class="article__body-text">哥伦比亚大学的安德烈亚斯·威默 (Andreas Wimmer) 分析了近 500 场内战的数据，发现当政党以种族为基础时，内战的可能性几乎是原来的两倍。如果相关国家既不是独裁国家（可以在骚乱升级之前镇压动乱）也不是完全民主国家（通常和平解决争端），那么不稳定的可能性可能会增加 30 倍。简而言之，当领导者援引鲜血和土壤时，预计事情会变得血腥或肮脏。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 09:10:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

月开始的厄尔尼诺现象将非常强烈，可能与 2016 年结束的厄尔尼诺现象一样严重，那一年是有记录以来最热的一年。如果他们是对的，这一纪录几乎肯定会在今年或明年被打破。 “我们正处于未知领域，”荷兰气象局局长、红十字会与红新月会气候中心前负责人马尔滕·范阿尔斯特说道。 “除了如此严重的全球变暖之外，我们还从未经历过厄尔尼诺现象，所以我们不知道会发生什么。” </p><div

年异常强烈的厄尔尼诺现象带来了干旱和洪水，导致全球约 6000 万人缺乏食物，导致寨卡病毒在南美洲大规模爆发，并使澳大利亚 29% 的大堡礁白化。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div

class="article__body-text">有时，天气的变化也能带来好处。阿根廷今年的降雨预计将增加粮食产量，打破长期干旱。厄尔尼诺年通常会产生较温和的大西洋飓风季节，减少对财产和农作物的损害（尽管今年可能不会因为北大西洋异常炎热的海水而出现这种情况）。厄尔尼诺现象的影响也多种多样，远远超出了渔业和农业的范围。 2015年，占全球产量30%的智利北部一家锂工厂的生产因大雨而中断。锂市场随之而来的紧张情绪出乎预测者的预料。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种多样性使得很难评估厄尔尼诺现象对世界经济的总体影响是积极还是消极。国际货币基金组织研究人员 2016 年发表的一项研究发现，厄尔尼诺现象无论从哪一方面都没有产生什么影响。但斯坦福大学的克里斯托弗·卡拉汉和达特茅斯学院的贾斯汀·曼金今年早些时候在<i>《科学》杂志</i>上发表的一篇论文发现，1982-83 年和 1997-98 年的厄尔尼诺周期使全球<small>GDP</small>分别永久减少了 4.1 万亿美元和 5.7 万亿美元。然而，第一个周期恰逢美国中央银行美联储加息的时期；第二个是亚洲金融危机。换句话说，在这两个时期，随着厄尔尼诺现象的出现，其他完全不相关的因素也在抑制新兴市场的经济增长。分解这些不同事件的影响极其困难。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，所有分析都一致认为，厄尔尼诺现象对穷国的打击比富国更严重。即使<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的研究发现总体影响不大，发展中国家的巨大成本也被美国更高的农业产量所抵消。与此同时，随着大宗商品价格的上涨，几乎所有地方的通货膨胀率都在上升。</p><h2> ENSO 开启 ENSO 开启</h2><p class="article__body-text">厄尔尼诺现象越严重，影响自然也就越大。根据美国政府气象机构<small>NOAA</small>的最新预测，当前的飓风有66%的可能性会“强劲”。该评估基于太平洋特定区域（称为“Niño 3.4”）的表面温度上升超过正常水平。升温1.5°C构成强烈事件；超过 2°C 就被视为“非常强”，与上个世纪最大的厄尔尼诺现象相当。上一次厄尔尼诺现象发生在 2018-19 年，峰值温度为 0.9°C，在 Niño 3.4 内出现。一位气候学家称之为“厄尔尼诺现象的小毛病”。在此之前的 2014-16 年，跨越了两个冬天，峰值温度为 2.6°C（见图表）。 2015 年和 2016 年，全球平均气温连续创下历史新高。据协调<small>NOAA</small>厄尔尼诺预报更新的 Michelle L&#39;Heureux 表示，今年的厄尔尼诺现象有

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">三个因素可能会加剧厄尔尼诺现象，带来新的极端情况。首先，它是在连续三年的拉尼娜现象（与厄尔尼诺现象相反）之后到来的，当时的风比平时更强烈地推动太平洋温暖的海水向西流向亚洲，暂时降低了全球气温。拉尼娜现象期间占主导地位的风型往往会将热量推入海洋深处。在随后的厄尔尼诺现象中，部分热量再次出现。连续三年的拉尼娜现象意味着有更多的热量需要释放。</p><p class="article__body-text">但不仅仅是拉尼娜现象在世界海洋中储存热量。全球变暖也是如此。几十年来，研究人员不仅测量了地表温度，还测量了 2000 米深处的温度。自 20 世纪 90 年代以来，这些更深的水域一直在不断升温。一些气候研究人员想知道，过去一个月左右观察到的全球海洋表面异常温度是否与这种远洋流感有关。</p><p class="article__body-text">尽管厄尔尼诺现象确实会导致厄尔尼诺 3.4 区域以外的地表温度上升，但这通常要到今年晚些时候才会发生。对早期气温飙升的一个可能解释是，深海中积累的一些热量开始重新浮出水面。英国利兹大学的皮尔斯·福斯特说：“也许我们已经开始看到一些热量的重新分配现象正在显现出来。”</p><p class="article__body-text">关于海洋内热动力变化可能加剧厄尔尼诺现象的理论尚未得到证实，但毫无疑问，更广泛的全球变暖将使厄尔尼诺现象变得更糟。 “随着气候变化的展开，特定厄尔尼诺现象的影响并不相同，而是更大，”英国气象局英国气象局的亚当·斯凯夫（Adam Scaife）说。全球变暖意味着空气中的水分含量增加，降雨量波动也在增加，“因此，与过去强度相同的厄尔尼诺现象可能会倾倒更多的水或导致更严重的干旱。”虽然“三次探底”拉尼娜现象掩盖了一些变暖现象，使气温比原本应有的温度更低，但厄尔尼诺现象却会加剧这种现象。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> “我相信 2024 年全球气温将是前所未有的，”斯凯夫博士说。目前，地球温度比蒸汽机发明之前高了 1.26°C。气候学家表示，根据经验，厄尔尼诺现象期间，尼诺 3.4 地区每升高一度，全球平均气温就会暂时升高 0.07°C。因此，强烈或非常强烈的事件可能会将平均气温总体上升至 1.4°C。</p><p class="article__body-text">这意味着厄尔尼诺现象期间经常遭受干旱和野火的地区——澳大利亚、印度尼西亚和亚马逊盆地的部分地区——面临更大的风险。仅在澳大利亚，即使是 2019 年微弱的厄尔尼诺现象也导致 24 万平方公里的灌木丛被焚毁，造成近 500 人死亡，数千座房屋被毁，50 亿澳元（约合 35 亿美元）的农作物和牲畜被毁。今年的厄尔尼诺现象可能会因印度洋偶极子（ <small>IOD</small> ）的正位相而加剧，印度洋偶极子（IOD）的正位相是一种以印度洋表面温度波动为特征的天气模式，进一步加剧了澳大利亚和印度尼西亚的干旱状况。与此同时，拉尼娜现象下三年的大雨促进了植物的生长。土壤和植物中残留的水分可能会提供一些保护。但如果所有植被都枯竭了，就会引发更猛烈的火灾。更糟糕的是，大雨和缩短的冬季缩小了进行控制燃烧的窗口，控制燃烧可以减少易燃植被的数量。前消防专员格雷格·马林斯 (Greg Mullins) 表示，澳大利亚人口最多的州新南威尔士州今年仅完成了预定燃烧量的 20%。</p><h2>偶极情感障碍</h2><p class="article__body-text"><small>IOD</small>还会加剧厄尔尼诺现象通常给东非带来的潮湿条件。从表面上看，经过多年的干旱，这应该是一个积极的因素。但降雨量可能过多，可能会淹没农田并损坏用于将农作物运往市场的道路。 “我们正在密切关注，”加州大学圣巴巴拉分校气候灾害中心的劳拉·哈里森 (Laura Harrison) 说。</p><p class="article__body-text">此类灾害也会对农产品市场造成严重破坏。事实上，印度政府已宣布禁止出口某些类型的大米，因为预计当前作物生长期间会出现比平常更干燥的情况。该禁令影响了印度约一半的年度出口量，按总量计算，印度大米贸易量占全球大米贸易量的 40%。它使世界大米价格达到2011年以来的最高水平。</p><p class="article__body-text">大米市场前景在好转之前可能会变得更糟。厄尔尼诺现象过去曾导致稻米单产下降：2015-16年，东南亚产量减少了1500万吨，占全球库存的7%。自今年年初以来，潜在短缺的担忧引发了亚洲各国政府的恐慌性购买。例如，印度尼西亚一直在从越南进口大米，越南是继印度和泰国之后的第三大出口国。</p><p class="article__body-text">小麦也可能会经历疯狂的发展。澳大利亚的农作物产量占全球的 12-15%，在厄尔尼诺现象年份，产量可能会减半。标准普尔全球商品洞察 ( <small>S&amp;P</small> Global Commodity Insights) 的保罗·休斯 (Paul Hughes) 表示：“考虑到小麦市场的不稳定状况，以及俄罗斯和乌克兰战争等因素，澳大利亚小麦作物非常重要，我们正在密切关注。”公司。</p><p class="article__body-text">棕榈油是另一种脆弱的产品。印度尼西亚和马来西亚这两个最大出口国的干旱将导致产量下降。<small>标准普尔</small>全球公司估计，如果厄尔尼诺现象轻微，马来西亚的出口可能会下降10%；如果厄尔尼诺现象严重，马来西亚的出口可能会下降一倍。去年俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，棕榈油帮助弥补了葵花籽油的短缺，葵花籽油的 75%

class="article__body-text">强烈厄尔尼诺现象的另一个可能后果是疾病增加。随着温度升高，病毒在蚊子等媒介中复制得更快。蚊子在炎热的天气里也更容易叮咬。暴雨和干旱都会为昆虫创造更多的繁殖场所，因为人们会在方便的容器中收集更多的水。世界卫生组织整理的研究发现，二十年来与厄尔尼诺现象相关的干旱条件使哥伦比亚和委内瑞拉的疟疾病例增加了三分之一以上。 1997-98 年强烈的厄尔尼诺现象与埃塞俄比亚、肯尼亚和乌干达的疟疾大流行有关。今年的大雨和洪水加剧了秘鲁有史以来最严重的登革热疫情，北部的医院不堪重负。</p><p class="article__body-text">洪水会导致卫生条件差，导致腹泻病增加。灾难发生后发生的流离失所和过度拥挤使此类疫情更加严重。如果非洲之角确实被雨水淋湿，霍乱病例可能会激增。</p><p class="article__body-text">营养不良会加剧疾病的脆弱性，特别是对于幼儿或老年人。慈善机构“救助儿童会”声称，2015-16 年厄尔尼诺现象造成的破坏导致全球另外 600 万儿童营养不良，这一数字是受到 covid-19 影响的儿童人数的三倍。这场大流行使卫生服务不堪重负并被削弱。健康慈善机构比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会估计，新冠肺炎导致免疫接种率出现30年来最大的持续下降，导致麻疹等可预防疾病的爆发激增。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">事实上，许多不良影响是可以预见的，这至少意味着政府和援助机构可以尽力做好准备。哥伦比亚大学和红十字会的气候预报员 Andrew Kruczkiewicz 解释说，自 2015 年以来，人道主义界越来越多地将季节性预报纳入其规划中。例如，在洪都拉斯，红十字会根据<small>NOAA</small>发布的厄尔尼诺现象预报，于 6 月底启动了紧急协议。它正在向面临干旱风险的地区分发现金和消毒水的工具包。</p><p class="article__body-text">但仔细的准备只能让你走到这一步，特别是在机构薄弱、腐败盛行的贫穷国家。自上次强厄尔尼诺现象以来，秘鲁已经更换了六位总统。在今年洪水和山体滑坡再次袭击同一地区之前，用于重建和气候防护的 140 亿美元资金中所投入的资金所剩无几。</p><p class="article__body-text">更多与气候相关的灾难可能只会加深秘鲁民众的不满和功能失调的政治，进一步削弱政府的应对能力。事实上，几千年来，气候的波动一直刺激着南美洲文明的兴衰。作家布莱恩·费根写道，厄尔尼诺现象“会摧毁人们对其领导人合法性和社会基础的信心”。古代秘鲁王国的传奇统治者芬佩莱克提供了一个有益的例子。根据神话，在持续的、反季节的降雨毁坏了庄稼之后，他的人民认为他应该受到指责。于是他们把他绑起来扔进海里。

e190yofl0"> <span>8</span><small>月</small><small>11日</small>，沙特阿拉伯最大的足球赛事——沙特职业联赛将在2023-24赛季拉开帷幕。上赛季的比赛并没有让人们兴奋不已。平均只有 9,300 名球迷观看比赛。过去五个赛季中的三个赛季，最佳射手都是摩洛哥人阿卜杜拉扎克·哈姆达拉（Abderrazak Hamdallah），他从未为任何世界顶级俱乐部效力过。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但这个赛季可能会有所不同。哈姆达拉先生的球队阿尔伊蒂哈德刚刚从皇家马德里签下了2022年世界最佳球员金球奖获得者卡里姆·本泽马和来自切尔西的明星中场球员恩戈洛·坎特。五次金球奖得主克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多 (Cristiano Ronaldo) 一月份从曼联转会到另一家沙特俱乐部阿尔纳斯尔 (Al Nassr)。前利物浦边锋萨迪奥·马内加入了他的行列，而利物浦队长乔丹·亨德森则与艾提法克签约。这样的例子还在继续。今年夏天，沙特联赛球队的转会费用已超过 4.8 亿美元，跻身全球足坛支出最高的球队之列。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">职业联赛的举措只是沙特阿拉伯斥资数十亿美元进军全球体育运动的一部分，该计划得到了沙特王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（ <small>MBS</small> ）的支持。它远远超出了足球的范围，正在席卷全球高尔夫、一级方程式赛车、拳击等领域。 <small>mbs</small>的目标是利用体育让沙特阿拉伯实现现代化，并改变外界对这个拥有 3600 万人口的沙漠王国的看法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特的挥霍发生之际，全球体育产业正受到数字颠覆和新一轮私募股权投资浪潮的冲击。愤世嫉俗者指责<small>王储</small>的虚荣工程和“体育洗牌”——利用体育来粉饰该国侵犯人权的声誉。沙特官员对此类批评感到愤怒。沙特驻<small>华盛顿</small>大使馆的法赫德·纳泽尔表示，沙特进行体育洗牌的想法“与事实相差甚远”。他说，这种说法充满了“种族中心主义”的味道：他说，一切都是为了沙特阿拉伯及其公民而不是西方人而做的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">许多观察家认为，这些举措不仅会改变沙特阿拉伯，还会改变全球体育本身，从古板的西方球队和锦标赛守护者手中夺取主动权，并引入一支充满活力的新力量。这项支出已经持续了好几年，但直到最近，其全部范围还被分散枪的方法所掩盖。体育产业的投资和谈判发生在多个层面，包括购买球员、购买外国俱乐部、发展国内俱乐部以及购买或发展国内外赛事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些交易是由一系列沙特实体进行的，包括政府本身、公共投资基金（ <small>pif</small> ）、主权财富基金，甚至是世界上最赚钱的石油公司沙特阿美公司。其规模令人印象深刻，在六项主要体育项目上花费了至少 100 亿美元。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">豪威，小伙子们</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">2021 年，沙特领导的财团以<small>3.91</small>亿美元的价格收购了纽卡斯尔联队，这是一支传奇但陷入困境的英超球队。除了发展国内联赛外，人们还强烈猜测沙特阿拉伯将效仿邻国卡塔尔在 2022 年举办世界杯的脚步，申办 2030 年世界杯。据信，海湾资金支持了 2021 年举办世界杯的尝试。创建了一个欧洲超级联赛，但在球迷的反对下崩溃了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在高尔夫领域，美国的主要机构<small>美巡赛</small>刚刚同意与沙特新贵锦标赛丽芙高尔夫<small>(liv</small> Golf) 合并，丽芙高尔夫 (liv Golf) 向顶级球员提供数亿美元来改变他们的忠诚度，从而使这项运动陷入混乱。另一个组织机构欧洲<small>dp</small>世界巡回赛也是该交易的一部分。唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 的课程经常举办<small>生活</small>活动，他将其描述为“美丽而迷人的交易”。两位左翼参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）和罗恩·怀登（Ron Wyden）最近在致<small>美国</small>司法部的公开信中谴责“沙特政权最近试图净化其暴行”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特阿拉伯在吉达举办了一场新的一级方程式大奖赛，并正在首都利雅得附近修建一条赛道；据报道，沙特投资者去年曾考虑出价 200 亿美元收购整个一级方程式赛车。沙特体育部长驳斥了这些报道，称其“纯粹是猜测”。沙特阿美公司仍然是<small>f</small> 1 的主要赞助商。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">男子<small>ATP</small>网球巡回赛的一名官员承认与可能的投资者进行了“积极”的谈判，其中包括<small>pif</small> 。女子网球巡回赛<small>WTA</small>正在考虑是否在沙特举办赛事，一位官员最近到访了沙特。该王国现在举办大型拳击比赛、摔跤比赛和电子竞技比赛。尽管气候恶劣，但它还是被选为2029年亚洲冬季运动会的举办地。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">他们自己的联盟</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国家为什么要大力发展体育事业？虚荣和嫉妒起了一定作用。许多沙特王室成员都是粉丝。他们已经在其他地方投资了团队，现在想要一些自己的团队。他们还希望受到全球体育精英的重视。 <small>PIF</small>州长亚西尔·鲁迈扬 (Yasir Al-Rumayyan) 是一位高尔夫球迷。最近国会就<small>PGA</small><small>图利夫</small>交易举行的听证会公布的文件表明，交易中提出的一个想法是，他可能会获得美国最尊贵的俱乐部奥古斯塔的会员资格。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特人目睹了邻国的挺身而出。卡塔尔乔治城大学的丹耶尔·雷奇 (Danyel Reiche) 表示，这项比赛始于 1993 年。那是卡塔尔首次举办<small>atp</small>男子网球锦标赛（鲍里斯·贝克尔获胜）。它花费了2000亿美元准备举办2022年世界杯。其中一位王室成员还拥有法国顶级俱乐部巴黎圣日耳曼队。曼城由阿布扎比皇室拥有，现在是世界上最有价值的足球品牌。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但沙特的计划远远超出了为其精英阶层提供福利和与邻国保持同步的范围。强劲的能源价格和产量意味着今年其石油出口预计将超过 1660 亿美元，即<small>GDP</small>的 16%。随着全球能源转型的迫在眉睫，沙特的“2030愿景”计划旨在通过发展新产业和经济自由化（包括让更多女性加入劳动力队伍）来实现经济多元化，摆脱对石油的依赖。 <small>PIF</small>是一个关键参与者，利用其超过 7000 亿美元的资金将资本重新部署到新的经济领域，并对品牌和技术进行战略投资。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特王国希望沙特职业联赛能够吸引投资和球迷。它的目标是到 2030 年每年接待 1 亿游客（2021 年为 6400 万）。官员们希望到那时联盟的收入将翻两番，达到 4.8 亿美元，尽管与去年收入十倍的<small>英超联赛</small>相比，这仍然相形见绌。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">希望体育运动能够对其他经济领域产生溢出效应。其中一部分是在一个以宗教冲突、极端主义和战争闻名的地区进行品牌重塑。 “每个人都应该为该地区的繁荣而共同努力，而不是陷入冲突，而沙特希望被视为处于这一领域的最前沿，”纽约智库外交关系委员会的史蒂文·库克解释道。约克。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更好的品牌和更多的活动可以提振旅游业，政府希望旅游业占<small>GDP</small>的比重从 2019 年的 3% 增加到 2030 年的 10%。当你想成为度假胜地时，明星力量会有所帮助：莱昂内尔·梅西 (Lionel Messi)，也许是足球界的明星最伟大的球员是沙特旅游大使，他在 Instagram 上向他的 4.82 亿粉丝发布沐浴在阳光下的照片。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">体育甚至可以作为社会改革的补充机制。近年来，沙特政府越来越接受男女在公共场合混合，并采取了一些措施来遏制过于热心的宗教警察。 2018 年，女性终于被允许开车。现在，它不仅支持男性运动，还支持女性运动。沙特女足三月份首次获得<small>国际足联</small>排名。所有这些可能会让这个国家对女性游客更具吸引力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">卡塔尔大学体育管理助理教授瓦迪赫·伊沙克表示，在整个地区，举办体育赛事“普遍受到居民的积极评价”。沙特驻华盛顿大使馆纳泽尔先生指出，沙特70%的人口年龄在35岁以下，年轻人热爱体育赛事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">总体规划面临两大风险。首先是它的商业模式可能行不通。海湾业主显然可以经营好体育业务。曼城在阿联酋投资者的<small>带领</small>下蓬勃发展（尽管<small>英超联赛</small>在二月份指责其涉嫌违反财务规则，但俱乐部否认了这一指控）。在沙特拥有所有权的第一年，纽卡斯尔联队花费了大约 1 亿英镑（1.26 亿美元）并摆脱了降级区。在第二场比赛中，俱乐部获得第四名，20年来首次获得参加欧洲主要俱乐部赛事冠军联赛的资格。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，在沙特阿拉伯，体育是一个国家支持的项目，而不是一个企业关注的项目，可能会带来一些问题。 6月，一些此前由体育部控制的顶级足球俱乐部名义上被私有化。但<small>pif</small>拥有四支球队75%的股份。石油公司阿美公司(Aramco)还有另一支球队，而在沙漠中兴建的大都市尼奥姆( <small>neom)</small>也有一支乙级球队。巴黎斯科玛商学院的西蒙·查德威克 (Simon Chadwick) 表示：“这几乎就像沙特阿拉伯的足球俱乐部变成了 quangos。”体育运动可能不会成为经济的新动力引擎，而可能成为其旧的、国营赞助体系的体现。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了吸引明星，片酬必须很高。据报道，本泽马签署了一份为期两年、价值 4.4 亿美元的合同，而罗纳尔多则据传年薪为 2 亿美元。今年夏天，阿尔希拉尔向巴黎圣日耳曼队提出了创纪录的 3 亿欧元（合 3.3 亿美元）报价，收购法国球星凯利安·姆巴佩，但到目前为止，姆巴佩已经拒绝了。高尔夫球手菲尔·米克尔森 (Phil Mickelson) 从丽芙高尔夫<small>(liv</small> Golf) 中赚了 2 亿美元，尽管他曾形容沙特队是“可怕的混蛋”（他后来道歉）。巨额工资意味着即使是最成功的欧洲球队也很难赚钱。 2022 年，<small>英超</small>联赛中超过一半的球队都出现了亏损，意大利、德国和西班牙的联赛整体上都处于亏损状态。 （Exor 持有<i>《经济学人</i>》母公司的股份，也是意大利足球俱乐部尤文图斯和意大利汽车制造商法拉利的投资者。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由于拥有石油财富，沙特的实验不会让银行倾家荡产。根据<small>pif</small> 2021年年报，休闲娱乐仅占其资产的1.6%。但国内收入低和成本高可能意味着许多沙特体育企业在没有补贴的情况下无法维持自身或在全球竞争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">沙特阿拉伯可能会面临一些与中国相同的足球问题，中国在过去十年中试图提高中超联赛的命运。身价昂贵的引进球星可能会抱怨足球的水平，并且人们会对当前支出水平的可持续性产生很多怀疑。但国家对联盟的支持将消除阻碍中国项目的财务问题和政治审查。沙特也在努力吸引年轻的天才球员，而不仅仅是像美国那样，许多来自欧洲俱乐部的顶级球员传统上都会去美国度过晚年。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但沙特国内观众较少也可能阻碍其雄心壮志。有一个新兴经济体在全球体育业务运营中发挥主导作用的例子。 2008年，印度推出了印度板球超级联赛（ <small>ipl</small> ）。去年，未来五年的比赛转播权以超过 60 亿美元的价格出售，使其成为世界上场均利润第二高的体育联盟，仅次于美式橄榄球比赛<small>NFL</small> 。印度的金融影响力使其在全球板球运动中拥有强大的话语权。但印度成功的基础在于其庞大的观众规模，有 14 亿热爱板球的公民。沙特无法与之匹敌。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="体育运动员达斯汀·约翰逊和乔丹·亨德森的拼贴画" width="1844"

edweubf1">图片来源：Israel Vargas/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二大危险是激增引发反弹。体育可能是一个敏感的投资行业，而沙特阿拉伯作为独裁国家的地位也无济于事。一些人权组织指责沙特进行体育洗牌，例如<small>国际足联</small>授予沙特 2023 年世俱杯冠军。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是对旧观念的新诠释，即肮脏的政权利用体育来炫耀其政治模式，就像墨索里尼在 1934 年世界杯上所做的那样，希特勒在 1936 年奥运会上所做的那样。东德和苏联都有国家支持的兴奋剂20世纪70年代和80年代的节目。最近，中国在去年主办冬季奥运会时被指责进行体育洗牌，俄罗斯在 2018 年举办足球世界杯时也被指责。卡塔尔在 2022 年也面临着大量反击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如今，批评者指出沙特阿拉伯缺乏民主自由并压制妇女和同性恋权利。 2018 年，直言不讳的记者贾迈勒·卡舒吉 (Jamal Khashoggi) 在沙特驻伊斯坦布尔领事馆惨遭谋杀，人们并没有忘记沙特王国在<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/09/can-yemen-hold-together">也门血腥战争</a>中所扮演的核心角色。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">岛屿半岛</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Yet Saudi Arabia&#39;s autocratic politics will probably not prevent it from taking a growing role in global sports. Qualification for the Champions League has gone a long way to stilling criticism of Saudi investment in Newcastle United. President Joe Biden, having described the kingdom as a “pariah” in 2019, is now keen to repair America&#39;s alliance. But its reputation may make deals more fiddly. The proposed <small>pga</small> Tour- <small>liv</small> golf merger has created a stink and is being assessed by the <small>us</small> Justice Department to see if it violates antitrust law.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>pga</small> Tour executives were hauled before a Senate committee last month. Senator Richard Blumenthal complained that a gagging clause in the deal, which could stop players from badmouthing Saudi Arabia, is “about as broad a non-disparagement clause as I have ever seen”. The deal&#39;s backers at the <small>pga</small> Tour are doubtless keen to suggest the Saudis will have a backseat role: probably a very different vision from that of <small>mbs</small> , in which the Saudis are in control and no longer just the “dumb money”. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But even if some deals do not transform the country in the way <small>mbs</small> hopes, Saudi Arabia is part of a broader shift that is changing global sports. The surge in capital from the kingdom is part of the rise of a new cohort of sovereign and private-equity funds that are investing in sports at scale. Bloomberg reported that private-equity firms spent $51bn on sports transactions in 2021, nearly double the total of 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ownership rules are being liberalised as clubs and tournaments seek new sources of capital to stay competitive. American sports leagues are the world&#39;s best at raking in money (see chart 1). Since 2019, several big American leagues have relaxed their rules to allow minority investments by institutional investors. In July Qatar&#39;s investment authority reached a deal to buy 5% of the parent company of the Washington Wizards, an American basketball team. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Digital disruption has also finally reached live sports, which had been one of the last bastions of traditional television (see chart 2). Increasingly viewers who have “cut the cord” on television instead watch sports through streaming services which offer live games but also on-demand highlights, analysis and other digital add-ons. This digital shift is being accompanied by unexpected swirls and shifts in audiences. For example, Formula 1, once notable for having little presence in the United States, is now gaining some traction there, boosted by tie-ups with Netflix.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi&#39;s sports splurge partly reflects the dynamics within the kingdom: a new flood of petrodollars; <small>mbs</small> ’s ambition to create a more socially liberal society and to restore his tarnished reputation in the West. But the moves also reflect a sense that there is a new window of opportunity in global sports: to grab bigger and newer audiences, to create different kinds of events and tournaments and to reinvent old ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The latest annual report from <small>pif</small> , released this week, includes the announcement of a sports-specific investment vehicle, hinting at broader future plans. Mr Benzema and Mr Ronaldo are likely to be hitting the back of the net come the autumn. The kingdom itself has plenty of other goals of its own. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 10 Aug 2023 09:43:51 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /内容/mgpccuuoqi169phpnfcir925l82ddj1u</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/10/saudi-arabia-is-spending-a-fortune-on-sport </item><item><title><![CDATA[Could America’s economy escape recession?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0"><style data-emotion="css qts40t">.css-qts40t img{display:block;}.css-qts40t .edweubf2{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="山姆大叔驾驶的汽车突然转向以避开路上的岩石" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBD010.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><style data-emotion="css 6pzdis">.css-6pzdis{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.edweubf0+.css-6pzdis{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Pete Ryan</span></figcaption></figure></section>空]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 08:54:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /内容/a9d4lsdn2nop513pvmea6lvj87dvhrj6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/20/could-americas-economy-escape-recession </item><item><title><![CDATA[The meticulous, ruthless preparations for a second Trump term]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20The%20presidency-in-waiting-931f3285de6998a88a31ca8ded538379.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>B</span> <small>ROOKE ROLLINS</small> is sitting at her desk in Fort Worth, Texas, at the back of an anonymous, low-rise building. It looks uncannily like an office in the White House, with its lemony cream wallpaper, dark wood furniture and photographs of the president signing bills as admirers look on. Only one detail jars: the 18th-century rifle leaning against the wall.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The resemblance is not a coincidence. Mrs Rollins worked in the White House under Donald Trump and briefly ran his Domestic Policy Council. She purchased her West Wing furniture when she left. Towards the end of Mr Trump&#39;s first term, she was in charge of putting together a policy agenda for his second one. After Mr Trump lost his bid for re-election in 2020, she set up a think-tank to continue that work, the America First Policy Institute ( <small>AFPI</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AFPI</small> aspires to be an administration-in-waiting. Its staff of 172 includes eight former cabinet secretaries from the Trump administration and 20 other political appointees. “I will leave things ready for the next Republican president,” Mrs Rollins says. Campaign-finance laws prevent her from saying so, but she means Mr Trump.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AFPI</small> is the newest think-tank preparing for a second term for Mr Trump, but it is not the biggest. The Heritage Foundation, which prides itself on having done the preparatory work for Ronald Reagan&#39;s “revolution”, has its own presidential transition project. This is led by Paul Dans, a lawyer who worked in the White House&#39;s Office of Personnel Management during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency. In 1981 copies of a manual for government produced by Heritage were placed on the chairs of each of Reagan&#39;s cabinet members before their first meeting. Heritage is updating that idea, co-ordinating an effort by 350 conservative wonks and former administration officials to write a plan for government in time for the Republican primaries next year. Those who have criticised Mr Trump or his agenda will not be part of it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As well as drafting policies for each department, Mr Dans and his colleagues are building a list of potential recruits to serve in the next Republican administration. He likes to describe the effort as a conservative LinkedIn. Fully staffing an administration requires about 4,000 political appointees, 1,200 of whom must be approved by the Senate. Heritage and its allied think-tanks are vetting the people to fill those jobs now.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Dismiss that which insults</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What would prove disqualifying? “If you kind of have shown yourself to have fought against the Trump administration, or there are issues where you&#39;ve actually been counter to it,” says Mr Dans. “You know where people stand by where they sit, so to speak. Their postings and social media, their allegiances over time can give people a pretty good picture.” Blaming Mr Trump for the ransacking of the Capitol in 2021, or supporting his impeachment in the days that followed, for example, would be enough to keep someone off the list.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thanks to these efforts, the next Trump administration, if there is one, will have fleshed-out plans and the know-how to advance them. That would make it very different from Mr Trump&#39;s first term. “We didn&#39;t have the people because nobody thought we would win,” says Steve Bannon, who managed Mr Trump&#39;s campaign and was an influential figure at the beginning of his presidency. (Mr Trump fired Mr Bannon, but later stopped him being tried for misuse of funds from a non-profit group he headed by pardoning him.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Bannon mentions the National Security Council ( <small>NSC</small> ) as an example of the staffing problems the Trump administration faced. It struggled to come up with half the necessary number of political appointees, he says. They were an odd mixture of people like Michael Anton, a corporate <small>PR</small> man and apocalyptic political commentator, and old foreign-policy hands who turned out to be queasy about Mr Trump&#39;s courting of North Korea&#39;s dictator and his hostility to American allies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What was true of the <small>NSC</small> applies to other agencies, too. “You have got to hit the beach with three or four thousand guys,” Mr Bannon says. Mr Dans agrees. “In Hollywood they like to describe things as &#39;this meets that meets the other&#39;. This is the Manhattan Project meets the Empire State Building meets <small>D</small> -Day.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The initial objective for this invading force is to capture the civil service. One lesson that Mr Trump&#39;s backers drew from his first term is that no policy matters more than control of the bureaucracy, because no policies can be implemented without it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To that end Mr Trump&#39;s commandos will “deconstruct” the administrative state—the 300 or more federal offices that issue and interpret regulations. The philosophical version of this idea is that, over time, as the role of the federal government has grown from fighting wars and running the postal service into the Leviathan it is today, unelected bureaucrats have assumed powers that should belong to Congress. The Twitter version is that the deep-state liberals who thwarted Mr Trump when he was in office and have persecuted him since he left must be vanquished. Either way, Mr Trump&#39;s shock troops will try to wrest power back from the bureaucracy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In practice it is hard to see how government would function without the administrative state. Congress struggles to fulfil basic responsibilities like passing a budget on time. To imagine that the same body could act as, say, the regulator of financial markets is a stretch. That may be the point. The <small>MAGA</small> movement is not libertarian, but in many ways it would like the federal government to do far less than it does now.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The would-be Trump appointees plan to subdue the bureaucracy using Schedule <small>F</small> , shorthand for an executive order issued by Mr Trump in 2020 and rescinded by Joe Biden when he became president. It reflects a view that the federal bureaucracy, whatever its size, should not have any entrenched authority. For the first century of its existence, civil servants were appointed to jobs by the government of the day based on an algorithm of personal contacts and favours owed known as the spoils system. Then in 1881 a deranged office-seeker assassinated the president, spurring the passage of the Pendleton Act, which created a class of professional bureaucrats who stayed in their posts even as the presidency changed hands. Since the 1940s, when Franklin Roosevelt was expanding the government, it has been hard to fire federal bureaucrats, <small>AFPI</small> complains.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many political appointees in the Trump administration believe that a minority of civil servants used their protected status to thwart or undermine the president&#39;s wishes. James Sherk, a policy adviser in the Trump White House who is now at <small>AFPI</small> , cites two cases on which lawyers in various government departments reportedly refused to work: one against Yale University for allegedly discriminating against Asian-Americans, and one aimed at protecting nurses from having to perform abortions. Schedule <small>F</small> would empower Mr Trump&#39;s appointees to remove perceived obstructionists at will.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Schedule <small>F</small> is now, I think, Republican doctrine,” says Russell Vought, who ran the Office of Management and Budget under Mr Trump. “I don&#39;t know how a Republican gets elected and doesn&#39;t do that.” It would also be straightforward to enact: Mr Trump could just reissue his old executive order. Again, there is a reasonable version of this idea, in which a small number of recalcitrant civil servants lose their jobs, and a campaign version, where Schedule <small>F</small> becomes the instrument of Mr Trump&#39;s righteous purge of Washington.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> To be with those I like is enough</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The combined effect of appointing only loyalists and cowing the bureaucracy would be both to remove constraints on Mr Trump and to ensure his wishes are acted on more often. In his first term Mr Trump&#39;s opponents took some comfort from the idea that not all the people around him were true believers, and were willing to stall his most alarming ideas. The <i>New York Times</i> ran an anonymous piece by a political appointee who claimed there was an internal resistance within the administration that acted as a check on presidential power. In a second Trump term, there will not be any “grown-ups in the room”, as Mr Trump&#39;s detractors called such people. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Silhouette of a Donald Trump statue being handed a spear" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ben Hickey</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Once a second Trump administration had bent the bureaucracy to its will, what policies would it pursue? The department-by-department plans being drawn up at <small>AFPI</small> , Heritage and elsewhere give some guidance. They involve some predictable fusillades in the culture wars, such as completing a wall along the border with Mexico and directing all federal officials to consider only people&#39;s biological sex, rather than “self-identified” gender. But some of the putative policy agenda is both more sweeping in scope and more of a break with past Republican orthodoxy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One such area is the economy. The new right is enthusiastic about the kind of industrial policy the Biden administration has pursued. “No one in Ohio…cares that the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial board doesn&#39;t like the <small>CHIPS</small> bill on free-market economic grounds,” JD Vance, a senator, recently told a gathering at American Compass, a think-tank, referring to a law subsidising semiconductor factories. In some cases Mr Trump&#39;s supporters would go further: Mr Vance advocates taxing companies that shift work offshore.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main partisan disagreement over industrial policy is no longer whether to have one at all, but over the Democrats&#39; habit of smuggling diversity requirements and environmental goals into it. As the Republicans have become a more working-class party than the Democrats, people like Mr Vance have tried to synthesise a <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/13/the-american-left-and-right-loathe-each-other-and-agree-on-a-lot">new Republican position</a> that is both pro-labour and hostile to union leaders. His advocacy of subsidies for industry without “the woke bullshit” is probably more popular than the Biden administration&#39;s approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That enthusiasm for an active state coexists with a more conventional Republican programme of lowering taxes, coupled with a belief that well-intentioned efforts to cut poverty usually backfire. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks of making permanent the tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, some of which are due to expire in 2025. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy wonks also advocate attaching work requirements to Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) and other government benefits. In Arkansas, the only state to have implemented work requirements for Medicaid, a quarter of those enrolled in the programme lost their health insurance and there was no noticeable increase in employment. The reforms would at least save some money, but not enough to have much impact on the federal deficit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Expensive industrial policy, lower taxes and only small reductions in benefits—in other words, less revenue and more spending—would not balance the books, much less trim government debts or refill the funds that pay for Medicare (subsidised health insurance for the disabled and the old) and Social Security (the state pension), which are due to run dry in the early 2030s. On past evidence the bond market is likely to continue to finance the growing gap between the government&#39;s income and expenditure. Investors might become nervous, however, if the Federal Reserve&#39;s independence were in question. Some Trumpists think it should be, since they do not like to cede so much power to unelected bureaucrats. That is a minority view, Mr Vought concedes, but could gain ground: “I guarantee that if that debate was in front of President Trump, that he wouldn&#39;t just throw you out of the Oval Office.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another area in which a second Trump term could bend the arc of history is in environmental policy. In his first term emissions of greenhouse gases kept falling, even though he reversed many of Barack Obama&#39;s policies to slow climate change. Investors assumed that government policy would soon revert to a greener norm and coal-fired power stations have lifespans of several decades, so the administration&#39;s fondness for them was not enough to get new ones built. In this respect, too, a second Trump administration would be more methodical and better organised.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Whatever satisfies the soul is truth</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about ending “the war on fossil fuels” and makes untethered assumptions about how much bigger the economy would be without it. ( <small>AFPI</small> estimates that America&#39;s <small>gdp</small> will be 6% smaller by the end of this decade than it would have been without the Obama administration&#39;s emissions-reductions targets.) The argument is presented in both pragmatic and moral terms. Why should American oil stay in the ground while Saudi oil flows? And why should the use of fuels which can bring so much prosperity to so many be circumscribed? Never mind that Mr Biden&#39;s administration has granted more permits to drill than Mr Trump&#39;s did, that America is the world&#39;s largest producer of oil or that it is in the national interest to limit global warming.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America Firsters like oil, gas and coal and the relatively well-paid, manly jobs for high-school graduates they bring. They are also opposed to the green transition, which they see as unnecessary government meddling that raises energy prices for ordinary Americans. Both Kevin Roberts, who runs Heritage, and Mrs Rollins, who started <small>AFPI</small> , used to be senior figures at the Texas Public Policy Foundation ( <small>TPPF</small> ), a think-tank which opposes the development of wind farms and solar plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Over a quarter of Texas&#39;s electricity is generated by renewables, and <small>TPPF</small> has helped to propagate the idea that this makes the state&#39;s power grid unstable. Investors in renewables say Texas&#39;s electricity regulator has become hostile to new projects. <small>TPPF</small> , meanwhile, is battling renewables as far afield as New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where it has initiated a lawsuit against a big offshore wind farm on behalf of fishermen. If the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department were run by people who shared these instincts, investors in renewables would face the same sort of political risks as owners of coal plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A third area which is likely to see great upheaval if Mr Trump becomes president again is foreign policy. Among America First types, there is deep disagreement about Ukraine. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about facing the threat from Russia. Yet Mr Bannon says, “I don&#39;t give a shit about Ukraine—what I give a shit about is the invasion of America&#39;s southern border.” Mr Vought makes the same point in a more wonkish way: “Ukraine is being subsidised by our taxpayers to fight and not make strategic calculations that they would otherwise make if we weren&#39;t subsidising it. And it&#39;s not in our interest to subsidise that conflict.” Mr Trump himself says he would end the war. He may not be able to do that. But Ukraine and its other allies ought to take seriously the possibility that America may no longer be with them in 18 months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Policy towards China is less contested. The Trump administration was more confrontational towards China than any of its predecessors. The Biden administration has continued in the same vein, albeit with less inflammatory rhetoric and more considered policies. “The difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration on protectionism is that the Biden administration is competent,” says Dan Drezner of Tufts University. A second Trump term would be more likely to build on what the Biden team have done rather than, say, loosening export controls. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Silhouette of a laurel wreath being lowered onto a Donald Trump statue" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD003.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ben Hickey</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Heritage&#39;s plan for 2025 foresees an immediate ban on TikTok and also on Confucius Institutes. American pension funds would be encouraged to divest from “problematic” Chinese entities. The government should be prepared “to employ punitive policy measures” to prevent American investment in sensitive areas in China and Chinese investment in America. American companies considering large-scale investments in anything deemed critical would have to submit information about counterparties and anticipated use of funds to the <small>US</small> government before investing, “under a presumption of denial”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whether Mr Trump would authorise the use of force if China were to invade Taiwan is hard to say. Some who worked in his administration note that whenever they were about to adopt tougher policies on China, the bosses of big American firms would call the White House and tell him that the move would alarm financial markets and he would back down. The same dynamic may apply in a second term. In a memoir of his time as Mr Trump&#39;s national security adviser, John Bolton suggests the former president was not really committed to Taiwan&#39;s security. Others claim he would be “stronger” than Mr Biden.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other allies could expect the same peremptory treatment as in Mr Trump&#39;s first term. He reportedly told aides he wanted to leave <small>nato</small> . Even <small>AFPI</small> , which on foreign policy is closer to the old Republican orthodoxy, thinks that military support should be withdrawn from countries that do not spend at least 2% of <small>GDP</small> on defence, a level that neither Japan nor most countries in <small>nato</small> meet. The modern America First movement, like its namesake during the second world war, contains some true isolationists. But it also contains an influential clutch of people like Elbridge Colby, who served in the Department of Defence and believes in a muscular foreign policy. He thinks China is such a threat that America should pull back from its defence commitments in Europe and the Middle East to concentrate on the Pacific.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> No matter how well-laid the plans for a second Trump term, nor how thoroughly vetted the people carrying them out, Mr Trump would still be in charge, which means there is a limit to how methodical it could be. But it would be altogether more formidable than the version of 2017-21. As for the candidate himself, he is aware of the plans being made on his behalf but has never been excited by the details of public policy. For the professional wonks in the movement, that is an opportunity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “ <i>The Economist</i> doesn&#39;t think that populists can govern, right?” asks Mr Vought. “We believe we&#39;re trying to be an answer to that viewpoint. So we&#39;re trying to look systemically: how does someone who has an American First perspective, a populist perspective, govern credibly and effectively? Because they know the inner workings of government so well.” The winner of next year&#39;s presidential election will be sworn in in 18 months. The institutions of the new right expect it to be Mr Trump, and this time they will be prepared. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.

class="article-text"> <span>O</span> <small>n the outskirts</small> of Niamey, the capital of Niger, it looks as if the countryside has moved to the city. Clusters of dome-like wooden huts have popped up. Cows and goats are tethered in the shade. Waves of rural folk have arrived, largely because of climate change.</p><p class="article-text"> “The seasons are not good like they used to be. It is hotter and the rains often fail,” says Ganso Seyni Ali, the chief of a group of herders from rural Niger. He has moved permanently to the city with half of his home village—over 150 families.</p><p class="article-text"> To a visitor from a rich country, their settlement looks grim. They have no right to the land they occupy and are periodically evicted. But the city is safer than the countryside, where herders and farmers clashed constantly over dwindling pasture and water. Mr Ali describes deadly battles fought with guns, arrows and machetes. In the city such strife is rare, in part because life is less desperate.</p><p class="article-text"> Mr Ali&#39;s group have swiftly adapted to their new environment. They take their cows outside the city to graze, and find extra forage by knocking on doors to ask for vegetable scraps. They find it easier to sell milk, with so many customers close by. Mr Ali offers your correspondents a steaming bowlful, fresh from the udder.</p><p class="article-text"> Many of his group have also found jobs. “It&#39;s better here. There&#39;s work,” says Ali Soumana, an ex-herder who now makes bricks. Back in the village he did not have enough to eat; now he does.</p><p class="article-text"> When flames approach and you don&#39;t have a fire extinguisher, you move. By the same token, as parts of the Earth grow less habitable, people will migrate. The rich will find it easier to adapt to higher temperatures or rising sea levels, since they can afford air-conditioning and flood defences. The poor have fewer options.</p><p class="article-text"> How many will move because of climate change is impossible to say. In “Nomad Century”, a book published last year, Gaia Vince wrote that if the world grew 4°C hotter by 2100 (an apocalyptic scenario), regions currently inhabited by 3.5bn people would become uninhabitable. Extreme forecasts like this are often seized on for political reasons. Green groups have cited the threat of “billions” of climate refugees to lend urgency to their calls to curb emissions. Nativists in rich countries use imagined hordes of climate migrants to justify ever stricter policing of borders.</p><p class="article-text"> Cooler thinking is required. More plausible numbers come from a modelling exercise by the World Bank known as Groundswell, the findings of which were first published in 2018 and updated in 2021. It uses a “gravity model” to simulate how changes to things like water availability, agriculture and sea level might push people out of some areas and into others. It predicts that by 2050 between 44m and 216m people in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, Latin America and the Pacific islands could be on the move within their own countries (see chart). </p><div class="ds-image ai2html-chart ds-image__left"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-box" class="ai2html svelte-16z6vcq"><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1" class="g-artboard svelte-16z6vcq"><img id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1-img" class="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1-img g-aiImg svelte-16z6vcq" alt src="/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/images/20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_1.png"><div id="legend-text" class="g-content-layer g-aiAbs g-aiPointText svelte-16z6vcq"><p class="g-pstyle2 svelte-16z6vcq"> Pessimistic‡</p><p class="g-pstyle3 svelte-16z6vcq"> Max estimate </p></div></div><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_2" class="g-artboard svelte-16z6vcq"><img id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_2-img" class="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_2-img g-aiImg svelte-16z6vcq" alt src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=="><div id="legend-text" class="g-content-layer g-aiAbs g-aiPointText svelte-16z6vcq"><p class="g-pstyle2 svelte-16z6vcq"> Pessimistic‡</p><p class="g-pstyle3 svelte-16z6vcq"> Max estimate </p></div></div><div id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_3" class="g-artboard svelte-16z6vcq"><img id="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_3-img" class="g-20230624_WOC549_C-Artboard_3-img g-aiImg svelte-16z6vcq" alt src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=="><div id="legend-text" class="g-content-layer g-aiAbs g-aiPointText svelte-16z6vcq"><p class="g-pstyle3 svelte-16z6vcq"> Pessimistic‡</p><p class="g-pstyle4 svelte-16z6vcq"> Max estimate</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p class="article-text"> Groundswell looks only at domestic migration, rather than the cross-border sort, because most climate migrants will be too poor to travel far (especially if droughts or floods have wiped out their assets). It excludes rich countries and small island states. Its analysis is hostage to unpredictable factors, such as how much governments spend on flood defences. Its gloomier scenarios rest on implausibly pessimistic assumptions about global emissions of greenhouse gases. But it gives a sense of the daunting scale of the problem: there are roughly 100m displaced people in the world today, mostly owing to war, so Groundswell&#39;s higher estimate of 216m additional climate migrants would constitute a tripling.</p><p class="article-text"> Climate-induced migration will often be traumatic. Yet it will also be an essential tool for adapting to a warming planet. And it may have some positive side-effects. If it causes more subsistence farmers to move to cities, they will probably find better work, health care and schools. They may also start having smaller families.</p><p class="article-text"> Niger, where climate change is already spurring large-scale migration, gives a sense of how things might unfold. More than nine in ten people have noticed changes in the environment, such as more frequent droughts, floods or soil degradation, finds a survey by the International Organisation for Migration. Three-quarters said climate change had made it harder to grow food or raise livestock. Half said that a member of their family had been forced to move because of the weather. </p><div class="map svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-1b9yre3"><p><svelte-scroller-outer class="svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background-container class="background-container svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"><div class="main svelte-9t3n8j"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class></div></div></div></div></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-foreground class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"><section class="svelte-1b9yre3"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"> Almost all of Niger&#39;s population live in the south; to the north is desert, which covers 80% of the country</div></section><section class="svelte-1b9yre3"><div class="svelte-1b9yre3"> Climate change has dramatically affected the country&#39;s rainfall.

An increase of one standard deviation in local temperature raises the risk of intergroup conflict by 11%, finds a study by Marshall Burke of Stanford University and others. Niger is racked by insurgency. “Terrorism and crime are closely linked with climate change,” its president, Mohamed Bazoum, tells <i>The Economist</i> .</p><p class="article-text"> When rural migrants move to urban areas, their lives tend to improve. Throughout the developing world, poverty is less common in cities. Urban wages are higher and depend less on the weather.</p><p class="article-text"> Climate change may jolt some into making a decision (to migrate) that would long have been in their interest anyway. A study in Kenya in 2020 found that rural people underestimate how high wages are in the capital, and that this makes them less likely to move. Another study looked at the aftermath of a volcanic eruption on an Icelandic island. Comparing the children of families whose homes were destroyed by lava with those that weren&#39;t, it found that being forced to move dramatically improved their education and lifetime earnings. This is not an argument for razing homes; but it suggests people would benefit from moving more than they do.</p><p class="article-text"> Those who move to the city are more likely to send their children to school, because schools are easier to get to and urban jobs require more book-learning. Back home, almost no children from his village attended classes, says Mr Ali. In Niamey that figure has risen to 30% or so, he reckons. That may be low, but it is progress. In Niger as a whole, urban children are twice as likely to attend primary school as their rural peers, and nearly four times as likely to attend secondary school. </p><div class="ytube svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-nyddqh"><div class="you__tube svelte-nyddqh"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pNNKexmjVAE/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Youtube 视频：" class="svelte-hw9fhp"><h3 class="svelte-nyddqh"></h3></div></div></div><p class="article-text"> Access to health care is usually better in cities, too. Abdul Moumouni Hassone, a farmer who moved to Niamey five years ago, recalls the time back in his village when his younger brother was feverish with malaria. Mr Hassone loaded him into a donkey cart and raced to the nearest clinic, 40km away. It took three hours. “He died as we arrived,” he sighs. In the city, by contrast, “It&#39;s easy to get medicine. There&#39;s a pharmacy on every corner.”</p><p class="article-text"> By accelerating urbanisation, climate change could hasten cultural change, too. Niger&#39;s population is still more than 80% rural. Villages can be stifling places, where old men enforce rigid traditions that, among other things, treat women abominably. In the hurly-burly of a city, those rules weaken. Old men may lament the shift to immodest dress and individualism. “In a village, when we make a decision, everyone follows it. Here [in the city], it&#39;s everyone for himself,” sighs Mr Hassone, who is 66. Yet he admits that his children prefer urban life, because there is more to do (and, whisper it, more freedom). “When we visit our village, they don&#39;t want to stay there even two days.”</p><p class="article-text"> The biggest change concerns fertility. In sub-Saharan Africa rural women each have on average 5.8 babies whereas urban ones have just 3.9. A study by George Martine, a Canadian demographer, and others found that urbanisation plays a big role in reducing family sizes. So climate migration could reduce population growth in some of the places where it is fastest.</p><p class="article-text"> Mr Hassone says that in his village a typical woman would have a dozen children, of whom perhaps nine would survive. He still thinks big families are desirable, but he can see how norms are shifting, as each child is no longer seen as an extra pair of hands to help in the fields, but as an extra mouth to feed, with added school fees. Some women who move to the city have “just two or three [babies], and then they are done!” he laments. Yet he concedes that, unlike rural children, all the urban ones will probably survive.</p><p class="article-text"> Whereas some climate migrants flee drought, others will be displaced by rising waters. In 2018 Daniel Lincke and Jochen Hinkel, two academics in Germany, used cost-benefit analyses to calculate that only 13% of the world&#39;s coastlines would be worth defending under their most pessimistic scenario, mostly in wealthy and densely populated parts of Europe, East Asia and the eastern United States. Conversely, 65% of coastline was not worth protecting under any scenario.</p><p class="article-text"> People will have to move out of flood zones. Some rich countries have property buy-out schemes to encourage this, but so far these have been modest in scale. Roughly 40,000 American families have taken buy-outs in the past 30 years, for example. Occasionally, a scheme may involve moving a whole community. A decade ago America spent $48m to move two dozen families from a rapidly disappearing sandbar in Louisiana to a new site 60km away.</p><p class="article-text"> That model will be hard to replicate, however. People tend to move as individuals or families, not as villages. And poor countries must adapt to rising waters on much tighter budgets. Consider Bangladesh. Most of this South Asian country of 170m is flood plain: flat as a billiard table. Its people have adapted shrewdly to violent weather. Whereas a cyclone in 1970 killed over 300,000, now early-warning systems, typhoon shelters and embankments keep the annual death toll from floods and storm surges to a few dozen. Yet the elements still cause havoc. In the south, cyclones flatten houses. In the north, floods gnaw away at friable river banks. A village can disappear in days. </p><div class="map svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-1jgib5d"><p><svelte-scroller-outer class="svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background-container class="background-container svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="main svelte-1133alf"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class></div></div></div></div></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-foreground class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> Bangladesh&#39;s population is spread across the country; around 22m people live in or near Dhaka, the capital.</div></section><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> Over the past two decades <span>floods</span> have been concentrated in the north-east, as satellite data show.</div></section><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> The Groundswell report predicts that climate change will push between 6.8m and 19.9m Bangladeshis to migrate internally by 2050, or 3.8-11.3% of the projected population.</div></section><section class="svelte-1jgib5d"><div class="svelte-1jgib5d"> Many will leave the rice paddies of the north-east and the southern river delta.

More insidious is when a river gobbles up a family&#39;s land. They save themselves from drowning by moving. They often remain in the countryside because the land is exceptionally fertile, and rural social services are surprisingly good in Bangladesh thanks to a legion of NGOs. But they have lost their assets, and often end up working other people&#39;s land.</p><p class="article-text"> Amirul Islam lost his home three times. He weeps at the memory. “When my two children ask me where my grandfather&#39;s house is, I cannot answer. Our house is now in the middle of the river,” he says. He moved to Chattogram, a port city, with seven relatives, and found work in a garment factory. He earns more than he did in the village, although he misses his old life.</p><p class="article-text"> The government&#39;s national strategy for climate displacement seeks to warn people of risks, curb settlement in vulnerable areas and help the displaced earn a living. Previous efforts did not always work well, however: many people were sent with little consultation to far-flung places with few jobs. Despite being given new houses and plots to farm, many chose not to stay. “We would go back a few years later and find that they had sold the land and ended up landless again,” says Tasneem Siddiqui of the University of Dhaka. Many simply pocketed the money and moved to cities. They may have a better idea of their own interests than any planner. </p><figure class="svelte-1whsw9v text-col-image ds-container"><img src="/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1424/20230701_FBP002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/360/20230701_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/384/20230701_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/480/20230701_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/600/20230701_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/834/20230701_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/960/20230701_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1096/20230701_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1280/20230701_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration/processed-images/1424/20230701_FBP002.jpg 1424w" alt class="svelte-8q80dm"><figcaption class="svelte-xo6s0l credit-only"><p class="credit"> image: Zabed Hasnain Chowdhury/ZUMA/Eyevine</p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-text"> Lots of climate migrants would like to move to the rich world. Some prosperous places enable this, albeit in a strictly controlled fashion. Shahed Hossain&#39;s home in Bangladesh was destroyed by a flood. He moved to a city, worked in a factory, saved and borrowed and eventually managed to buy a plane ticket to the United Arab Emirates (which lets in far more unskilled migrants than any Western country). As a labourer there he makes $400 a month—four times what he earned in Bangladesh. He has repaid his debts, and can now afford to send his children to university.</p><p class="article-text"> But most rich countries are far less open to migrants, many of whom take extraordinary risks to get to them nonetheless. Sylla Alseny, a farmer from Guinea, left home because his crops were ravaged by insects. (He blames climate change.) He headed for Europe overland. (Flying would have been cheaper, but he had no visa.) In Algeria his traffickers robbed him at knifepoint. In Tunisia police deported him, after gang-raping a female migrant in his group. He never made it to Europe.</p><p class="article-text"> Some countries are contemplating a warmer welcome for climate migrants. One, Argentina, has created a new visa for those fleeing climate-related disasters. (It has barely been used, perhaps because Argentina is far from anywhere people are fleeing.) A White House report in 2021 said some of those displaced by climate change “may” qualify as refugees. That is a tricky category to define, however, and the world&#39;s asylum systems are dysfunctional.</p><p class="article-text"> In the meantime, most climate migrants will have to stay close to home. Few of the most vulnerable places are prepared for a surge of them. In north Africa, whose inhabitants cluster by the coast, Groundswell predicts that 4.5m-13m people (2-6% of the population) will be displaced by climate change by 2050. </p><div class="map svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-1c988d1"><p><svelte-scroller-outer class="svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background-container class="background-container svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="main svelte-9t3n8j"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class></div></div></div></div></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-foreground class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"><section class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"> In Egypt most people live along the Mediterranean coast or the Nile.</div></section><section class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"> By 2050, rising seas mean that much of the north coast, especially around the city of Alexandria, will be below the level at which <span>floods</span> can be expected at least once a year.</div></section><section class="svelte-1c988d1"><div class="svelte-1c988d1"> Groundswell predicts that many people will leave low-lying coastal areas and head for Cairo. </div></section></div></svelte-scroller-foreground></svelte-scroller-outer></p></div></div><p class="article-text"> Many Egyptian farmers will see their fields dry out, too. Almost all Egypt&#39;s water comes from the Nile. Yet Egypt&#39;s government encourages waste by providing water free of charge to farmers and cheaply to households. Farmers flood their crops, rather than using drip irrigation. As a result, pipes often run dry.</p><p class="article-text"> This happened last year to Romany Sami, a 27-year-old farmer. He moved to Cairo and found a job as an electrician. But to afford a flat big enough for his family, he would have had to commute two or three hours each way through the city&#39;s awful traffic. Instead he shared a cramped space with 12 other labourers. It was miserable, so eventually he went back to his farm, where there is water again—for now.</p><p class="article-text"> Egypt&#39;s urbanisation rate, at 43%, has barely changed since the 1970s. At some point it will have to rise again; it makes no sense for half the swelling population of a desiccating country to live in the countryside. Yet the government has done little to make cities more welcoming. Fuel subsidies promote congestion. Red tape and rent controls make housing hard to find. The government should be making cities more livable. Instead, it is building a grandiose new capital with ornamental lakes 50km from Cairo. That provides fat contracts for military-backed firms, but few Egyptians can afford to live there.</p><p class="article-text"> Amazingly, many governments discourage domestic mobility. Roughly half have policies to reduce rural-urban migration, according to the <small>UN</small> . China&#39;s household-registration system bars rural folk from many public services in big cities, forcing millions of domestic migrants to leave their children in awful village schools. A huge rural job-guarantee scheme in India in effect pays the poor to remain in their home states. Similar schemes reduce mobility in Ethiopia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Discouraging free movement makes societies less dynamic under any circumstances. It also makes it harder for them to adapt to climate change.</p><p class="article-text"> Policies aimed at the world&#39;s estimated 475m smallholder farms tend to focus on helping them stay where they are by adopting more climate-resilient farming techniques. That can be useful. But many of these small farms will eventually become unsustainable because of climate change. Many farmers will have to give up farming, find other jobs and rely on bigger, more capital-intensive farms for food.</p><p class="article-text"> Rather than trying to prevent the inevitable, Sam Huckstep and Michael Clemens of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington, suggest that governments should subsidise rural-urban transport, teach rural folk how much urban jobs pay and help them find work when they arrive. They should also make state benefits portable, so that migrants do not lose them when they move.</p><p class="article-text"> The challenges of preparing for climate migration, though only a subset of the challenges of preparing for climate change itself, are immense. New arrivals will need physical infrastructure, from housing to transport, and the human capital to help them adapt, especially education, health care and job training.</p><p class="article-text"> All this may seem daunting. Yet if one thinks of climate mobility “as a process that occurs over the next hundred years, it can become a lot less scary,” says AR Siders of the University of Delaware. “One hundred years from now things will look very, very different…And so resisting the idea of change—it&#39;s sort of nonsensical.” <span>■</span></p><p class="article-print"> This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Out of the frying pan&quot;</p><p class="article-sources"> Sources: WorldPop and Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Columbia University; Groundswell Spatial Population and Migration Projections; USGS Earlywarning; Floodbase; Climate Central;<i>经济学家</i></p><div class="related-content svelte-vmm051"><div class="wrapper svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tiles svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tile main svelte-13yxci9"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/30/why-affirmative-action-in-american-universities-had-to-go" class="svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDP504.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></a><p class="svelte-13yxci9"> And why what comes after could be better </p></div><div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDP503.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDD003.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_LDP502.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 10:15:10 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/vuu9tabaahi7u9d43ebabgk64hmkh5gr</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/07/01/the-surprising-upside-of-climate-migration </item><item><title><![CDATA[War is reshaping the Ukrainian state—for the better]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Governing%20Ukraine-738896fd61e4d7fa565e9906c0b35d33.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们最近对<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的更多报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>W</span> <small>HEN RUSSIAN</small> tanks began bearing down on Kyiv, Ukraine&#39;s capital, in February of last year, Mykhailo Fedorov was overseeing improvements to an app that provides Ukrainians with easy access to government services. At the time the app focused on fairly conventional tasks: filing tax returns, obtaining business permits, claiming benefits and so on. But the 32-year-old Mr Fedorov and his colleagues quickly added extra features. Now <small>DIIA</small> (the Ukrainian for “action” and also an acronym for “the State and Me”) allows patriots to donate to the war effort, struggling businesses to apply for state support and ordinary citizens to <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/22/how-a-chatbot-has-turned-ukrainian-civilians-into-digital-resistance-fighters">report Russian troop movements</a> . And with the war making it hard for people to visit government offices, the ability to conduct official business online has become a godsend for many.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When Volodymyr Zelensky became Ukraine&#39;s president in 2019, he promised to modernise a state that until then had been a byword for bureaucracy and corruption. <small>DiIa</small> , launched in 2020, was the centrepiece of this effort. But what began as a means to mollify exasperated voters quickly became part of Ukraine&#39;s struggle for survival. To beat back the Russian onslaught and keep the government functioning, the state has had no choice but to become vastly more nimble and effective.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Wreckage and resolve</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The young, tech-savvy Ukrainians leading this overhaul see it not just as a necessity, but also as an opportunity. “We call it Ukraine 2.0. We all loved Ukraine as we knew it, but there were a lot of things in it which we don&#39;t want to bring into a new one. We got a unique chance to build a new country,” says Oleksandr Kamyshin, a 38-year-old former manager of a venture-capital fund who is now restructuring Ukraine&#39;s arms industry.  “The full-scale Russian invasion not only brought the horrors of war to millions of Ukrainians. February 24th 2022 was also an occasion for Ukraine to rethink itself,” echoes <i>Ukrainska Pravda</i> , an online newspaper.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <b>Read more of our package of articles on rebuilding Ukraine:</b></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Like Mr Fedorov, the Ukrainian state was born in 1991. A vestige of the Soviet Union, it was seen by many Ukrainians as more of a nuisance than a benefit. Corruption was endemic, from the bribes demanded by traffic cops to the kickbacks needed to secure government contracts. The public put far more faith in civil society than in official institutions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It was civil society, naturally enough, that spearheaded the campaign to change all this. It led the Maidan uprising of 2013-14 (pictured), a protest movement which brought about the fall of Viktor Yanukovych, the grasping pro-Russian president of the day. The new government, with the help of Western aid agencies, set up a series of institutions to battle corruption, including an independent investigation bureau, dedicated prosecutors and a special court. Mr Zelensky has since strengthened this system by installing a new council composed partly of retired American and European judges to regulate judicial conduct. The details of most public procurement are now made public, to make crooked transactions easier to spot. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Anti-government demonstrators clash with riot police in central Kiev on February 18th 2014." width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP004.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">They are probably in government now</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These new rules and institutions have not eliminated corruption, but they have made it a far riskier undertaking, rather than the accepted norm.

Not only had the popular campaign for good government caused the downfall of a pro-Russian regime; it was also undermining Mr Putin&#39;s favoured technique for suborning Ukrainian politicians and, worse, it was creating an alarming example of successful reform that might inspire his own citizens. In a speech laying out Russia&#39;s case for war days before the invasion, Mr Putin included among Ukraine&#39;s supposed crimes the creation of the new units to fight corruption. It was not just a passing reference: he listed each agency individually, and denounced them all as tools of America. “Not every politician in Ukraine could name all these institutions. This was a real tribute to our work,” says Mr Shabunin. “Putin realised that if he does not interfere now, these reforms would lead Ukraine into the Western world.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But far from halting the overhaul of the Ukrainian state, Mr Putin&#39;s invasion has accelerated it. The state-owned railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, is a good example. In August 2021, just months before the invasion, it was put in the hands of Mr Kamyshin, who has not only a Cossack-style semi-shaved hairdo, but also a degree from <small>INSEAD</small> , a French business school. At the time, he says, Ukrzaliznytsia was a feeding trough for corrupt officials, politicians and shady intermediaries, who sold it second-rate supplies at inflated prices.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Kamyshin quickly cleared out the middlemen. But to keep the trains running throughout the war, despite relentless shelling and blackouts, he also had to empower not just thrusting young managers but also the grizzled engineers who know the tracks inside out. As a result, Ukrzaliznytsia has kept essential cargo moving, be it weapons, troops, humanitarian aid or refugees. It even ferried Joe Biden, America&#39;s president, across the country on a visit in February, earning its special service the sobriquet “Rail Force One”. All this has made Ukrzaliznytsia a popular brand among young Ukrainians. In November it opened its first merchandise shop in Kyiv.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In March Mr Kamyshin became the minister in charge of the defence industry, another pit of inefficiency and graft. State-owned factories produced more shells in the first month after his appointment than they had done in the entire previous year. Mr Fedorov, now a deputy prime minister, has found a different way to speed up military procurement, <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/27/how-crowdfunding-is-shaping-the-war-in-ukraine">crowdfunding</a> the purchase of around 4,000 drones and the training of 10,000 people to use them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Fedorov has also turned his hand to streamlining the operations of the armed forces. (In his trainers, sweatshirt and jeans, wielding only a sticker-spattered laptop, he has probably done more damage to Mr Putin&#39;s war machine than most men in uniform.) He has helped create software to pool information from assorted drones, sensors and cameras to provide a comprehensive picture of the battlefield, which can be viewed in real time by everyone from generals to foot soldiers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Appropriately enough for a system enabling quicker, less hierarchical decision-making, the software in question was developed not at a secret military research institute on orders from on high; instead, shortly before the war began, the army assembled a team of volunteer programmers and activists; they have applied themselves to problems as they have arisen. Mr Fedorov organises hackathons to come up with solutions to specific programming conundrums. “There is a fundamental change now in how we think, how we make decisions and what kind of a country we are building,” says Mr Fedorov.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The distaste for rigid hierarchies and the devolution of decision-making are among the defining features of this new approach to administration. Those may sound like boilerplate principles of good government, but they are rare in post-Soviet states. Their adoption by the Ukrainian army helps explain why it has been able to keep Russia&#39;s numerically superior forces at bay. They have also been used to great effect by Mr Kamyshin&#39;s former boss, Oleksandr Kubrakov, the minister of infrastructure, in the mammoth task of distributing all the weapons and supplies donated by Ukraine&#39;s allies. These have to be brought to the front lines without being stockpiled in big warehouses or transported along predictable routes, since both would create easy targets for Russian bombs. He has achieved the near-impossible by dividing deliveries into multitudes of small consignments, the vast majority of which are moved by private hauliers along a plethora of obscure and ever-evolving routes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That hints at another change: treating ordinary Ukrainians as allies of the state, rather than adversaries or subjects. Civil society has also grown stronger during the war. A survey conducted in mid-2022 found that 86% of Ukrainians had volunteered in some way to support the war effort. There has been an eight-fold increase in the number of registered charities since the start of the war. At the same time, there has been a blurring of the lines between activism and government. Mr Shabunin has enlisted in the army. Mustafa Nayyem, a journalist whose social-media posts were a catalyst for the Maidan uprising, served for a time as a deputy to Mr Kubrakov, overseeing the road network, and now heads the agency charged with post-war reconstruction. His brother, a human-rights lawyer, also enlisted, and lost an eye in combat.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The new generation of reformist administrators is well aware that they are not just restructuring ministries and state-owned enterprises, but are laying the foundation of a new country. “It is essential that everybody has a vision and understands what they have fought for, what we are building” says Mr Fedorov. “Without that vision, there can be no success.” </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A man trims a tree in front of a bombarded and burnt block of flats in Irpin, Kyiv region, Ukraine" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Giving shape to a revival</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Success is far from guaranteed, however, even if the war goes well. The forces arrayed against the reinvention of the Ukrainian state are many and powerful. For one thing, not all Ukrainians support the idea. Many in the old elite are losing their meal tickets. The office of the president is preoccupied not just with the war, but also with politics; the nitty-gritty of administration is a much lower priority. And the exigencies of the invasion have put the security services in positions of great authority, often with little oversight.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Corruption remains rife, a clear sign that not all bureaucrats have turned over a new leaf. Last month the most senior judge on the Supreme Court was charged with taking bribes. A scandal involving the procurement of military rations has also come to light since the beginning of the war, leading to the sacking of several officials and the resignation of the deputy minister of defence. A reforming official gripes that in some parts of the country businesses are suffering extortion on a par with the depredations of Mr Yanukovych&#39;s tenure.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What is more, the war is robbing Ukraine of many of its best and brightest. In addition to those killed or disabled on the battlefield (Ukraine does not disclose casualty figures), some 6.2m people have fled the country over the past 18 months, more than 15% of the pre-war population. The workforce has shrunk by the same proportion. And some 60% of the adults who have left had university degrees, says Tetyana Berezhna, deputy minister for economy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The exodus is currently constrained, since men of working age are not allowed to leave the country. But with so many Ukrainians now settled elsewhere in Europe, in many cases with jobs or children in school, the likelihood is that lots of Ukrainian men will go join their relatives whenever travel restrictions are lifted. Those who stay will present problems, too: they will be traumatised by fighting, and in many cases gravely injured. “The war has generated a major demographic crisis in the country,” says Ms Berezhna.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although the economy is showing some signs of life, it has been clobbered. It shrank by about 35% last year. The World Bank predicts that more than half the population may be living in poverty by the end of 2023. Some 3m people are unemployed. Roughly 5m are internally displaced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The government&#39;s priority is to try to stop the economy from atrophying yet more. It is handing out grants to small and medium-sized businesses and farmers on the condition that they create new jobs. Some 6,000 new businesses have sprung up since the war began and some 40,000 jobs have been saved by relocating firms from the most war-torn parts of the country to safer areas in the west. The state is also creating programmes to reintegrate veterans into civilian life and to make it easier for the disabled to work.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the longer run the government also wants to make Ukraine a more attractive place to invest and do business. It is debating sweeping deregulation of the labour market—to such an extent that some observers worry it will gravely reduce workers&#39; rights. Accession to the European Union, which officially accepted Ukraine as a candidate last year, will require detailed reforms to everything from energy markets to customs procedures. The process is seen by reformers as a critical safeguard, preventing the reinvention of the state from going into reverse.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The government has set all manner of lofty targets, such as doubling the size of the economy in a decade, which would require average annual growth of 7%. Its official “Recovery Plan Blueprint” calls for privatisation, stronger laws on competition and corporate governance and “de-oligarchisation”. Mr Fedorov expresses hope that the war will transform Ukraine from an economy focused on natural resources and the associated rents to one driven by technology and innovation. The authorities see <small>it</small> , already 5% of <small>gdp</small> , as an important potential source of growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All of this is contingent not only on restoring security, but also on attracting vast amounts of investment. The government estimates the bill for reconstruction at more than $750bn. Ukraine&#39;s allies and donors <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/22/rebuilding-ukraine-will-require-money-but-also-tough-reforms">have gathered in London this week</a> for a big conference intended in part to work out how to drum up such a daunting sum.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Ukrainian civil-society groups&#39; biggest worry about reconstruction is not that there will too little money, but rather that it will not be well spent and much of it will be embezzled, according to a recent survey conducted by Chatham House, a British think-tank. These sorts of concerns are widespread: according to a recent poll commissioned by <i>Zerkalo Nedeli</i> , another Ukrainian online newspaper, 84% of Ukrainians agree that, even during the war, “The facts about corruption should be made public, because through corruption we will lose unity, the support of partners, and, ultimately, victory.”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The war on graft</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Ukraine in this war is fighting not only for the right to exist, but also for the opportunity to become a European country, intolerant to corruption…That is why scrutiny of officials and government becomes even more important for journalists than before the war,” says Segvil Musaeva, the editor-in-chief of <i>Ukrainska Pravda</i> . “We cannot allow our society, our army to find out after the end of this war that all this time officials have persisted in misconduct, bad governance or corruption.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Fedorov agrees. In the eyes of the trailblazers of Ukraine 2.0, it is the government&#39;s efforts to work for its citizens, rather than exploit them, that make Ukraine worth fighting for. Everyone has been profoundly affected by the war, he explains, and everyone has become an activist, in effect. “Our society has grown tremendously,” he says, “It will not allow us to turn in the wrong direction.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 22 Jun 2023 12:53:57 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/q8e20jb2im2bni62vtn9ulptim4cpgrn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/22/war-is-reshaping-the-ukrainian-state-for-the-better</item><item><title><![CDATA[Inflation is as corrosive to investing as it is to the real economy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0"><style data-emotion="css qts40t">.css-qts40t img{display:block;}.css-qts40t .edweubf2{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230624_FBD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><style data-emotion="css 6pzdis">.css-6pzdis{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.edweubf0+.css-6pzdis{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Till Lauer</span></figcaption></figure></section>空]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8k3epir6ho28rqm9q8euf2t5f9ibhnh7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/21/inflation-is-as-corrosive-to-investing-as-it-is-to-the-real-economy </item><item><title><![CDATA[Pretending that everything is under control in Russia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1whazj10"><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Editor&#39;s note:</b> On June 23rd Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner, launched an open revolt against the Kremlin, accusing the Russian army of killing his troops.

A mixture of fierce repression and unrelenting propaganda have kept the public largely quiescent. But in recent weeks the war has been seeping into everyday life. In an affluent area in south-western Moscow military trucks roar past Teslas. Recruiters stationed outside supermarkets try to enlist passers-by in the army. At a speed-dating event young women complain of the difficulty of maintaining a steady relationship—because their boyfriends have been called up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> On May 30th a swarm of drones attacked Moscow. None hit its target: they were all either shot down or disabled by jamming. Some fell close to Barvikha Luxury Village, a posh suburb. Villages close to the border with Ukraine in Belgorod province have been shelled. A few have been briefly occupied by pro-Ukrainian militias making forays across the border. These incursions met little initial resistance: many of the troops who used to guard the border had been redeployed to Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="/ukraine-war">Ukraine war</a> .</i></p></aside><h2> Lieutenants at loggerheads</h2><p class="article__body-text"> There are also growing signs of disarray among Russia&#39;s elite. For months Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, a mercenary force fighting on Russia&#39;s behalf, has been denouncing Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, and Valery Gerasimov, Russia&#39;s top general, as incompetent foot-draggers. But his complaints are becoming steadily shriller. He recently claimed that Russian soldiers had laid mines behind Wagner&#39;s positions. Wagner has also released a video of a Russian officer, who looked as if he had been beaten, confessing that he had shot at a vehicle used by Wagner&#39;s forces while drunk.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The incursions in Belgorod have especially incensed Mr Prigozhin (pictured). “Why are tens of thousands of people, our Russian guys, dying advancing towards the West? So that we could start giving away, step by step, pieces of Belgorod province, our native Russian land? Why is everyone silent about the deaths of these civilians? Where is their explanation to the Russian people that we are handing over our territories and civilians to be devoured?”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has a habit of provoking conflict among his subordinates to reinforce his role as an indispensable arbiter. Mr Prigozhin also serves as a useful spur to the Russian army and as a scold for rich Russians unenthused by the war. But these conflicts typically do not spill into public view. Some speculate that Mr Prigozhin could be attacking the top brass in anticipation of territorial losses in Ukraine. By denigrating the generals, he may help deflect blame from Mr Putin. Alternatively, the bickering could be a reflection of infighting between powerful factions who sense weakness on the part of the arbiter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has been keeping a low profile of late, presumably to avoid any association with military setbacks. A visit to a children&#39;s clinic and meetings with regional officials have been his only recent public appearances. His apparent lack of interest in the war and the noisy squabbling in the top ranks, whatever the reason for them, are likely to have a demoralising effect on Russia&#39;s soldiers and civilians alike. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAPBBeHQy_o?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Russia&#39;s propagandists have been trying to reassure the public, insisting that Russia had thwarted the Ukrainian counter-offensive before it had even begun. But their jaunty footage of destroyed Ukrainian tanks has been scorned by Mr Prigozhin and military bloggers. Big territorial losses will presumably lead to further tension within the Russian elites. A weakened Mr Putin, in turn, would probably resort to even greater repression to compensate for losses at the front. Mr Prigozhin is calling for martial law, a general mobilisation and the restoration of the death penalty.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What comes next will depend not just on the progress of the counter-offensive, but on the pliability of the elite and the mood of the broader public. Mr Putin has had little trouble suppressing dissent so far. But the many military setbacks and the public disagreements among his own henchmen make that job harder. “We are moving into uncharted waters,” an American official says. “And it is not just Ukraine that needs liberation, so does Russia.” <span>■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:48:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/vv78i90h6dfis7hte6j40mlk3pcc9qeq</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/08/pretending-that-everything-is-under-control-in-russia</item></channel></rss>
