class="article__body-text">如今，美联储官员倾向于避免使用“狂欢”这个词，但他们也在努力应对类似的情况。他们一直在以 20 世纪 80 年代初以来最快的速度加息。鹰派经济学家认为，为了抑制通胀，美联储将不得不进一步提高通胀率，尽管这肯定会增加失业率并可能引发经济衰退。鸽派反驳说，美联储已经走得太远了，进一步的经济痛苦是不必要的。第三种可能性是，美联储正在采取正确的措施，经济将放缓，通胀消散，而不会出现衰退（行话是“软着陆”），直到最近还被认为几乎是不可能的。</p><h2>紧致狂欢</h2><p class="article__body-text">可能性仍然很大。自2022年3月以来，美联储已将短期利率从0%提高至5%。如此快速的增长往往与衰退同时发生。随着利率上升，借贷成本上升，消费者支出和企业投资都受到拖累。一般来说，利率增幅越大，阻力就越大。因此，在过去一年的大部分时间里，华尔街和企业董事会的主流观点是美国经济最终将陷入恐慌。截至 6 月，彭博社调查的经济学家预测未来 12 个月经济衰退的概率中值为 65% 左右。商业团体世界大型企业联合会 (Conference Board) 在 2 月份预测这一可能性为 99%。硅谷最受欢迎的宏观经济预测家斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒(Stanley Druckenmiller)最近表示，他预计经济将出现“硬着陆”，即企业利润下滑和失业率大幅上升。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

class="article__body-text">最悲观的预兆是收益率曲线的极端倒挂。通常，长期债券的利率高于短期债券的利率，因为投资者期望持有未来成熟的证券的风险得到额外补偿。当短期收益率较高时，意味着投资者预计央行将降息，通常是因为他们认为经济增长将减弱。在过去的半个世纪里，倒挂在预示美国经济衰退方面有着近乎完美的记录，而且它们现在已经引起了麻烦一段时间了。 2022 年 10 月，收益率曲线在本次经济周期中首次出现倒挂，目前已严重倒挂。从倒挂开始到经济衰退开始的时间平均约为 350 天，这将使潜在的经济衰退在 9 月份开始。美联储纽约分行根据收益率曲线计算经济衰退的概率。 5 月份，它认为这一可能性超过 70%，是 1982 年以来的最高水平（见图 1）。</p><p class="article__body-text">其他指标也证实了这种黯淡的前景。根据密歇根大学一项备受关注的调查显示，消费者信心去年跌至历史最低点。硅谷银行和其他几家金融机构三月份的倒闭证明，快速加息正在损害脆弱的企业，而随之而来的金融不稳定加剧了经济逆风。银行提高了贷款标准，这是经济衰退迫在眉睫的另一个迹象。小型企业——美国经济的命脉——仍然极其悲观。自 2022 年底以来，制造业已经出现收缩，产出下降。经济学家之间的争论不再是关于经济衰退是否即将到来，而是关于经济衰退是长期还是短期、深度还是浅度。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，在过去几周里，人们的情绪发生了变化。尽管存在许多不祥的预兆，但经济健康状况最重要的指标——劳动力市场——仍然保持着惊人的弹性。失业率仅为 3.6%，略高于五年来的低点。春季失业保险申请人数的短暂上升已经逐渐减弱。美国连续30个月新增就业岗位，使总就业人数恢复至疫情前水平。</p><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，通货膨胀正在消退。截至 2022 年 6 月的一年中，消费者价格上涨了 9.1%。截至今年 6 月的一年里，房价仅上涨了 3%，是两年多以来的最小涨幅。不包括能源和食品在内的核心通胀率较高，但经过几个月的停滞后，又再次朝着正确的方向发展。随着大流行后供应链的混乱，大多数商品的成本仅缓慢上升，在某些情况下甚至下降。根据私人指数，租金迄今为止是通货膨胀的一个重要因素，它正在下降，并且官方数据也可能很快开始下降。劳动力成本仍在上涨，但上涨速度已经放缓，这对餐厅餐饮、汽车维修、税务会计等价格来说是个好兆头。

class="article__body-text">说通胀下降和劳动力市场强劲的结合是出乎意料的，这是一种轻描淡写的说法：许多经济学家认为这是不可能的。他们认为，就业和价格之间存在短期权衡：在其他条件相同的情况下，低失业率与通胀率上升相关，这种关系被称为菲利普斯曲线。在大流行之前的十年里，菲利普斯曲线就受到了质疑，因为尽管失业率大幅下降，通胀仍然保持静止。但去年通货膨胀的复苏使菲利普斯曲线重新流行起来，部分原因是大流行后劳动力市场的效率似乎降低了。争论的焦点不是失业率是否需要上升才能降低通胀，而是在物价得到控制之前需要有多少人失业。前财政部长拉里·萨默斯(Larry Summers)去年在一次备受讨论的演讲中表示，失业率可能需要攀升至10%。</p><h2>就业狂欢</h2><p class="article__body-text">美国确实有一个极度紧张的劳动力市场：太多的公司竞相雇用太少的工人。这通常会导致工资大幅上涨，从而导致通胀上升。反过来，抑制通货膨胀的明显方法是通过提高利率给企业带来足够的痛苦，从而使它们采取大范围裁员的方式。但平衡劳动力市场的另一个方法是增加工人的供给。这在一定程度上已经发生了：在 25-54 岁的人群中，84% 的人有工作或正在寻找工作，这是自 2002 年以来的最高比例。劳动力——已经回归：去年有超过 100 万人回流，这是 2017 年以来的最高数字。自 2020 年 2 月以来，经济增加了近 400 万个就业岗位，增长速度远远快于长期趋势。</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope=""

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，雇主们对于解雇工人一直犹豫不决。有些人很可能会囤积这些人才，因为他们发现过去几年很难招募到足够的人才。他们没有解雇员工，而是减少招聘。尽管没有裁员，但更多工人和更少招聘广告的最终结果是劳动力市场略微平静。高盛 (Goldman Sachs) 计算出，目前美国的就业岗位比工人多大约 320 万个。该数字仍高于 200 万，这被认为是就业市场不太紧张、不太宽松的最高水平，但这一超调远低于 2022 年初 570 万的峰值。随着职位空缺数量下降工资的持续上涨势头有所放缓（见图2）。鸽派经济学家即使没有完全宣布胜利，也开始大肆宣扬这些成就。国家经济委员会主席莱尔·布雷纳德 (Lael Brainard) 7 月 12 日表示：“经济正在违背预期，即如果就业机会没有大幅减少，通胀就不会下降。”</p><p class="article__body-text">另外两件事有助于解释美国的好运。首先，由于大流行的怪异现象，迫在眉睫的问题可能被夸大了。几个月来，经济学家关于经济衰退可能性的模型一直在闪烁红灯。但有理由认为这些模型可能给出了不可靠的信号。它们旨在在数据发生突然变化时预测出现问题。不过，最近这种转变反映了疫情过后经济的恢复正常，而不是经济的初现疲软。例如，与 2020 年相比，人们购买的笔记本电脑和健身自行车明显减少，这并不是因为他们大幅削减支出，而是因为他们在家工作的次数减少了。因此，制造业的疲软与其说是预兆，不如说是宿醉。</p><p class="article__body-text">收益率曲线倒挂也可能具有误导性。长期利率可能低于短期利率，并不是因为经济衰退迫在眉睫，而是因为一个更令人愉快的原因：随着通胀消退，美联储将能够降低利率。如果它能够在增长放缓之前实施这些削减，那么它将有很好的机会引导美国实现软着陆。</p><p class="article__body-text">第二个因素与经济的潜在实力有关。货币政策可能从紧，但也存在抵消力量。一是政府支出。美国的预算赤字超过<small>GDP</small>的 5%——这在外界经济衰退和战争中是闻所未闻的。这就是把钱放到人们的口袋里。有很多理由担心这种财政慷慨的可持续性，但就目前而言，它对经济来说是一个缓冲。 </p></div><div

class="article__body-text">乔·拜登担任总统头两年在民主党失去众议院控制权之前颁布的几项重大立法也开始影响经济。在 2021 年通过的基础设施法的推动下，高速公路、港口、发电厂等方面的支出约占每年<small>GDP</small>的 0.25%。对电动汽车、可再生能源和半导体的补贴似乎促进了私营部门投资的激增：与大流行前的水平相比，今年制造设施的支出实际增长了 70%，创下历史新高。</p><p class="article__body-text">另一个抵消力量是家庭，其支出约占<small>GDP</small>的三分之二。他们为进入高通胀和利率上升时代做好了充分准备。在大流行期间，他们积累了价值约 2 万亿美元的“超额储蓄”，这是因为花钱的机会较少，而且接受了三轮刺激支票以及其他形式的政府支持。随着生活成本的上升，许多人已经动用了这些储蓄。尽管如此，美联储旧金山分行的研究人员估计，仍有剩余的额外储蓄——大约 5000 亿美元——足以维持今年的大部分时间。无论如何，这些储蓄的重要性已经不如以前了：几年来，名义工资增长首次超过了通货膨胀率，这意味着大多数美国人现在的实际收入在增加。</p><div

class="article__body-text">可能会出什么问题？政策滞后是一个已知的未知因素，但可能会拖累经济。滞后是指货币政策变化开始影响商业活动所需的时间长度。经济学家过去认为，利率上升可能需要两年多的时间才能波及经济。更严格的信贷标准尚未充分发挥其影响：例如，信用卡利率刚刚开始飙升，可能还需要几个月的时间，拖欠率才会随之上升。</p><p class="article__body-text">但与此相反的是，有证据表明，在某些方面，由于金融市场的动荡，滞后性比以前要小得多。例如，抵押贷款利率在 2022 年初大幅上涨，仅仅是因为人们预期美联储将很快开始加息，而事实确实如此。房地产行业可以说是经济中对利率最敏感的部分，目前正处于小幅反弹的阵痛之中，销售和建设都开始增长（见图 3）。美联储制定的一项新的金融状况指数表明，总体而言，过去几个月，利率上升对经济增长的拖累实际上已经减弱，部分原因是美国股市的投资者预计美国股市上涨周期将会结束。费率。</p></div><h2>放荡的无精打采</h2><p class="article__body-text">值得注意的是，软着陆并不等于高速增长。离得很远。帮助控制通胀需要的是一段时期（可能是很长一段时期）增长放缓，这会降低经济温度。事实上，这样的插曲可能正在顺利进行。尽管<small>国内生产</small>总值在过去几个季度保持良好增长，但与其密切相关的国内总收入（ <small>GDI</small> ）却一直疲软。从理论上讲，两者应该是一致的。 <small>GDP</small>追踪经济中的所有最终支出，总结特定时期内的消费、投资、政府支出和净出口。 <small>GDI</small>跟踪与该支出相关的收入，汇总工资、利润和任何其他收入。事实上，两者永远不会完美匹配，因为它们来自不同的来源。最近，这种差距异常之大——这也许是与大流行相关的扭曲的另一个后果。今年第一季度<small>GDP</small>按年率计算增长2%，而<small>GDI</small>却下降1.8%。目前尚不清楚哪个数字更准确，但协调两者的一种常见方法是平分差异。这意味着增长已经非常低，进而可能进一步抑制通胀。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种乐观的前景存在很大的风险。通货膨胀可能会再次变得顽固，就像过去两年一样。最近的乐观情绪很大程度上与六月份好于预期的通胀数据有关。从单一数据得出全面的结论从来都不是一个好主意，尤其是在潜在趋势如此不稳定的情况下。</p><p class="article__body-text">即使7月和8月通胀再次下降，也存在这样的问题：如果空缺职位数量继续大幅超过可用工人数量，那么通胀会降到多低。国际货币基金组织前首席经济学家奥利维尔·布兰查德和美联储前主席本·伯南克5月在一篇论文中估计，在目前劳动力市场紧张的情况下，失业率需要上升一段时间内将通胀率维持在4.3%以上，以将通胀率降至美联储的目标。这意味着大约 100 万人将不得不失业——这是一个不小的混乱。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4"

class="article__body-text">在这方面，经济的弹性令人不安。如果房地产反弹势头强劲，很容易刺激租金和商品价格上涨（所有这些新房都需要沙发、冰箱、地毯等）。如果工资继续以每年 5% 左右的速度增长，它们也将为服务业的价格设定一个底线。通胀预期虽然下降，但并不表明美联储一切都在掌控之中（见图 4）。强劲经济与粘性通胀之间的反馈循环将给美联储带来严峻挑战，使其别无选择，只能将利率提高到新的高度，届时对紧缩引发的衰退的担忧很可能成为现实。</p><p class="article__body-text">迄今为止没有出现经济衰退，这使得美联储能够避免在紧缩政策中面临任何严重的权衡。美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）和他的同侪因加息速度之快（尽管为时已晚）而受到高度评价。但考虑到就业市场的健康状况，他们很容易表现出坚决的态度。如果情况恶化，他们的决心将受到严峻考验。美联储前副主席理查德·克拉里达(Richard Clarida)表示，随着通胀率达到“两点目标”，美联储明年可能会逐步降息，而不是实际回到2%的目标。这可能有助于避免经济衰退。但这也代表着目标的转变，美联储容忍更高的通胀率，因为它不想造成痛苦的经济痛苦。这本身将使未来对抗通胀变得更加困难。</p><p class="article__body-text">尽管存在所有这些风险，但美国迄今为止避免了硬着陆仍然值得注意。经济正从40年来通胀最高峰走上一条危险的道路。与传统观点相反，它在令人毛骨悚然的过程中成功地增加了数百万个就业岗位。它的下降还远未结束。但软着陆曾经是一个微弱的希望，现在已成为可能的结果之一。 <span

class="article__body-text">这种相似并非巧合。罗林斯夫人在唐纳德·特朗普领导下的白宫工作，并短暂管理过他的国内政策委员会。她离开时购买了西翼的家具。在特朗普第一个任期即将结束时，她负责为他的第二个任期制定政策议程。特朗普在 2020 年竞选连任失败后，她成立了一个智库来继续这项工作，即美国优先政策研究所 ( <small>AFPI</small> )。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small>渴望成为一个候任政府。其 172 名工作人员包括 8 名特朗普政府前内阁部长和 20 名其他政治任命者。 “我将为下一任共和党总统做好准备，”罗林斯夫人说。竞选财务法禁止她这么说，但她指的是特朗普先生。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small>是为特朗普连任做准备的最新智囊团，但它并不是最大的智囊团。传统基金会以为罗纳德·里根的“革命”做了准备工作而自豪，也有自己的总统过渡项目。该团队由保罗·丹斯 (Paul Dans) 领导，他是一名律师，曾在特朗普担任总统期间在白宫人事管理办公室工作。 1981年，里根内阁成员在第一次会议之前，将一份由Heritage制作的政府手册放在每位内阁成员的椅子上。 Heritage 正在更新这一想法，协调 350 名保守派专家和前政府官员的努力，为明年的共和党初选及时制定政府计划。那些批评特朗普先生或他的议程的人不会参与其中。</p><p class="article__body-text">除了为每个部门起草政策外，丹斯和他的同事们还在制定一份可能在下一届共和党政府任职的新人名单。他喜欢将这一努力描述为保守的 LinkedIn。为政府配备齐全的人员需要大约 4,000 名政治任命人员，其中 1,200 名必须得到参议院的批准。遗产基金会及其联盟智囊团现在正在审查填补这些职位的人选。</p><h2>驳回侮辱性的内容</h2><p class="article__body-text">什么会证明取消资格？ “如果你表现出自己曾与特朗普政府作斗争，或者在某些问题上你实际上一直反对特朗普政府，”丹斯先生说。 “可以这么说，你知道人们站在哪里、坐在哪里。随着时间的推移，他们的帖子和社交媒体以及他们的忠诚度可以给人们一个很好的印象。”例如，指责特朗普在 2021 年洗劫国会大厦，或者在接下来的几天里支持对他的弹劾，就足以将某人排除在名单之外。</p><p class="article__body-text">由于这些努力，下一届特朗普政府（如果有的话）将拥有充实的计划和推进这些计划的专业知识。这将使其与特朗普的第一个任期截然不同。 “我们没有人，因为没有人认为我们会赢，”特朗普竞选团队的负责人史蒂夫·班农 (Steve Bannon) 说道，他在担任总统之初就是一位颇具影响力的人物。 （特朗普解雇了班农，但后来赦免了他，阻止了他因滥用他领导的非营利组织资金而受到的审判。） </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">班农先生提到国家安全委员会（ <small>NSC</small> ）作为特朗普政府面临的人员配置问题的一个例子。他说，它很难找到所需政治任命人数的一半。他们是一群奇怪的人，其中包括迈克尔·安东（Michael Anton）这样的人，一位企业<small>公关</small>人员和世界末日政治评论员，还有一些老外交政策专家，他们对特朗普讨好朝鲜独裁者和对美国盟友的敌意感到不安。</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>国家安全委员会</small>的情况也适用于其他机构。 “你必须和三四千人一起去海滩，”班农先生说。丹斯先生对此表示同意。 “在好莱坞，他们喜欢用‘这个遇见另一个’来形容事物。这是曼哈顿计划与帝国大厦与<small>诺曼底</small>登陆的结合。”</p><p class="article__body-text">这支入侵部队的最初目标是夺取公务员队伍。特朗普的支持者从他的第一个任期中吸取的一个教训是，没有什么政策比控制官僚机构更重要，因为没有它，任何政策都无法实施。</p><p class="article__body-text">为此，特朗普的突击队将“解构”行政国家——发布和解释法规的 300 个或更多联邦办公室。这个想法的哲学版本是，随着时间的推移，随着联邦政府的角色从打仗和经营邮政服务发展成为今天的利维坦，未经选举产生的官僚已经承担了本应属于国会的权力。推特上的版本是，那些在特朗普执政期间阻挠他、并在他离任后一直迫害他的深层国家自由派必须被击败。不管怎样，特朗普的突击部队将试图从官僚机构手中夺回权力。</p><p class="article__body-text">实际上，如果没有行政国家，政府将如何运作是很难的。国会努力履行基本职责，例如按时通过预算。想象同一个机构可以充当金融市场监管者的角色有些牵强。这可能就是重点。 <small>MAGA</small>运动不是自由主义的，但在很多方面它希望联邦政府做得比现在少得多。</p><p class="article__body-text">特朗普的潜在任命者计划使用附表<small>F</small>来压制官僚机构，附表 F 是特朗普在 2020 年发布的一项行政命令的简写，乔·拜登就任总统后废除了该命令。它反映了一种观点，即联邦官僚机构无论规模大小，都不应该拥有任何根深蒂固的权威。在其存在的第一个世纪里，公务员是由当时的政府根据个人关系和所欠恩惠的算法（称为战利品制度）任命的。然后在 1881 年，一位精神错乱的谋求公职的人暗杀了总统，促使《彭德尔顿法案》的通过，该法案造就了一个职业官僚阶层，即使总统职位易手，他们仍坚守岗位。 <small>AFPI</small>抱怨称，自 20 世纪 40 年代富兰克林·罗斯福 (Franklin Roosevelt) 扩大政府规模以来，解雇联邦官员一直很困难。</p><p class="article__body-text">特朗普政府中的许多政治任命人员认为，少数公务员利用其受保护的身份来阻挠或破坏总统的意愿。特朗普白宫政策顾问、现供职于<small>AFPI</small>的詹姆斯·谢尔克 (James Sherk) 援引了据报道政府各部门律师拒绝工作的两起案件：一起针对耶鲁大学涉嫌歧视亚裔美国人，另一起旨在保护护士免于必须进行堕胎。附表<small>F</small>将授权特朗普的任命者随意清除被认为是阻挠者。</p><p class="article__body-text"> “我认为， <small>F</small>附表现在是共和党的信条，”特朗普领导下的管理和预算办公室负责人拉塞尔·沃特 (Russell Vought) 表示。 “我不知道共和党人是如何当选的，但他不会这么做。”颁布起来也很简单：特朗普只需重新发布他的旧行政命令即可。同样，这个想法有一个合理的版本，其中少数顽固的公务员失去了工作，还有一个竞选版本，其中附表<small>F</small>成为特朗普先生正义清洗华盛顿的工具。</p><h2>和喜欢的人在一起就足够了</h2><p class="article__body-text">只任命效忠者和威慑官僚机构的综合效应将消除对特朗普的限制，并确保他的愿望更频繁地得到执行。在特朗普的第一个任期内，特朗普的反对者从这样的想法中得到了一些安慰：并非他周围的人都是真正的信徒，并且愿意拖延他最令人震惊的想法。 《<i>纽约时报》</i>刊登了一位政治任命者的匿名文章，声称政府内部存在对总统权力的制衡。在特朗普的第二个任期内，将不再有特朗普的批评者所说的“房间里的成年人”。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB

alt="唐纳德·特朗普雕像被递上长矛的剪影" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">一旦特朗普第二届政府让官僚机构屈服于其意志，它会采取什么政策？ <small>AFPI</small> 、Heritage 和其他机构正在制定的逐部门计划提供了一些指导。它们涉及文化战争中一些可预见的连发，例如沿着墨西哥边境修建隔离墙，并指示所有联邦官员只考虑人们的生物性别，而不是“自我认定的”性别。但一些假定的政策议程不仅范围更广泛，而且更多地打破了过去共和党的正统观念。</p><p class="article__body-text">经济就是这样的领域之一。新右翼对拜登政府推行的产业政策充满热情。 “俄亥俄州没有人……关心《<i>华尔街日报》</i>编辑委员会基于自由市场经济理由不喜欢<small>CHIPS</small>法案，”参议员 JD Vance 最近在智库美国指南针的一次聚会上说道。补贴半导体工厂的法律。在某些情况下，特朗普的支持者会走得更远：万斯主张对将工作转移到海外的公司征税。</p><p class="article__body-text">关于产业政策的主要党派分歧不再是是否制定产业政策，而是民主党习惯将多样性要求和环境目标纳入其中。随着共和党已经成为一个比民主党更加工人阶级的政党，像万斯先生这样的人试图综合一种<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/13/the-american-left-and-right-loathe-each-other-and-agree-on-a-lot" data-tegid="ltmo4cs1bur7up9uh1alvvsbhfce2cai">新的共和党立场</a>，既支持工党，又敌视工会领导人。他提倡对工业进行补贴，而不是“醒悟的废话”，这可能比拜登政府的做法更受欢迎。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种对积极国家的热情与更传统的共和党减税计划并存，再加上人们相信善意的减贫努力通常会适得其反。 <small>AFPI</small>的政策手册谈到将 2017 年《减税和就业法案》中的减税政策永久化，其中一些法案将于 2025 年到期<small>。AFPI</small>的政策专家还主张将工作要求附加到 Medicaid（穷人的健康保险）中。 ）和其他政府福利。阿肯色州是唯一实施医疗补助工作要求的州，四分之一的参加该计划的人失去了健康保险，而且就业率没有明显增加。这些改革至少会节省一些钱，但不足以对联邦赤字产生太大影响。</p></div><p class="article__body-text">昂贵的产业政策、较低的税收和福利的小幅削减——换句话说，收入减少和支出增加——不会平衡收支，更不用说削减政府债务或补充支付医疗保险（为残疾人和残疾人提供补贴的健康保险）的资金。养老金）和社会保障（国家养老金），这些都将在 2030 年代初耗尽。根据过去的证据，债券市场可能会继续为政府收入和支出之间日益扩大的差距提供融资。然而，如果美联储的独立性受到质疑，投资者可能会变得紧张。一些特朗普支持者认为应该如此，因为他们不喜欢将如此多的权力让给未经选举产生的官僚。沃特先生承认，这是少数人的观点，但可能会获得广泛的支持：“我保证，如果这场辩论是在特朗普总统面前进行的，他不会直接把你赶出椭圆形办公室。”</p><p class="article__body-text">特朗普第二任期可能扭转历史弧线的另一个领域是环境政策。在他的第一个任期内，尽管他推翻了巴拉克·奥巴马减缓气候变化的许多政策，但温室气体排放量持续下降。投资者认为政府政策很快就会恢复到更环保的标准，而燃煤发电站的使用寿命长达几十年，因此政府对它们的喜爱不足以建造新的发电站。在这方面，特朗普第二届政府也将更加有条理、组织得更好。</p><h2>凡是能满足心灵的就是真理</h2><p class="article__body-text"><small>AFPI</small>的政策书谈到了结束“化石燃料战争”，并对没有这场战争的经济规模做出了不受限制的假设。 （ <small>AFPI</small>估计，到本十年末，美国的<small>GDP</small>将比没有奥巴马政府的减排目标时减少 6%。） 这一论点是从务实和道德角度提出的。为什么美国的石油应该留在地下，而沙特的石油却在流动？为什么燃料的使用能够给这么多人带来如此多的繁荣却要受到限制呢？不管拜登政府比特朗普政府发放了更多的钻探许可证，不管美国是世界上最大的石油生产国，也不管限制全球变暖符合国家利益。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国优先者喜欢石油、天然气和煤炭，以及它们为高中毕业生带来的相对高薪、有男子气概的工作。他们还反对绿色转型，认为这是政府不必要的干预，会提高普通美国人的能源价格。 Heritage 的经营者凯文·罗伯茨 (Kevin Roberts) 和<small>AFPI</small>的创始人罗林斯 (Rollins) 都曾是德克萨斯州公共政策基金会 ( <small>TPPF</small> ) 的高级人物，该基金会是一个反对风电场和太阳能发电厂开发的智库。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Over a quarter of Texas&#39;s electricity is generated by renewables, and <small>TPPF</small> has helped to propagate the idea that this makes the state&#39;s power grid unstable. Investors in renewables say Texas&#39;s electricity regulator has become hostile to new projects. <small>TPPF</small> , meanwhile, is battling renewables as far afield as New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where it has initiated a lawsuit against a big offshore wind farm on behalf of fishermen. If the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department were run by people who shared these instincts, investors in renewables would face the same sort of political risks as owners of coal plants.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A third area which is likely to see great upheaval if Mr Trump becomes president again is foreign policy. Among America First types, there is deep disagreement about Ukraine. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about facing the threat from Russia. Yet Mr Bannon says, “I don&#39;t give a shit about Ukraine—what I give a shit about is the invasion of America&#39;s southern border.” Mr Vought makes the same point in a more wonkish way: “Ukraine is being subsidised by our taxpayers to fight and not make strategic calculations that they would otherwise make if we weren&#39;t subsidising it. And it&#39;s not in our interest to subsidise that conflict.” Mr Trump himself says he would end the war. He may not be able to do that. But Ukraine and its other allies ought to take seriously the possibility that America may no longer be with them in 18 months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Policy towards China is less contested. The Trump administration was more confrontational towards China than any of its predecessors. The Biden administration has continued in the same vein, albeit with less inflammatory rhetoric and more considered policies. “The difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration on protectionism is that the Biden administration is competent,” says Dan Drezner of Tufts University. A second Trump term would be more likely to build on what the Biden team have done rather than, say, loosening export controls.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/778/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/512/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/768/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/819/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1024/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1280/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1638/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="Silhouette of a laurel wreath being lowered onto a Donald Trump statue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Heritage&#39;s plan for 2025 foresees an immediate ban on TikTok and also on Confucius Institutes. American pension funds would be encouraged to divest from “problematic” Chinese entities. The government should be prepared “to employ punitive policy measures” to prevent American investment in sensitive areas in China and Chinese investment in America. American companies considering large-scale investments in anything deemed critical would have to submit information about counterparties and anticipated use of funds to the <small>US</small> government before investing, “under a presumption of denial”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Whether Mr Trump would authorise the use of force if China were to invade Taiwan is hard to say. Some who worked in his administration note that whenever they were about to adopt tougher policies on China, the bosses of big American firms would call the White House and tell him that the move would alarm financial markets and he would back down. The same dynamic may apply in a second term. In a memoir of his time as Mr Trump&#39;s national security adviser, John Bolton suggests the former president was not really committed to Taiwan&#39;s security. Others claim he would be “stronger” than Mr Biden.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other allies could expect the same peremptory treatment as in Mr Trump&#39;s first term. He reportedly told aides he wanted to leave <small>nato</small> . Even <small>AFPI</small> , which on foreign policy is closer to the old Republican orthodoxy, thinks that military support should be withdrawn from countries that do not spend at least 2% of <small>GDP</small> on defence, a level that neither Japan nor most countries in <small>nato</small> meet. The modern America First movement, like its namesake during the second world war, contains some true isolationists. But it also contains an influential clutch of people like Elbridge Colby, who served in the Department of Defence and believes in a muscular foreign policy. He thinks China is such a threat that America should pull back from its defence commitments in Europe and the Middle East to concentrate on the Pacific.</p><p class="article__body-text"> No matter how well-laid the plans for a second Trump term, nor how thoroughly vetted the people carrying them out, Mr Trump would still be in charge, which means there is a limit to how methodical it could be. But it would be altogether more formidable than the version of 2017-21. As for the candidate himself, he is aware of the plans being made on his behalf but has never been excited by the details of public policy. For the professional wonks in the movement, that is an opportunity.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> “ <i>The Economist</i> doesn&#39;t think that populists can govern, right?” asks Mr Vought. “We believe we&#39;re trying to be an answer to that viewpoint. So we&#39;re trying to look systemically: how does someone who has an American First perspective, a populist perspective, govern credibly and effectively? Because they know the inner workings of government so well.” The winner of next year&#39;s presidential election will be sworn in in 18 months. The institutions of the new right expect it to be Mr Trump, and this time they will be prepared. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>通过<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">《制衡》</a>掌握美国政治的最新动态，这是我们的每周仅限订阅者的时事通讯，它探讨了美国民主的状况以及对选民重要的问题。您还可以阅读有关<a href="https://www.economist.com/us-election-2024">2024 年选举的</a>其他文章，并关注我们跟踪乔·拜登支持率的<a href="https://www.economist.com/president-joe-biden-polls" data-tegid="hcqvn8gl89s7jjstumps8is95685q07j">变化</a>。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 09:15:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/34fdaqhpnfv8mqucvmtb54fk4r3206ap</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/13/the-meticulous-ruthless-preparations-for-a-second-trump-term </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why China should be friendlier to its neighbours]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Border-defence police officers on patrol in Heilongjiang province, north-east China" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_FBP001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style><span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">图片：盖蒂图片社</span></figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">N</span> <small>o country has</small> more neighbours than China, with 14 land borders.

The inner ones formed territory under the emperor&#39;s direct rule. Then came neighbouring kingdoms such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam, which acknowledged the emperor&#39;s ultimate authority by paying tribute. Outermost were foreigners whose trade with China was often seen as tribute, too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Xi Jinping, China&#39;s present-day potentate, puts a 21st-century spin on this worldview. At home he has made himself the “core” of the Communist Party and crushed dissent, especially in border areas. Globally, he has made China a more assertive power. But his efforts to bind China&#39;s neighbours more closely to it—“to warm people&#39;s hearts and enhance our affinity, charisma and influence”, as he ordered officials in 2013—have not gone to plan.</p><h2> Twitchy in Tokyo</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Several neighbours are aligning themselves more closely with America, to counteract China&#39;s growing assertiveness. Most of those friendliest to China are unstable. Others fear its intentions. In recent votes at the <small>UN</small> , half of China&#39;s immediate neighbours broke ranks with it to condemn Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and only five backed a statement rejecting criticism of its policies in Xinjiang. That all speaks to a weakness in Chinese foreign policy that could undermine Mr Xi&#39;s ambitions. Put simply, can China really challenge American leadership in the world if it cannot get its own neighbours on board? </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Powerful countries often try to enhance their own prosperity and security by dominating their region in economic, military, political and cultural terms. In the modern era France, Germany, Japan and Russia have all sought local hegemony by force, with devastating consequences. The European Union has expanded peacefully, but remains a marginal power on defence and security. Only America has managed to dominate its region for a long time.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is partly owing to geography, which has helped America to keep other big powers at bay. But it has also bound itself to its neighbours through mutually beneficial arrangements, including a free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, close defence relations with both (especially Canada) and relatively open borders. American soft power helps, too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s neighbourhood is far trickier. It has 22,800km of land borders, more than any other country. In addition, all eight of its maritime borders are disputed. China&#39;s neighbours include big economic and military powers, such as India and Russia, with their own regional ambitions.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/776/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/255/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/383/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/511/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/766/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/817/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1021/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1276/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1634/90/media-assets/image/20230708_EPM966.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s neighbours fall into three broad camps (see map): fragile or failing states (Afghanistan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea and Pakistan), frenemies that have close ties but fear Chinese domination (Mongolia, Russia and Central Asian states), and places with either defence treaties with America or military ties to it (India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Chinese officials deny seeking regional hegemony. In their telling, China wants only to reclaim its rightful borders, not to expand them or dominate neighbours. They blame America for frustrating Chinese ambitions. “Western countries—led by the <small>US</small> —have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression against us,” Mr Xi complained in a speech in March.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America has indeed worked hard lately to improve ties with countries near China. Yet many of Mr Xi&#39;s problems with his neighbours date back to a time when they felt either neglected by America (during the presidency of Barack Obama) or alarmed by it (during the presidency of Donald Trump). Reservations about China stem instead from its own missteps, according to officials and academics in neighbouring countries. In particular, they cite excessive muscularity on territorial issues, haphazard or coercive economic policies and a heavy-handed approach to diplomacy that is rooted in China&#39;s imperial past and grand assumptions about its future. Most are unconvinced by China&#39;s reassurances, especially given its support for Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and the implication that might is right.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For 30 years after its inconclusive war with Vietnam in 1979, China took a conciliatory approach to territorial disputes, opting for stability as it focused on economic reform. Between 1991 and 2002 it resolved disagreements about its land borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Tajikistan and Vietnam. Perhaps most remarkably, in 2008, it signed the last of a series of agreements affirming Russia&#39;s control over a Ukraine-sized region annexed from China in the 19th century. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The tilt towards confrontation began before Mr Xi took power, but he has accentuated it, making territorial issues central to his pledge of “national rejuvenation”. China has, without doubt, succeeded in altering the territorial status quo to its advantage in the short term. Its ships and aircraft now regularly patrol around rocky specks where its claims overlap with Japan&#39;s in the East China Sea. The seven fortified artificial islands that it built on disputed reefs in the South China Sea have enhanced its capacity to enforce its claims there. In some contested border areas, Indian troops no longer patrol.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Those gains have come at a cost, however, by alarming China&#39;s neighbours. Japan adopted a new security strategy in December which pledged a doubling of defence spending by 2027 and a new counterstrike capability, moving away from the pacifist principles it has embraced since the second world war. Japan is also co-ordinating more closely on defence with America, including over Taiwan, and stepping up security co-operation with American allies and other Chinese neighbours.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi&#39;s approach to the South China Sea has also triggered a change of course in the Philippines, the only formal American ally among the five countries whose claims there overlap with China&#39;s. Its previous president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a “separation” from America in 2016, pledging to align with China&#39;s “ideological flow”. But relations soured after China continued to harass Philippine ships and failed to build promised infrastructure.</p><h2> Leery on Luzon</h2><p class="article__body-text"> A new president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, is now re-emphasising relations with America. In February he gave it access to four new military bases, including three in its north that could be useful in a war over Taiwan. In April the two sides held their biggest-ever joint military drills, involving 12,000 American troops. They are planning to resume joint naval patrols in the South China Sea. China, meanwhile, has warned the Philippines that it is falling “into the abyss of geopolitical strife”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Vietnam also has claims in the South China Sea and had several maritime stand-offs with China there in the 2010s. It, too, has drawn closer to America militarily. In 2018 it let an American aircraft-carrier visit one of its ports for the first time in more than 40 years. Two more have visited since, including one in June this year. America has also supplied Vietnam with defence equipment, such as aircraft, drones and coastguard cutters.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is another neighbour reassessing ties, after a series of clashes with China on their disputed Himalayan frontier over the past four years, one of which killed at least 20 Indian troops and four from China. That was among the deadliest such skirmishes since China won a brief border war in 1962. Bilateral trade has continued to grow (by 8.6% last year), but India has limited investment from China, banned dozens of Chinese apps and launched tax raids on several Chinese firms.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is also now working more closely with America and its allies on defence, bilaterally and as part of the Quad, which includes America, Australia and Japan. During a state visit to Washington in June, Narendra Modi, its prime minister, signed a series of deals on the defence industry which could eventually turn India into a base for the joint manufacturing of Western-designed weapons. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s perturbed neighbours are also collaborating more closely with one another. India has trained Vietnamese submariners, supplied Vietnam with 12 high-speed patrol boats and agreed to give it a missile corvette. India also recently sold cruise missiles to the Philippines. Japan has provided patrol craft for Vietnam and radar for the Philippines, which has also received three navy ships from South Korea since 2020 and is getting several more.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBC748.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The economic picture is less clear-cut. China is an indispensable partner to all its neighbours, including those with conflicting territorial claims. Bilateral trade in goods with its 20 terrestrial and maritime neighbours was just over $2trn in 2022, an increase of 74% over the past decade. That is more than the combined trade of America and the <small>EU</small> with the same countries. In poorer ones, China is also a big source of investment. A trade deal called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which came into force in 2022 and involves China and eight of its neighbours, will further boost cross-border commerce.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But in aggregate China&#39;s neighbours sell more to America and the <small>EU</small> combined than they do to China (see chart). What is more, China has an unsettling habit of using its economic clout to punish neighbours that rile it. That, too, did not start with Mr Xi. An early example came in 2010, when China banned exports of rare-earth minerals to Japan after a clash in the East China Sea. Mr Xi, however, has expanded the practice. This week he imposed <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/04/in-its-tech-war-with-america-china-brings-out-the-big-guns" data-tegid="u20ml5uf91jhfh472n72p3vavb1eldrm">new curbs on rare earths</a> .</p></div><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230708_FBP002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Jiankou section of the Great Wall in Beijing, China" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mongolia was an early target for Mr Xi. After it hosted the Dalai Lama in 2016, China held up loans and customs clearances. Mongolia has since become even more dependent on trade with China, which buys about 84% of its goods exports (mostly coal). But Mongolia&#39;s government hedges through a partnership with <small>Nato</small> , which is helping it build cyber-defences, train officers in English and operate in conjunction with <small>Nato</small> forces (Mongolian troops have served in Kosovo and Afghanistan).</p><p class="article__body-text"> The row over the Dalai Lama also reinforced anti-Chinese sentiment in a country where many resent the treatment of their ethnic kin in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. A ban on teaching the Mongolian language there is especially unpopular. A former Mongolian president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, has called it an “atrocity that seeks to dissolve and eliminate Mongolians as an independent ethnicity”.</p><h2> Bruised in Busan</h2><p class="article__body-text"> But it is South Korea that stands out as an example of ill-judged Chinese arm-twisting. After Park Geun-hye became president in 2013, she sought closer ties with China, even attending a military parade in Beijing. Yet in 2017 China instituted an economic boycott after America deployed an anti-missile battery in South Korea, intended chiefly to deter North Korea, but which China also saw as a threat. Until then a regular survey by South Korea&#39;s Asan Institute that rates public views of other countries consistently gave China more than five out of ten. Last year it scored 2.7.</p><p class="article__body-text"> South Korea is now strengthening its alliance with America, and setting aside long-running differences with Japan, its former colonial ruler. The two are also joining American-led efforts to reduce China&#39;s role in their supply chains. That is creating new opportunities for others on China&#39;s periphery. Hyundai, a South Korean carmaker, said in May that it would invest $2.5bn in India over the next decade. And Vietnam (where South Korea is already the biggest foreign investor) said in December that Samsung and <small>LG</small> , two South Korean electronics makers, would invest another $6bn between them.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For China&#39;s poorer neighbours, investments in infrastructure help compensate for its domineering ways. Success stories include a cargo rail link across Central Asia that carries 8% of China-Europe trade, a railway from China to Laos, which began passenger services in April and could boost Laotian <small>GDP</small> by 21% according to the World Bank, and power projects that have increased blackout-prone Pakistan&#39;s generation capacity by 8 <small>GW</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet such initiatives are often undermined by a tendency to over-promise and to ignore local sentiment. In Nepal, China has not completed any of its promised Belt and Road projects. Malaysia has ditched several of them, alleging that costs were inflated. Debt problems related to Belt and Road have pushed Pakistan and Laos to the brink of default. And a civil war in Myanmar has delayed several big Chinese projects and further sapped support for China, which backs the hated military junta. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> China has also failed to stop shady Chinese businesses and criminal gangs from piggybacking on Belt and Road. Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines have all seen a huge influx of Chinese money and workers into gambling ventures, leading to an uptick in crime. They and other poorer neighbours still crave development assistance. But as China confronts an economic slowdown and scales back Belt and Road, many are looking to Japan, whose aid comes with less baggage.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A recent survey by Singapore&#39;s <small>iseas</small> -Yusof Ishak Institute found little faith in China among its South-East Asian neighbours. More people expressed distrust than trust of it in Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines. Japan was more trusted in all six of China&#39;s neighbours in the region and America more so in five. China also ranked below America, Australia and the <small>EU</small> as a place to visit or study.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even in Kazakhstan, which does well from its ties with China, people are wary. The tension is striking at Khorgos, a border crossing with a five-square-kilometre duty-free zone spanning the frontier. Rising mirage-like from the steppe, the Chinese side features two dozen multistorey malls selling everything from leather jackets to flat-screen televisions. It teems with Kazakh shoppers, closely watched by Chinese riot police with shields and batons. The Kazakh side, meanwhile, has only a couple of half-built low-rise malls, where customers are scarce and employees mostly Chinese.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Kanat Agibayev, a 22-year-old Kazakh law student, likes the cheap winter clothes and rucksack he just bought on China&#39;s side. But ask about Chinese investment in Kazakhstan, or a recent deal for visa-free access, and he echoes the fears of other interviewees: “We&#39;ll get swamped.” Russian propaganda fans such Sinophobia. But China has contributed, too, not least with its recent detention of up to a million Chinese Muslims, including ethnic Kazakhs, in re-education camps. In 2022 a survey by Central Asia Barometer found that only 35% of Kazakhs supported Chinese involvement in energy and infrastructure projects, down from almost half in 2018.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Then there are the chest-beating declarations of China&#39;s “wolf warrior” diplomats. In April alone China&#39;s ambassador in Manila appeared to threaten Filipino workers in Taiwan and the one in Paris questioned the legitimacy of former Soviet states. A month later Mr Xi hosted five Central Asian leaders at a summit infused with imagery from the Tang Dynasty, when China ruled much of Central Asia.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “It looked like an emperor receiving tribal chieftains,” says Bekzat Maqsutuly, a Kazakh activist detained for planning a protest against a deal signed at the summit permitting visa-free travel between China and Kazakhstan. A Kazakh official dismisses his complaints as “irrational”. Only 3,412 Chinese nationals work in Kazakhstan, government figures show. The visa deal will benefit Kazakh lorry drivers and business people as much as Chinese visitors. Even so, the official adds, Kazakhstan&#39;s future lies not in subordination to either Russia or China, but in close relations with lots of big powers, including America, Japan and the <small>EU</small> (Kazakhstan&#39;s biggest trade partner and foreign investor), as well as Turkey, which jointly produces weapons in Kazakhstan and is a member of <small>nato</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> None of this means that China&#39;s neighbours are turning their backs on it. Given its economic heft, that is unthinkable. But it points to a future in which Mr Xi&#39;s hegemonic ambitions are frustrated as the more stable and dynamic countries on his borders either resist his initiatives or hedge their bets, while the most volatile ones, with the dimmest prospects, become increasingly reliant on China&#39;s support. The challenge for America and its allies is to offer China&#39;s neighbours ever more ways to hedge. For Mr Xi, the question is more existential: can China accept relations with its neighbours in which it is anything less than pre-eminent? <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p>

Sustained price rises do not affect all asset classes equally, so a relative repricing will be required. But those one-off profits and losses will not be the only consequence. In the <a href="https://www.economist.com/economy">real economy</a> , inflation corrodes trust by continually and arbitrarily redistributing wealth. In the financial one this corrosive dynamic is less obvious, but just as real.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Central bankers remain adamant that they will return inflation to their targets, <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/04/04/the-fed-may-not-get-inflation-down-to-2-says-richard-clarida">typically 2%</a> . Many on Wall Street, though, are sceptical. Jean Boivin, who runs the research arm of BlackRock, the world&#39;s biggest asset manager, makes his argument bluntly. “Central banks can always bring inflation back to 2% if they really want to, but now it would require too big of a demand crush to bear.” He believes it will instead settle around 3-4%. Richard Clarida, vice-chair of the Federal Reserve from 2018 to 2022, has a similar view. “Mr Powell&#39;s Fed…will eventually get the inflation rate it wants,” he recently wrote for this newspaper. “But it is likely to be something more like &#39;two point something&#39; than &#39;two point zero&#39;.” Asked what “something” means, he replies: “It could be 2.8% or 2.9% when they start to consider rate cuts.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The likelihood of monetary guardians explicitly admitting that they will tolerate inflation above 2% is low. Every time Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is asked about the possibility, he vehemently denies it. Such a shift, especially with prices already rising much faster than 2%, would immediately damage the Fed&#39;s credibility: if the target can be ignored once, why not again?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet the forces ranged against central bankers, which will push up prices by constraining supply and boosting demand, are fearsome. Demographic trends are shrinking workforces in much of the rich world, which may lead to shortages of labour. The fragility of global supply chains—exposed by the covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and fracturing Sino-American trade—has incentivised countries to replicate them locally. On the demand side, higher defence spending, the investment required to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and the costs of supporting ageing populations are all increasingly seen as essential.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> Read more of our package on inflation:<br> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/22/investors-must-prepare-for-sustained-higher-inflation">Investors must prepare for sustained higher inflation</a><br> <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/21/britains-inflation-pain-is-mostly-self-inflicted-and-getting-worse">Britain&#39;s inflation pain is mostly self-inflicted and getting worse</a><br> <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/22/annual-inflation-of-114-is-pushing-argentina-to-the-right">Annual inflation of 114% is pushing Argentina to the right</a></p></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Rate-setters could, through ultra-high interest rates, destroy enough demand in other parts of the economy to bring inflation down to 2%. But with so many structural factors pushing prices up, the sceptics argue, this would involve inflicting a politically unacceptable level of economic damage. And the longer inflation remains above target the more it raises expectations of future price rises, which can then become self-fulfilling. The world may thus have entered a regime in which central bankers pay lip-service to their inflation targets but shy away from measures severe enough to meet them. In other words, 4% may be the new 2%.</p><h2> Another roll of the price</h2><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC540.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> An extra percentage point or two in the annual rate of inflation may not seem much. Yet the impact on investment returns is huge. Buy a ten-year government bond when inflation is 2%, and the principal that is eventually returned will be worth 82% of its original value. When inflation is 4%, that figure falls to 68% (see chart 1). Over the longer run the gap yawns even wider. The principal on a 30-year bond will, when returned, be worth 55% of its original value if inflation averages 2% over that time. With 4% inflation, it will be worth 31%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the erosion of the value of both the principal and the fixed interest payments is not the only way that higher inflation affects investments in bonds. Rising prices fuel expectations that central banks will raise rates, which in turn pushes yields in the bond market up to match those expectations. Bond prices are an inverse function of yields: when yields rise, prices fall.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The scale of this second effect would depend on the duration of the bond. If markets think central banks are prepared to tolerate slightly elevated inflation, they will assume there will be fewer increases in rates in the immediate future, not more. This expectation would push short-term yields down and prices up. Meanwhile, in addition to the expectation of higher rates eventually, the volatility and uncertainty brought on by higher inflation would raise the “term premium” (financial jargon for the extra yield long-term lenders demand in return for taking on more risk). The overall effect would be that, during the initial adjustment, bond portfolios with shorter durations would do much better than those with more distant maturities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Could inflation-linked bonds offer more protection? In theory, yes, though in practice there are not enough of them to go around. Inflation-linked Treasuries, for example, comprise just 8% of the total. And even these can fare badly under inflation that is not merely high but also volatile and unpredictable, if this instability prompts large swings in real yields. Last year was a case in point. Real yields soared alongside inflation, hurting the value of inflation-linked bonds alongside the vanilla sort. An index of inflation-linked Treasuries compiled by Bloomberg, a data provider, fell by 12% over the course of the year. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> On the face of things, shares are ideally suited to weathering spells of high inflation. They derive their value from the underlying companies&#39; earnings, and if prices are rising across the economy then those earnings, in aggregate, ought to be rising as well. Suppose inflation stays elevated but stable and the economy is otherwise humming along, says Ed Cole of Man Group, an asset manager. Managers should be able to control costs and adjust prices in response. And in any case, “Equities are nominal beasts. If the numbers are going up, everyone pats themselves on the back.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the very long run, data compiled by Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, three academics, for Credit Suisse&#39;s <i>Global Investment Returns Yearbook</i> back this up. Globally, between 1900 and 2022, stocks beat inflation handily, posting an annualised real return of 5%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But there is a snag: the higher inflation rises, the less stable it tends to be. Take American consumer-price inflation going back to 1913, when official data begin. After years in which prices rose by between 0% and 5%, the average inflation rate for the subsequent 12 months was within 1.8 percentage points of the first one. (So a year of 2% inflation was, on average, followed by one of between 0.2% and 3.8%.) When prices rose by between 5% and 10%, the average change for the subsequent year jumped to 3.8 percentage points. Inflation of 4% would leave little room for error.</p><h2> Once bitten, price shy</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Such volatility is much harder for businesses to handle. Mr Cole points to industries with high fixed costs, such as <small>IT</small> outsourcing, commercial services and construction, in which firms can do little to trim wage bills while remaining in business. If those costs rise in line with inflation, but revenues are slower to adjust, volatile inflation can generate big swings in margins and earnings.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Moreover, during individual periods of high inflation, the historical record is less comforting for shareholders. Between 1900 and 2022, in years in which inflation rose above around 7.5%, the average real return on equities flipped from positive to negative. Even when inflation was lower than this, it tended to reduce the real returns from shares. In other words, though stocks tend to outpace inflation in the long term, in the short term they do not offer a true hedge against it.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1198/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/394/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/591/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/788/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1182/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1261/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1576/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1970/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2522/90/media-assets/image/20230624_BBC509.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Real assets will fare much better if inflation remains high (see chart 2). Property and infrastructure generate income streams, in the form of rents and usage charges, that can often be raised in line with inflation or may even be contractually linked to it. As the supply of such assets is constrained, their real prices are also likely to rise as investors seek out assets that carry some protection against inflation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is also true of commodities. Measured by returns on commodity futures (financial contracts that give investors exposure to commodities without the hassle and expense of owning actual iron ore or cattle), this class of assets has historically done even better in real terms than stocks. In years of above-average inflation, the excess real return of a diversified portfolio of commodity futures over cash has averaged 11.4%. The asset class even tends to do well when high inflation combines with low or negative growth, with excess returns averaging 10% in such “stagflationary” years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The trouble with all such physical assets is the difficulty of investing in them. The total value of all commodity futures is less than $500bn—barely 1% of that of America&#39;s stockmarkets. Should investors pile into them en masse, they would push prices up enough to render the exercise futile. Infrastructure, meanwhile, is dominated by private investment managers, who tend to focus on selling to big institutional investors, such as pension funds and university endowments. Individuals, in contrast, struggle to buy such assets despite their appeal in a high-inflation world.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other vendors poised to capitalise on churn in the financial markets are active asset-managers. They have had a miserable time during the years of easy money that followed the financial crisis of 2007-09. Data compiled by Strategas Securities, a brokerage and research firm, show that in each year from 2010 to 2021, the majority of active managers who measure their performance against the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 share index failed to beat it. Such underperformance is not limited to America. <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> Global, another research firm, reckons that in the ten years to 2022, 90% of European active managers produced worse returns than the broader market.</p></div><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230624_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In part this is down to arithmetic. Overall market performance is the average of each investor&#39;s, which makes beating the index a zero-sum affair. On top of this, active managers charge fees (often 1-2% or more a year), which brings their average performance down—so in aggregate, they are likely to underperform. Even accounting for this, though, the years of rock-bottom interest rates and relentlessly buoyant markets were hard on stockpickers. “If everything goes up together, it doesn&#39;t matter how much skill you&#39;ve got,” says Luke Ellis, Man Group&#39;s boss.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By contrast, the return of high inflation and the volatility it brings allow skilled investors to outperform. In particular “dispersion”, or big differences in performance among different assets, offers active managers the chance to prove their worth. “Lots of people having a tough time doesn&#39;t mean a bad opportunity set,” says Mr Ellis. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Yet even Mr Ellis does not think that “you&#39;ll suddenly see 70% of active managers outperforming the index”. Many will be wrong-footed by macroeconomic conditions that they have never had to grapple with before. More insidiously, their clients will only gradually adjust to the wealth-destroying effects of inflation. Jeremy Grantham, a veteran fund-manager, recently wrote of his surprise that money-managers have not yet started to routinely adjust share-performance charts for inflation, as was routine in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Do so, and the numbers look much worse. Nominally, the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 index fell by 19% in 2022, but it would need to rise by more than 30% over the course of this year to recoup its losses in real terms. And as investors see chunks of their savings being eaten away by inflation, paying another couple of percentage points to their fund-managers will become much harder to stomach. Just as, in the real economy, inflation prompts consumers to suspect firms of profiteering, in the financial one it will pit both retail and institutional investors against those managing their money.</p><h2> Sugar and price</h2><p class="article__body-text"> A surprising winner from sustained high inflation, argues Martin Jaugietis of BlackRock, might be defined-benefit pension schemes, which in America hold assets worth some $17trn. Such schemes invest regular payments from workers and their employers in return for the promise of a set income in retirement (usually a fixed percentage of the worker&#39;s final salary). The financial health is determined by their “funding ratio”, or the value of their assets relative to the present value of the future payments they must make to retirees. As interest rates rise, this present value shrinks, since schemes can buy higher-yielding bonds, locking in cash flows that will help pay future liabilities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Provided their assets do not fall too much, the higher nominal interest rates brought on by persistent inflation would therefore be a fillip for defined-benefit schemes. This is especially true for American ones, says Mr Jaugietis, since they do not typically raise payouts to pensioners in line with inflation. Sure enough, in 2022 the funding ratios of American schemes improved markedly as inflation and interest rates rose, despite plunging asset prices. Even in Britain, where retirement payouts tend to be linked more closely to inflation, funding ratios shot up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet, as in the real economy, each winner from inflation creates a loser. In this case, the workers who have contributed to defined-benefit schemes that are not inflation-linked will lose out. After ten years of 4% inflation, someone who expected to retire with an income of $50,000 a year would see the purchasing power of that income fall by around a third. In effect the boon for defined-benefit schemes would be paid for by an arbitrary reduction in their members&#39; wealth. Many pensioners would be in the same position as workers who struggle to secure pay rises that keep pace with inflation, and just as aggrieved.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The final category of participants in financial markets that might welcome higher inflation is governments. The world over, their debt burdens have ballooned—first in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-09 and then during the covid-19 pandemic, on which the rich world spent 10% of its <small>GDP</small> . Europe&#39;s energy crisis has triggered yet more spending. Six of the <small>G</small> 7 group of large, developed economies have gross government-debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratios above 100%; only Germany&#39;s is below.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The only ways to chip away at these vast piles of debt other than inflation are turbocharged growth, tax rises or spending cuts. The first is unlikely; the others are politically painful. So governments may quietly rejoice as the real value of their debt is inflated away.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet in doing so, they risk falling foul of two groups. One is voters, whose savings lose purchasing power at the same time. The more immediate danger comes from the bond market. Investors in sovereign debt will be acutely aware that inflation is eating into their returns. Expect them to rake through governments&#39; fiscal statements with ever finer-toothed combs for signs that worse is to come.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Emerging-market countries are used to this treatment, and to the wild swings in borrowing costs and exchange rates it can bring. But for the rich world the adjustment would be painful. Britain&#39;s flirtation with disaster in September, when an irresponsibly inflationary budget sent gilt yields soaring and the pound through the floorboards, may offer a taste of things to come. Governments that lose the trust of lenders are in for a rough ride.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The idea that central banks might quietly allow inflation to fester, taking a chunk of society&#39;s stability and trust with it, may seem speculative. But look back at the past century and you will struggle to find an instance of inflation rising as far as it did in 2022, then immediately coming back under control. The trade-offs required to get it there look nightmarish. The generation of investors that is learning for the first time how to deal with elevated inflation may have plenty of time to study it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:19:54 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8k3epir6ho28rqm9q8euf2t5f9ibhnh7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/21/inflation-is-as-corrosive-to-investing-as-it-is-to-the-real-economy </item><item><title><![CDATA[Pretending that everything is under control in Russia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Founder of Wagner private mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin makes a statement in Bakhmut" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230610_FBP003.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Editor&#39;s note:</b> On June 23rd Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner, launched an open revolt against the Kremlin, accusing the Russian army of killing his troops.

A mixture of fierce repression and unrelenting propaganda have kept the public largely quiescent. But in recent weeks the war has been seeping into everyday life. In an affluent area in south-western Moscow military trucks roar past Teslas. Recruiters stationed outside supermarkets try to enlist passers-by in the army. At a speed-dating event young women complain of the difficulty of maintaining a steady relationship—because their boyfriends have been called up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> On May 30th a swarm of drones attacked Moscow. None hit its target: they were all either shot down or disabled by jamming. Some fell close to Barvikha Luxury Village, a posh suburb. Villages close to the border with Ukraine in Belgorod province have been shelled. A few have been briefly occupied by pro-Ukrainian militias making forays across the border. These incursions met little initial resistance: many of the troops who used to guard the border had been redeployed to Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-war">Ukraine war</a> .</i></p></aside><h2> Lieutenants at loggerheads</h2><p class="article__body-text"> There are also growing signs of disarray among Russia&#39;s elite. For months Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, a mercenary force fighting on Russia&#39;s behalf, has been denouncing Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, and Valery Gerasimov, Russia&#39;s top general, as incompetent foot-draggers. But his complaints are becoming steadily shriller. He recently claimed that Russian soldiers had laid mines behind Wagner&#39;s positions. Wagner has also released a video of a Russian officer, who looked as if he had been beaten, confessing that he had shot at a vehicle used by Wagner&#39;s forces while drunk. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The incursions in Belgorod have especially incensed Mr Prigozhin (pictured). “Why are tens of thousands of people, our Russian guys, dying advancing towards the West? So that we could start giving away, step by step, pieces of Belgorod province, our native Russian land? Why is everyone silent about the deaths of these civilians? Where is their explanation to the Russian people that we are handing over our territories and civilians to be devoured?”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has a habit of provoking conflict among his subordinates to reinforce his role as an indispensable arbiter. Mr Prigozhin also serves as a useful spur to the Russian army and as a scold for rich Russians unenthused by the war. But these conflicts typically do not spill into public view. Some speculate that Mr Prigozhin could be attacking the top brass in anticipation of territorial losses in Ukraine. By denigrating the generals, he may help deflect blame from Mr Putin. Alternatively, the bickering could be a reflection of infighting between powerful factions who sense weakness on the part of the arbiter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin has been keeping a low profile of late, presumably to avoid any association with military setbacks. A visit to a children&#39;s clinic and meetings with regional officials have been his only recent public appearances. His apparent lack of interest in the war and the noisy squabbling in the top ranks, whatever the reason for them, are likely to have a demoralising effect on Russia&#39;s soldiers and civilians alike. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAPBBeHQy_o?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Russia&#39;s propagandists have been trying to reassure the public, insisting that Russia had thwarted the Ukrainian counter-offensive before it had even begun. But their jaunty footage of destroyed Ukrainian tanks has been scorned by Mr Prigozhin and military bloggers. Big territorial losses will presumably lead to further tension within the Russian elites. A weakened Mr Putin, in turn, would probably resort to even greater repression to compensate for losses at the front. Mr Prigozhin is calling for martial law, a general mobilisation and the restoration of the death penalty.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What comes next will depend not just on the progress of the counter-offensive, but on the pliability of the elite and the mood of the broader public. Mr Putin has had little trouble suppressing dissent so far. But the many military setbacks and the public disagreements among his own henchmen make that job harder. “We are moving into uncharted waters,” an American official says. “And it is not just Ukraine that needs liberation, so does Russia.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:48:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

In both countries the fertility rate (the number of children a typical woman will have over her lifetime) fell below 2.1 in the 1970s. That level is known as the replacement rate, since it keeps a population stable over time. Anything lower will eventually lead to a declining population, something both Italy and Japan have suffered for about a decade. The median Italian is now 47; the median<!-- --> Japanese 49. Earlier this year, Kishida Fumio, Japan&#39;s prime minister, warned that the country is “on the brink of being unable to maintain social functions” because of its baby bust.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But Italy and Japan are no longer the most extreme examples of demographic decline. In 2022 South Korea had a fertility rate of just 0.8. A rate below one means that the next generation will be less than half the size of its parents&#39;. As recently as 2012 the <small>UN</small> projected that South Korea&#39;s population would shrink by only a fifth or so by the end of the century, from 52m today to 41m by 2100. More recent forecasts, however, suggest that the population will fall by more than half over the same period, to just 24m (see chart 1).</p><p class="article__body-text"> South Korea may be an exceptional case, but demographic decline is becoming commonplace. In 2010 98 countries and territories recorded fertility rates below 2.1. By 2021 the number had grown to 124, more than half of the places for which the <small>UN</small> collects data (see map). By 2030 it expects the tally to reach 136.</p></div><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="828" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/828/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/129/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/194/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/259/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/388/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/414/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/518/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/647/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/828/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBM967.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Matthias Doepke, an economist who studies the financial causes and effects of changes in fertility, notes that falling birth rates are no longer limited to richer countries or to wealthier families within a given country. “There&#39;s a global convergence in women&#39;s aspirations for careers and family life,” says Mr Doepke. Fertility rates for women with fewer years of formal education have fallen towards the levels of their more educated peers. In fact, women in America with exactly 16 years of schooling (mostly those with undergraduate degrees) have marginally fewer children on average than those with more schooling. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> By the same token, low fertility rates have spread from rich countries such as Italy and Japan to middle-income ones such as Thailand (1.3) and Brazil (1.6). Even more notably, India&#39;s fertility rate recently fell below 2.1 and is expected to keep falling. Since it accounts for a fifth of the world&#39;s population, that will have global repercussions. The 15 biggest economies in the world, including Brazil, China, India and Mexico, all have fertility rates below 2.1.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In 2021 there were 782m people aged between 21 and 30 in countries where fertility is below the replacement rate. By 2050 this group, in effect the potential number of home-grown entrants to the workforce, is expected to have dropped by a fifth, to 619m. This fall is not some subjective and questionable forecast: most members of that generation have already been born, and fertility rates do not tend to change rapidly. In countries in which the fertility rate is below 1.5, which includes almost all of East Asia and much of Europe, the decline will be more extreme, with the same cohort contracting by 37%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Instead of a population structure shaped like a pyramid, with each new generation bigger than the one that preceded it, or even a pillar, with all generations similar in size, these countries will become inverted pyramids, with older generations replaced by smaller and smaller cohorts. In parts of the world this has already happened: the number of Chinese aged between 21 and 30 has already fallen from 232m at its peak in 2012 to 181m in 2021. The decline will accelerate rapidly in the 2040s, leaving China with fewer than 100m people in the same pool in the mid-2050s. The population of Europe in the same age category will fall from around 85m to below 60m over the same period. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The obvious way to compensate for dwindling birth rates is <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/28/a-new-wave-of-mass-migration-has-begun">immigration</a> , which is on the rise in much of the rich world, despite the political tensions it has generated in recent years. But as demographic decline affects more and more countries, educated migrants will become harder to find, even as the shrinking of the native-born population accelerates in many rich countries. For China, with a population of some 1.4bn, the notion that enough immigrants could be found to reverse the effects of dwindling birth rates is fanciful. Although India&#39;s population is still growing, it will peak in the 2060s, if not sooner. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region of the world that seems likely to be a big source of potential migrants for many years to come. But even there, birth rates are falling more quickly than past projections predicted. Although immigration will continue to temper demographic decline in many countries for decades, in the long run, it cannot fully compensate for the baby bust in big economies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some of the consequences of these demographic shifts are well known. An ever greyer population will mean higher spending on public pensions and health care, but there will be fewer people of working age to pay the taxes required. The rich world currently has around three people between 20 and 64 years old for every one over 65. By 2050 this ratio will shrink to less than two to one. That will necessitate later retirement ages, higher taxes or both.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The economic consequences of demographic decline are not only fiscal, however. Labour is one of the three main determinants of growth, along with capital and the efficiency with which both are used (productivity). Shrinking workforces, other things being equal, automatically lead to lower economic growth. But demographic decline also has knock-on effects on capital and productivity that are much less well understood.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Many economists believe that a smaller working population will push down interest rates in real terms (meaning, after accounting for inflation), because there will be fewer investment opportunities and a large stock of savings accumulated by those in or near retirement. But others, such as Charles Goodhart, a former official at the Bank of England, believe the effect will be the opposite. As more people enter retirement and so stop saving but continue to consume, there will be less funding for investment, pushing real interest rates up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Both sides agree that an ageing population will reduce both savings and investment, but disagree about which will decline more quickly. But the balance of evidence points towards lower real interest rates: many developing economies still have decades of savings accumulation ahead of them, and retirees often cling to their savings rather than running them down. Either way, demographic changes will have huge implications for markets. Broadly speaking, low real interest rates are good for those who have already accumulated assets but bad for those still trying to save, including the increasing numbers of workers approaching retirement with inadequate nest eggs.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But it is on productivity that demographic decline may have the most troubling effect. Younger people have more of what psychologists call “fluid intelligence”, meaning the ability to solve new problems and engage with new ideas. Older people have more “crystallised intelligence”—a stock of knowledge about how things work built up over time. There are no precise cut-offs, but most studies suggest that fluid intelligence tends to peak in early adulthood and to begin to decline in people&#39;s 30s. Both types of intelligence are useful: companies, industries and economies need both youngsters able to respond to new challenges and seasoned veterans with a detailed understanding of their trade. But the two are not of equivalent value when it comes to innovation. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> In research published in 2021, Mary Kaltenberg and Adam Jaffe, both economists, and Margie Lachman, a psychologist, used a database of 3m patents filed over more than 40 years to explore the relationship between innovation and age. Depending on the scientific discipline, the authors note that patenting rates peak in a researcher&#39;s late 30s and early 40s. The rates of patenting then decline only gradually through their 40s and 50s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But for disruptive innovations, which fundamentally change a scientific field, the picture is very different. The researchers used<!-- --> a measure of disruptiveness based on the number of citations of a given invention in future patents. If a particular patent is cited by subsequent inventors, but that patent&#39;s technological predecessors are not, it is categorised as a disruptive rather than an incremental innovation. For instance, the work of Kary Mullis, a Nobel-prize-winning biochemist, on polymerase chain reactions underpins much modern genetic and medical testing. After Mullis published his work, citations of prior technologies in the same field nosedived. Mr Jaffe, Ms Kaltenberg and Ms Lachman find that patents filed by the very youngest inventors are much more likely to be completely novel, discipline-changing innovations, and that as inventors age the patents they file become increasingly incremental.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This matters, because innovation raises productivity. Improvements to existing processes and the invention of entirely new ways of doing things enable more to be produced with the same amount of labour and capital. In the long term, it is only by raising productivity that standards of living can be lifted. Demographic decline will chip away at that contribution over time by reducing the number of novel ideas stemming from the fluidly intelligent minds of young workers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even a fractionally lower rate of productivity growth will compound over the years to make an economy significantly smaller. During the particularly rapid post-war boom in economic growth in the rich world, between 1947 and 1973, productivity growth accounted for about 60% of the rise in output per worker in America, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany. America has grown much faster than the rest of the rich world since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, thanks in large part to its bigger gains in productivity.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If the decline in fertility was confined to a few countries, or a particular region, the impact on innovation might not be so severe. Technologies invented in one country eventually spread to others. The spinning jenny and the computer chip didn&#39;t have to be reinvented in every corner of the world to improve productivity globally. But the fact that fertility is declining simultaneously in a large proportion of countries means that the consequences in terms of reduced innovation will be felt globally.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some researchers believe such a demographically driven reduction in innovation is already under way in parts of the world. James Liang, a Chinese economist and demographer, notes that entrepreneurship is markedly lower in older countries: an increase of one standard deviation in the median age in a country, equivalent to about 3.5 years, leads to a decrease of 2.5 percentage points<!-- --> in the entrepreneurship rate (the proportion of adults who start their own business). That is a huge effect, considering the global entrepreneurship rate was around 6.1% in 2010.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What is more, this relationship does not seem to be simply a function of the relative lack of young people in ageing societies. Young people in such countries also seem to start businesses at lower rates than their peers in less wizened societies.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230603_FBC360.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> This phenomenon, according to Mr Liang, may be the cause of Japan&#39;s “entrepreneur vacuum”. As recently as 2010, Japanese inventors were<!-- --> the biggest producers of patents in 35 global industries, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation, a <small>un</small> agency. By 2021 they were the leaders in just three. Japan has fallen behind not only China, which now occupies most of the top spots, but America too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Looking only at the most novel fields, in which radical new innovations are most likely, makes the picture no better. In an analysis published by the London School of Economics&#39; Centre for Economic Performance, Antonin Bergeaud and Cyril Verluise note that Japan&#39;s contribution to genome editing and blockchain technology has shrunk to almost nothing. Once-leading roles in hydrogen storage, self-driving vehicles and computer vision (a form of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret images) have been reduced to supporting roles behind America, China or both (see chart 2).</p></div><h2> Needling nabobs of natalism</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Governments are largely powerless to reverse declining birth rates. Attempts in various countries to prod women to have more children have typically yielded meagre results. Research on the expensive support provided by governments in Hungary and Poland, in the form of income-tax credits and flat payments respectively, suggests a limited effect on fertility. Singapore offers large grants to the parents of new children, which now run to S$11,000 ($8,300) for the first two children, and S$13,000 for any more, on top of tax rebates and child-care subsidies. Parents are given priority over other buyers in subsidised apartment sale schemes. But Singapore&#39;s total fertility rate is just 1.0: whatever the effect of the policies, it is nowhere near big enough to avert demographic decline. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Of course, birth rates are not the only, or even the main determinant of productivity. If they were, some of sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s poorest economies would be the world&#39;s most dynamic. Levels of education, the reliability of legal and financial systems and the existence of networks of innovators interacting with one another all matter. Japan is still more innovative than many rich countries with a lower average age. But demography can magnify or muffle a country&#39;s underlying potential.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That suggests ways to counteract the effects of demographic decline on innovation, by focusing on other factors that increase productivity. The most obvious is education, which allows ageing societies to make better use of the dwindling pool of young people. Especially in middle-income countries such as Brazil and China, there are millions who do not receive proper schooling, and whose contribution to the economy is therefore small. The same is true, albeit to a lesser extent, in much of the rich world. No matter how intelligent they are, uneducated workers cannot hope to come up with groundbreaking ideas in medicine or computing, say. As the potential workforce shrinks, maximising the output of everyone in it will become essential, and could help offset the effects of an ageing population for some time, at least in the realm of innovation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Technology can also provide ways to cope with demographic change, from telemedicine to the increased use of robots in service industries. Such innovations can undoubtedly ease the difficulties presented by an ageing society, whether by directly contributing to the care of the elderly or by automating the roles of young workers. But the shrinking number of innovative young thinkers will, ironically, reduce the number of such valuable new ideas.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A shortfall in human innovation may also be less damaging if offset by new ideas conceived by artificial intelligence. There seems no doubt that machines will soon be working out how to make incremental improvements in existing processes—indeed, in some spheres, they already are. Whether machines will ever learn how to generate disruptive new ideas, however, remains a matter of debate.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Plasmon&#39;s film, about the last child in Italy, ends with a discussion of children as a symbol of hope. It directs viewers to a website that suggests policies to promote bigger families. The website, in turn, asks readers to sign a petition calling for action. Scarcely 8,000 have done so.

He has been widely heralded as the candidate with the best chance of defeating the favourite, Donald Trump.

In November he won re-election in Florida by a resplendent 19-point margin. In damning contrast, Mr Trump&#39;s attempts to play kingmaker in the midterm elections went disastrously wrong, with many of the candidates he endorsed losing races that the Republican Party had considered in the bag. Mr Trump appeared suitably deflated when he launched his presidential campaign on November 15th at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Back then some opinion polls put the two candidates neck-and-neck among primary voters. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZ8j_CZLFm8?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Six months later it is Mr DeSantis who has been stumbling. He has been criticised as an isolationist for dismissing the war in Ukraine as a mere “territorial dispute”, as an anti-corporatist for picking fights with Disney and as an extremist for signing a ban on abortion beyond six weeks of pregnancy. Mr Trump, meanwhile, has recovered his step, making a triumphant return to the campaign trail. He and his team have spent months pummelling Mr DeSantis. In retrospect, the governor&#39;s decision to wait until Florida&#39;s legislature had completed its annual session earlier this month before announcing his candidacy looks like a miscalculation, although the delay was in part to allow lawmakers to pass a bill permitting him to run for president without resigning as governor. During the long interlude he has endured a protracted beating on the airwaves without offering much defence. It is as if Brutus had overslept on the Ides of March, giving Julius Caesar a chance to put on his armour, but had tried to proceed with his hit job all the same. The plot to overthrow Mr Trump, which once seemed plausible, now looks forlorn.</p><h2> Lend me your cheers</h2><p class="article__body-text"> In 2016 Mr Trump ran as an insurgent. In 2020 he ran as the incumbent. For 2024, he is running as a hybrid of the two—insurrectionist and institutionalist all at once. It is proving to be a potent combination, which has helped to build a huge lead in the early polling. Among likely voters in the primary, Mr Trump retains the stature of a former president, but is also seen as the put-upon underdog, owing to his claims that the election of 2020 was stolen, his bans from social media and his <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/25/how-donald-trumps-trials-and-the-republican-primary-will-intersect" data-tegid="tc50p4ub3qvuq8tedqkquurcoq9ubbhu">many legal troubles</a> . Early stumbles, such as his lacklustre campaign launch and an embarrassing dinner with a white supremacist, have been righted by a new campaign operation that is more professional than the chaotic family affairs of Mr Trump&#39;s past runs. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> What is more, the Republican Party has been thoroughly Trumpified. This is especially true at the state level, where most of the rules for primaries are set. Unlike 2016, when the party establishment shunned Mr Trump, today he dominates the race for elite endorsements. Many big donors have defected to alternatives such as Mr DeSantis, but this is not as damaging as it sounds. Mr Trump will have no trouble raising money from his army of small-dollar donors and will again be able to portray himself as the authentic tribune of the people, assailed by the henchmen of the out-of-touch elite. Among the Republican base, he has universal name recognition and near-universal admiration.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This reverence for Mr Trump makes it difficult for his competitors to attack him. Most of them come not to bury Trumpism, but to praise it. But the resulting muddle blunts their appeal. Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, puts it this way, “Why would you go to see a Rolling Stones tribute band, when the Rolling Stones themselves are still on tour?”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Are the primaries over before they have begun? Some think so. “Hope is not a strategy,” says Rick Wilson, a former Republican operative who now runs the Lincoln Project, an anyone-but-Trump outfit. He thinks Mr Trump would have to be incapacitated to lose. “Donald Trump will start taking DeSantis&#39;s head off in debates and kicking it around like a soccer ball. And the Republican base voters want that show,” he says. Ask closeted anti-Trump Republicans around Washington how the primary will go, and many conjure scenes of brutality worthy of the Gallic wars.</p><p class="article__body-text"> More optimistic sorts, however, point out that there is still a long way to go, even if Mr Trump&#39;s chariot is building speed. “We&#39;re still months and months and months away from voting. National polls are pretty meaningless—they are going to mean something once voting has started,” says David Kochel, a Republican consultant based in Iowa (the first state to vote) who previously worked with Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush. Consultants for struggling campaigns swap Cinderella stories about late-breaking candidates who went from 2% in Iowa to 20% in the space of a month. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Early polls, it is true, do not predict the final results as well as later ones. But that does not mean they are useless. There is a correlation between early strength and the final results (see chart 1). At present, Mr Trump commands the support of almost 55% of primary voters according to a polling average constructed by FiveThirtyEight, a data-journalism outfit. That is more than 30 percentage points more than Mr DeSantis&#39;s average. In contested primaries over the past 40 years, six of the eight candidates who have polled above 30% this far ahead of the voting went on to capture their party&#39;s nomination. The two candidates who failed to capitalise on such big leads were Ted Kennedy, who ran against an incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, in 1980, and Hillary Clinton, who was eventually upstaged in 2008 by the charismatic Barack Obama. The Republican candidate who comes closest to both Carter-like incumbency and Obama-like magnetism this year is, of course, Mr Trump.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem is not simply one of a divided field. Although there are already six declared, halfway plausible candidates, with more to come in all likelihood, even a two-horse race would favour Mr Trump. Recent polling conducted for <i>The Economist</i> by YouGov finds that, in a head-to-head contest, Republican primary voters prefer Mr Trump to Mr DeSantis by 58% to 25%. And the former president&#39;s support is not at all reluctant or half-hearted. Fully 64% of Republicans want Mr Trump to run again, despite the many alternatives. Democrats, by contrast, are much less energised about Joe Biden, their presumptive nominee: only 53% of them want the president to run again.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In 2016 Mr Trump&#39;s opponents thought his outrageous statements and chaotic campaign would inevitably lead to political failure. That proved hopelessly Pollyannaish. Most now assume there is little that Mr Trump could say or do to alienate his base. But some opponents still hope that his campaign will implode because of the sort of messy infighting that characterised his entire time in the White House.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The hitch is that the chaos candidate is a bit more orderly this time. In 2016 Mr Trump&#39;s campaign attracted a fair number of charlatans. Current management is more stable. Susie Wiles, one of its leaders, ran Mr Trump&#39;s successful operation in Florida in both 2016 and 2020. She also headed Mr DeSantis&#39;s run for governor in 2018, when he was Mr Trump&#39;s protégé. There is little family involvement: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president&#39;s daughter and son-in-law, who served as senior advisers when he was in the White House, are not expected to play any part in the campaign. Mr Trump also has much more personal experience: this is his third run for president (fourth if you count his abortive campaign with the Reform Party in 2000). His Republican opponents are all running for the first time. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump&#39;s team is assiduous. “Shortly after I got elected, the next day or a couple of days later, I received a voicemail from President Trump congratulating me,” says Mike Brown, the chairman of the Republican Party in Kansas. The Trump campaign has been “exceptional” in communicating about the primary in the state, he says. The rules that will translate the results of individual state primaries and caucuses (in effect, decentralised party conferences) into votes for contenders for the nomination at the party&#39;s national convention are arcane and ever-changing. Unlike the Democratic primaries, in which a state&#39;s votes are typically split among the candidates in proportion to their share of the vote, many Republican primaries follow a winner-take-all system. That can turn a relatively narrow lead in terms of the share of the vote into a crushing dominion over delegates. While Mr Trump was president, he encouraged states to adopt such systems or other rules that help the front-runner. And the dates of the primaries keep moving even further forward, giving insurgent candidates ever less time to build momentum (see chart 2).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump&#39;s team has been seizing a march on its adversaries in other respects, too, diligently soliciting endorsements from senior figures in the party with calls and invitations to the imperial court at Mar-a-Lago. Such support was not forthcoming in 2016, but has been flooding in ahead of next year&#39;s contest. Mr Trump has already racked up the endorsements of 51 of the 222 Republicans in the House of Representatives and ten of the 49 Republican senators. His opponents have just seven representatives and two senators among them all. The Trump campaign takes particular pride in its success with Florida&#39;s delegation to Congress, who have largely spurned their state&#39;s governor. Eleven of Florida&#39;s 20 Republican representatives have endorsed Mr Trump, compared with just one for Mr DeSantis. Mr DeSantis and Mr Scott could not expect many endorsements before entering the race, of course, but they have a lot of catching up to do.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Operationally, at least, Mr DeSantis can certainly hope to catch up. He is a prodigious fundraiser, taking in an astounding $217m during his gubernatorial run in 2022, much of which went unspent. Because Mr DeSantis is the favourite among deep-pocketed donors (though his stances on abortion, Disney and Ukraine have irked some), he will rely heavily on an organisation called “Never Back Down”, a so-called super <small>PAC</small> that can take unlimited donations as long as it does not co-ordinate with the official campaign. A person familiar with Mr DeSantis&#39;s thinking says he could raise $250m between his official campaign and the super <small>PAC</small> . The mastermind of Never Back Down is Jeff Roe, the founder of a consultancy called Axiom Strategies, which worked on both the failed presidential campaign in 2016 of Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, and Glenn Youngkin&#39;s successful bid for governor in Virginia in 2021. Never Back Down is expected to carpet-bomb television with advertisements and also pay for the canvassers and organisers who must traipse around early-voting states for months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The official campaign will be run by members of Mr DeSantis&#39;s inner circle in Florida. The likely campaign manager, Generra Peck, headed his most recent campaign for governor. His polling guru will probably be another homegrown talent, Ryan Tyson. Mr DeSantis is the favourite to win the arms race for donations. He will have plenty of campaign veterans who know how to spend his takings.</p></div><h2> I came, I saw, I squandered</h2><p class="article__body-text"> If cash were all it took to become president, America would be midway through the first term of Michael Bloomberg, a tycoon and former mayor of New York who lavished $1.1bn on a failed campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Persuading Republican voters to defect from Mr Trump, as Mr DeSantis must now do, is a difficult task. Many obvious avenues of attack, the ones that might appeal to swing voters in a general election, are non-starters in the primary. Mr Trump&#39;s encouragement of the mob that stormed Congress on January 6th 2021 hardly imperils his standing in the party, most of which believes that the election of 2020 was stolen. Nor can his opponents make hay from the inquiries, investigations and lawsuits that have dogged the president since he left office, from the <small>FBI</small> ’s search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago to his recent indictment by Manhattan&#39;s district attorney for fraudulent book-keeping. These indignities, far from diminishing Mr Trump in Republicans&#39; eyes, have turned him into a martyr. Even political rivals like Mr DeSantis have felt obliged to come to his defence.</p><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Florida Governor Ron DeSantis listensduring a press conference to sign several bills related to public education and teacher pay, in Miami, Tuesday, May 9, 2023.

The old neoconservative and business-friendly order has been swept away. The other candidates&#39; failure to present a “value proposition”, says Mr Miller of the Trump campaign, “will impede their ability to build coalitions and actually go and challenge the president…Saying that you&#39;re Trump without the drama, which is kind of where it seems Ron DeSantis is going—that just doesn&#39;t work.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Presidential primaries are often popularity contests more than they are policy debates—and this one will be little different. All the candidates agree that Mr Biden is intentionally wrecking the country, that wokeness has run amok and that the southern border must be sealed. There are only modest signs of disagreement. Mr Trump is attacking Mr DeSantis from the left on fiscal matters, arguing that he will endanger Social Security (the state pension) and Medicare (free health care for the elderly), two sacrosanct programmes among older voters. Mr Scott is calling for less confrontational politics. More internationalist candidates such as Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, argue that continuing to back Ukraine is vital for America&#39;s national security. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Others are more isolationist than Mr Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy Indian-American entrepreneur from Ohio, says, “We&#39;ve got to be willing to ban most <small>US</small> businesses from doing business in China until the <small>CCP</small> [Chinese Communist Party] falls or until the <small>CCP</small> radically reforms itself.” That is a harder decoupling than the other candidates have proposed. He also wants to ban affirmative action, shut down the <small>FBI</small> and use the army to dismantle Mexican cartels that ship fentanyl across the border. Early polls show some success in peeling off Trump voters, but it is a delicate operation. “We rally behind America first for a reason. It&#39;s not Trump first,” says Mr Ramaswamy. “I&#39;m running against him, but to be clear, I still recoil at the idea that the nominee should somehow be the product of some plot of Republican donors.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the conspirators must at some point coalesce if they are to be rid of Caesar. In 2016 the fractured field, combined with winner-take-all primary rules, helped Mr Trump triumph. Whereas Democrats united behind Mr Biden in 2020 when it became apparent that Bernie Sanders, a left-wing ideologue, might secure the nomination, Republicans may be hard to corral. At the moment, Mr DeSantis certainly looks like the strongest rival to Mr Trump. But the other candidates seem much keener to attack him than the former president, for fear of alienating the base. Ms Haley has taken to denouncing Mr DeSantis for feuding with Disney, for instance. Other prominent Republicans, such as Kari Lake, a failed candidate for governor of Arizona last year, and Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, have taken to swiping at Mr DeSantis as well. They may be auditioning for the job of vice-president to Mr Trump, and see such attacks as a quick way into his good graces.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Despite his stumbles in recent months, Mr DeSantis is a clever and driven man. He may regain his lean and hungry look and let slip the dogs of war. Many voters will pay close attention to the televised debates, the first of which will be held in August in Wisconsin (although the former president may not participate). Mr DeSantis could point out that the national debt soared by $8trn during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency; that crime and illegal immigration both increased despite all the former president&#39;s big talk on both scores; that covid-19 was poorly contained and that another epidemic, of wokeness, became more rather than less contagious during his presidency.
