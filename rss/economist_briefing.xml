class="article__body-text">以色列情报部门未能预见到这次袭击的情况堪比 1973 年赎罪日战争的开始，当时埃及和叙利亚在犹太教最重要的节日同时发动了突然袭击。然而，平民丧生的人数却截然不同。 1973 年，那些入侵军队寻求的是夺取领土，而不是屠杀非战斗人员。在为期三周的战争中死亡的 2,656 名以色列人都是士兵。相比之下，本周哈马斯受害者中只有约 13% 是现役军人。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBD002.jpg"

公里的基布兹雷姆附近沙漠中的一个音乐节上，那里至少有 260 人被谋杀。 </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，哈马斯向该国发射了前所未有的迫击炮和火箭弹，在更广泛的地区散布了恐惧。 10 月 7 日至 9 日期间发射了约 4,500 枚爆炸性射弹——大约相当于 2014 年整个两个月战争期间的发射量——引发的大火从太空中都可见。 <small>NASA</small>卫星系统<small>FIRMS</small>于 10 月 7 日在以色列发现的火灾数量是过去十年中第二高的，仅次于 2020 年的一系列野火。大多数火灾集中在与加沙的边境地区，但有些甚至到达了特拉维夫南郊。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP503.jpg"

class="article__body-text">这次袭击使所有其他针对以色列平民的大规模谋杀事件相形见绌。以色列独立战争期间阿拉伯人犯下的最血腥暴行是 1948 年 5 月在以色列定居点 Kfar Etzion 发生的大屠杀，造成 127 人死亡。巴勒斯坦恐怖分子此前最致命的一次袭击是2002年在内坦亚市一家酒店的逾越节家宴上引爆的炸弹，造成30人死亡。10月7日的死亡人数已经超过了第二次起义期间以色列人死亡的总人数。巴勒斯坦起义从2000年持续到2005年。作为以色列人口的一部分，这相当于9月11日12日的袭击——每日死亡率只有全面战争、种族灭绝或自然灾害才能超过。</p><p class="article__body-text">最尖锐的历史比较是在以色列建国之前。并非所有哈马斯的受害者都是以色列人，也并非所有以色列死者都是犹太人。但根据对这次和之前袭击中被杀者的种族构成的合理假设，10 月 7 日之前最后一次在一天内杀害这么多犹太人是在大屠杀期间。 <span>■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>图表来源：

e190yofl0"><small>最初的几个</small><span>小时</span>很混乱。以色列南部靠近加沙边境的居民被火箭弹和迫击炮弹的声音吵醒。他们冲向避难所——在这个国家的这个地区，这是一个残酷的例行公事，但仍然是例行公事。几分钟后，他们听到枪声越来越近，并用阿拉伯语喊叫。这根本不是例行公事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他们家外的难以想象的场景也开始在社交媒体上流传：巴勒斯坦武装分子坐在一辆皮卡车的床上，驶过以色列城镇，向路人开枪；公共汽车站有一堆尸体，军事哨所也有一堆尸体。早上的时间持续得很长，但没有任何救援到来。疯狂的以色列人在他们的安全室里打电话给电视新闻节目，并小声询问他们的军队在哪里。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后，同样令人震惊的是关于绑架的报道。一位母亲说，她的两个儿子（其中一个只有 12 岁）被绑架并拖过边境。一段视频显示，一名老妇人开着高尔夫球车在加沙街道上游行，她僵硬的笑容掩盖了她的震惊，一名武装男子坐在她身后。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">死亡人数不断上升。近一周后，当局仍在清点尸体。在 Be&#39;eri 这个约有 1000 人的小基布兹，武装分子挨家挨户屠杀了大约 10% 的人口。在以北 8 公里的卡法阿扎 (Kfar Azza)，死亡人数可能更多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于以色列人来说，10 月 7 日是史无前例的一天。在这个面积只有 1000 万的国家里，有超过 1,300 人被杀。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history">死亡人数</a>超过了过去20年以色列和巴勒斯坦之间所有暴力事件中丧生的以色列人人数。另有 3,300 人受伤。以色列人曾认为控制加沙的巴勒斯坦伊斯兰组织哈马斯是一个可以控制的威胁。现在它发动了该国历史上最致命的恐怖袭击。中东最强大的军队失去了对自己城镇的控制，需要几天时间才能重新控制。当局已找到至少 1,500 名巴勒斯坦武装分子的尸体，超过一个营的枪手数量，他们设法冲过据称防守严密的边界。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着震惊逐渐变成愤怒，迫在眉睫的问题是以色列将如何应对。它已经开始了报复性空袭，造成 1,200 多名巴勒斯坦人死亡，其中许多是平民，并使超过 30 万人流离失所。以色列不会就此止步，尽管其军事选择毫无吸引力。未来几周，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人必将遭受更多苦难。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但 10 月 7 日的后果将更为广泛。这场大屠杀不仅可能重塑以色列对巴勒斯坦人的态度，也可能重塑其国内政治。它<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause">威胁到哈马斯对加沙权力的控制</a>；它还可能引发地区战争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">袭击以一连串火箭弹开始：几个小时内就发射了 2,200 枚火箭弹。这已经足够令人震惊了：哈马斯在 2014 年对以色列的战争中花了近一个月的时间才发射了这么多子弹。但以色列人很快发现这些发射是为更大规模的行动做掩护。推土机冲破了边境围栏，数百名武装分子涌了过去。其他人乘坐滑翔伞飞越它，或者乘坐小艇绕它航行。他们呈扇形散布到以色列城镇并开始杀戮。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列花了几个小时才组织防御。一些部队不得不从北部边境赶往南方。他们一抵达，就在集结地苦苦挣扎，而指挥官则试图制定作战计划。几位退役将军亲自动手，穿上旧军装，驱车前往被围困的村庄，进行临时反击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">甚至在收复自己的领土之前，以色列就开始对加沙进行空袭。总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡宣布以色列处于战争状态，他的政府开始为可能的地面进攻做准备。军队已动员了 36 万名预备役军人，并花了几天时间将坦克和其他装备运送到加沙边境。国防部长约夫·加兰特承诺全面包围加沙。 “没有电，没有食物，没有水，没有燃料，一切都关闭了。” 10 月 11 日，其唯一的发电厂燃料耗尽并关闭。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃雷兹是以色列和加沙之间的唯一过境点，已无限期关闭。以色列要求加沙平民通过与埃及接壤的拉法过境点逃离，但一再轰炸该过境点。无论如何，埃及严格限制允许过境的人数。即使在和平时期，巴勒斯坦人也很难离开加沙。现在这是不可能的了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当以色列军队准备在加沙作战时，必须密切关注其北部边境。 10 月 8 日，黎巴嫩的什叶派激进组织和政党真主党炮击了有争议的一小片领土沙巴阿农场。根据不成文的交战规则，沙巴发生的事情就留在沙巴：真主党可以表达对巴勒斯坦人的支持，但也可以向以色列表明，它不希望发生更广泛的冲突。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而一天后，以色列军队击毙了一群从黎巴嫩越境的枪手。三名真主党武装分子随后在以色列的报复性轰炸中被打死，导致该组织向以色列军队哨所发射火箭弹。双方可能都不想爆发战争，但升级并不总是符合逻辑。黎巴嫩民众纷纷囤积食物和燃料。以色列已撤离北部边境附近的城镇。哈马斯大声呼吁其他国家加入对以色列的攻击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列军队可能需要时间来准备，但对加沙地带的地面进攻似乎几乎是肯定的。以色列军队从 1967 年到 2005 年占领加沙，随后撤军，迫使约 8,000 名犹太定居者随之撤退。此后，以色列基本上封锁了该领土的空中、陆地和海上，同时允许一些巴勒斯坦人在以色列工作，并允许非威胁性的货物进入。 （埃及几乎也有同样的限制。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列最近一次入侵加沙是在 2014 年，目的是摧毁哈马斯在边界围栏下挖掘的用于渗透以色列的隧道。以色列军队并没有渗透到该地区很远的地方，该地区只有约10公里宽、40公里长，但却居住着200万人口。即便如此，这次行动还是表明地面攻击可能会出错。哈马斯部队袭击了拉法附近的以色列巡逻队，并俘获了一名军官哈达尔·戈尔丁。以色列随后连续几天炮击拉法，造成数十名巴勒斯坦人死亡。戈尔丁后来被宣布死亡。以色列人将此事件称为“黑色星期五”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即将到来的攻击将会更大。以色列可能部署两个装甲师和一个轻型空降师，每个师下辖五个旅。其中一些部队正在等待坦克和其他装备到达加沙周围的集结地。其他人在过去几天的战斗中遭受了损失。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">假设以色列领导人确实下令大规模入侵，一两个装备坦克的装甲旅可能会试图通过代尔巴拉附近最窄处（6公里）向西推进，将地带一分为二。其他两三个旅规模的部队（每个几千人）可能会集中在北部，包括加沙城周围，另外一两个部队则集中在南部的汗尤尼斯或拉法。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t

e190yofl0">他们的目标可能是针对哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战组织（一个独立的激进组织），重点关注空袭范围之外的领导人和基础设施。哈马斯声称其在加沙拥有数百公里的隧道。找到他们的入口并投放炸药将是首要任务。最大的挑战将是城市战，这是一项众所周知的艰巨任务。加沙的人口比伦敦或东京更稠密，为武装分子提供了很多藏身之处，而平民却没有多少地方可以避难。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯可能指望进行相对谨慎的袭击。该组织认为，以色列无法承受地面入侵造成的巨大伤亡。 “我们知道他们是胆小鬼，”驻卡塔尔的哈马斯高级官员穆萨·阿布·马尔祖克说。 “我们知道他们无法在地面上作战。”它还预计加沙地带100多名以色列和外国人质的存在将限制以色列军队。哈马斯希望用这些囚犯来交换以色列监狱中关押的 5,200 名巴勒斯坦人中的许多人（如果不是全部的话）。它还威胁说，每次以色列“在没有事先警告的情况下”轰炸加沙平民住宅时，就会杀死一名平民。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，最近几天灾难性的死亡人数可能会改变以色列的盘算。华盛顿智库布鲁金斯学会的纳坦·萨克斯表示：“以色列承担成本的意愿——而且是确切的——成本比过去高得多。”至于人质，许多仍在埋葬亲人的以色列人表示，他们没有心情与杀害他们的组织讨价还价。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">忽视后果自负</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，以色列不得不重新审视许多长期持有的假设，最引人注目的是认为加沙可以安全地任其恶化的信念。 2007年哈马斯从巴勒斯坦<small>临时</small>政府手中夺取了对加沙的控制权后，以色列和埃及大幅收紧了边境限制，窒息了加沙的经济。尽管此后暴力事件屡屡发生，但以色列官员开始认为哈马斯变得更加务实。 “最重要的是，他们希望保持对加沙的控制，”一名军官去年表示。 “要做到这一点，他们需要改善经济。”人们的想法是，如果以色列允许阿拉伯政府为加沙的基本社会服务提供资金，并为加沙人在以色列工作发放更多许可证，那么该领土将保持静止状态。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这种观点不仅完全错误，而且以色列自诩的安全部门也未能发现一场精心策划的袭击正在酝酿之中。加沙的每一个电话都通过以色列网络进行，这简化了窃听。无人机经常飞越该地带。以色列在该领土上也有庞大的线人网络，但都无济于事。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">毫无疑问，部分问题在于概念上的失败：认为哈马斯已经对大规模冲突失去了兴趣。事实上，甚至一些哈马斯领导人似乎也感到惊讶。阿布·马尔祖克表示，他和卡塔尔其他高级领导人事先并未获悉此次袭击事件。自2017年叶海亚·辛瓦尔成为加沙哈马斯领导人以来，少数主要在加沙的强硬派巩固了权力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个错误是本雅明·内塔尼亚胡(Binyamin Netanyahu)对巴勒斯坦人采取的分而治之的政策，内塔尼亚胡在过去14年中有12年担任以色列总理。长期以来，他一直试图削弱<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>，该机构仍然管理着约旦河西岸的部分地区。自 2014 年半心半意的谈判破裂以来，他一直拒绝恢复和平谈判。他冻结了<small>以色列</small>代表巴勒斯坦权力机构征收的税收收入的转移。与此同时，他将哈马斯视为加沙的合法势力。例如，2011 年，他批准了一项协议，用 1,027 名巴勒斯坦囚犯交换武装分子 2006 年抓获的以色列士兵吉拉德·沙利特 (Gilad Shalit)。这次交换自然提高了哈马斯在巴勒斯坦人中的地位。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于内塔尼亚胡先生来说，逻辑很清楚。巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>致力于与以色列谈判两国解决方案，这令总理的右翼支持者感到厌恶。削弱<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>并支持其激进竞争对手将有助于他声称以色列没有“和平伙伴”。但巴勒斯坦人却得到了一个不同的、但也是可以预见的教训：从以色列获得让步的唯一方法是通过武力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，哈马斯现在可能做得有些过头了。一些观察家认为，它没想到攻击会如此成功，并且不确定如何进行。它可能希望吓唬以色列让步，但实际上却让以色列做好了战争的准备。以色列军队10月10日告诉外国国防武官，其目标是“消灭”哈马斯的领导层。据参加会议的人士透露，军方的最终目标是摧毁哈马斯的能力，无论需要多长时间。然而，说起来容易做起来难，正如美国在阿富汗长期战争中或以色列在占领黎巴嫩南部 18 年期间所学到的那样。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="以色列-加沙边境附近，一名以色列士兵在一辆装甲运兵车旁祈祷。" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw"

e190yofl0">即使以色列能够铲除哈马斯，也没有人知道什么会取代它。巴勒斯坦权力<small>机构</small>太弱，无法在加沙维护权威；它甚至还不足以控制西岸，部分地区已经陷入无政府状态。大多数巴勒斯坦人和大多数加沙人都希望解散它。 87岁的总统马哈茂德·阿巴斯已经近20年没有踏足加沙了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">有人闲谈派遣阿拉伯维和人员保卫加沙，但很少有阿拉伯政权愿意这样做。 1949年至1967年埃及占领加沙；双方都对那段时光有着痛苦的回忆。沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋等海湾国家无意统治超过200万巴勒斯坦人。大多数以色列人也不希望重新占领该领土。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，入侵然后离开并不能改变现状。以色列人离开后，哈马斯的领导人和大部分武装人员可能会从他们的掩体中出来并恢复对巴勒斯坦领土的控制。这是一个令人难以接受的结果，但却是最有可能的结果。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于任何以色列政府来说，制定明确的前进道路都是困难的，尤其是现任政府。今年是政治严重动荡的一年。经过一年多的反对后，内塔尼亚胡在 11 月份的提前选举中赢得了多个席位。他领导的政府完全由右翼和宗教政党组成。他的国家安全部长伊塔马尔·本-格维尔因极端民族主义观点而被禁止在以色列军队服役。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">此后，内塔尼亚胡推行了一个分裂的议程，其中包括限制最高法院推翻政府政策的权力，以及赋予政客在法官任命方面更多的发言权。批评者称这是一场司法“政变”，并于今年每周六举行大规模抗议活动，直到 10 月 7 日被暂停。陆军预备役军人威胁要抵制他们的义务兵役（这一策略也已被搁置）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乐观者希望本月的大屠杀将有助于使以色列政治重新回到中间位置。纳夫塔利·贝内特 (Naftali Bennett) 的顾问希姆里特·梅厄 (Shimrit Meir) 写道：“在最黑暗的日子过后，如果能够达成和解，那就是以色列恢复理智、结束政治危机并组建联合政府。”贝内特于 2021 年接替内塔尼亚胡出任总理。短暂担任总理。内塔尼亚胡先生在 10 月 9 日的黄金时段讲话中敦促中间派政党“无条件”加入他的政府。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 10月11日，经过几天的谈判，领导第二大中间派政党民族团结党的前陆军参谋长本尼·甘茨同意加入“紧急政府”。但最大反对党 Yesh Atid 的领导人 Yair Lapid 迄今拒绝参加。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">团结在怀疑之中</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于两党来说，困境在于加入一个他们的支持者在过去一年里一直抗议的政府。内塔尼亚胡承诺不会推行任何与战争无关的立法，但拒绝抛弃他最极端的联盟伙伴。对于一位一如既往地关心自己政治生存的首相来说，这是有道理的。只要战斗持续，联合政府就会持续下去。内塔尼亚胡先生不想疏远他随后需要组建另一个右翼联盟的政党。甘茨先生无论如何都捏着鼻子加入，向缺乏军事专业知识的政府提供军事专业知识。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管这将暂时稳定政府，但最近几天发生的事件可能会结束内塔尼亚胡先生漫长且充满卷土重来的职业生涯。他花了一年的时间进行一场不必要的政治斗争，而不是关注真正的威胁——而在此之前的许多年，他一直在努力让巴勒斯坦成为一个无法解决的问题。安全是他的口号，十多年来他一直负责监督以色列武装部队和情报部门，只曾短暂中断过一段时间。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯则选择了凶残的虚无主义。与加沙领导人交谈就像进入了一个幻想世界，在那里加沙得到了“解放”，尽管其居民却被困在 365 平方公里的牢房里，陷入贫困。对以色列的胜利即将到来，在那之前，加沙人将欣然忍受他们的命运。自大屠杀发生以来，该组织明确表示，除了希望引发对以色列更广泛的攻击之外，除了持续暴力外，它没有任何计划。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">简而言之，正在发生的灾难似乎很可能暴露出双方思维的贫乏。唉，最近几天发生的令人震惊的流​​血事件，以及未来可能发生的更多恐怖事件，也将使采取更具建设性的方法来解决冲突变得更加困难。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“噢，</span><small>我们所有阿拉伯和伊斯兰国家的人民</small>，”哈马斯军事部门领导人穆罕默德·戴伊夫在该组织袭击以色列南部之际发布的一份录音声明中吟诵道。 “……任何有枪的人都应该把它拿出来的一天已经到来。现在是时候了。如果你没有枪，请拿起你的菜刀、斧头、斧头、燃烧瓶、卡车、推土机或汽车。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些人响应了他的号召。在埃及第二大城市亚历山大，一名警察枪杀了两名以色列游客和他们的导游。在以色列与黎巴嫩紧张的边境地区，发生了零星的战斗。从巴林到摩洛哥，哈马斯的支持者纷纷走上街头。在叙利亚首都大马士革，巴勒斯坦国旗照亮了歌剧院。在黎巴嫩的巴勒斯坦难民营中，游客们报告了狂欢节的气氛。在阿拉伯世界颇受欢迎的半岛电视台的所在地卡塔尔，流亡的哈马斯领导人跪倒在办公室地板上致谢，该电视台一直以毫不掩饰的钦佩之情报道暴行。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但哈马斯号召援助的阿拉伯和穆斯林军团还没有动静，至少现在还没有。一些阿拉伯政府已经或正在考虑与以色列正式实现和平。大多数其他人热衷于将敌意限制在纯粹的言辞层面。他们的秘密警察通常会压制任何抗议活动，担心示威者也可能反对他们自己的政府。此外，自2011年“阿拉伯之春”令人兴奋的抗议活动演变成混乱、分裂、暴力和镇压之后，阿拉伯“街道”仍处于疲惫不堪的状态。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，暴力和战争蔓延到其他战线，特别是黎巴嫩的危险依然严峻。以色列预计在加沙开始的地面行动可能是一个触发因素。一方面，美国正在认真对待这一威胁。它已在以色列附近海域部署了一艘航空母舰和其他军舰。中东的空军中队正在得到加强。紧急武器正在运往以色列。其目的既是为了表达对以色列的声援，也是为了阻止伊朗及其代理人参与其中。乔·拜登总统 10 月 10 日表示：“对于任何国家、任何组织、任何想利用这种情况的人，我都有一句话。” “不。不。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由宿敌伊朗及其在伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚和也门的代理人组成的所谓以色列“抵抗轴心”的成员正在为哈马斯的“胜利行动”欢呼，并暗示他们可能会加入战斗。但目前还没有人这样做。真主党是黎巴嫩的什叶派民兵兼政党，可以说是以色列边境上最强大的敌人，它知道它在 2006 年发起的支持哈马斯的战争对黎巴嫩造成了巨大的破坏。到目前为止，它还没有再次加入。由于经济崩溃，黎巴嫩无力应对另一场灾难。即使像真主党这样的国中之国也可能会犹豫是否要造成进一步的损害。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊朗也保持着干燥状态。它向真主党提供的12万至15万枚导弹和火箭可能主要是为了阻止以色列轰炸伊朗核设施。尽管伊朗发表了各种反以色列言论，但它从未为巴勒斯坦人发动过战争。加沙的一名哈马斯官员表示：“我们知道我们是（伊朗）的工具。”他指出，哈马斯和伊朗在逊尼派和什叶派穆斯林之间的宗派分歧上处于对立面。 “归根结底，我们只有<i>zawaj muta</i> ，一段临时婚姻。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，随着加沙战斗的加剧，轴心国采取更多行动的压力可能会增加。四个月前，真主党在黎巴嫩南部进行了一场大肆宣传的军事演习，练习占领以色列城镇。黎巴嫩安全专家希拉尔·卡尚表示，哈马斯现在这样做“让他们面临压力”。目前，跨境袭击的目的似乎是警告，而不是战争的开始。哈马斯发动袭击的第二天，真主党炮击了以色列在沙巴阿农场的阵地，这是一个有争议的边境地区，那里的战斗往往是自给自足的。其他地方也发生了更严重的交火，包括导弹和炮火。真主党报告称，其三名战士已被打死。以色列军队表示，还击毙了至少两名渗透者。问题是这些小冲突是否会升级为更大的事件。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">亚伯拉罕焦躁不安的孩子们</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊朗已经从哈马斯的屠杀中获益。它最大的担忧是其海湾邻国与以色列的和解。根据《亚伯拉罕协议》，以色列近年来与包括巴林和阿拉伯联合酋长国在内的几个阿拉伯国家实现了关系正常化。下一个获奖者是沙特阿拉伯，它是世界上最大的石油出口国，也是伊斯兰教两个圣地的所在地。上个月，沙特王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼表示，与以色列的协议即将达成：“我们每天都在更接近。”以色列部长已开始公开访问沙特阿拉伯。就在哈马斯袭击前几天，伊朗最高领导人阿亚图拉阿里哈梅内伊警告说，与以色列建立关系的国家正在将自己置于“危险之中”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">考虑到沙特阿拉伯国内民众的敌意，以及王子要求与美国签订正式防御条约和浓缩铀手段等要求，以色列和沙特阿拉伯之间的协议永远不会轻易达成。如果以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡向巴勒斯坦人做出沙特希望的让步，他也将面临失去极右翼联盟盟友的风险。尽管如此，破坏这笔交易可能是哈马斯发动袭击的主要目标之一。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果是这样，它可能已经成功了，至少在一段时间内是这样。华盛顿智库卡内基国际和平基金会的亚伦·大卫·米勒表示，美国促成以色列与沙特达成协议的能力“已降至零”。鉴于流血事件，任何以色列领导人都不会向巴勒斯坦人做出让步。沙特阿拉伯也将受到类似的限制，无论如何，穆罕默德亲王可能不愿意仓促与可能很快失去权力的美国和以色列领导人达成协议。由于“持续占领”，沙特外交部实际上将暴力归咎于以色列。 10 月 11 日，穆罕默德王子和伊朗总统易卜拉欣·莱西通了电话——这是他们第一次这样做。伊朗表示，他们讨论了“结束针对巴勒斯坦的战争罪行的必要性”；沙特方面表示，王子正试图“阻止局势持续升级”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管沙特阿拉伯对与以色列建立关系犹豫不决，但欧盟却因支持巴勒斯坦权力机构而陷入困境。巴勒斯坦权力机构管理着巴勒斯坦人控制的西岸部分地区，由巴勒斯坦竞争对手法塔赫领导。派别属于哈马斯。<small>欧盟</small>对<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>的援助正在接受审查，因为有人声称它可能资助极端主义。 10 月 9 日，欧盟扩大事务专员奥利弗·瓦赫利 (Oliver Varhelyi) 表示，价值数亿美元的付款已被暂停。他立即遭到<small>欧盟</small>最高外交官何塞普·博雷尔的反驳，博雷尔表示“惩罚所有巴勒斯坦人民”会损害<small>欧盟</small>。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">拜登和比比的B计划</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至于以色列的重要盟友美国，这场大屠杀使拜登和内塔尼亚胡之间和解了。拜登对以色列转向民族主义右翼以及针对遏制司法机构的大规模抗议活动感到担忧，此前曾试图限制与内塔尼亚胡的接触。现在，他给了总理很大的余地来采取军事反应。他在 10 月 10 日的电视讲话中宣称：“毫无疑问，美国是以色列的支持者。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登先生迫切关心的是确定有多少美国人被杀（已确认死亡 22 人）或被扣为人质（具体数字未知，但仍有 17 人下落不明）。第二个更广泛的目标是控制整个地区可能出现的冲击波。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登对以色列的拥抱可能在某个时候成为一种温和的克制形式。美国开始更加关注加沙平民的困境。拜登敦促以色列“在战争法范围内”行动，这是对以色列官员的一种含蓄的谴责，他们曾谈到“全面围困”并切断对该领土的食品、水和电力供应。美国敦促以色列和埃及开放某种人道主义走廊。细节尚不清楚，但有报道称，它正在倡导为美国公民和至少一些巴勒斯坦人提供离开加沙的安全方式。 “平民没有做错任何事。我们希望确保他们有出路，”白宫发言人表示。但埃及不希望出现人员外逃。其总统阿卜杜勒-法塔赫·塞西表示，巴勒斯坦问题的解决不应“以牺牲其他各方的利益为代价”。承认巴勒斯坦难民大量涌入将破坏埃及的稳定，并可能被视为为以色列对加沙的破坏性袭击铺平道路。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">动荡中的另一项克制努力涉及伊朗。也许是因为他们不想开辟另一条战线，美国和以色列官员表示，没有关于伊朗或真主党直接参与策划或指挥哈马斯袭击的硬情报。但拜登的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文坚称，“从广义上讲，伊朗是这次袭击的同谋，因为他们向哈马斯提供了大部分资金”，更不用说多年的训练、武器和其他支持了。一些报道称伊朗对这次袭击感到惊讶。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登上任时希望恢复一项限制伊朗核计划的协议，巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)不顾内塔尼亚胡的反对签署了该协议，但唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)撕毁了该协议。目前还没有达成协议，伊朗现在距离制造核弹更近了。 Hamas&#39;s horror now risks making him look like a dupe for even trying to negotiate with a regime that chants “Death to Israel”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indeed, Republicans are drawing a direct line between Mr Biden&#39;s Iran policy and Hamas&#39;s slaughter. They criticise him in general for easing Mr Trump&#39;s policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran. And they denounce him in particular for negotiating a deal to secure the release in September of five imprisoned Americans. This involved the unfreezing of $6bn in Iranian oil revenues in South Korea, now held in escrow in Qatar. The administration says the money has not yet been disbursed and will be used only to pay non-Iranian contractors for food and other humanitarian supplies. “Nobody in Iran will ever touch a single dinar or cent or rial from those funds,” insists a senior official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Never mind the facts. For Mr Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee, “American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks.” He later lamented, “We are perceived as being weak and ineffective, with a really weak leader.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That said, Republicans are not helping Israel much. Their divisions, and the approach of next year&#39;s elections, have made <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/paralysis-in-congress-makes-america-a-dysfunctional-superpower">Congress</a> more dysfunctional than usual. The Senate has not confirmed Mr Biden&#39;s nominee for ambassador to Israel, nor hundreds of senior military appointments. The budget process—including new military aid for Ukraine and possibly for Israel—is at a standstill. A government shutdown looms again in November. And at a rally on October 11th, Mr Trump himself called Israel&#39;s defence minister a “jerk”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Both out of sincere belief and to defuse Republican attacks, Mr Biden will hug Israel close. “Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond—indeed has a duty to respond—to these vicious attacks,” he argued. What then? Nobody can tell what Gaza, or the Middle East, will be like after Israel&#39;s retribution. Mr Biden will need a new strategy for the region now that Hamas has upended much of his old one. Israel-Saudi normalisation is set back. The “two-state” solution to the Palestinian question has all but vanished. A less hostile relationship with Iran seems impossible. And the president&#39;s hopes of turning away from the Middle East to focus on the great-power contests with Russia and especially China have been dashed. As America knows all too well, from its experience of Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, overreaction to bloodthirsty terrorism without a viable long-term plan can lead to disaster.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Less than a fortnight ago, in a different era, Mr Sullivan had declared with satisfaction: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.” He recognised that “all that can change” but boasted that he had to spend less time than any of his predecessors since 9/11 dealing with crisis and conflict there. Now he has joined them, somehow trying to contain the Middle East&#39;s entropy and violent politics. Mr Sullivan had sought to “depressurise, de-escalate and ultimately integrate the Middle East region”. But it all risks going into reverse: conflict, escalation and disarray could easily start feeding each other once again. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 10:15:23 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qj8bss66cemnue1fg97t246smbc9ibms</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause </item><item><title><![CDATA[The war in Ukraine is threatening to wash across the Black Sea]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20The%20Black%20Sea-a34b4b127b192d3ddc0d94d8286e7553.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们最近对<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的更多报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>W</span> <small>HEN RUSSIA</small> invaded Ukraine last year, the Black Sea seemed unlikely to become much of a battleground. The Ukrainian navy, after all, had only one warship, which it was forced to scuttle as Russian troops advanced on the shipyard where it was being repaired, in the city of Mykolaiv. Snake Island, a maritime outpost guarding the western approaches of Odessa, Ukraine&#39;s biggest port, fell to Russian attackers on the first day of the war. Odessa itself braced for an amphibious assault that would have cut Ukraine off from the sea altogether.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact the landings never came was the first sign that Russia&#39;s dominion over the sea was not as absolute as it seemed. A more ringing indication of that came in April of last year, when Ukraine managed to sink the flagship of Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet, the <i>Moskva</i> , using a newly developed anti-ship missile. Two months later intense Ukrainian bombardment drove the occupiers from Snake island. But it is only much more recently that Ukraine has begun to demonstrate a capacity to strike targets across the Black Sea.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In early August a Ukrainian naval drone—another new weapon—damaged a Russian landing-ship just off Novorossiysk, a big Russian port far to the east of the war zone. The following day another drone damaged a Russian oil tanker off Crimea, the peninsula that dominates the Black Sea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. On October 1st aerial drones struck a helicopter base in Sochi, some 600km away from the closest Ukrainian-held territory. Most dramatically of all, over the past month, Ukrainian missiles and drones have repeatedly hit targets across Crimea, culminating in the destruction of the headquarters of Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol on September 22nd.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia also seems to be intensifying the war at sea. In July it withdrew from a pact overseen by the <small>UN</small> whereby it allowed Ukrainian grain exports to pass safely across the sea. It has threatened to sink any cargo ships calling at Ukrainian ports and has repeatedly bombed Ukrainian docks and grain silos in an effort to throttle Ukraine&#39;s maritime trade. Since Russia and Ukraine both have the capacity to strike at shipping and since, as a diplomat puts it, the Black Sea is to grain what the Persian Gulf is to oil, an escalation in naval warfare could have a harrowing impact on global food markets. In fact, the Black Sea is also a big conduit for oil, and is central to the economies not only of Russia and Ukraine, but also Turkey and other littoral states. If it truly becomes a war zone, the world will feel the repercussions.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Sea gall</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For the most part, the war in Ukraine has been dominated by infantry, tanks and artillery, as well as long-range drones and missiles. But even though the six amphibious assault ships that Russia deployed to the Black Sea just before the outbreak of hostilities have not been used, the threat to Ukraine&#39;s southern shores has in some ways shaped the conflict. For one thing, the possibility of a coastal landing meant that Russia could menace Ukraine from three directions, and obliged Ukraine to spread its forces thinly in response.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Much the same logic has applied to the war in the skies. Excluding Iranian-made drones, around a fifth of all Russian missile strikes on Ukraine between January and March of this year originated at sea. Attacking from the sea, as well as from land and air, has allowed Russia to place a greater stress on Ukraine&#39;s air defences, which have to watch for attacks from every direction bar the west.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s response has in some ways been a triumph. The sinking of the <i>Moskva</i> has obliged Russia to keep its ships away from the shore. And the steady bombardment of Sevastopol has turned a huge naval base into something of a liability. Several ships previously berthed there have been pulled back to Novorossiysk. “They are like mice running away,” scoffs a Ukrainian naval officer. Ukraine has achieved “the functional defeat of the Russian Black Sea Fleet”, crowed James Heappey, Britain&#39;s junior defence minister, this week. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">But for all its successes, Ukraine&#39;s main goal, to ensure that cargo ships can come and go safely from Odessa and its other ports, remains elusive. After Russia withdrew from the <small>UN</small> ’s grain initiative, Ukraine set up a new shipping route that hugs its coastline until the Romanian border to the west of Snake Island (see map). The intention is to keep civilian vessels as far from Russian guns as possible, and to get them as quickly as possible into the territorial waters of Romania, a member of <small>NATO</small> , where Russia would presumably hesitate to launch attacks. So far ten ships have come to Odessa this way, loaded grain and set sail again, without incident, despite Russia&#39;s threats.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A senior Ukrainian official tells <i>The Economist</i> that intelligence indicates Russia is planning an attack on civilian shipping, in an attempt to disrupt the new export route. Russian warships can fire missiles with a range of 2,500km, which would allow them to strike cargo vessels from a safe distance. By the same token, Russia can use submarines to lay mines even if its surface ships are forced to stay away, suggests Sidharth Kaushal of the Royal United Services Institute ( <small>RUSI</small> ), a think-tank in London (although Ukrainians argue that the shallow waters along the new export route would make that difficult). Even if Ukraine were somehow to sink the entire Russian fleet, missiles fired from Crimea could easily destroy a lumbering cargo ship off Odessa.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another Ukrainian official notes that Russian strikes on Ukrainian ports are already raising insurance premiums across the Black Sea: “Insurers see where things are headed. They are not daft.” But, adds the first, “Two can play at this game.” Ukraine has warned that, if Russia attacks civilian vessels, it will retaliate in kind. It has been demonstrating its capacity to hit distant naval targets not to escalate the war in the Black Sea, he says, but to deter Russia from doing so. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The stakes for both countries are high. Before the war, roughly 60% of Ukraine&#39;s exports passed through its ports on the Black Sea. The volume of trade has since contracted dramatically, both because of the Russian blockade and because of the broader disruptions caused by the war to farms, factories and infrastructure. Even when the grain initiative was operating, Ukraine&#39;s exports were a fraction of what they once were (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some of the missing volumes have been diverted to barges on the Danube river. Ukrainian officials say they are managing to export over 3m tonnes of grain a month in that way at the moment. Another 1m tonnes is being exported by train and a smaller amount by lorry. But these alternatives are all much slower and more expensive than piling giant freighters with cargo. The cost of exporting a tonne of grain by river barge, for example, is roughly $120, versus $30-40 for exports by sea. Russia is bombing the new routes as well. What is more, Ukraine simply does not have adequate road, rail and barge capacity to substitute for deep-sea ports. The result is a further blow to an economy already gutted by the war, and further loss of tax revenue and foreign exchange for a government that is borrowing unsustainably.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Russia has a lot to lose as well. More than 80% of its grain exports and about 30% of its oil exports pass through ports on the Black Sea. These shipments have barely been affected by the war so far. Russia&#39;s military force in Syria is also dependent on fuel and supplies shipped via the Black Sea. This “Syrian express” probably ranks high on Ukraine&#39;s list of potential targets should the war at sea expand in scope.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Crimea and punishment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To inflict serious injury on the Russian economy, Ukraine does not need to sink all Russia-bound ships, but simply to damage enough of them that insurance premiums shoot up and Russian ports become commercially unattractive. “We don&#39;t have the drones to stop all Russian trade. But if you are asking if we can dramatically increase the financial stakes? Sure, no problem,” says a Ukrainian official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That would be bad not only for Russia, but also for global food markets. In the early stages of the war, they were gripped by panic. After all, when fighting broke out, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for an eighth of the calories traded worldwide. In 2021 they were the world&#39;s first and fifth biggest exporters of wheat, shipping 39m tonnes and 17m tonnes respectively—28% of the world&#39;s traded supply. Both also grow a lot of grain used to feed animals, such as maize and barley, and are the top two producers of sunflower seeds, giving them an 11.5% share of the vegetable-oil market.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Within days, the invasion sent wheat prices to more than $12 a bushel, up from $7 two months before; the cost of maize shot to its highest in a decade. This was largely because of the Russian blockade of Ukraine&#39;s ports on the Black Sea. Traders also feared that the war and Western sanctions might impede Russian exports. Many, including <i>The Economist,</i> warned that global food shortages were looming.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Agricultural markets are much calmer now, despite the growing risk of escalation in the Black Sea. Wheat currently costs little more than $5 a bushel, less than it did before the war began. In fact, prices fell back to pre-war levels during the summer of 2022 and have stayed there since.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That was less because of the <small>UN</small> ’s deal to revive Ukraine&#39;s grain exports than because of bumper crops elsewhere. Russia, whose farming industry is exempt from Western sanctions, harvested an unprecedented 100m tonnes of wheat in 2022. Other countries, from Brazil to India, also enjoyed bumper crops.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This year looks much the same. Ukraine is growing less wheat than before the war and its exports are down sharply because of the scrapping of the grain deal. But Russia has again produced a bountiful harvest, as have many other exporters. Whereas last year crops were threatened by La Niña, a climatic phenomenon that often saps yields in big cereal-growing regions in the northern hemisphere, this year, notes Carlos Mera of Rabobank, a Dutch lender, the reverse pattern, El Niño, promises more benign conditions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Attacks on commercial shipping in the Black Sea would doubtless send prices leaping again. Insurers would raise their rates or refuse to underwrite cargoes at all. Grain would not be the only casualty: some 2m barrels of oil and a further 1m barrels of refined petroleum products are exported through the Black Sea every day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the effects might again be short-lived. The Russian government is already insuring lots of the oil tankers that visit its ports, to help shipping firms evade Western sanctions. It could do the same for other exports as well. Despite rising tensions and Western pressure, lots of shipping firms are willing to transport Russian goods, says Matthew Wright of Kpler, a ship-tracking firm. What is more, Russia has a very dense network of oil pipelines. It could probably divert a good part of the oil that is normally shipped across the Black Sea to terminals in the Baltic. (The refined products would be harder to move around in this way.)</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> War and peas</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Transporting grain by road from Russia&#39;s farming heartlands in the west to distant terminals in St Petersburg, the Baltics or the Pacific would be slow and prohibitively expensive. (Ukraine already struggles to truck much smaller volumes over shorter distances.) But Russia has several grain terminals on the Black Sea and the adjoining Sea of Azov, so it could use an ever-shifting assortment of ports and shipping routes to keep cargoes out of harm&#39;s way. Given that Russia has struggled to choke off Ukraine&#39;s grain exports despite its vastly superior navy and air force, it is hard to imagine Ukraine snuffing out Russian trade.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For all these reasons, Viktor Kurilov of Rystad Energy, a consultancy, reckons attacks on commercial shipping might cause crude-oil prices to rise by only $5-7 a barrel before settling $1-2 above where they would otherwise have been. Wheat markets might be jolted more severely, at least for a time. That would not be painless: the brief spikes in food prices last year, the <small>UN</small> calculates, helped lift the number of people around the world facing severe hunger by 65m. But a lasting cataclysm is unlikely. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="The Russian Navy's submarine Rostov-on-Don sails in the Bosphorus, on its way to the Black Sea, in Istanbul, Turkey" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Not so Bosporous any more</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A critical variable in all this is the stance of Turkey, in effect the gatekeeper to the Black Sea. Under a treaty called the Montreux Convention, Turkey is obliged to let commercial shipping pass unhindered through the Bosporus and Dardanelles, the narrow straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. But the treaty places restrictions on the number and size of transiting warships. When war breaks out on the Black Sea, it gives Turkey the power to prevent belligerents from sending in reinforcements and to close the straits entirely to warships from non-littoral countries. So when Russia invaded Ukraine it barred Russia from reinforcing its Black Sea fleet, but also stopped <small>NATO</small> countries from sending in ships, despite being a member of the alliance itself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With the collapse of the grain deal, Turkey is under pressure to help prevent Russia from strangling Ukrainian trade. Bulgaria and Romania, two <small>NATO</small> members with coastline on the Black Sea but relatively weak navies, would welcome a show of force from the alliance. Some Ukrainians are calling for Western naval convoys to protect commercial shipping.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Turkey is loth to allow anything that increases the risk of a broader conflagration and that antagonises Russia. By sitting on the fence, Turkey&#39;s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has won valuable concessions from his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Russia let Turkey delay some payments for Russian gas, worth perhaps billions of dollars, a sop that helped Mr Erdogan conceal the scale of his economic mismanagement before elections earlier this year. Turkey&#39;s refusal to join other <small>NATO</small> members in imposing harsh sanctions on Russia has also been lucrative: trade between the two countries nearly doubled last year, to $62bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some analysts suspect that Mr Putin also promised Mr Erdogan that Russian troops sent to enforce a ceasefire would instead stand aside as Azerbaijan, Turkey&#39;s main regional ally, seized control of a disputed province from ethnic-Armenian rebels in late September. “Turkey is using Russian weakness to extract concessions,” says Yoruk Isik, who runs Bosphorus Observer, a consultancy. “As long as it continues to get them and as long as trade with Russia continues,” he adds, “Turkey will do its best not to confront Russia.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia is equally reluctant to rock the boat, as it were. If Russia were to attack commercial shipping, the pressure on Mr Erdogan to allow <small>NATO</small> ships into the Black Sea would increase dramatically. One thought holding Mr Putin back may be the risk of pushing Mr Erdogan into a less accommodating position.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is just another way in which neither side is likely to prevail completely in the war at sea. Ukrainian drones will continue to embarrass Russia, but the Russian navy will remain a menace to Ukrainian cities and shipping. Russia can probably push insurance rates sky-high, reckons Mr Kaushal of <small>RUSI</small> , “irrespective of how uncomfortable the Ukrainians can make Sevastopol”. And although naval battles will never be the main focus of the fighting, fears of an alarming flare-up will always linger. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 12:47:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/97jfa8dn922bjn2g8mhdcjrmmn7m7i22</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/05/the-war-in-ukraine-is-threatening-to-wash-across-the-black-sea </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Microsoft could supplant Apple as the world’s most valuable firm]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Microsoft-37a9c1204ae8d2f12b81da6615461597.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>or years</small> Microsoft has been trying to coax office workers to write reports, populate spreadsheets and create slide shows using its office software. No longer: now it wants to do the writing and populating for them. At its headquarters in Redmond, a leafy suburb of Seattle, the firm demonstrates its latest wizardry. Beyond the plate-glass windows, snow-capped mountains glisten and pine trees sway. Inside, a small grey rectangle sits at the top of a blank Word document. With a few words of instruction, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> )—or “Copilot”, as Microsoft calls it—finds a vast file in a computer folder and summarises its contents. Later, it edits its own work and succinctly answers questions about the material. It can perform plenty of other tricks, too: digging out emails on certain topics, drawing up a to-do list based on a meeting and even whipping up a passable PowerPoint presentation about your correspondent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is a glimpse into the future of work. The mind-boggling capabilities of “generative” <small>AI</small> look set to transform many desk jobs. It is also a glimpse into the future of Microsoft, which was once the world&#39;s most valuable public company and hopes to reclaim the title by selling the technology that will power the transformation. Through the firm&#39;s investment in Open <small>AI</small> , the startup behind Chat <small>GPT</small> , a popular <small>AI</small> chatbot, it is able to inject cutting-edge <small>AI</small> into its products.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pilot whale</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That does not just mean adding the Copilot to its office-work software (previously called “Office”, but recently rebranded as “Microsoft 365”), which will be rolled out in November. This week the firm will launch a Copilot for Windows, its operating system, which will be able to change your computer&#39;s settings, generate images and summarise web pages. Copilots for its sales software and human-resources offerings are already available. One for its security software is in the works. In February Microsoft added Chat <small>GPT</small> -like functions to Bing, its search engine, in effect another Copilot. With its squadron of Copilots, Microsoft is inserting generative <small>AI</small> into almost every aspect of its business. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">This is perhaps the biggest bet any company is taking on <small>AI</small> . The prize is potentially huge. Copilots could transform the world of work for the 1.2bn people who use Microsoft 365 and the 1.4bn who use Windows. This would allow Microsoft to bring in new customers and charge them more. That, in turn, could drive business to Azure, Microsoft&#39;s high-margin cloud business, possibly helping it overtake Amazon Web Services ( <small>AWS</small> ) to become the world&#39;s biggest cloud firm. It could even help Microsoft&#39;s valuation above the current $2.3trn, potentially closing the gap with Apple, currently the world&#39;s most valuable firm (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In effect <small>AI</small> offers Microsoft a tantalising chance to do something that has eluded it until now, and bring together all that it offers, argues Mark Moerdler of Bernstein, a broker. Teams, Microsoft&#39;s video-conference service, might be more attractive to <small>IT</small> managers than Zoom, a rival, if it features a Copilot that can sort through employees&#39; emails in Outlook and summon up information from their Word documents and PowerPoints. All this wizardry can also be channelled through Azure, further boosting Microsoft&#39;s business.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nonetheless Microsoft is also taking a big gamble. Next year its capital spending is expected to jump by almost two-fifths, to about $40bn. That is a near-record 16% of the firm&#39;s revenue and a higher share than any other tech giant save Meta, the parent of Facebook. Much of this will be spent on new <small>AI</small> chips and high-performance networking to go into the 120-odd extra data centres it plans to bring online. Whether such an investment will pay off is an open question. For all their promise, Copilots still have plenty of problems. At the demonstration in Redmond the <small>AI</small> -generated slide show described your correspondent as “ <small>CEO</small> of <small>ABC</small> Inc”, which he definitely is not. Competitors, in particular Alphabet (the parent of Google), are eyeing up all the same markets. As the battle over the future of work heats up, Microsoft&#39;s position is enviable but not unassailable.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Putting itself in that position has been a long endeavour. Microsoft&#39;s heyday was in the 1990s. The dominance of Windows as an operating system combined with a cut-throat business mentality made the firm mighty but roundly despised. A period of stagnation followed, as it lived off the revenue from Windows. When Satya Nadella took over in 2014, he shook things up. Windows would no longer be the firm&#39;s main focus. Instead the company was reorganised around Azure, with blockbuster programmes, such as Office, shifting to the cloud. This involved an enormous build-out of data centres. Microsoft&#39;s capital spending went from 6% of revenue in 2014 to 11% five years later. Crucially, the firm moved away from a walled-garden approach. Mr Nadella allowed Microsoft&#39;s software to run on other operating systems, such as Google&#39;s, Apple&#39;s and Linux, an open-source rival to Windows.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All the while Microsoft was also investing in <small>AI</small> . It first announced it was working with Open <small>AI</small> in 2016; it has since invested $13bn, for what is reported to be a 49% stake. The deal not only allows Microsoft to use Open <small>AI</small> ’s technology, but also stipulates that Open <small>AI</small> ’s models and tools run on Azure, in effect making Open <small>AI</small> ’s customers into indirect clients of Microsoft. And it isn&#39;t just Open <small>AI</small> . Microsoft has bought 15 <small>AI</small> -related firms since Mr Nadella took over. That includes paying $20bn for Nuance, a health-care firm with cutting-edge speech-to-text technology, in 2022. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Today Microsoft&#39;s business relies on three divisions for growth. The first is Azure. For the past five years it has been closing in on <small>AWS</small> (see chart 2). Cloud spending is slowing as <small>IT</small> managers tighten purse strings. Despite this, in the most recent quarter the business grew by 27% year on year. Microsoft does not reveal Azure&#39;s sales, but analysts think that it accounts for about a quarter of the firm&#39;s revenue, which hit $212bn last year. Gross margins for its cloud business are also secret, but Bernstein puts them at a lofty 60% or so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second is Microsoft 365, which also accounts for about a quarter of revenue. That has been growing by about 10% a year of late, thanks to take-up among smaller businesses, especially in service industries such as restaurants. The third source of growth is cybersecurity. In earnings calls Microsoft executives have said it accounts for roughly $20bn in revenue (about a tenth of the total). That is more than the combined revenues of the five biggest firms that provide only cybersecurity. What is more, revenues are growing by around 30% each year. (Microsoft&#39;s video-game arm, which brings in $15bn a year, is also set to grow substantially now that British antitrust regulators have signalled they will approve the long-delayed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, another gamemaker, for $69bn.)</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Blue fine-tuner</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Using Azure as the underlying infrastructure for Microsoft&#39;s other businesses has helped spread costs, streamline operations and boost profits. Since 2014 operating margins have risen from 29% to 43%—higher than other titans of tech (see chart 3). That has excited investors. During Mr Nadella&#39;s tenure Microsoft&#39;s market value has risen by about $2trn. Microsoft&#39;s price-to-earnings ratio, an indication of investors&#39; expectations of future profits, has more than doubled during Mr Nadella&#39;s reign, to 32. That is higher than the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 average, and more than all tech titans bar Amazon, whose figure is skewed by its paltry earnings. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Cheerleaders say Microsoft has two big advantages when it comes to generative <small>AI</small> . The first is the range of software it sells. Asking a single chatbot to peruse emails and spreadsheets to pull together a slide show is much easier than dealing with different <small>AI</small> helpers for each programme.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, Microsoft has a first-mover advantage. It has been quicker to deploy <small>AI</small> than rivals, thanks to its tie-up with Chat <small>GPT</small> and possibly also because Mr Nadella feels that it was slow to react to smartphones and the cloud. Whatever the reason, Microsoft&#39;s speed has made Open <small>AI</small> the default for big firms trying out the technology. A recent survey of <small>IT</small> managers by JPMorgan Chase, a bank, found that over the next three years they expected 56% of their spending on generative <small>AI</small> to go to Microsoft compared with 13% for <small>AWS</small> and 12% for Google Cloud Platform ( <small>GCP</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another survey by Sequoia, a venture-capital firm, of 33 startups that it invests in, found that 90% of them used Open <small>AI</small> . Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley, a bank, argues that an ecosystem is beginning to form around Open <small>AI</small> ’s <small>GPT</small> -4 model. That includes consultants who specialise in its tools and recommend that clients use them, as well as software sellers, such as HubSpot, which build bespoke programmes that use Open <small>AI</small> ’s models.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is some evidence for the idea that Copilots could help cement Microsoft&#39;s lead. In June 2022 it launched a code-generating Copilot on GitHub, a repository for code which Microsoft had bought in 2018 for $7.5bn. The model was trained using the reams of code stored on GitHub. It has quickly become an essential tool for software developers. In a survey, 90% of users told GitHub that the Copilot improved their productivity. The firm also conducted a small study that found that coders completed tasks 55% more quickly when using the tool. Some 27,000 businesses have a subscription, twice the number of three months ago. It is so popular in tech circles that the term “copilot” has become shorthand for an <small>AI</small> assistant, whether provided by Microsoft or not.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Microsoft says firms testing a Copilot for its “productivity” software (meaning, for email, spreadsheets, word-processing and the like) report similar benefits. Kate Johnson, the boss of Lumen, a telecoms firm, describes it as a “step function change” in the way her staff work. She uses it to look back at Teams meetings and see whether quieter employees are being given a chance to speak. It also takes instant minutes and draws up to-do lists for attendees. That helps with accountability, adds Ms Johnson: the tasks staff were meant to complete after the last meeting are “right there for everyone to see”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Copilots can also act as software coaches, teaching workers how to insert charts in spreadsheets, for example. The goal is that they will eventually be able to learn users&#39; preferences and even their writing style. “We hope one day to deliver a highly effective alter ego—an agent that knows you deeply,” Mr Nadella wrote in his book “Hit Refresh”, published in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All this does not come cheap. At $30 per user per month, Copilots may mean a 52-83% mark-up, depending on the software package a firm uses. Jason Wong of Gartner, a research firm, says, “That is expensive compared to the licences but cheap if it is going to save you hours a week.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other way Microsoft will make money from Copilots is from the underlying infrastructure. In May it announced its “Copilot Stack” on Azure. This makes it easy for developers to build Copilots in their own applications or to create “plugins” for Microsoft&#39;s Copilots. The hope is that lots of firms use this infrastructure, sending much more business to Azure. Another advantage of this “platform” approach is that Microsoft may be able to strike deals to use the data of Azure&#39;s clients to bring, say, legal expertise into a Word document or email. That creates an advantage that “competitors are going to find very difficult or impossible to replicate”, a research note from Bernstein argues.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Hammerhead</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the second quarter of the year <small>AI</small> added roughly $120m to Microsoft&#39;s cloud revenues. That is expected to double in this quarter. In 2025, Mr Weiss estimates, <small>ai</small> could boost revenue by $40bn, largely through Azure&#39;s <small>AI</small> tools and 365&#39;s Copilots.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such growth would not be cheap. New Street Research, a firm of stockmarket analysts, reckons that Microsoft is the biggest customer of Nvidia, the world&#39;s largest seller of <small>AI</small> chips. Its research suggests that Microsoft spent roughly $3bn on Nvidia&#39;s <small>AI</small> chips in the second quarter of 2023, up from about $1bn in the first quarter. In a call with investors in July, Amy Hood, the chief financial officer, noted that the <small>AI</small> build-out is putting pressure on Microsoft&#39;s puffy margins in the cloud. That is being offset, she says, by more efficient data-crunching. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft&#39;s head of cloud and <small>AI</small> , says, “We are seeing inference costs [those related to asking an <small>AI</small> model a question] going down and expect to see that continue and models get more accurate and more efficient.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if spiralling costs are contained, there are plenty of other risks. Competition is white-hot. One battle is for the $340bn market for business software. In May Google announced Duet for Workspace, its version of Copilots. Last week it released features allowing Bard, its chatbot, to access user&#39;s Gmail inboxes and Google Docs. Salesforce, a software giant, has Einstein. Slack, a messaging app and one of Salesforce&#39;s subsidiaries, has Slack <small>GPT</small> . ServiceNow, whose software helps firms manage their workflow, has Now Assist. Zoom offers Zoom Companion. Intuit is selling Intuit Assist. Startups such as Adept and Cohere offer <small>ai</small> assistants, too. Open <small>AI</small> launched its enterprise-focused Chat <small>GPT</small> in August.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Supplying the infrastructure to underpin such <small>ai</small> offerings will be another battlefield. <small>AWS</small> and <small>GCP</small> both offer access to <small>AI</small> models similar to those of Open <small>AI</small> . Analysts suspect these rivals have more experience deploying specialist <small>AI</small> chips than Microsoft.

The head of <small>IT</small> at a big oil-and-gas-services firm says he stopped employees from using GitHub&#39;s Copilot after his firm was sued in November for breach of copyright. Microsoft, for its part, has agreed to cover customers&#39; legal fees related to its Copilots, provided they use Microsoft&#39;s safety features, such as content filters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Models can also get things wrong. Microsoft has reduced such problems by training them on accurate, up-to-date information and including more citations. But that did not prevent your correspondent&#39;s promotion to <small>ceo</small> . Jared Spataro, who is in charge of Microsoft&#39;s productivity software, says that Copilots entail an “entirely new way of working”, in which the machine helps you produce more “but it isn&#39;t always right”. Humans must be alert to this and, if necessary, make corrections.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A third concern is data governance—making sure that only the right employees get access to the right information. An analyst notes that some early users of Copilots are discovering “really scary” results. Imagine personnel files or confidential emails coming up in a search, say.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is also the near-certainty that Microsoft will be accused of abusing its market power. (Endless competition headaches plagued its previous period of ascendancy, in the late 1990s.) The firm is already fighting on many fronts. In August it announced that it would “unbundle” Teams from its software packages, after complaints from Slack triggered an <small>EU</small> investigation. Customers have also complained about the way Microsoft&#39;s software licences nudge companies to use Azure, rather than <small>AWS</small> and <small>GCP</small> . Brad Smith, Microsoft&#39;s president, has called this a “valid concern” and the firm says it has made changes. But in June Google submitted comments to a probe by America&#39;s Federal Trade Commission, claiming that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in clients”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These types of disputes will no doubt intensify as <small>AI</small> -powered software becomes prevalent. If a Windows Copilot steers users to Outlook rather than Gmail, say, trustbusters may cry foul. The upshot of this could be to weaken Microsoft&#39;s ability to use a breadth of software offerings to make Copilots more useful, one of its big competitive advantages.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even so, Microsoft is in a strong position. It failed to seize on the advent of smartphones and was slow to grasp the potential of the cloud. Today it finds itself poised to exploit a technology that could transform the world of work. It must maintain a delicate balance, moving faster than competitors while ensuring that its advance into <small>ai</small> does not upset regulators, sap profits or ruffle clients. If it slips, plenty of rivals are ready to take its place. But if it succeeds, the reward will be huge. The Copilot will be the captain of its fortunes. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 18:27:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4faffuah59d4el3mb71mfc4bt67a2pr8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/27/how-microsoft-could-supplant-apple-as-the-worlds-most-valuable-firm </item><item><title><![CDATA[Western help for Ukraine is likely to diminish next year]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Ukraine%20and%20the%20West-1b5f0cd51f99f30c3e14c553e42eaefb-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们最近对<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的更多报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>T</span> <small>he end</small> keeps receding. There was a time when some Ukrainian officials, having halted Russia&#39;s army outside Kyiv, thought it would take only a few more months to bring the war to a conclusion. “Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year,” predicted Lieutenant-General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of military intelligence, in May 2022. By last November, shortly after a spectacular Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defence minister at the time, was still expecting a swift victory. “My feeling is that by the end of the spring, this war will be over.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact, Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive did not even begin until June. Far from hastening the war&#39;s end, it has demonstrated just how long the fighting could drag on. Ukrainian forces, stymied by Russian minefields and other defences, have inched forward on foot. The deployment of reserves and spiffy Western weapons has not yet yielded any big breakthroughs. Wet weather and a shortage of ammunition will probably bring the Ukrainian advance, such as it is, to a halt by late October, if not earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another fighting season beckons. “We must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,” warned Jens Stoltenberg, <small>NATO</small> ’s secretary-general, on September 17th. “It&#39;ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine,” agreed Mark Milley, America&#39;s top general, the same day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America insists it will stay the course for “as long as it takes”, as Joe Biden, the president, has put it several times this year. Britain, France, Germany and other allies have all used the same phrase. As ironclad as these pledges sound, they depend on two uncertain variables. One is the West&#39;s ability to furnish Ukraine&#39;s army with enough weapons and ammunition. The other is the political will to keep handing them over.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the first. Russia&#39;s defence industry moved onto a war footing in the last quarter of 2022, says Richard Connolly, an expert on Russia&#39;s economy, who points to a big jump in steel production. British officials say that Russia can now produce around 200 tanks a year, twice as many as they had previously assumed. Mr Connolly says that, with refurbished tanks included, the true figure is probably 500 to 800. Western sanctions are not crimping output much, he adds, with crucial components such as semiconductors smuggled in via Hong Kong or Central Asia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In principle, Ukraine&#39;s friends should have no trouble helping it outgun Russia. The combined <small>GDP</small> of <small>nato</small> ’s members is 12 times that of Russia, even after accounting for Russia&#39;s lower prices. The difference is that Russia is willing to spend much more heavily on the war: military spending now takes up almost 40% of the national budget, far in excess of Western levels. <small>NATO</small> countries are trying to redress this imbalance by investing in arms production, which has been neglected since the cold war ended. But there are two snags.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One is cost. Estonia spends around $5,000 to $6,000 on every new artillery shell, says Kusti Salm, the senior civil servant in the country&#39;s defence ministry. That is relatively cheap by <small>NATO</small> standards, he notes. Russia, he says, spends 60,000 roubles, or around $620. The vast difference is largely down to cheaper labour and materials, lower quality products and lower profit margins for arms manufacturers, most of which are state-owned. Inflation is exacerbating the problem. “Prices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up,” complained Admiral Rob Bauer, a <small>nato</small> bigwig, on September 16th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second issue is timing. “After a slow start,” says Mr Connolly, “Russia has reached race pace and they&#39;re in gear now. They&#39;re now going to start churning stuff out at the rate approximating what they need.” American and European investments in new capacity, having started later, will not yield much extra supply until the second half of 2024 or 2025, giving Russia more time to mobilise, build new defences and pin down Ukrainian forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take the case of artillery shells. The good news is that American and European production is soaring. American officials say that their own output has risen from an annualised rate of 168,000 shells in the spring to 336,000 today. It will continue to rise, thanks both to new facilities and to more intensive use of existing ones. European production is set to double by the end of this year or the start of next, according to Estonia&#39;s defence minister. Between them, America and Europe should comfortably produce nearly 2m shells next year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shell shock</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trouble is, that is barely enough to keep up. Russia will produce 1m-2m shells next year, according to British estimates. That is on top of a stock of around 5m shells, new and refurbished. That should allow it to fire at least 15,000 rounds a day for a year, says Mr Salm. That is roughly on a par with Ukraine&#39;s heightened consumption during its counter-offensive, according to people familiar with the data. But Ukraine can probably sustain that tempo for only a couple more months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The gap could be bridged by borrowing from elsewhere. Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive was enabled by a massive transfusion of South Korean shells. America and its allies have discreetly purchased arms and ammunition from non-aligned countries such as Egypt and Pakistan on Ukraine&#39;s behalf. But such ready sources of weaponry are running out. Western armies&#39; stockpiles have been depleted, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the Western arms industry ramps up, this problem should ease. By 2025 there might even be a “glut” of shells, says a Western official. If most of the new output goes to Ukraine, and assuming that neither China nor North Korea bails out Russia, the Ukrainian army might then be able to out-pulverise the Russian army for the first time in the conflict. But 2025 is the military equivalent of a lifetime away. Next year, meanwhile, Ukraine will probably struggle to mount a big offensive.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The year after next is also a lifetime away in terms of politics. In Europe, the political winds seem favourable to Ukraine. Polls conducted in June and July showed that 64% of Europeans favour military aid to Ukraine, with strong support not just in countries with a long-standing suspicion of Russia, such as Sweden (93%), but also in more distant member states such as Portugal (90%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some hard-right parties, such as France&#39;s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and Germany&#39;s Alternative for Germany ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ), cast the conflict as a waste of European resources. “The German public is paying three times over for this war,” complains Gunnar Lindemann, an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> member of Berlin&#39;s regional assembly, “supporting 1m refugees, carrying huge energy bills and sending weapons to Ukraine.” Both parties are rising in the polls, but both remain far from power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Olaf Scholz, Germany&#39;s chancellor, has been mindful of anti-war sentiment, notably within his own Social Democratic Party. He dithered for months before agreeing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. He still refuses to send long-range Taurus missiles, even though Britain and France have given Ukraine comparable weapons. Yet Mr Scholz has by now realised that public scepticism is mushy: as soon as he sends a new weapon, approval broadly follows. On September 18th his government announced another €400m ($429m) of arms, including ammunition, armoured vehicles and mine-clearing equipment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Emmanuel Macron, France&#39;s president, who provoked grumbling in Kyiv last year over his frequent phone calls with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, and over his hesitation in sending weapons, is now among the most gung-ho of European leaders. France has long resisted expanding the <small>EU</small> , yet Mr Macron has become a fervent supporter of Ukraine&#39;s accession to the bloc. A poll in July showed that 58% of the French backed this approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s bid for <small>eu</small> membership is proceeding at a pace that would have astonished Europe-watchers just a few years ago. It formally became a candidate to join in June, 2022. This December, barring a shock, that status will be upgraded by the opening of detailed negotiations on accession. Ukraine is dazzling <small>EU</small> officials with its swift progress on the necessary reforms. It may still take years for Ukraine to become a fully fledged member, but the war seems to be speeding up the process rather than delaying it. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives at Skrydstrup Airbase in Denmark" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Now for Congress to get on board</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: EPA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In America, however, the outlook is much more divided and uncertain. On August 10th the White House asked Congress to authorise another $24bn “supplemental” budget for Ukraine, which would bring total American aid thus far to $135bn. Supporters of such assistance, among both Democrats and Republicans, constitute a clear majority of both chambers of Congress. Were the request put to a simple up-or-down vote, it would be approved relatively easily.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is unlikely to be, because of America&#39;s dysfunctional politics. A majority of the members of the House of Representatives may support Ukraine, but a small number of Republicans hold extreme anti-Ukrainian views, including Matt Gaetz, who has proposed inviting Russia to join <small>NATO</small> , and Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conspiracy theorist who has promoted the absurd notion that aid to Ukraine is actually being siphoned off by donors to the Democrats. Since the Republicans have only a slender majority in the House and since the Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, does not want to rely on Democratic votes to push legislation through, the pro-Russia fringe has much more influence than its numbers would imply.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The likeliest course is for Mr McCarthy to attach the supplemental budget to other important legislation, making it harder to derail. Past efforts in the House to deny Ukraine funding have been overcome, although each one attracts more Republican votes. Mr Biden already has congressional approval to send a further $6bn-worth of weapons to Ukraine from existing stockpiles. But after that there is likely to be a delay of several months while Congress contorts itself over the latest request. What emerges may be dribs and drabs of aid, rather than the big packages of last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the longer run, aid for Ukraine is fast becoming a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain. Republican voters, egged on by the scepticism of Donald Trump, their party&#39;s likeliest nominee for president next year, have begun to question further aid to Ukraine. Democrats remain broadly supportive. The big budget deficit and high interest rates make politicians of all parties reluctant to rack up more debt. And even Democrats support the notion that America&#39;s European allies should be the ones taking the initiative in conflicts on their own borders.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And then there is the possibility that Mr Trump wins next year&#39;s election. His policy on Ukraine is characteristically incoherent. In March he promised that he would settle the war in “no longer than one day”, before even entering office. “We don&#39;t have ammunition for ourselves,” he complained in May, “We&#39;re giving away so much.” But he denies he would push for a deal allowing Mr Putin to keep Ukrainian territory. “Nobody was tougher on Russia than me,” he said this week, insisting he would strike “a fair deal for everybody”. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Nevertheless, Western officials worry that Mr Putin will wait to see whether Mr Trump becomes president again before agreeing to negotiations. That scenario is already provoking frenetic debate in Europe. “If the United States tried to force a negotiated settlement on Ukraine,” argued Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage, a pair of Russia experts, in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> recently, “Europeans would have little capacity to resist.” Others say this is unduly fatalistic. French officials argue that, should America end its support for Ukraine, although Europe cannot replace American military aid gun for gun and missile for missile, the prudent and rational thing is for Europe to try to preserve its options by boosting arms manufacturing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The question is whether Europe alone can drum up enough cash and weapons to keep Ukraine going. Although America provided the lion&#39;s share of aid for much of the war, the latest analysis from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, finds this pattern has reversed. Europeans have long dispensed more financial aid. They are now providing more aid of all sorts, thanks in part to the <small>EU</small> ’s recent €50bn pledge, a multi-year commitment which stretches to 2027 (see chart).</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Money isn&#39;t everything</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the figures do not tell the whole story. America has been the fulcrum of the allied effort to support Ukraine, chairing the regular meetings at which donations of weapons are pledged and co-ordinated at Ramstein, an American military base in Germany. It has provided diplomatic cover for other countries&#39; aid: Mr Scholz, for instance, insisted that he would not allow German-made Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine unless Mr Biden first sent some American <small>M</small> 1 <small>A</small> 1 Abrams tanks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In some cases Europeans have sent arms to Ukraine on the understanding that they will receive new American weapons to replace the donated ones. America&#39;s security guarantees, underwritten by nuclear weapons, have given Europeans the confidence to stand up to Russian threats. Finally, America has provided vital intelligence that has helped Ukraine find and destroy high-value targets, from generals to warships. Substituting for this organisation and assistance would be a Herculean task.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may be unavoidable. “The assumption of the West was—and I think everyone has been unspoken on this—was that we give them everything we can, then they will go on this one large offensive and whatever happens at the end of this we will settle for that,” says Mr Salm, the Estonian official. “That was the plan.” A new one is required, he suggests, involving not just more arms, but also more technology to offset Russia&#39;s advantages in mass, bolder sanctions, such as expulsion from the Paris Olympics, and new training that learns from the mistakes of the summer.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Above all, a change in mentality is needed. “This is exactly what a war of attrition is about: convince the West that we can out-suffer you, we can out-fight you, we can out-last you. They know the weak points of democracies,” Mr Salm says. The task, he believes, is to persuade Mr Putin that the opposite is true. “We, as the Ramstein coalition, are 25 times richer, stronger and [more] technologically advanced than Russia…It&#39;s not that we are empty-pocketed here.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:38:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/e4olb392cfef30qkihtvtnms801edpp4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year </item><item><title><![CDATA[To endure a long war, Ukraine is remaking its army, economy and society]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Ukraine-33237edecb896a72ccd71824180b0500.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们最近对<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的更多报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>I</span> <small>n the autumn</small> sunshine Kyiv looks glorious. The leafy streets are full of life: café terraces bustle and hipsters throng the bars of Podil, a trendy neighbourhood. The odd air-raid siren aside, the main signs of the 18-month-old war with Russia are rusty tanks turned into makeshift war memorials and the various men in uniform enjoying some leave with their loved ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#39;s top soldier, the scenes of children eating ice cream and men presenting flowers to their sweethearts are satisfying. “This is what we are fighting for. I just want people to have a normal life in the whole of Ukrainian territory,” he says. The critical word is “whole”: Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive has not yet produced the results he and others had hoped for. Russian lines have not crumbled. Almost a fifth of Ukrainian territory remains in Russia&#39;s hands. In the war of attrition that looms, it is not clear which side has more staying power. In part, of course, that depends on a second uncertainty: in what quantities the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year">military and financial support</a> supplied by Ukraine&#39;s allies will keep flowing as the war grinds on.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A break in the clouds</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For all its superficial normality, Kyiv is awash with apprehension. Ukrainians know that Russia has been stockpiling missiles and drones to attack their energy infrastructure when temperatures drop. They know that the supply of volunteers has dried up, and that men are being conscripted to replace casualties at the front. And they know no end is in sight: a year ago 50% of them thought it would be over within a year. Now only 34% believe that. Whereas Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s dictator, does not care about the lives of his own troops, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine&#39;s president, presides over a democratic society which does. “It is not just about de-occupation [at any cost]. It&#39;s about de-occupation, but not losing a lot of lives,” he recently told <i>The Economist</i> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The prospect of an attenuated struggle has started to seep into Mr Zelensky&#39;s speeches. “We need to learn to live with [the conflict],” he told Ukrainians recently.  “It depends on what kind of war. We are prepared to keep fighting for a very long period of time…[while] minimising the number of casualties. Like in Israel, for example. We can live like that.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A war of endurance, however, will require big changes in military planning, the economy and society more broadly. The heroic improvisation and decentralisation of the early part of the war will no longer suffice. On the military side, Mr Zelensky has initiated a clear shift by installing a new minister of defence, Rustem Umerov. Like almost all Ukrainians, he has a personal stake in the war, as a Crimean Tatar, an ethnic group persecuted for Ukrainian sympathies since Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea in 2014. But, he says, “Ukraine is not about emotions, it is about a system, logistics and industries.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Umerov, a 41-year-old former entrepreneur and investor, says his mission is to build the capacity of both Ukraine&#39;s defence industry and its soldiers, so that Western allies see Ukraine not as a dependent always begging for aid, but as a partner, capable of shaping its own fortune. His previous job was managing the government&#39;s property portfolio, and he wants to bring an efficient managerial mindset to his new role. Red tape must be eliminated. “Anything that can be digitised, needs to be digitised,” he says. He is not afraid to make waves: after two weeks in the job, he replaced six of his seven deputies.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> An explosive legacy</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When it was part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had a vast defence industry. Some 1.5m Ukrainians laboured in 700 military enterprises, including 205 factories and 130 research and development sites. Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine&#39;s second president, ran the world&#39;s biggest rocket plant in the city of Dnipro in Soviet times. A flagship factory in Kharkiv produced 900 tanks a year. But corruption and neglect after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 gradually killed these businesses.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Now Ukraine is rebuilding its arms industry almost from scratch. “Anything that can be produced locally, must be produced locally,” Mr Umerov insists. In part that involves reforming state enterprises, the job of Oleksandr Kamyshin, a former investment banker who used to run the state railway company and follows Western management fads. “The first hundred days of the war were about bravery. The next 1,000 days are about steeliness,” he declares. In June, three months after his appointment, Ukraine produced as many shells as it had in the entire previous year. In July it reached double that, Mr Kamyshin says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Umerov wants to encourage private arms manufacturers, which account for only 20-30% of the local industry. He says he is prepared to pay local firms in advance if they can demonstrate their ability to make useful kit. Many are struggling with a dearth of capable managers: the defence ministry is offering to help bring such people back from the front lines. Within five years, Mr Kamyshin predicts, private firms will produce 80% of local output.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One focus is on drones. Ukraine&#39;s output of them has grown exponentially, albeit from a tiny base. “We will [produce] 120 to 150 times more drones than we did last year,” says Mykhailo Fedorov, the 32-year-old minister for digital transformation, who is co-ordinating the effort. The number of local firms in the business has risen from seven in December to 70 now, the vast majority of them private. To encourage this growth the government has eliminated tariffs on imported components and is buying drones at prices that allow margins of as much as 25%. “We can win in a technological war,” says Mr Fedorov. “We are getting help from countries with large economies and a greater level of freedom. Technologies like freedom and they like mobility. We have both.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Kamyshin wants Western military contractors to start localising their production, too. <small>BAE</small> Systems, a British defence firm which makes lots of weapons supplied to Ukraine, has set up a local subsidiary, hoping to produce <small>L</small> 119 and <small>M</small> 777 howitzers, which are both in wide use at the front. Rheinmetall, Germany&#39;s biggest arms manufacturer, is already repairing Leopard tanks in Ukraine and plans to open an armoured-vehicle factory soon. As Armin Papperger, its <small>CEO</small> , told <small>CNN</small> , “[Ukrainians] have to help themselves. If they always have to wait [for] Europeans or Americans [to] help them over the next ten or 20 years…that is not possible.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Protecting such factories from Russian attacks will require ingenuity. “We will not have one Soviet-style hypergiant plant but many smaller plants spread across the country,” says Mr Kamyshin. Drones are proof of what is possible: Ukraine&#39;s surging output of reconnaissance devices, Mr Fedorov says, has helped give it parity with Russia&#39;s forces. Production of longer-range ones, which can hit targets in Crimea and deep inside Russia, is also growing. “It is an important historical moment,” he says, “when we are not simply receiving aid and hoping [that it will not run out] but when we are taking responsibility for our own lives in our own hands and starting to form our own capability.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s growing drone industry also allows its armed forces to adopt new tactics, by taking the war inside Russia. One aim is to hit military factories in an effort to disrupt whole supply chains. Recent examples include an attack on a facility that produces decalin, a fuel additive essential for rockets, and a plant that makes circuitry for Kinzhal and Iskander missiles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second aim is psychological: to shatter the facade of normality the Kremlin tries to preserve, particularly in big cities such as Moscow. Airports there have had to suspend flights for brief spells almost daily in recent weeks owing to drone attacks on the city. (Mr Kamyshin says he would like to set up a shop selling <small>T</small> -shirts with the slogan “Moscow never sleeps”.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine also has a third goal in its strikes on Russian infrastructure: to deter Russian attacks on its own infrastructure. Since Russia withdrew in July from a deal allowing exports of grain from Ukraine&#39;s ports on the Black Sea, it has been bombarding those and other export routes and threatening ships calling at Ukrainian ports. Ukraine&#39;s exports have halved as a result, doing yet more damage to an already stricken economy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine is trying to break the Russian blockade. Last month it established a new sea route, hugging the western coast of the Black Sea close to Romania and Bulgaria. If Ukraine can protect it, it could raise its exports to some 70% of pre-war levels. On September 17th, two ships docked at the port of Chornomorsk near Odessa to load almost 20,000 tonnes of wheat. Hours later Russia unleashed a barrage of drones and missiles at other nearby ports.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A sea change</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukrainian strategists hope that, if they can threaten Russian ports on the Black Sea and strike at the military bases from which attacks on Ukrainian ports are launched, they may be able to keep Ukraine&#39;s exports afloat. Earlier this month Ukrainian missiles damaged a submarine, a ship and port facilities at a Russian naval base in Crimea. It had decent air defences, but more distant Russian facilities may not be as protected.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The focus on protecting exports reflects a sense among Ukrainian officials that the economy will also need a drastic overhaul to cope with a long war. Ukraine received $31bn in financial aid last year and is on course to receive even more this year. But Serhiy Marchenko, the finance minister, assumes that such largesse will not be forthcoming indefinitely.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile, military spending has leapt from 5% of <small>GDP</small> before the war to 26% this year. Even if the fighting stopped, spending might not drop much. General Zaluzhny says, “I want the Ukrainian army to be so strong that Russia does not even dare to look in our direction.” The shrunken economy is too small to generate sufficient tax revenue to pay for Ukraine&#39;s security, Mr Marchenko notes, so the government will have to help it grow by improving the business climate and fostering industry.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main concern for investors, says Mr Marchenko, is not physical security but the unreliable legal system, a problem that predates the war. Similarly, it is corruption rather than the damage done by the war to Ukraine&#39;s infrastructure that most Ukrainians see as the main obstacle to recovery. The independent corruption-fighting investigators, prosecutors and courts that Ukraine has put in place are making progress, but the broader judicial system remains inefficient and unpredictable.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Perhaps the worst injury that the war has inflicted on the economy has been to prompt an exodus of 7m Ukrainians—nearly 20% of the pre-war population of 37m people. More than two-thirds are women, since men of fighting age are barred from leaving the country. The working-age population has shrunk from 16.7m in 2021 to 12.4m this year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The call of the placid</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To lure people back, the government is offering startup grants for businesses and subsidised mortgages for those rebuilding homes. But many of the departed have settled in richer, more stable places in the <small>EU</small> , found jobs and put their children in school. They are unlikely to want more upheaval and they may see more opportunity for themselves and their children in their new homes, whatever the security situation in Ukraine. A recent survey found that about half of those who have moved to Germany, at least, intend to stay there for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is not just an economic cost to the exodus, but a social one as well. According to Olena Zelenska, Mr Zelensky&#39;s wife, who heads a government mental-health initiative, there has already been a rise in the number of divorces “because women and children are abroad and men are here”. Mr Zelensky says there is a real risk that a war of attrition could accelerate an outflow of people from Ukraine, creating further economic problems and widening the gap between those who left and those who have stayed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is not the only source of social tension. Roman Hasko, a lieutenant from the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade, who volunteered in the first week of the war, says he feels disappointed to see the bustle of night-time Kyiv, having just arrived on leave from the front line near Bakhmut. “I see a lot of potential recruits. I have many free positions in my unit. Not all have been killed—some are wounded or sick…If we are talking about winning this war, these empty lines need to be filled.” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC677.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">In the first weeks of the war men like Mr Hasko queued up to enlist. Now Ukraine is filling the ranks through conscription. Some young men who have not yet been called up are nervous about leaving home or passing checkpoints for fear of being dragooned. Many try to bribe their way out of military service and to leave the country illegally. Last month Mr Zelensky sacked the heads of all the regional military recruitment centres. He replaced them with soldiers with battlefield experience who had been vetted by intelligence services. Earlier this month the Ministry of Defence drastically cut the number of medical exemptions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukrainians clearly have some concerns about how the country is being run. Approval of the army and the president remain sky high, but confidence in the country&#39;s politicians in general is down from 60% in December to 44% in June. The share of Ukrainians who say the country is on the right track has also slipped (see chart). There is disquiet about corruption in particular.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But 76% tell pollsters they do not want new elections until the war is over. Support for Ukraine&#39;s independence is the highest it has ever been, at 82%. Most do not complain about restrictions on movement or other wartime curtailment of civil liberties. “War has become part of a new horrific normal,” says Darina Solodova, a sociologist with the United Nations Development Programme in Kyiv.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Resistance to Russia&#39;s aggression remains a unifying principle for the vast majority. “It is not the question of whether to resist or not, but who has done more or less for that resistance,” says Ms Solodova. Across Ukraine 42% say that even if Russia intensifies its bombing of cities Ukraine should keep fighting. Some 21% think that the conflict should be frozen without making any concessions to Russia. Only 23% think it is worth initiating negotiations. Even in the east and south, which have borne the brunt of the war, support for negotiations is relatively low, at 32% and 39% respectively. Only 5% of Ukrainians are willing to cede any territory to Russia and only 18% to forswear joining <small>NATO</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Research by the Centre for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development, a think-tank in Cyprus, suggests that Ukrainians have become more optimistic about the future despite the war. Most believe that future generations will be better off. Ms Zelenska is not surprised: “People know what they are fighting for, not just what against.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:14:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ppv93sn16mkmpo0os26ioqogg623s8kn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/to-endure-a-long-war-ukraine-is-remaking-its-army-economy-and-society </item><item><title><![CDATA[The hard right is getting closer to power all over Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Europe_s%20hard%20right-3da6c3966e318901bdd99c67b92e03ad.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>N SINT-GENESIUS-RODE</small> , a well-to-do commuter town in the hills south of Brussels, a crowd of 50 or so gathered on September 2nd in a parish hall to drink champagne and promote the dismemberment of Belgium. The meeting was organised by Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest), a right-wing party that rails against such threats to the Flemish way of life as Islam, immigration and—most pernicious of all—the French language. The town is in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking half of Belgium), but French-speakers have been moving in for decades and are now the majority. The only way to stop the rot, explains Klaas Slootmans, a member of the Flemish regional parliament from Vlaams Belang, is for Flanders to declare independence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may sound parochial, chauvinist and disruptive if not delusional, but it goes down well. People have a right “to be the boss in their own country”, Mr Slootmans proclaims; the crowd applauds. Vlaams Belang is Belgium&#39;s most popular party, with an average of 22% support in recent polling. Barring a sudden reversal, it should triumph in simultaneous elections next year for the national, European and regional parliaments. Other Belgian parties have hitherto declared it too extreme to do business with, and refused to include it in coalitions. But this so-called <i>cordon sanitaire</i> may have to be abandoned if the party wins a fifth or more of parliamentary seats. Anyway, the ostracism may in fact be helping Vlaams Belang. Its support has tripled over the past five years.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The right moment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a common pattern. Across much of Europe, populist right-wing parties like Vlaams Belang, once relegated to the fringe, are going from strength to strength. In Hungary, Italy and Poland they hold power. In Finland, Sweden and Switzerland they have a share of it. In Germany polls put the <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/germanys-rampant-hard-right-afd-puts-other-parties-in-a-fix">Alternative for Germany</a> ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ) party at 22%, up from 10% in the election in 2021. In France the National Rally ( <small>RN</small> ), the biggest hard-right party, has 24% support. Add in 5% for Reconquest, another anti-immigrant party, and the hard right becomes the biggest voting block in the country. In the Netherlands, too, a smattering of right-wing populists claim a quarter or more of the vote. Even newish democracies that for decades lacked big nationalist parties—Portugal, Romania and Spain—now have them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The advance of the hard right is neither uniform nor one-way. Support for populist nationalists has recently slumped in Denmark and Spain, for instance. Nor are all these parties the same: some are eager Atlanticists, others pro-Russian; some are libertarian, others want a more generous welfare state, albeit only for people of native stock. What is more, hard-right groups tend to mellow the closer they get to power, or to splinter, or both. The government of Italy, for one, although led by the Brothers of Italy ( <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> ), a party with links to fascism, has proved much more moderate than many had feared. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Nonetheless, the trend is alarming, for three reasons. First, it is remarkably broad. Four of the five most populous countries in the European Union have hard-right parties either in government or polling above 20% (see map). Second, the current circumstances are especially propitious for populist parties, with immigration rising after a hiatus during the pandemic, inflation high and the growing cost of climate policy creating a potent new focus for popular ire. Third, and most important, the hard right does not need to win power to have a baleful impact on politics. Simply by attracting a big share of voters, it is already skewing the debate, and so making it harder for European governments to adopt sensible policies on pressing problems, such as the war in Ukraine, immigration and climate change.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Freedom fighters</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When the Freedom Party, Austria&#39;s main hard-right outfit, joined a coalition government in 2000, other <small>EU</small> governments were so horrified that they reduced contact with Austria&#39;s to the bare minimum in protest. To no avail: the hard right has since broken through barrier after barrier. It first led a government in 2010, when Fidesz, a once-centrist outfit that had taken a populist turn, swept to power in Hungary. Those who said the same thing could never happen in mature democracies in western Europe were proved wrong last year when <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> took power in Italy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">More milestones loom. Hard-right parties are expected to do well in next year&#39;s European elections. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> and prime minister of Italy, is trying to persuade the centre-right alliance in the European Parliament, the European People&#39;s Party ( <small>EPP</small> ), to join forces with the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists ( <small>ECR</small> ), which she heads. That would move the legislature of all of the <small>EU</small> in a populist direction. In France, meanwhile, the hard right&#39;s performance is improving at each presidential election (see chart). It is possible that Marine Le Pen, the runner-up at the past two contests, may win the next one, in 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A series of external factors are helping to propel support for the hard right. Illegal immigration, which spurred support for populist parties when it surged in 2015, is growing again after a lull during the pandemic. There have already been more than 165,000 unauthorised arrivals in Europe this year, as many as in all of last year, although still well below the level of 2015. Populists also tend to do well in times of economic upheaval, and so are benefiting from the high inflation that has plagued Europe for the past two years, and especially from soaring energy prices.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Expensive petrol, heating and electricity have helped foment a backlash against policies to fight climate change, which the hard right has seized on. This began in France with the <i>gilets jaunes</i> movement in late 2018, initially a protest against a carbon-tax hike on motor fuel. The <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s rise this year was touched off by a proposed government ban on oil and gas boilers in homes. In the Netherlands the Farmer-Citizen Movement ( <small>BBB</small> ), a new populist party, began as a farmers&#39; protest against nitrogen-emission limits. It won an astounding 20% of the vote in regional elections in March.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There has also been a broader slide in trust in government in many European countries, after a brief resurgence during the pandemic, to the benefit of the hard right. American-style culture wars are becoming fiercer, too, which, again, helps the populists. Maximilian Krah, the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s lead candidate in the European elections, went viral over the summer with dating advice posted on TikTok: “Real men are right-wing. Don&#39;t watch porn.” In other videos Mr Krah argues that “multicultural means multi-criminal”, bemoans rainbow flags and warns that BlackRock, an investment firm, wants to replace Germans with “minorities and immigrants”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The European politician most adept at exploiting such ideas to win and hold power is Viktor Orban, Fidesz&#39;s leader and the prime minister of Hungary since 2010. He readily bashes migrants, gay people and the <small>EU</small> as at odds with homespun Hungarian values. He has used the parliamentary majorities he has won with such talk to pack the courts with loyalists and gerrymander the electoral system. Cronies have bought up critical media outlets. In addition to undermining democracy at home, Mr Orban&#39;s rule has scrambled policymaking at <small>NATO</small> and in the <small>EU</small> , owing to his friendliness with both China and Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But harnessing right-wing populism to take control of a state is not easy. When Poland&#39;s Law and Justice ( <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ) party came to power in 2015, it followed Mr Orban&#39;s script. It turned the state media into a propaganda bureau and tried to pack the courts. But <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s efforts have not got as far as Fidesz&#39;s. Many judges have fought back, and the <small>EU</small> has withheld billions of euros in aid to force <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> to reverse some of its court-packing. The media have not been cowed. The opposition remain competitive, even though <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> is favoured in next month&#39;s election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other right-wing populists using Mr Orban&#39;s template have also had mixed results. Janez Jansa, a former prime minister of Slovenia nicknamed “Marshal Tweeto” for a social-media style reminiscent of Donald Trump, lost power in 2022. Estonia&#39;s far-right <small>EKRE</small> party tried to go after the media while in government in 2019, but that coalition collapsed and the party did poorly in an election this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even where it has been electorally successful, the hard right has struggled to put in place radical policies such as ending political asylum or scrapping measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Take Sweden, where the Sweden Democrats, long shunned by other parties because of their roots in the neo-Nazi movement, took 21% of the vote in 2022. They signed a confidence-and-supply deal to back a centre-right minority government, giving them direct influence over policy on immigration and crime. But in a speech in August Jimmie Akesson, the party&#39;s leader, had to make excuses for the government&#39;s slow progress implementing the deal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ms Meloni is the first leader in western Europe with the parliamentary clout to enact a hard-right agenda. Yet so far, she has run a fairly conventional government. Her only populist measures have been to introduce a misconceived tax on banks, limit some airline fares and prevent same-sex parents from registering their partner&#39;s child as their own. In part, she is constrained by European fiscal rules. But the <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> is also simply less extreme than it once was. ”This is a pragmatic centre-right government with, now and again, some identitarian [culture-war] policies,” argues Giovanni Orsina of the <small>LUISS</small> school in Rome.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On the question of Europe, in particular, many hard-right parties have softened. A few of the edgiest populists want to dismantle the union they sneeringly refer to as the “ <small>EUSSR</small> ”. But <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> abandoned the idea of leaving the euro and restructuring the <small>EU</small> before coming to power. Ms Meloni instead wants the <small>EU</small> to do more to help Italy, by keeping out the migrants that flood Italy&#39;s shores. This summer she went to Tunisia with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission&#39;s president, to negotiate a migration deal. She also wants the bloc to relax its fiscal rules so that her government can spend more. She even cultivates Europhiles by praising the union as the guardian of European peace and civilisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>RN</small> , in similar fashion, no longer calls for France to leave the <small>EU</small> and the euro. Its rhetoric remains anti-European, but with few specifics. This retreat from more radical policies was presumably intended precisely to broaden the <small>RN</small> ’s appeal and so help it win power. And even if Ms Le Pen were to become president, she might still struggle to implement her policies, despite the immense formal powers of the office. After all, reforms to state pensions championed by Emmanuel Macron, the incumbent, met ferocious opposition even though he clearly advertised them during his re-election campaign last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Far-right parties, which are often young, full of zealous ideologues and dependent on charismatic leaders, are prone to schisms. The Finns Party&#39;s first stint in government, in 2015, split it in two. Its second, which began in May, has already been marred by scandals and resignations. In Poland, <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s generous benefits policies have alienated fiscal conservatives, some of whom have defected to a libertarian party called Confederation. Ms Le Pen, having softened her radical image, now faces competition on the right from Reconquest, whose lead candidate in the European election is her niece, Marion Maréchal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most vivid illustration of such chaos is in the Netherlands, which since 2002 has seen a series of right-wing populist parties rocket to prominence only to implode. In provincial elections in 2019 Forum for Democracy, a party led by Thierry Baudet, a dandyish Eurosceptic, finished first with 17%. Within months it had split into three. Mr Baudet now hawks conspiracy theories about covid-19 and immigration; his rump of the party is polling at 3%. Earlier this year the <small>BBB</small> had a brief moment as the standard-bearer of the right, but it has already slumped to 11% in the polls. It has been losing votes to yet another new party on the right with populist overtones, New Social Contract, which was launched by an <small>MP</small> famous for investigating abuses by the tax authority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What all these parties have in common is a vague sense that they stand with ordinary people against the elite. Their positions on hot-button issues can be hazy, as with the <small>RN</small> ’s new stance on Europe. At a local level their candidates are often pragmatic. In June the rural town of Raguhn-Jessnitz in Saxony-Anhalt became the first to elect an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> mayor. Hannes Loth is an energetic 42-year-old former vegetable farmer (“cabbage, sweetcorn, onions—all kinds of onions”). During the pandemic, when locals had trouble getting travel permits because of the lack of a covid-testing centre, Mr Loth opened one himself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Loth&#39;s main concerns are run-down streets and fire stations and the town&#39;s budget deficit, which was €1.5m ($1.6m) last year. That is partly because high energy prices sent heating bills for the <i>Rathaus</i> (town hall) through the roof. Mr Loth, toeing the <small>a</small> f <small>d</small> ’s line, says the solution is to restart the nuclear plants the government has closed and negotiate peace in Ukraine so gas pipelines to Russia can reopen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The disconnect between genuine problems and far-fetched solutions encapsulates something important about hard-right populist parties. Mr Loth is acutely sensitive to his constituents&#39; suffering from high energy costs. But the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s response is in part a fantasy: whatever it might wish, cheap Russian gas will not be an option for the foreseeable future. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="rotesters raising their hands making a Nazi salute while carrying a Spanish flag with the words"Long live the unity of Spain" are seen during a protest of far right wing party" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Making their presence felt</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similarly, the worries of the voters at the meeting in Sint-Genesius-Rode are natural. They have seen their town change its language around them; they have trouble finding good Dutch-language schools for their kids. But Vlaams Belang&#39;s solutions are illusory. Flemish independence is unlikely. Even if it happened, there is no way to force Sint-Genesius-Rode to speak mostly Dutch again. It has become French-speaking not because of a bureaucratic conspiracy, but because immigrants are more interested in learning French (a widely spoken language) than Dutch (a relatively obscure one).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The changes Europe&#39;s populist parties rail against tend to be inexorable or at least not easily reversed: demography, sexual liberation, gender equality, the shift away from fossil fuels. As with Vlaams Belang, the policies they propose to set the world to rights tend to be incoherent or unachievable. For populists, unrealistic programmes are no bad thing: candidates cannot thunder indignantly at election rallies about problems that have been solved.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Moreover, simply by railing and attracting support, far-right parties help to shift the debate. All across the continent, centre-right parties have toughened their immigration policies and heightened their culture-war rhetoric to stop voters defecting to the populists. The most glaring example of this was in Britain, where Brexit was set in train by the Conservative Party&#39;s decision to support a referendum on Brexit in an effort to diminish the appeal of the insurgents of the <small>UK</small> Independence Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is probably the biggest risk of the rising vote share of Europe&#39;s far-right parties. Certainly, they tend to be associated with bigotry and misogyny, and to undermine the rule of law. Occasionally they may win enough power to damage democracy, as in Hungary and Poland. But more often, big populist-right blocs simply impede countries from getting to grips with their most pressing problems by offering illusory solutions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is the last thing the <small>EU</small> needs. The next European Parliament must make grave decisions regarding institutional reform in the <small>EU</small> , energy security, climate, support for Ukraine and more. If a quarter of its members refuse to wrestle seriously with such problems, they are unlikely to be solved. The hard right does not need to seize control of the levers of power to gum them up. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i><b>Correction (September 18th, 2023):</b> A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Germany&#39;s election took place last year.

No longer: of the six countries invited to join the bloc at its annual summit on August 22nd, four—Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> )—are from the region. If they all accept, the Middle East will account for more than a third of the expanded bloc&#39;s members.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The invitations are one sign among many that the Middle East is changing. Wealthy Gulf states are trying to establish themselves as non-aligned middle powers. Saudi Arabia has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. The <small>UAE</small> , which will host this year&#39;s global climate summit, <small>cop</small> 28, wants to fashion a dual role as both oil exporter and green-energy powerhouse. The six-member Gulf Co-operation Council ( <small>GCC</small> ) is one of the world&#39;s economic hotspots, drawing the talented and the ultra-rich from east and west and deploying vast pools of capital abroad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even more striking is the Middle East&#39;s newfound (and relative) calm. A ceasefire has quietened the eight-year war in Yemen. Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to ease their 40-year feud in March. Qatar has repaired relations with its neighbours. The region has even reconciled with Syria&#39;s murderous dictator, Bashar al-Assad. America, meanwhile, is urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, under which four other Arab countries have established ties with Israel since 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Five years ago Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia&#39;s crown prince and de facto ruler, offered a hopeful vision of where things might go. “I think that the new Europe is the Middle East,” he said. “The next global renaissance will be in the Middle East.” His comments fit an increasingly popular narrative in the Gulf, that a “new” Middle East will be focused on economics rather than democratisation, Islamisation or other distracting ideologies. Diplomacy will bring stability, which will foster investment and growth that helps everyone move beyond the upheavals of decades past. The Gulf states have long applied this model at home; now they want to export it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Middle East has huge potential. First, and most obvious, it is awash with hydrocarbons. It accounts for 36% of world oil production, 46% of oil exports, 22% of natural-gas output and 30% of liquefied natural gas ( <small>LNG</small> ) exports. Those numbers will only rise. The region has vast reserves (52% of the world&#39;s total for oil and 43% for gas) and low production costs. At a time when Western oil majors are skittish about investing, Gulf firms are adding capacity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Location is important, too: the region connects Europe, Africa and Asia. Some 30% of the world&#39;s shipping containers pass through the Suez canal in Egypt, while 16% of its air cargo flies via airports in the Gulf. Its young population is another asset: 55% of Middle Easterners are under 30, compared with 36% of the population of the <small>OECD</small> , a club mostly of rich countries.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Monumental misfortune</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the story of the past two decades has been one of conflict and despair. First came America&#39;s ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003. The fury of the Arab spring followed, bringing upheaval but not democracy: all the countries affected eventually either reverted to dictatorship or collapsed into civil war. Islamist violence and sectarian strife compounded the region&#39;s woes. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The Middle East accounts for 6% of the world&#39;s population but just 4% of economic output. Strip out a few big oil producers and that figure falls below 2%. In much of the region <small>GDP</small> per person is stagnant or falling (see chart 1). Poverty rates have soared in Egypt and Lebanon, to say nothing of war-torn Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But three big shifts are under way that could change the place of the Middle East in the world. The first is the growing distance between the Gulf states and America. Three successive presidents have sought to reduce America&#39;s military presence in the Middle East. Joe Biden, the current one, is not trying to impose democracy on the region; he does not even seem too interested in reining in Iran&#39;s nuclear programme. America has other priorities: competition with China, the war in Ukraine, political turmoil at home.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s economic role is also decreasing. Over the past 30 years the share of Middle Eastern exports going to China and India has climbed from 5% to 26%, according to the <small>IMF;</small> the share sent to Europe and America has fallen from 34% to 16%. Much of this reflects Asia&#39;s booming appetite for oil, the region&#39;s main export. In the 1990s China took less than 1% of Saudi Arabia&#39;s crude exports, and India less than 3%; by 2021 those figures were 28% and 12%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Oil is at the heart of the second shift, in energy markets. The region is trying to become an even bigger force in oil and gas to finance a transition away from hydrocarbons, contradictory though that may sound. Recent high oil prices have brought a windfall. Aramco, the state-owned Saudi giant, posted a record $161bn profit last year, up from $110bn in 2021. It plans to expand its capacity by 1m barrels a day (roughly 10%) over the next three years. The <small>UAE</small> has a similar target. It has also made itself a transit point for Iranian and Russian oil, which are subject to Western sanctions. Qatar, already the world&#39;s biggest exporter of <small>LNG</small> , plans to boost production by 63% by 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The proceeds are being poured into new industries. Instead of parking its petrodollars in American treasuries, as it once did, Saudi Arabia is snapping up everything from European footballers to stakes in electric-car firms. This summer the kingdom struck a $2.6bn deal with Brazil&#39;s largest mining firm, part of a plan to spend $170bn on the industry by 2030.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final shift is in attitudes. Surveys show that Arabs view the economy as their top concern. About a third of young Arabs say the cost of living is the region&#39;s biggest problem and another third cite unemployment; almost half say it is hard to find a job in their country. Asked whether stability or democracy is more important, 82% choose the former. Growing numbers believe that democracy is bad for economic growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Citizens have lost interest in political Islam, too. Islamist parties have been forced out of government by Tunisian voters and Egyptian soldiers. Armed Islamists failed to take control of Iraq, Libya and Syria. <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/07/a-year-after-iran-was-shaken-by-protests-zealots-have-tightened-their-grip">Widespread protests</a> in Iran last year were a sign of popular frustration with its religious rulers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The leaders of the Gulf countries, too, seem to have a new outlook. Over the past decade they had sought to use force to change the region. They tried to impose a friendly government on Yemen; Saudi Arabia sent weapons to Syrian rebels; the <small>UAE</small> attempted to install Khalifa Haftar, a warlord, as Libya&#39;s leader. Each effort failed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At least for now, the era of macho foreign policy is over. The most unexpected diplomatic shift was the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. They have been at odds since the latter&#39;s Islamic revolution in 1979, fighting a proxy war that eventually spread to Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. With a nudge from China, though, they agreed in March to reopen their embassies, which had been closed since 2016, to tone down criticism of one another in state-backed media and to boost economic ties. They are hardly friends, but the deal has reduced the chance of conflict in the Gulf.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most unsavoury shift is Mr Assad&#39;s reintegration. He did nothing to earn it: after destroying Syria to keep power, he has made no gestures towards reform or reconciliation. But in May the Saudis let him reclaim Syria&#39;s seat at the Arab League.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The easing of tensions has nonetheless brought a measure of calm, which may help explain the improving economic outlook. The <small>IMF</small> expects the non-oil portion of the Gulf states&#39; economies to grow by 4.2% this year (unchanged from last year), even as the oily bit expands by just 1.9% (down from 10.3% in 2022). The region attracted 6% of global flows of foreign direct investment last year, up from 3% in 2019.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Capital markets are booming. Firms in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the <small>UAE</small> , accounted for 14% of the world&#39;s <small>IPO</small> s in the first quarter of 2023. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that foreign ownership of Middle Eastern equities climbed from 2% in 2017 to 10% last year. It sees the region&#39;s weight in emerging-market indices rising to 10% in the next few years, from 7% today.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Big domestic reforms are making headway: 31% of Saudi women were employed in the first quarter of this year, compared with 16% at the same point in 2017. Gulf states are also trying to be more exacting when doling out aid. Some still comes with few strings attached: Tunisia, for instance, secured a surprise $500m bail-out (most of it loans) from Saudi Arabia in July. But Egypt is having to raise money by selling stakes in state-run firms to sovereign-wealth funds from Qatar and the <small>UAE</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists muse about where this could lead. A calmer Middle East would mean fewer risks to global trade and energy flows, and fewer refugees (the region accounts for over 8m of the world&#39;s 35m). As Western firms seek to diversify supply chains, a youthful Middle East could become a new manufacturing base. Morocco&#39;s thriving car industry, which produces around 700,000 vehicles a year and sustains 220,000 jobs, shows what is possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The region could also do more business with itself. Trade within the Middle East is equivalent to only 2.9% of the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> , compared with 22% within the <small>EU</small> . Researchers at Majid al-Futtaim, an Emirati retail giant, and McKinsey, a consultancy, estimate that dropping barriers to trade could boost the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> by $230bn (5%). If Saudi Arabia and Israel buried the hatchet, commercial ties with the Middle East&#39;s most dynamic economy would become possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Infrastructure could be stitched together as well. The <small>GCC</small> countries have long mooted integrating their railways, which could easily be connected to those of Iraq, Israel and Jordan, too. Pipelines could bring low-cost Saudi hydrogen across the Mediterranean to consumers in Europe; upgraded transmission lines could allow a sun-baked region to export solar power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is an alluring vision, but there are many pitfalls. The first is that the economic progress of the past few years has been uneven. The Middle East has long been riven with political schisms, between revolutionaries and royalists, nationalists and Islamists, Sunnis and Shias. Today, though, the most important distinction is economic, between the prosperous states and the penurious ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Unfortunately, most of the Middle East is penurious. Even in a time of regional calm, dire economies threaten these countries&#39; stability. In the past five years alone, since Prince Muhammad first began talking about a regional renaissance, there have been big protests in Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Sudan.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pharaonic mismanagement</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt, the most populous country in the Arab world, is especially alarming. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the soldier who has run it since a coup in 2013, has consistently spent less than the constitution requires on health and education. But he has found the money for grandiose projects such as a new capital city in the desert and for big purchases of weapons for the army (Egypt is the world&#39;s sixth-largest arms importer).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt&#39;s debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratio has risen to 93%, with 36% of the loans denominated in foreign currencies. Its non-oil economy has been in contraction for 33 consecutive months and for 81 of the past 90 months. The currency has lost half its value over the past two years and will probably be devalued again soon. Annual inflation hit a record high of 38% in July. Citizens endured blackouts in sweltering heat this summer because the government could not afford to import enough fuel for power plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A fully fledged balance-of-payments crisis seems likely. Even if the government limps on, it will be hard to reinvent the region when its largest country is moribund. And should unrest erupt on a sufficient scale, it could even damage the economic prospects of the Gulf countries. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Another risk is that even the region&#39;s prosperous countries will fail to create the jobs and growth they have promised. They have undeniably done better to date than their counterparts elsewhere in the Middle East. In 1975 Saudis and Libyans had roughly the same <small>GDP</small> per person; today the Saudi figure is 353% higher. The Gulf and Israel (the region&#39;s other prosperous spot) account for just 14% of the Middle East&#39;s population, but 60% of its <small>GDP</small> , 73% of its exports of goods and 75% of its <small>FDI</small> (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Saudi Arabia, like its neighbours, is battling deep structural problems. Citizens still see a cushy public-sector job as a birthright. The government employs fully 53% of working Saudis, although that is down from 66% in 2019. Schools do not teach marketable skills. Wages are too high for the kingdom to become a manufacturing hub, at least without costly state subsidies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Prince Muhammad hopes annual foreign direct investment will be $100bn by 2030. Last year it was just $8bn. That leaves the government as the main agent of economic transformation, which is worrying in two respects. First, its finances are hostage to oil markets. Analysts estimate that the kingdom runs a deficit when the price drops below $100 a barrel, if off-budget spending by its sovereign-wealth funds is included. It is currently about $90—its highest for almost a year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, it is far from clear that the government&#39;s investments in diversification will pay off. Vision 2030, the kingdom&#39;s economic blueprint, predicts tourism will contribute 10% of Saudi <small>GDP</small> by the end of the decade. Officials claim the industry will generate 1m jobs, enough to hire one in 20 Saudis, a higher share than in France or Spain. But there is scant evidence of the hoped-for flood of 100m annual visitors. Last year there were just 16m, estimates the <small>UN</small> —about 1.5m fewer than in 2016, the year the vision was adopted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another worry is that the ideological arguments that leaders are so eagerly papering over will at some point resurface. Saudi Arabia is pursuing a détente with Iran even as the latter continues to produce highly enriched uranium for its rogue nuclear programme. Should the regime go further and manufacture a bomb, it could trigger a regional arms race—or even a war. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Collage juxtaposing an image of a tank and an excavator" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Anthony Gerace/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been relatively subdued for the past two decades, but it is unlikely to stay that way for ever. Serious conflict in the Holy Land could shake Arab agreements with Israel. Violence has ebbed in Libya, Syria and Yemen, but the underlying disputes remain unresolved. Mr Assad faced a wave of protests last month in Sweida, a restive southern province. And Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE</small> , although the main cheerleaders for the new Middle East, often disagree about both foreign policy and economic matters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final risk is that the region gets its geopolitical balancing act wrong. America is still the only country willing and able to project military power across the region, and its domination of the global financial system gives it unmatched economic clout. The Gulf states cannot risk losing it as a partner. Yet their dalliances with Russia and China are prompting mounting anger in Washington. America has imposed sanctions on a few firms in the <small>UAE</small> , including one accused of supplying drones to Russia. It has delayed a deal to sell <small>F</small> -35 fighter jets to the country because of allegations of a Chinese military presence at a port in Abu Dhabi.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Gulf states are “planning in part their future prosperity on the assumption that China&#39;s economic rise will continue”, notes Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. There are warning lights flashing over China&#39;s economy, though: slow growth, an ageing population, a moribund property market. A big gamble on China that alienates America could leave the Gulf in a difficult spot.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact is, Prince Muhammad is not the first regional leader to wax lyrical about a renaissance in the Middle East. There are many parallels between the current era and the 1990s, another time when the region seemed to be trying to put its violent past behind it. The Oslo accords appeared to herald an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Lebanon&#39;s long civil war had sputtered to a halt. Autocrats in Egypt, Jordan and Syria talked about opening their hidebound economies. So did Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, the Saudi crown prince of the day, who promised bold reforms and sought better relations with Iran.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 1993 Shimon Peres, then Israel&#39;s foreign minister, wrote a book called “The New Middle East” arguing that trade would pacify the region. “Ultimately, the Middle East will unite in a common market,” he stated. “And the very existence of this common market will foster vital interests in maintaining the peace over the long term.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> History, sadly, had other ideas. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process gradually ground to a halt. America invaded Iraq in 2003 and Israel sent its army into southern Lebanon in 2006. Supposedly modernising autocrats across the region proved quite bad at the modernising bit, which precipitated the Arab spring. Gulf economies stayed oily, save for Dubai, which never had much oil to begin with.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An era of peace and development is a tempting vision, but to attain it, the region&#39;s autocrats must be serious about keeping the peace and smart about fixing their economies. The present circumstances give them a chance to change, and technological and geopolitical forces provide an incentive. The rest is up to them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/holsuu85iuk0b8tu763gh7eqgambvsno</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/07/the-gulf-countries-want-to-reshape-the-middle-east-in-their-image </item><item><title><![CDATA[How cynical leaders are whipping up nationalism to win and abuse power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Nationalism%20and%20corruption-cc63480577ac61a926fc6b4c75cd5cf0.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>E</span> <small>ARLIER THIS</small> year Tunisia&#39;s president, Kais Saied, warned that “hordes of irregular immigrants” from sub-Saharan Africa were plotting to change Tunisia&#39;s demography, replacing the Arab majority. Black Africans, he added, brought “violence, crimes and unacceptable practices”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In effect, he gave Tunisians permission to be openly racist. Suddenly, many felt free to use slurs that were previously taboo, including one for black people that means, literally, “slave”. Most locals interviewed by <i>The Economist</i> in the street in August used this term. “The slaves are replacing us,” said Nizar, a furniture repair man in Tunis, the capital. “They are taking all the jobs.” Worse, “They stand on the balcony in their underwear drinking alcohol.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A wave of hatred has crashed over the country. In July, after an Arab was killed in a brawl with migrants in Sfax, Tunisia&#39;s second city, mobs torched homes where black Africans were lodging. Landlords, scared of losing their property, evicted black tenants. When <i>The Economist</i> visited, hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants were sleeping rough in the town centre, huddled together for protection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Look at my head,” said Muhammad, a painter from Guinea, pointing to a hammer-blow scar. He was driven from his flat by thugs wielding stones and petrol bombs, he said; then police grabbed him and dumped him in the desert with no water. Many migrants have died this way, but Muhammad somehow made it back to Sfax. He is desperate to get to Europe. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMcuv4eccCA?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s speech was pure fabrication. There is no plot to change Tunisia&#39;s demography. Black Africans are a tiny share of the population, and largely just passing through. If they linger, it is simply because they are saving for the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before the speech, Mr Saied was unpopular, thanks to a dire economy. After it, he appears to have won more support. Polls are unreliable, but one in November gave him less than 30% backing; a different one in June found that 69% would vote for him.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> By vowing to guard Tunisians from a phantom menace, he has rallied them behind him. He has also deflected blame for the country&#39;s ills. Economists think Tunisia&#39;s inflation is largely caused by the government, but Mustafa, from Sfax, blames black people, who he says are driving up prices by eating all the bread. He plans to vote for Mr Saied at the next election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s hate-mongering has also distracted attention from other controversial things he has been doing, such as muzzling the press, purging the judiciary and shutting down the national anti-corruption watchdog. He has been dismantling the checks and balances that promote good, clean governance, with predictable results. Tunisia has grown more fearful, less free and more corrupt. Its score on the Corruption Perceptions Index ( <small>CPI</small> ) compiled by Transparency International, a watchdog, has worsened significantly since 2021, when Mr Saied started dismantling its young, hopeful democracy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Tunisia reflects a global trend: more leaders are using nationalism as a tool to amass power—and to abuse it (see chart 1). Whereas nationalism was once a means to dismantle deplorable colonial empires, it is increasingly becoming a device to remove legitimate constraints on government power. Leaders who chafe at checks and balances need a pretext to scrap them. They cannot admit that they want to muzzle the press and purge the courts because they find it irksome to follow the rules and would prefer to rule with unfettered authority. So they accuse journalists and judges of being traitors, or agents of foreign powers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nationalism can be positive or negative. The positive sort—love of one&#39;s country—can be a force for good. “It is the strongest foundation for solidarity between people who might otherwise have few things in common,” writes Yascha Mounk in “The Great Experiment: How to Make Diverse Democracies Work”. “At its best, it can inspire a white Christian living in rural Tennessee to feel special concern for a Hispanic atheist living in Los Angeles—and vice versa.” Because it is benign and, except at a few Western universities, uncontroversial, positive nationalism is embraced by nearly all politicians. Hardly any would admit to not loving their country.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The danger is when they espouse negative nationalism: the fear and suspicion of outsiders. The outsiders could be foreigners or domestic minorities. Perhaps because this paranoid variant is based on a deep-seated instinct—the desire to protect one&#39;s tribe—it is highly potent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When people feel their country is threatened, they rise to defend it, sometimes heroically. When Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Ukrainians made great sacrifices to resist him. This benefited Ukraine, which would otherwise have become a vassal state. It also boosted the poll ratings of Ukraine&#39;s president, Volodymyr Zelensky: people rallied round the man who led their country&#39;s defence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Alas, unscrupulous leaders have found they can win similar poll bumps by vowing to defend people against confected threats. Mr Putin claims that his unprovoked attack on Ukraine is really about defending Russia from Western aggression and Ukrainian Nazis. Many Russians believe him. Despite the war&#39;s cost to Russia in blood, treasure and international isolation, independent polls suggest that Mr Putin&#39;s approval rating has risen since he started it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main drawback of paranoid nationalism is obvious. It is terrible for its targets, whether they be immigrants in Tunisia or Ukrainians whose land has been sown with mines. Neighbours of paranoid nationalist regimes have cause to be nervous, as anywhere that shares a border with Russia or China can attest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other big drawback is less well understood: politics based on bigotry opens the door to misrule and corruption. As Mr Putin has ratcheted up nationalist propaganda over the past two decades, his cronies have been plundering Russia. And though he is surely the most extreme example, he is far from alone. In fact, there is a clear statistical correlation between nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>The Economist</i> analysed data from the V-Dem Institute, a think-tank attached to the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. Every year it asks experts to describe how the world&#39;s governments justify themselves to voters or citizens. It then creates a scale with the results. After weighting countries by population, we found that between 2012 and 2021 governments became more reliant on nationalism to justify themselves. (Specifically, on an ideology that included a nationalist element. It could also include other elements, such as populism or Islamism.) The change was significant: a typical citizen has seen an increase in her state&#39;s use of nationalism roughly equivalent to what China has seen under its “Wolf Warrior” president, Xi Jinping. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> We combined our measure of how nationalist governments are with data on perceptions of public-sector corruption from Transparency International ( <small>TI</small> ) for the years 2012 to 2021. Using a statistical model, we found that where governments rely on nationalist rhetoric to stay in power, experts think the public sector is much more corrupt (see chart 2). Moreover, comparing countries with themselves over time, going back to 2012, we find that more nationalist rhetoric has been associated with more corruption, and less nationalism with less corruption. Both these findings remain true after controlling for average incomes, and changes in them, and worldwide trends in nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There were notable exceptions (China, for instance, became cleaner and more jingoistic) but the relationship is statistically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in nationalism was correlated with a jump of 5.31 (on a scale of 0 to 100) in corruption when comparing countries, and a 0.13 point jump when comparing within them. The latter may seem small, but corruption scores usually do not change much at all. Interestingly, when an increase in nationalism came first, it predicted a future increase in corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why might this be so? Daniel Eriksson, the head of <small>TI</small> , suggests three ways that nationalism can foster the abuse of power. Politicians may whip up nationalist passions to win office or hang on to it. By granting their kin or cronies influence, they may attempt to capture the state. And by branding critics as traitors, they may erode the checks and balances that prevent the looting of public funds.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Appeals to nationalism are effective because they are simple to understand, and far more emotive than any bread-and-butter policy proposal. “Vote for me and I&#39;ll make incremental improvements to schools” is a fine platform but a dull slogan. “The tribe next door are attacking us!” is an electrifying one.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pick your poison</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The enemy can take many forms. It could be immigrants, as in Tunisia. Or a geopolitical rival: Chinese and Russian propaganda constantly demonise America. Or a minority faith: India&#39;s ruling party plays up the non-existent threat that Muslims, less than 15% of the population, pose to the Hindu majority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Or the enemy could be cultural change. Many nationalist leaders describe any new social trend that makes people uncomfortable as foreign, or even a vicious attempt by foreigners to subvert their country&#39;s values. Iran&#39;s regime uses this argument about women&#39;s rights; Uganda&#39;s, about tolerance for gay people. Illiberal regimes habitually describe the values they oppose as alien, which is easier than explaining why they are wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Each nationalist leader is unique, and it is hard to tell which ones believe their own rhetoric. Either way, paranoid nationalism gives them tools to gain power, consolidate it, and disguise their abuse of it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Consider Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega, the president, was once a revolutionary Marxist. He shot his way to power in 1979 but lost an election in 1990. Determined to regain and retain power, he muffled his Marxism, dialled up the anti-American bombast, won an election in 2006 and has gradually throttled democracy ever since.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> His choice of bogeyman is shrewd. The United States really did sponsor violent revolutionaries in his country—four decades ago. That threat is long gone, but Mr Ortega still claims that his opponents are “agents of the Yankee empire” who “stopped being Nicaraguans long ago”. In February he had more than 300 dissidents stripped of their citizenship. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Following Mr Eriksson&#39;s script, Mr Ortega has put his kin in positions of power. His vice-president and likely successor is his wife, Rosario Murillo. Eight of their nine children help them run the country. Their son Laureano is a presidential adviser. He oversaw negotiations with a Chinese firm to build a $50bn canal across Nicaragua. The project collapsed in 2015 amid allegations of skulduggery. Laureano is also an opera singer. Not all opera fans are convinced of his talent. One critic likened his voice to the “shrieks of a goat giving birth”. But he regularly lands the starring role in operas backed by a foundation he runs, which is funded by Nicaraguan taxpayers.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Grand theft autocrat</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Ortega family run the main television channels in Nicaragua. This lets them slant the news in their favour. It is also lucrative. Between 2018 and 2020 Nicaragua&#39;s government bought advertising worth an estimated $59m from the three biggest <small>TV</small> channels owned or controlled by the Ortegas, while spending a measly $230,000 at channels not affiliated with them. In all, the family is thought to control 22 companies in industries from energy to property. Nicaragua is a whopping ten points more corrupt on <small>TI</small> ’s scale than in 2012, and now ranks lower than Congo.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In richer, more established democracies, too, paranoid nationalism offers a quick way for outsiders to grab attention and break into national politics, or remain on top. In May Viktor Orban, Hungary&#39;s prime minister, claimed at a conservative conference, “We are all under attack.” He vows to defend Hungarians against immigration, Islam and gay rights. He proclaims the unity of all ethnic Hungarians, including those in neighbouring countries. He gives them pensions and lets them vote in Hungarian elections; they tend to vote for him. Inflaming nationalism has thus helped him win four elections.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Hungarian media, which are now largely controlled by Mr Orban&#39;s cronies, parrot his claims of foreign plots. Tame courts raise few objections when rivers of aid from the European Union flow into the pockets of his chums and state assets are transferred to foundations controlled by his allies. Lorinc Meszaros, a former schoolmate of Mr Orban who owned a modest pipe-fitting business, has become the richest man in Hungary, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $1.4bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Hungary and elsewhere, nationalism offers a plausible-sounding excuse to weaken checks and balances. Watchdogs can be designated “foreign agents” and neutered. Honest public servants can be labelled “unpatriotic” and replaced with loyalists. Dodgy dealings can be kept secret in the name of national security.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Putin was a pioneer of this approach. In 2012 he introduced a law restricting the activities of <small>ngo</small> s that received money from abroad. In 2022 he broadened the law&#39;s scope. Now the state can declare any individual or group to be a “foreign agent” (which sounds to many ears like “spy”) if it deems them to be “under foreign influence”. So-called “foreign agents” can be banned from any kind of political activity, or simply shut down.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Elements of the Putin method have been widely imitated around the world. At least 50 countries have enacted rules to curb civil society in recent years, according to Amnesty International. More broadly, of the 31 countries that showed a significant deterioration on the Corruption Perceptions Index between 2012 and 2022, 80% also suffered a constriction of civil liberties, as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister organisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Labelling watchdogs “foreign agents” impedes their work. Nervous local donors grow reluctant to fund feisty <small>ngo</small> s; advertisers shun independent media, lest their brand names be tarnished by association. India has used its Foreign Contributions Regulation Act to harass and muzzle groups from Oxfam to Greenpeace. China&#39;s “foreign influence” rules restrict the activities of any foreign-linked <small>ngo</small> that might annoy the Communist Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In July Zimbabwe&#39;s president signed a “Patriotic Bill” allowing long jail terms for anyone caught “wilfully damaging the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe”. The opposition says it criminalised criticism of the government in the run-up to an election last week, which the ruling party “won” unfairly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Despite its name, the bill seems designed to make Zimbabwe worse-governed. It makes it hazardous for members of civil society, the principal check on a thieving ruling party, to have any contact with foreigners. If an independent journalist talks to a foreign diplomat, or a local election-monitoring group shares data with an international one, or an anti-corruption watchdog seeks advice from an expert abroad, jail may await. As a cherry on top, the law also makes it harder to punish predatory officials, by requiring prosecutors to prove that those who abuse office knew that their actions were wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In country after country, incumbents have found that nationalist or sectarian arguments can be used to harass or exclude from office those who challenge the status quo. Iran&#39;s corrupt theocracy insists that all presidential candidates meet its definition of Islamic piety. In 2021 it disqualified 585 of them, including all the would-be reformers, and allowed only seven to run. A new Polish law could bar from office politicians deemed to be unduly influenced by Russia; its probable target is Donald Tusk, a leading opposition candidate who is not pro-Russian at all. Since 2015, when Poland&#39;s nationalist ruling party took charge, the country has grown eight points grubbier on the Corruption Perceptions Index.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shades of greed</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A more nationalist government does not automatically mean a more corrupt one. It is possible for a country to become more tub-thumping, but no dirtier, at least for a while. However, in the long run, if a leader uses nationalism to erode checks and balances, it becomes easier for the people around him or his successors to plunder. This happened in Zimbabwe, where a nationalist autocrat who was far more interested in power than money, Robert Mugabe, failed to stop looting by his cronies and was ultimately overthrown by them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thus, regardless of the starting point, paranoid nationalism tends to make countries worse governed and less stable. A paper co-written by Abhijit Banerjee, a Nobel prize-winning economist, found that when voters pick candidates by ethnicity instead of, say, probity or competence, they end up with less honest, less competent representatives.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Andreas Wimmer of Columbia University crunched data from nearly 500 civil wars and found that when political parties are ethnically based, civil war is nearly twice as likely. And instability is perhaps 30 times as likely if the country in question is neither a dictatorship (which can crush unrest before it escalates) nor a full democracy (where disputes are typically resolved peacefully). In short, when a leader invokes blood and soil, expect things to get bloody, or soiled. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Inspect all our code, data and models on <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/the-economist-nationalism-and-corruption/tree/master">GitHub</a></i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 09:10:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ttf827decbkegnfcmlacnisovs2h4nbg</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/31/how-cynical-leaders-are-whipping-up-nationalism-to-win-and-abuse-power </item><item><title><![CDATA[El Niño and global warming are mixing in alarming ways]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20El%20Ni_o-c8f29ab72a33fa5f13dc4d00f5112413.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>FTER YEARS</small> of praying for more rain, Californians unexpectedly found themselves wishing for less this week, when tropical storm Hilary blew in from Mexico on August 21st. Rainfall records were smashed in Los Angeles and San Diego. Death Valley, farther inland, was deluged with as much rain in a day as it normally receives in a year. Inundated roads completely cut off the nearby city of Palm Springs (pictured) for a time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hurricanes and tropical storms hit California only very rarely: none had even come close since 1997, and the previous one to make landfall was in 1939. Most of the few that have reached the state, however, including Hilary, have coincided with El Niño, a weather pattern that temporarily raises global temperatures while redistributing heat and moisture around the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meteorologists predict that the current El Niño, which began in June, will be a strong one—perhaps as severe as the one that ended in 2016, which helped make that year the hottest ever recorded. If they are right, the record is almost certain to fall this year or next. “We are in uncharted waters,” says Maarten van Aalst, director of the Dutch meteorological agency and former head of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “We have never had an El Niño on top of so much global warming, so we don&#39;t know what is going to happen.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> El Niños form and eventually dissipate owing to interactions between the trade winds that blow to the south of the equator and the ocean beneath them. The resulting accumulations of hotter- or colder-than-average water and high or low pressure in the atmosphere affect temperatures, winds and rainfall. Most of the time, the trade winds blow warm water from the central Pacific westward, towards Australia and Asia. That movement, in turn, helps draw cooler water up from the depths in the eastern Pacific, near South America. But every two-to-seven years, conditions conspire to create a vast pool of warmer-than-average surface water all the way across the Pacific, as far as South America.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> • <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/08/30/el-nino-is-back-and-could-bring-devastation-far-beyond-extreme-weather">Listen to experts on our science podcast discuss  why the current El Niño is alarming climatologists</a> .</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Peruvian fishermen named this phenomenon after the baby Jesus ( <i>el niño Jesus</i> in Spanish) because it tends to reach its peak around Christmas. It is of more than passing interest to them: the vast shimmering shoals of <i>anchovetas</i> on which their livelihood depends prefer colder water, and so vanish when El Niño appears.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent weeks small fishing boats in the port of Pisco have been unloading species rarely found nearby: butterfish, sierra, sardines. Meanwhile, the industrial fishing fleet, which relies on <i>anchovetas</i> , languishes in the harbour. Farther down the waterfront, factories that normally grind its catch into fishmeal are shuttered. No smoke billows from their chimneys; no fishy odour lingers in the air. An industry with exports of $2bn a year has been brought to a standstill.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The hiatus has contributed to an economic contraction in Peru and is likely to keep global fishmeal prices high for much of the year. That, in turn, will raise costs for the fish farms and livestock businesses around the world that use the stuff as feed. But those are only the beginnings of El Niño&#39;s impacts. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toKK4bGaKWQ?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tropical Pacific is so immense that the warming of its surface by an extra degree or two is enough to supercharge the global climate. More water evaporates, which warms the upper atmosphere and fuels tropical thunderstorms. Convection carries this additional energy to colder regions to the north and south, on either side of the equator. The spinning of the Earth spreads the energy east, as well. The net result is a vast redistribution of heat and moisture. In climate jargon, El Niño is a prime example of the “teleconnection” of the world&#39;s weather systems. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">No two El Niños are the same, but some general patterns exist. Broadly speaking, the Amazon Basin, Australia, the Indian subcontinent, the Sahel, South-East Asia and southern Africa often suffer drier conditions; Central and East Asia, the Horn of Africa, the southern cone of South America and the southern United States tend to get wetter (see map). Sometimes, the consequences can be devastating. A relatively mild El Niño in 2018-19 helped to fuel some of the worst wildfires in Australia&#39;s history. The exceptionally strong El Niño of 2014-16 brought droughts and floods that left some 60m people around the world short of food, drove huge outbreaks of Zika virus across South America and bleached 29% of Australia&#39;s Great Barrier Reef.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At times, the changes in the weather can also bring benefits. This year rains in Argentina are expected to increase grain production, breaking a long drought. El Niño years typically yield milder Atlantic hurricane seasons, reducing damage to property and crops (though that may not hold this year because of unusually hot waters in the North Atlantic). El Niño&#39;s impacts are hugely varied, too, going far beyond fisheries and agriculture. In 2015 production at a lithium plant in northern Chile that accounted for 30% of the world&#39;s output was disrupted by heavy rain. The ensuing jitters in the lithium market were not something forecasters had predicted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such diversity makes it hard to assess whether the overall effect of El Niño is positive or negative for the world economy. A study by researchers at the International Monetary Fund published in 2016 found that El Niño had little effect one way or the other. But a paper published earlier this year in <i>Science</i> by Christopher Callahan of Stanford University and Justin Mankin of Dartmouth College finds that the El Niño cycles of 1982-83 and 1997-98 permanently reduced global <small>gdp</small> by $4.1trn and $5.7trn respectively. The first cycle, however, coincided with a period when the Federal Reserve, America&#39;s central bank, was raising interest rates; the second with the Asian financial crisis. In both periods, in other words, as El Niño unfolded, other completely unrelated factors were also curbing economic growth in emerging markets. Disaggregating the impact of these different events is extremely difficult.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All analyses, however, agree that poor countries are hit harder by El Niño than rich ones. Even in the <small>IMF</small> study that found little overall impact, big costs in the developing world were offset by higher agricultural yields in the United States in particular. Inflation, meanwhile, rose almost everywhere as commodity prices jumped.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> ENSO on ENSO on</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The more severe the El Niño, naturally, the bigger the impact. According to the latest forecast from <small>NOAA</small> , the American government&#39;s meteorological agency, there is a 66% chance that the current one will be “strong”. The assessment rests on the rise in surface temperatures above the norm within a specific area of the Pacific known as “Niño 3.4”. A 1.5°C rise constitutes a strong event; more than 2°C counts as “very strong”, on a par with the biggest El Niños of the past century. The previous El Niño, in 2018-19, peaked inside Niño 3.4 at 0.9°C. A climatologist calls it a “little futz of an El Niño”. The one before that, in 2014-16, spanned two winters and peaked at 2.6°C (see chart). Global average temperatures reached successive records in 2015 and 2016. According to Michelle L&#39;Heureux, who co-ordinates <small>NOAA</small> ’s El Niño forecast updates, there is a 30% chance that this year&#39;s will end up just as mighty. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Three factors are likely to compound this El Niño, bringing new extremes. First, it arrives right on the heels of three consecutive years of La Niña, the inverse of El Niño, when winds propel warm Pacific water more strongly than usual westward, towards Asia, temporarily reducing global temperatures. The wind patterns that dominate during La Niña tend to push heat deeper into the ocean. Some of that heat resurfaces during subsequent El Niños. Three straight years of La Niña mean there is more heat to be released.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is not just La Niña that has been storing heat in the world&#39;s oceans. So has global warming. For decades researchers have been taking the temperature not only at the surface but also at depths of up to 2,000 metres. Since the 1990s these deeper waters have been running an ever-rising fever. Some climate researchers are wondering whether the off-the-charts surface temperatures observed in the past month or so around the world&#39;s oceans could be linked to this pelagic flu.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although El Niño does cause surface temperatures to rise outside the Niño 3.4 region, that usually does not happen until much later in the year. A possible explanation of the early surge in temperatures is that some of the heat accumulated in the deep ocean is starting to resurface. “Perhaps we&#39;re beginning to see some of that redistribution of heat now manifesting itself,” says Piers Forster of the University of Leeds in Britain.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The theory that shifting thermal dynamics within the oceans may be intensifying this El Niño is not yet proved, but there is no question that global warming more broadly is set to make El Niños worse. “As climate change unfolds, the impacts for a given El Niño are not the same, they&#39;re bigger,” says Adam Scaife of the Met Office, Britain&#39;s meteorological agency. Global warming means the air is more charged with water, rainfall fluctuations are increasing, “and therefore, a given El Niño with the same strength as we had in the past can dump more water or cause a bigger drought.” Whereas the “triple dip” La Niña masked some warming, making temperatures cooler than they would otherwise have been, an El Niño will amplify it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “I am confident that 2024 will be unprecedented in terms of global temperatures,” says Dr Scaife. Currently, the planet is 1.26°C warmer than before the invention of the steam engine. As a rule of thumb, climatologists say, every degree of warming in the Niño 3.4 region during an El Niño temporarily adds 0.07°C to global average temperatures. A strong or very strong event could therefore push the total rise in the average temperature to 1.4°C.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That means that the regions that often suffer drought and wildfires during El Niño—Australia, Indonesia and parts of the Amazon Basin—are at heightened risk. In Australia alone, even the weak El Niño of 2019 helped to incinerate 240,000 square kilometres of bush, killing nearly 500 people, destroying thousands of homes and wiping out A$5bn ($3.5bn) of crops and livestock. This year&#39;s El Niño is likely to be compounded by the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole ( <small>IOD</small> ), a weather pattern characterised by fluctuating surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean that further accentuates dry conditions in Australia and Indonesia. Three years of heavy rains under La Niña, meanwhile, have boosted plant growth. Lingering moisture in the soil and plants may offer some protection. But if all that vegetation dries out, it will fuel fiercer blazes. To make matters worse, heavy rain and shortening winters have shrunk the window to carry out controlled burns, which are used to reduce the amount of fire-prone vegetation. New South Wales, Australia&#39;s most populous state, has conducted only 20% of its scheduled burn this year, according to Greg Mullins, a former fire commissioner.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Dipolar disorder</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>IOD</small> can also reinforce the wet conditions that El Niño typically brings to east Africa. On the face of things, that should be a positive after years of drought. But the rainfall is likely to be excessive, and might flood farmland and damage the roads used to bring crops to market. “We are on watch,” says Laura Harrison of the Climate Hazards Centre at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disasters of this sort will also create havoc in agricultural markets. As it is, India&#39;s government has declared a ban on exports of certain types of rice, in anticipation of drier-than-usual conditions while the current crop is growing. The ban affects about half of India&#39;s annual exports, which in total account for 40% of the global trade in rice by volume. It has sent world rice prices to their highest level since 2011.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The outlook for the rice market may get worse before it gets better. El Niños have in the past driven down rice yields: in 2015-16 South-East Asia&#39;s crop declined by 15m tonnes, 7% of global stocks. The spectre of potential shortages has prompted panic-buying among Asian governments since the beginning of the year. Indonesia, for example, has been snaffling up rice from Vietnam, the third-largest exporter after India and Thailand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Wheat, too, could be in for a wild ride. Australia produces 12-15% of the global crop and yields can halve in El Niño years. “Given the precarious situation of the wheat market, with the Russia-Ukraine war and other things, that Australian wheat crop is a very important one, and one we&#39;re watching closely,” says Paul Hughes of <small>S&amp;P</small> Global Commodity Insights, a research firm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Palm oil is another vulnerable product. A drought in Indonesia and Malaysia, the two biggest exporters, would diminish yields. <small>S&amp;P</small> Global reckons that Malaysian exports could fall by 10% if the incipient El Niño is mild and double that if it is severe. After Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine last year, palm oil helped make up for a dearth of sunflower oil, 75% of which is normally produced by the two adversaries. El Niño will thus come as a second blow to the already stretched market for edible oils. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Fishermen take a break after fishing anchovy" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Not what they wanted for Christmas</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another likely outcome of a strong El Niño is an increase in disease. Viruses replicate more quickly in vectors like mosquitoes as temperatures rise. Mosquitoes also bite more in the heat. Heavy rainfall creates more places for insects to breed, as can droughts, as people collect more water in accessible receptacles. Research collated by the World Health Organisation found that the dry conditions associated with El Niños across two decades boosted malaria cases in Colombia and Venezuela by more than a third. A strong El Niño in 1997-98 was associated with big malaria epidemics in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. This year heavy rains and floods exacerbated Peru&#39;s worst-ever outbreak of dengue, overwhelming hospitals in the north.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Flooding can result in poor sanitation, causing an increase in diarrheal diseases. The displacement and overcrowding that occurs after disaster strikes makes such outbreaks worse. If the Horn of Africa is indeed drenched by rain, a surge in cholera cases is likely.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Malnutrition exacerbates vulnerability to disease, particularly in the very young or very old. Save the Children, a charity, claims that the disruption brought by the El Niño of 2015-16 left an additional 6m children worldwide undernourished, three times the number affected in the same way by covid-19. And the pandemic has left health services overstretched and weakened. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a health charity, estimates that covid led to the biggest sustained decline in immunisation rates in 30 years, prompting a surge in outbreaks of preventable illnesses such as measles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact that many of these ill-effects are foreseeable does at least mean that governments and aid agencies can try to prepare for them. Since 2015 the humanitarian community has increasingly been incorporating seasonal forecasts into their planning, explains Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a climate forecaster at Columbia University and the Red Cross. In Honduras, for instance, the Red Cross activated an emergency protocol at the end of June based on the El Niño forecast issued by <small>NOAA</small> . It is distributing cash and kits to sanitise water to places at risk of drought.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But careful preparation only gets you so far, especially in poor countries with weak institutions and widespread corruption. Since the last strong El Niño, Peru has shuffled through six presidents. Precious little of the $14bn set aside for rebuilding and climate-proofing had been invested before floods and landslides hit the same areas again this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> More climate-related disasters will probably only deepen popular discontent and dysfunctional politics in Peru, further eroding the government&#39;s capacity to respond. In fact, oscillations in the climate have spurred the rise and fall of civilisations in South America for thousands of years. El Niño, writes author Brian Fagan, “can destroy the people&#39;s faith in the legitimacy of their leaders and in the foundations of their society”. Fempellec, a legendary ruler of an ancient Peruvian kingdom, provides a salutary example. According to myth, after sustained, unseasonable rains laid waste to crops, his people decided he was to blame.
