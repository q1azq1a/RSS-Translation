class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>像</span><small>每支</small>现代军队一样， <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/netanyahu-wages-war-and-fights-for-his-own-survival">以色列将军们</a>在过去一年半的时间里一直在密切关注乌克兰的战斗并做笔记。 10 月 7 日，以色列社区遭受<a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">恐怖袭击</a>，造成 1,400 多人被杀，现在以色列国防军 ( <small>IDF</small> ) 的坦克营已准备好大举进入加沙，这些教训尤其重要。尽管坦克越来越容易受到无人机、徘徊弹药和从顶部攻击的现代反坦克导弹的攻击，但坦克仍然是战场上唯一集机动性、防护性和强大火力于一体的平台。他们将成为以色列地面入侵加沙的先锋队，为身后的步兵部队扫清道路。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “我们看到了俄罗斯人如何在乌克兰作战以及他们犯下的错误，”<small>以色列国防军</small>装甲部队指挥官希沙姆·易卜拉欣准将说，他的职责是让以色列坦克及其人员做好战争准备。 “他们在那里以单军方式作战，而不是使用联合兵种战术，”他解释道。换句话说，俄罗斯的装甲团作为独立的坦克部队作战，而不是与步兵、作战工程和炮兵部队组成一体化编队，并且没有与情报和空中力量的协调。在某些情况下，坦克纵队在没有任何支援的情况下沿着道路排成一列，让乌克兰人将其击落。俄罗斯坦克乘员训练不足，几乎没有表现出遵循自己的条令的迹象。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列装甲部队的形状与以前不同，”易卜拉欣将军说。 “多年来，我们一直在各个级别进行联合训练。我们不再认为坦克能够做所有事情。战场已变；这里更加拥挤和拥挤。这些大平台面临很多挑战，我希望步兵和工兵能够弥补我的劣势。我们参加所有课程和演习的士兵现在已经习惯了在联合兵种环境中作战。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中许多想法最初是从以色列50年前赎罪日战争期间的大规模坦克战中学到的。在那场冲突中，<small>以色列国防军</small>的装甲营（有时单独行动）因苏联提供的埃及当时新颖的赛格反坦克导弹以及敌方坦克而遭受重大损失。以色列国防军迅速适应，其战术在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代被美国陆军广泛研究和采用。如今，以色列坦克兵被广泛认为是世界上训练有素、准备最充分的坦克兵之一。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但<small>以色列国防军</small>并不是唯一向乌克兰学习的国家。在哈马斯袭击以色列边境之初，袭击者使用携带大型手榴弹的无人机摧毁了观察哨。至少在一个案例中，有这样的手榴弹击中以色列梅卡瓦坦克的镜头。乌克兰人也曾对俄罗斯坦克使用过类似的战术。易卜拉欣将军坚称，虽然边境上的一些坦克被击中“两三次”，但没有一辆被摧毁，所有坦克很快就会恢复使用。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，在一些集结区域，人们看到梅卡瓦坦克配备了“顶笼”，即固定在炮塔（车辆最暴露的部分）上方的板条金属屏障，以阻止来自上方的此类攻击。俄罗斯去年使用这种简易装置引起了嘲笑，但以色列的采用表明装甲专业人士越来越严肃地对待无人机的威胁。<small>以色列国防军</small>常规装甲旅使用的梅卡瓦坦克的更先进版本（与预备役人员所使用的梅卡瓦坦克不同）配备了<small>TROPHY</small> ，这是一种极其先进的以色列设计的“主动防护系统”系统，事实证明，它可以有效地击败来袭的敌方坦克。带有向外爆炸的爆炸板的反坦克导弹。然而，并非所有坦克单位都配备该系统。以色列储存库中的每辆坦克，包括早期版本的梅卡瓦坦克，现在都在部署中，这表明即将开展的大规模行动以及保卫以色列与黎巴嫩北部边境的必要性。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯袭击开始后两小时内，易卜拉欣将军就通知<small>以色列国防军</small>所有装甲旅指挥官，他们应该开始动员，甚至在军队高层发出正式命令之前。现在，自 1982 年以色列入侵黎巴嫩以来，四十多年来第一次，整个装甲部队都被征召入伍。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是一支庞大的部队，尽管以色列国防军热衷于保护其作战安全，并未透露具体数字，但据了解其中包括 1000 多辆主战坦克。其中许多并不是为了对加沙进行地面进攻，而是部署在以色列北部，以防与伊朗支持的黎巴嫩运动真主党爆发战争，真主党每天都用火箭弹和迫击炮弹挑衅以色列的回应自 10 月 7 日哈马斯袭击以来的炮击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果第二条战线确实爆发，以色列坦克兵将进行两种类型的战争。虽然哈马斯和真主党在之前与以色列坦克的交锋中都使用了类似的战术和武器——小型伏击队发射俄罗斯制造（和伊朗提供）的反坦克导弹——但地形将产生很大的不同。在加利利和黎巴嫩南部的丘陵林地地区面对真主党的前景与在加沙城建筑密集的城市地区的战斗截然不同，在加沙城，袭击可能来自近距离。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">多年来，军事专家们一致认为，在狭窄的城市街道上驾驶笨重的坦克作战是一种负担。但更明智的观点是，如果使用得当，并与其他地面部队配合，在全副武装的对手保卫的城市环境中作战时，没有什么可以取代坦克的火力和突破能力。美国指挥官表示，坦克在伊拉克战争的关键城市战斗中发挥着至关重要的作用，包括轻型装甲车无法胜任的情况。在巴格达充满敌意的郊区萨德尔城，美国坦克和其他装甲车组成了一项研究所称的“流动装甲箱”，它们可以缓慢、稳定和安全地移动，而不会使徒步部队面临危险。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与许多其他坦克作战人员相比，以色列坦克军至少有两个优势。一是哈马斯不被认为拥有“顶部攻击”反坦克导弹，如供应给乌克兰的美国“标枪”和英瑞<small>“NLAW”</small>反坦克导弹，这些导弹可以攻击坦克装甲最薄弱的部分——车体顶部。另一个原因是，以色列坦克的设计目的是在该国边境作战，而不是远离家乡，并提供高水平的保护。这使得它们相对笨重，移动性可能较差，但能够承受严重的撞击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">除了“主动”防护之外，更先进的以色列坦克和步兵战车还拥有先进的通信系统。这些设备将它们连接到一个网络，该网络在坦克的屏幕上为部队提供服务，所有信息都是由其他以色列平台上的传感器收集的，包括盘旋在头顶上的无人机的镜头。 “今天的坦克可以利用从其他来源收集的信息向目标开火，并自行收集信息，这些信息将被其他火源使用，”易卜拉欣将军说。这克服了城市战的传统问题：视线短，其中一个坦克排可能不知道下一个街区周围发生了什么。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与世界各地的坦克将军一样，他非常不同意那些根据俄罗斯的失败推断坦克时代已经结束的人，并引用了 10 月 7 日的事件作为证据。当数千名武装分子沿着边境围栏通过 29 个突破口冲入以色列时，他认为，在某些时候，当天早上驻扎在边境的少量坦克“是唯一剩下的保护层，他们使用了所有武器” 、大炮、机枪，然后跑过去，试图阻止周围数百名试图进入社区的恐怖分子。”由于边境上的大部分观察和摄像头都被摧毁，坦克上往往携带着唯一仍在运行以传递重要信息的监视系统。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最终，<small>以色列国防军</small>那天早上的失败是情报评估和缺乏能够快速到达边境的部队的原因之一。但易卜拉欣将军坚称，在当时抵达基布兹的少数坦克中，“它们是恢复对这些社区的控制和结束流血事件的关键因素。没有什么能像坦克那样做到这一点。” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

class="article__body-text">这次袭击使所有其他针对以色列平民的大规模谋杀事件相形见绌。以色列独立战争期间阿拉伯人犯下的最血腥暴行是 1948 年 5 月在以色列定居点 Kfar Etzion 发生的大屠杀，造成 127 人死亡。巴勒斯坦恐怖分子此前最致命的一次袭击是2002年在内坦亚市一家酒店的逾越节家宴上引爆的炸弹，造成30人死亡。10月7日的死亡人数已经超过了第二次起义期间以色列人死亡的总人数。巴勒斯坦起义从2000年持续到2005年。作为以色列人口的一部分，这相当于9月11日12日的袭击——每日死亡率只有全面战争、种族灭绝或自然灾害才能超过。</p><p class="article__body-text">最尖锐的历史比较是在以色列建国之前。并非所有哈马斯的受害者都是以色列人，也并非所有以色列死者都是犹太人。但根据对这次和之前袭击中被杀者的种族构成的合理假设，10 月 7 日之前最后一次在一天内杀害这么多犹太人是在大屠杀期间。 <span>■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>图表来源：

class="article__body-text">他们家外的难以想象的场景也开始在社交媒体上流传：巴勒斯坦武装分子坐在一辆皮卡车的床上，驶过以色列城镇，向路人开枪；公共汽车站有一堆尸体，军事哨所也有一堆尸体。早上的时间持续得很长，但没有任何救援到来。疯狂的以色列人在他们的安全室里打电话给电视新闻节目，并小声询问他们的军队在哪里。</p><p class="article__body-text">然后，同样令人震惊的是关于绑架的报道。一位母亲说，她的两个儿子（其中一个只有 12 岁）被绑架并拖过边境。一段视频显示，一名老妇人开着高尔夫球车在加沙街道上游行，她僵硬的笑容掩盖了她的震惊，一名武装男子坐在她身后。</p><p class="article__body-text">死亡人数不断上升。近一周后，当局仍在清点尸体。在 Be&#39;eri 这个约有 1000 人的小基布兹，武装分子挨家挨户屠杀了大约 10% 的人口。在以北 8 公里的卡法阿扎 (Kfar Azza)，死亡人数可能更多。</p><p class="article__body-text">对于以色列人来说，10 月 7 日是史无前例的一天。在这个面积只有 1000 万的国家里，有超过 1,300 人被杀。<a href="/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history">死亡人数</a>超过了过去20年以色列和巴勒斯坦之间所有暴力事件中丧生的以色列人人数。另有 3,300 人受伤。以色列人曾认为控制加沙的巴勒斯坦伊斯兰组织哈马斯是一个可以控制的威胁。现在它发动了该国历史上最致命的恐怖袭击。中东最强大的军队失去了对自己城镇的控制，需要几天时间才能重新控制。当局已找到至少 1,500 名巴勒斯坦武装分子的尸体，超过一个营的枪手数量，他们设法冲过据称防守严密的边界。</p><p class="article__body-text">随着震惊逐渐变成愤怒，迫在眉睫的问题是以色列将如何应对。它已经开始了报复性空袭，造成 1,200 多名巴勒斯坦人死亡，其中许多是平民，并使超过 30 万人流离失所。以色列不会就此止步，尽管其军事选择毫无吸引力。未来几周，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人必将遭受更多苦难。</p><p class="article__body-text">但 10 月 7 日的后果将更为广泛。这场大屠杀不仅可能重塑以色列对巴勒斯坦人的态度，也可能重塑其国内政治。它<a href="/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause">威胁到哈马斯对加沙权力的控制</a>；它还可能引发地区战争。</p><p class="article__body-text">袭击以一连串火箭弹开始：几个小时内就发射了 2,200 枚火箭弹。这已经足够令人震惊了：哈马斯在 2014 年对以色列的战争中花了近一个月的时间才发射了这么多子弹。但以色列人很快发现这些发射是为更大规模的行动做掩护。推土机冲破了边境围栏，数百名武装分子涌了过去。其他人乘坐滑翔伞飞越它，或者乘坐小艇绕它航行。他们呈扇形散布到以色列城镇并开始杀戮。</p><p class="article__body-text">以色列花了几个小时才组织防御。一些部队不得不从北部边境赶往南方。他们一抵达，就在集结地苦苦挣扎，而指挥官则试图制定作战计划。几位退役将军亲自动手，穿上旧军装，驱车前往被围困的村庄，进行临时反击。</p><p class="article__body-text">甚至在收复自己的领土之前，以色列就开始对加沙进行空袭。总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡宣布以色列处于战争状态，他的政府开始为可能的地面进攻做准备。军队已动员了 36 万名预备役军人，并花了几天时间将坦克和其他装备运送到加沙边境。国防部长约夫·加兰特承诺全面包围加沙。 “没有电，没有食物，没有水，没有燃料，一切都关闭了。” 10 月 11 日，其唯一的发电厂燃料耗尽并关闭。</p><p class="article__body-text">埃雷兹是以色列和加沙之间的唯一过境点，已无限期关闭。以色列要求加沙平民通过与埃及接壤的拉法过境点逃离，但一再轰炸该过境点。无论如何，埃及严格限制允许过境的人数。即使在和平时期，巴勒斯坦人也很难离开加沙。现在这是不可能的了。</p><p class="article__body-text">当以色列军队准备在加沙作战时，必须密切关注其北部边境。 10 月 8 日，黎巴嫩的什叶派激进组织和政党真主党炮击了有争议的一小片领土沙巴阿农场。根据不成文的交战规则，沙巴发生的事情就留在沙巴：真主党可以表达对巴勒斯坦人的支持，但也可以向以色列表明，它不希望发生更广泛的冲突。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而一天后，以色列军队击毙了一群从黎巴嫩越境的枪手。三名真主党武装分子随后在以色列的报复性轰炸中被打死，导致该组织向以色列军队哨所发射火箭弹。双方可能都不想爆发战争，但升级并不总是符合逻辑。黎巴嫩民众纷纷囤积食物和燃料。以色列已撤离北部边境附近的城镇。哈马斯大声呼吁其他国家加入对以色列的攻击。</p><p class="article__body-text">以色列军队可能需要时间来准备，但对加沙地带的地面进攻似乎几乎是肯定的。以色列军队从 1967 年到 2005 年占领加沙，随后撤军，迫使约 8,000 名犹太定居者随之撤退。此后，以色列基本上封锁了该领土的空中、陆地和海上，同时允许一些巴勒斯坦人在以色列工作，并允许非威胁性的货物进入。 （埃及几乎也有同样的限制。）</p><p class="article__body-text">以色列最近一次入侵加沙是在 2014 年，目的是摧毁哈马斯在边界围栏下挖掘的用于渗透以色列的隧道。以色列军队并没有渗透到该地区很远的地方，该地区只有约10公里宽、40公里长，但却居住着200万人口。即便如此，这次行动还是表明地面攻击可能会出错。哈马斯部队袭击了拉法附近的以色列巡逻队，并俘获了一名军官哈达尔·戈尔丁。以色列随后连续几天炮击拉法，造成数十名巴勒斯坦人死亡。戈尔丁后来被宣布死亡。以色列人将此事件称为“黑色星期五”。</p><p class="article__body-text">即将到来的攻击将会更大。以色列可能部署两个装甲师和一个轻型空降师，每个师下辖五个旅。其中一些部队正在等待坦克和其他装备到达加沙周围的集结地。其他人在过去几天的战斗中遭受了损失。</p><p class="article__body-text">假设以色列领导人确实下令大规模入侵，一两个装备坦克的装甲旅可能会试图通过代尔巴拉附近最窄处（6公里）向西推进，将地带一分为二。其他两三个旅规模的部队（每个几千人）可能会集中在北部，包括加沙城周围，另外一两个部队则集中在南部的汗尤尼斯或拉法。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280"

alt="哈马斯武装分子袭击音乐节后，汽车散落在路边"></span><figcaption>大屠杀纪念碑</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text">他们的目标可能是针对哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战组织（一个独立的激进组织），重点关注空袭范围之外的领导人和基础设施。哈马斯声称其在加沙拥有数百公里的隧道。找到他们的入口并投放炸药将是首要任务。最大的挑战将是城市战，这是一项众所周知的艰巨任务。加沙的人口比伦敦或东京更稠密，为武装分子提供了很多藏身之处，而平民却没有多少地方可以避难。</p><p class="article__body-text">哈马斯可能指望进行相对谨慎的袭击。该组织认为，以色列无法承受地面入侵造成的巨大伤亡。 “我们知道他们是胆小鬼，”驻卡塔尔的哈马斯高级官员穆萨·阿布·马尔祖克说。 “我们知道他们无法在地面上作战。”它还预计加沙地带100多名以色列和外国人质的存在将限制以色列军队。哈马斯希望用这些囚犯来交换以色列监狱中关押的 5,200 名巴勒斯坦人中的许多人（如果不是全部的话）。它还威胁说，每次以色列“在没有事先警告的情况下”轰炸加沙平民住宅时，就会杀死一名平民。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，最近几天灾难性的死亡人数可能会改变以色列的盘算。华盛顿智库布鲁金斯学会的纳坦·萨克斯表示：“以色列承担成本的意愿——而且是确切的——成本比过去高得多。”至于人质，许多仍在埋葬亲人的以色列人表示，他们没有心情与杀害他们的组织讨价还价。</p><h2>忽视后果自负</h2><p class="article__body-text">事实上，以色列不得不重新审视许多长期持有的假设，最引人注目的是认为加沙可以安全地任其恶化的信念。 2007年哈马斯从巴勒斯坦<small>临时</small>政府手中夺取了对加沙的控制权后，以色列和埃及大幅收紧了边境限制，窒息了加沙的经济。尽管此后暴力事件屡屡发生，但以色列官员开始认为哈马斯变得更加务实。 “最重要的是，他们希望保持对加沙的控制，”一名军官去年表示。 “要做到这一点，他们需要改善经济。”人们的想法是，如果以色列允许阿拉伯政府为加沙的基本社会服务提供资金，并为加沙人在以色列工作发放更多许可证，那么该领土将保持静止状态。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种观点不仅完全错误，而且以色列自诩的安全部门也未能发现一场精心策划的袭击正在酝酿之中。加沙的每一个电话都通过以色列网络进行，这简化了窃听。无人机经常飞越该地带。以色列在该领土上也有庞大的线人网络，但都无济于事。</p><p class="article__body-text">毫无疑问，部分问题在于概念上的失败：认为哈马斯已经对大规模冲突失去了兴趣。事实上，甚至一些哈马斯领导人似乎也感到惊讶。阿布·马尔祖克表示，他和卡塔尔其他高级领导人事先并未获悉此次袭击事件。自2017年叶海亚·辛瓦尔成为加沙哈马斯领导人以来，少数主要在加沙的强硬派巩固了权力。</p><p class="article__body-text">第二个错误是本雅明·内塔尼亚胡(Binyamin Netanyahu)对巴勒斯坦人采取的分而治之的政策，内塔尼亚胡在过去14年中有12年担任以色列总理。长期以来，他一直试图削弱<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>，该机构仍然管理着约旦河西岸的部分地区。自 2014 年半心半意的谈判破裂以来，他一直拒绝恢复和平谈判。他冻结了<small>以色列</small>代表巴勒斯坦权力机构征收的税收收入的转移。与此同时，他将哈马斯视为加沙的合法势力。例如，2011 年，他批准了一项协议，用 1,027 名巴勒斯坦囚犯交换武装分子 2006 年抓获的以色列士兵吉拉德·沙利特 (Gilad Shalit)。这次交换自然提高了哈马斯在巴勒斯坦人中的地位。</p><p class="article__body-text">对于内塔尼亚胡先生来说，逻辑很清楚。巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>致力于与以色列谈判两国解决方案，这令总理的右翼支持者感到厌恶。削弱巴勒斯坦权力<small>机构</small>并支持其激进竞争对手将有助于他声称以色列没有“和平伙伴”。但巴勒斯坦人却得到了一个不同的、但也是可以预见的教训：从以色列获得让步的唯一方法是通过武力。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，哈马斯现在可能做得有些过头了。一些观察家认为，它没想到攻击会如此成功，并且不确定如何进行。它可能希望吓唬以色列让步，但实际上却让以色列做好了战争的准备。以色列军队10月10日告诉外国国防武官，其目标是“消灭”哈马斯的领导层。据参加会议的人士透露，军方的最终目标是摧毁哈马斯的能力，无论需要多长时间。然而，说起来容易做起来难，正如美国在阿富汗长期战争中或以色列在占领黎巴嫩南部 18 年期间所学到的那样。</p><figure> <span><meta><img width="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_FBP002.jpg"

class="article__body-text">即使以色列能够铲除哈马斯，也没有人知道什么会取代它。巴勒斯坦权力<small>机构</small>太弱，无法在加沙维护权威；它甚至还不足以控制西岸，部分地区已经陷入无政府状态。大多数巴勒斯坦人和大多数加沙人都希望解散它。 87岁的总统马哈茂德·阿巴斯已经近20年没有踏足加沙了。</p><p class="article__body-text">有人闲谈派遣阿拉伯维和人员保卫加沙，但很少有阿拉伯政权愿意这样做。 1949年至1967年埃及占领加沙；双方都对那段时光有着痛苦的回忆。沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋等海湾国家无意统治超过200万巴勒斯坦人。大多数以色列人也不希望重新占领该领土。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，入侵然后离开并不能改变现状。以色列人离开后，哈马斯的领导人和大部分武装人员可能会从他们的掩体中出来并恢复对巴勒斯坦领土的控制。这是一个令人难以接受的结果，但却是最有可能的结果。</p><p class="article__body-text">对于任何以色列政府来说，制定明确的前进道路都是困难的，尤其是现任政府。今年是政治严重动荡的一年。经过一年多的反对后，内塔尼亚胡在 11 月份的提前选举中赢得了多个席位。他领导的政府完全由右翼和宗教政党组成。他的国家安全部长伊塔马尔·本-格维尔因极端民族主义观点而被禁止在以色列军队服役。</p><p class="article__body-text">此后，内塔尼亚胡推行了一个分裂的议程，其中包括限制最高法院推翻政府政策的权力，以及赋予政客在法官任命方面更多的发言权。批评者称这是一场司法“政变”，并于今年每周六举行大规模抗议活动，直到 10 月 7 日被暂停。陆军预备役军人威胁要抵制他们的义务兵役（这一策略也已被搁置）。</p><p class="article__body-text">乐观者希望本月的大屠杀将有助于使以色列政治重新回到中间位置。纳夫塔利·贝内特 (Naftali Bennett) 的顾问希姆里特·梅厄 (Shimrit Meir) 写道：“在最黑暗的日子过后，如果能够达成和解，那就是以色列恢复理智、结束政治危机并组建联合政府。”贝内特于 2021 年接替内塔尼亚胡出任总理。短暂担任总理。内塔尼亚胡先生在 10 月 9 日的黄金时段讲话中敦促中间派政党“无条件”加入他的政府。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 10月11日，经过几天的谈判，领导第二大中间派政党民族团结党的前陆军参谋长本尼·甘茨同意加入“紧急政府”。但最大反对党 Yesh Atid 的领导人 Yair Lapid 迄今拒绝参加。</p><h2>团结在怀疑之中</h2><p class="article__body-text">对于两党来说，困境在于加入一个他们的支持者在过去一年里一直抗议的政府。内塔尼亚胡承诺不会推行任何与战争无关的立法，但拒绝抛弃他最极端的联盟伙伴。对于一位一如既往地关心自己政治生存的首相来说，这是有道理的。只要战斗持续，联合政府就会持续下去。内塔尼亚胡先生不想疏远他随后需要组建另一个右翼联盟的政党。甘茨先生无论如何都捏着鼻子加入，向缺乏军事专业知识的政府提供军事专业知识。</p><p class="article__body-text">尽管这将暂时稳定政府，但最近几天发生的事件可能会结束内塔尼亚胡先生漫长且充满卷土重来的职业生涯。他花了一年的时间进行一场不必要的政治斗争，而不是关注真正的威胁——而在此之前的许多年，他一直在努力让巴勒斯坦成为一个无法解决的问题。安全是他的口号，十多年来他一直负责监督以色列武装部队和情报部门，只曾短暂中断过一段时间。</p><p class="article__body-text">哈马斯则选择了凶残的虚无主义。与加沙领导人交谈就像进入了一个幻想世界，在那里加沙得到了“解放”，尽管其居民却被困在 365 平方公里的牢房里，陷入贫困。对以色列的胜利即将到来，在那之前，加沙人将欣然忍受他们的命运。自大屠杀发生以来，该组织明确表示，除了希望引发对以色列更广泛的攻击之外，除了持续暴力外，它没有任何计划。</p><p class="article__body-text">简而言之，正在发生的灾难似乎很可能暴露出双方思维的贫乏。唉，最近几天发生的令人震惊的流​​血事件，以及未来可能发生的更多恐怖事件，也将使采取更具建设性的方法来解决冲突变得更加困难。 <span>■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 10:28:19

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“噢，</span><small>我们所有阿拉伯和伊斯兰国家的人民</small>，”哈马斯军事部门领导人穆罕默德·戴伊夫在该组织袭击以色列南部之际发布的一份录音声明中吟诵道。 “……任何有枪的人都应该把它拿出来的一天已经到来。现在是时候了。如果你没有枪，请拿起你的菜刀、斧头、斧头、燃烧瓶、卡车、推土机或汽车。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些人响应了他的号召。在埃及第二大城市亚历山大，一名警察枪杀了两名以色列游客和他们的导游。在以色列与黎巴嫩紧张的边境地区，发生了零星的战斗。从巴林到摩洛哥，哈马斯的支持者纷纷走上街头。在叙利亚首都大马士革，巴勒斯坦国旗照亮了歌剧院。在黎巴嫩的巴勒斯坦难民营中，游客们报告了狂欢节的气氛。在阿拉伯世界颇受欢迎的半岛电视台的所在地卡塔尔，流亡的哈马斯领导人跪倒在办公室地板上致谢，该电视台一直以毫不掩饰的钦佩之情报道暴行。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但哈马斯号召援助的阿拉伯和穆斯林军团还没有动静，至少现在还没有。一些阿拉伯政府已经或正在考虑与以色列正式实现和平。大多数其他人热衷于将敌意限制在纯粹的言辞层面。他们的秘密警察通常会压制任何抗议活动，担心示威者也可能反对他们自己的政府。此外，自2011年“阿拉伯之春”令人兴奋的抗议活动演变成混乱、分裂、暴力和镇压之后，阿拉伯“街道”仍处于疲惫不堪的状态。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，暴力和战争蔓延到其他战线，特别是黎巴嫩的危险依然严峻。以色列预计在加沙开始的地面行动可能是一个触发因素。一方面，美国正在认真对待这一威胁。它已在以色列附近海域部署了一艘航空母舰和其他军舰。中东的空军中队正在得到加强。紧急武器正在运往以色列。其目的既是为了表达对以色列的声援，也是为了阻止伊朗及其代理人参与其中。乔·拜登总统 10 月 10 日表示：“对于任何国家、任何组织、任何想利用这种情况的人，我都有一句话。” “不。不。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由宿敌伊朗及其在伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚和也门的代理人组成的所谓以色列“抵抗轴心”的成员正在为哈马斯的“胜利行动”欢呼，并暗示他们可能会加入战斗。但目前还没有人这样做。真主党是黎巴嫩的什叶派民兵兼政党，可以说是以色列边境上最强大的敌人，它知道它在 2006 年发起的支持哈马斯的战争对黎巴嫩造成了巨大的破坏。到目前为止，它还没有再次加入。由于经济崩溃，黎巴嫩无力应对另一场灾难。即使像真主党这样的国中之国也可能会犹豫是否要造成进一步的损害。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊朗也保持着干燥状态。它向真主党提供的12万至15万枚导弹和火箭可能主要是为了阻止以色列轰炸伊朗核设施。尽管伊朗发表了各种反以色列言论，但它从未为巴勒斯坦人发动过战争。加沙的一名哈马斯官员表示：“我们知道我们是（伊朗）的工具。”他指出，哈马斯和伊朗在逊尼派和什叶派穆斯林之间的宗派分歧上处于对立面。 “归根结底，我们只有<i>zawaj muta</i> ，一段临时婚姻。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，随着加沙战斗的加剧，轴心国采取更多行动的压力可能会增加。四个月前，真主党在黎巴嫩南部进行了一场大肆宣传的军事演习，练习占领以色列城镇。黎巴嫩安全专家希拉尔·卡尚表示，哈马斯现在这样做“让他们面临压力”。目前，跨境袭击的目的似乎是警告，而不是战争的开始。哈马斯发动袭击的第二天，真主党炮击了以色列在沙巴阿农场的阵地，这是一个有争议的边境地区，那里的战斗往往是自给自足的。其他地方也发生了更严重的交火，包括导弹和炮火。真主党报告称，其三名战士已被打死。以色列军队表示，还击毙了至少两名渗透者。问题是这些小冲突是否会升级为更大的事件。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">亚伯拉罕焦躁不安的孩子们</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊朗已经从哈马斯的屠杀中获益。它最大的担忧是其海湾邻国与以色列的和解。根据《亚伯拉罕协议》，以色列近年来与包括巴林和阿拉伯联合酋长国在内的几个阿拉伯国家实现了关系正常化。下一个获奖者是沙特阿拉伯，它是世界上最大的石油出口国，也是伊斯兰教两个圣地的所在地。上个月，沙特王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼表示，与以色列的协议即将达成：“我们每天都在更接近。”以色列部长已开始公开访问沙特阿拉伯。就在哈马斯袭击前几天，伊朗最高领导人阿亚图拉阿里哈梅内伊警告说，与以色列建立关系的国家正在将自己置于“危险之中”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">考虑到沙特阿拉伯国内民众的敌意，以及王子要求与美国签订正式防御条约和浓缩铀手段等要求，以色列和沙特阿拉伯之间的协议永远不会轻易达成。如果以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡向巴勒斯坦人做出沙特希望的让步，他也将面临失去极右翼联盟盟友的风险。尽管如此，破坏这笔交易可能是哈马斯发动袭击的主要目标之一。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果是这样，它可能已经成功了，至少在一段时间内是这样。华盛顿智库卡内基国际和平基金会的亚伦·大卫·米勒表示，美国促成以色列与沙特达成协议的能力“已降至零”。鉴于流血事件，任何以色列领导人都不会向巴勒斯坦人做出让步。沙特阿拉伯也将受到类似的限制，无论如何，穆罕默德亲王可能不愿意仓促与可能很快失去权力的美国和以色列领导人达成协议。由于“持续占领”，沙特外交部实际上将暴力归咎于以色列。 10 月 11 日，穆罕默德王子和伊朗总统易卜拉欣·莱西通了电话——这是他们第一次这样做。伊朗表示，他们讨论了“结束针对巴勒斯坦的战争罪行的必要性”；沙特方面表示，王子正试图“阻止局势持续升级”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管沙特阿拉伯对与以色列建立关系犹豫不决，但欧盟却因支持巴勒斯坦权力机构而陷入困境。巴勒斯坦权力机构管理着巴勒斯坦人控制的西岸部分地区，由巴勒斯坦竞争对手法塔赫领导。派别属于哈马斯。<small>欧盟</small>对<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>的援助正在接受审查，因为有人声称它可能资助极端主义。 10 月 9 日，欧盟扩大事务专员奥利弗·瓦赫利 (Oliver Varhelyi) 表示，价值数亿美元的付款已被暂停。他立即遭到<small>欧盟</small>最高外交官何塞普·博雷尔的反驳，博雷尔表示“惩罚所有巴勒斯坦人民”会损害<small>欧盟</small>。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">拜登和比比的B计划</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至于以色列的重要盟友美国，这场大屠杀使拜登和内塔尼亚胡之间和解了。拜登对以色列转向民族主义右翼以及针对遏制司法机构的大规模抗议活动感到担忧，此前曾试图限制与内塔尼亚胡的接触。现在，他给了总理很大的余地来采取军事反应。他在 10 月 10 日的电视讲话中宣称：“毫无疑问，美国是以色列的支持者。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登先生迫切关心的是确定有多少美国人被杀（已确认死亡 22 人）或被扣为人质（具体数字未知，但仍有 17 人下落不明）。第二个更广泛的目标是控制整个地区可能出现的冲击波。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登对以色列的拥抱可能在某个时候成为一种温和的克制形式。美国开始更加关注加沙平民的困境。拜登敦促以色列“在战争法范围内”行动，这是对以色列官员的一种含蓄的谴责，他们曾谈到“全面围困”并切断对该领土的食品、水和电力供应。美国敦促以色列和埃及开放某种人道主义走廊。细节尚不清楚，但有报道称，它正在倡导为美国公民和至少一些巴勒斯坦人提供离开加沙的安全方式。 “平民没有做错任何事。我们希望确保他们有出路，”白宫发言人表示。但埃及不希望出现人员外逃。其总统阿卜杜勒-法塔赫·塞西表示，巴勒斯坦问题的解决不应“以牺牲其他各方的利益为代价”。承认巴勒斯坦难民大量涌入将破坏埃及的稳定，并可能被视为为以色列对加沙的破坏性袭击铺平道路。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">动荡中的另一项克制努力涉及伊朗。也许是因为他们不想开辟另一条战线，美国和以色列官员表示，没有关于伊朗或真主党直接参与策划或指挥哈马斯袭击的硬情报。但拜登的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文坚称，“从广义上讲，伊朗是这次袭击的同谋，因为他们向哈马斯提供了大部分资金”，更不用说多年的训练、武器和其他支持了。一些报道称伊朗对这次袭击感到惊讶。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登上任时希望恢复一项限制伊朗核计划的协议，巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)不顾内塔尼亚胡的反对签署了该协议，但唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)撕毁了该协议。目前还没有达成协议，伊朗现在距离制造核弹更近了。 Hamas&#39;s horror now risks making him look like a dupe for even trying to negotiate with a regime that chants “Death to Israel”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indeed, Republicans are drawing a direct line between Mr Biden&#39;s Iran policy and Hamas&#39;s slaughter. They criticise him in general for easing Mr Trump&#39;s policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran. And they denounce him in particular for negotiating a deal to secure the release in September of five imprisoned Americans. This involved the unfreezing of $6bn in Iranian oil revenues in South Korea, now held in escrow in Qatar. The administration says the money has not yet been disbursed and will be used only to pay non-Iranian contractors for food and other humanitarian supplies. “Nobody in Iran will ever touch a single dinar or cent or rial from those funds,” insists a senior official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Never mind the facts. For Mr Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee, “American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks.” He later lamented, “We are perceived as being weak and ineffective, with a really weak leader.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That said, Republicans are not helping Israel much. Their divisions, and the approach of next year&#39;s elections, have made <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/paralysis-in-congress-makes-america-a-dysfunctional-superpower">Congress</a> more dysfunctional than usual. The Senate has not confirmed Mr Biden&#39;s nominee for ambassador to Israel, nor hundreds of senior military appointments. The budget process—including new military aid for Ukraine and possibly for Israel—is at a standstill. A government shutdown looms again in November. And at a rally on October 11th, Mr Trump himself called Israel&#39;s defence minister a “jerk”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Both out of sincere belief and to defuse Republican attacks, Mr Biden will hug Israel close. “Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond—indeed has a duty to respond—to these vicious attacks,” he argued. What then? Nobody can tell what Gaza, or the Middle East, will be like after Israel&#39;s retribution. Mr Biden will need a new strategy for the region now that Hamas has upended much of his old one. Israel-Saudi normalisation is set back. The “two-state” solution to the Palestinian question has all but vanished. A less hostile relationship with Iran seems impossible. And the president&#39;s hopes of turning away from the Middle East to focus on the great-power contests with Russia and especially China have been dashed. As America knows all too well, from its experience of Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, overreaction to bloodthirsty terrorism without a viable long-term plan can lead to disaster.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Less than a fortnight ago, in a different era, Mr Sullivan had declared with satisfaction: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.” He recognised that “all that can change” but boasted that he had to spend less time than any of his predecessors since 9/11 dealing with crisis and conflict there. Now he has joined them, somehow trying to contain the Middle East&#39;s entropy and violent politics. Mr Sullivan had sought to “depressurise, de-escalate and ultimately integrate the Middle East region”. But it all risks going into reverse: conflict, escalation and disarray could easily start feeding each other once again. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 10:15:23 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qj8bss66cemnue1fg97t246smbc9ibms</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamas-has-failed-to-rally-the-middle-east-to-its-cause </item><item><title><![CDATA[The war in Ukraine is threatening to wash across the Black Sea]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20The%20Black%20Sea-a34b4b127b192d3ddc0d94d8286e7553.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>W</span> <small>HEN RUSSIA</small> invaded Ukraine last year, the Black Sea seemed unlikely to become much of a battleground. The Ukrainian navy, after all, had only one warship, which it was forced to scuttle as Russian troops advanced on the shipyard where it was being repaired, in the city of Mykolaiv. Snake Island, a maritime outpost guarding the western approaches of Odessa, Ukraine&#39;s biggest port, fell to Russian attackers on the first day of the war. Odessa itself braced for an amphibious assault that would have cut Ukraine off from the sea altogether.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact the landings never came was the first sign that Russia&#39;s dominion over the sea was not as absolute as it seemed. A more ringing indication of that came in April of last year, when Ukraine managed to sink the flagship of Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet, the <i>Moskva</i> , using a newly developed anti-ship missile. Two months later intense Ukrainian bombardment drove the occupiers from Snake island. But it is only much more recently that Ukraine has begun to demonstrate a capacity to strike targets across the Black Sea.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In early August a Ukrainian naval drone—another new weapon—damaged a Russian landing-ship just off Novorossiysk, a big Russian port far to the east of the war zone. The following day another drone damaged a Russian oil tanker off Crimea, the peninsula that dominates the Black Sea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. On October 1st aerial drones struck a helicopter base in Sochi, some 600km away from the closest Ukrainian-held territory. Most dramatically of all, over the past month, Ukrainian missiles and drones have repeatedly hit targets across Crimea, culminating in the destruction of the headquarters of Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol on September 22nd.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia also seems to be intensifying the war at sea. In July it withdrew from a pact overseen by the <small>UN</small> whereby it allowed Ukrainian grain exports to pass safely across the sea. It has threatened to sink any cargo ships calling at Ukrainian ports and has repeatedly bombed Ukrainian docks and grain silos in an effort to throttle Ukraine&#39;s maritime trade. Since Russia and Ukraine both have the capacity to strike at shipping and since, as a diplomat puts it, the Black Sea is to grain what the Persian Gulf is to oil, an escalation in naval warfare could have a harrowing impact on global food markets. In fact, the Black Sea is also a big conduit for oil, and is central to the economies not only of Russia and Ukraine, but also Turkey and other littoral states. If it truly becomes a war zone, the world will feel the repercussions.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Sea gall</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For the most part, the war in Ukraine has been dominated by infantry, tanks and artillery, as well as long-range drones and missiles. But even though the six amphibious assault ships that Russia deployed to the Black Sea just before the outbreak of hostilities have not been used, the threat to Ukraine&#39;s southern shores has in some ways shaped the conflict. For one thing, the possibility of a coastal landing meant that Russia could menace Ukraine from three directions, and obliged Ukraine to spread its forces thinly in response.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Much the same logic has applied to the war in the skies. Excluding Iranian-made drones, around a fifth of all Russian missile strikes on Ukraine between January and March of this year originated at sea. Attacking from the sea, as well as from land and air, has allowed Russia to place a greater stress on Ukraine&#39;s air defences, which have to watch for attacks from every direction bar the west.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s response has in some ways been a triumph. The sinking of the <i>Moskva</i> has obliged Russia to keep its ships away from the shore. And the steady bombardment of Sevastopol has turned a huge naval base into something of a liability. Several ships previously berthed there have been pulled back to Novorossiysk. “They are like mice running away,” scoffs a Ukrainian naval officer. Ukraine has achieved “the functional defeat of the Russian Black Sea Fleet”, crowed James Heappey, Britain&#39;s junior defence minister, this week. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBM949.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">But for all its successes, Ukraine&#39;s main goal, to ensure that cargo ships can come and go safely from Odessa and its other ports, remains elusive. After Russia withdrew from the <small>UN</small> ’s grain initiative, Ukraine set up a new shipping route that hugs its coastline until the Romanian border to the west of Snake Island (see map). The intention is to keep civilian vessels as far from Russian guns as possible, and to get them as quickly as possible into the territorial waters of Romania, a member of <small>NATO</small> , where Russia would presumably hesitate to launch attacks. So far ten ships have come to Odessa this way, loaded grain and set sail again, without incident, despite Russia&#39;s threats.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A senior Ukrainian official tells <i>The Economist</i> that intelligence indicates Russia is planning an attack on civilian shipping, in an attempt to disrupt the new export route. Russian warships can fire missiles with a range of 2,500km, which would allow them to strike cargo vessels from a safe distance. By the same token, Russia can use submarines to lay mines even if its surface ships are forced to stay away, suggests Sidharth Kaushal of the Royal United Services Institute ( <small>RUSI</small> ), a think-tank in London (although Ukrainians argue that the shallow waters along the new export route would make that difficult). Even if Ukraine were somehow to sink the entire Russian fleet, missiles fired from Crimea could easily destroy a lumbering cargo ship off Odessa.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another Ukrainian official notes that Russian strikes on Ukrainian ports are already raising insurance premiums across the Black Sea: “Insurers see where things are headed. They are not daft.” But, adds the first, “Two can play at this game.” Ukraine has warned that, if Russia attacks civilian vessels, it will retaliate in kind. It has been demonstrating its capacity to hit distant naval targets not to escalate the war in the Black Sea, he says, but to deter Russia from doing so. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBC834.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The stakes for both countries are high. Before the war, roughly 60% of Ukraine&#39;s exports passed through its ports on the Black Sea. The volume of trade has since contracted dramatically, both because of the Russian blockade and because of the broader disruptions caused by the war to farms, factories and infrastructure. Even when the grain initiative was operating, Ukraine&#39;s exports were a fraction of what they once were (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some of the missing volumes have been diverted to barges on the Danube river. Ukrainian officials say they are managing to export over 3m tonnes of grain a month in that way at the moment. Another 1m tonnes is being exported by train and a smaller amount by lorry. But these alternatives are all much slower and more expensive than piling giant freighters with cargo. The cost of exporting a tonne of grain by river barge, for example, is roughly $120, versus $30-40 for exports by sea. Russia is bombing the new routes as well. What is more, Ukraine simply does not have adequate road, rail and barge capacity to substitute for deep-sea ports. The result is a further blow to an economy already gutted by the war, and further loss of tax revenue and foreign exchange for a government that is borrowing unsustainably.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Russia has a lot to lose as well. More than 80% of its grain exports and about 30% of its oil exports pass through ports on the Black Sea. These shipments have barely been affected by the war so far. Russia&#39;s military force in Syria is also dependent on fuel and supplies shipped via the Black Sea. This “Syrian express” probably ranks high on Ukraine&#39;s list of potential targets should the war at sea expand in scope.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Crimea and punishment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To inflict serious injury on the Russian economy, Ukraine does not need to sink all Russia-bound ships, but simply to damage enough of them that insurance premiums shoot up and Russian ports become commercially unattractive. “We don&#39;t have the drones to stop all Russian trade. But if you are asking if we can dramatically increase the financial stakes? Sure, no problem,” says a Ukrainian official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That would be bad not only for Russia, but also for global food markets. In the early stages of the war, they were gripped by panic. After all, when fighting broke out, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for an eighth of the calories traded worldwide. In 2021 they were the world&#39;s first and fifth biggest exporters of wheat, shipping 39m tonnes and 17m tonnes respectively—28% of the world&#39;s traded supply. Both also grow a lot of grain used to feed animals, such as maize and barley, and are the top two producers of sunflower seeds, giving them an 11.5% share of the vegetable-oil market.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Within days, the invasion sent wheat prices to more than $12 a bushel, up from $7 two months before; the cost of maize shot to its highest in a decade. This was largely because of the Russian blockade of Ukraine&#39;s ports on the Black Sea. Traders also feared that the war and Western sanctions might impede Russian exports. Many, including <i>The Economist,</i> warned that global food shortages were looming.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Agricultural markets are much calmer now, despite the growing risk of escalation in the Black Sea. Wheat currently costs little more than $5 a bushel, less than it did before the war began. In fact, prices fell back to pre-war levels during the summer of 2022 and have stayed there since.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That was less because of the <small>UN</small> ’s deal to revive Ukraine&#39;s grain exports than because of bumper crops elsewhere. Russia, whose farming industry is exempt from Western sanctions, harvested an unprecedented 100m tonnes of wheat in 2022. Other countries, from Brazil to India, also enjoyed bumper crops.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This year looks much the same. Ukraine is growing less wheat than before the war and its exports are down sharply because of the scrapping of the grain deal. But Russia has again produced a bountiful harvest, as have many other exporters. Whereas last year crops were threatened by La Niña, a climatic phenomenon that often saps yields in big cereal-growing regions in the northern hemisphere, this year, notes Carlos Mera of Rabobank, a Dutch lender, the reverse pattern, El Niño, promises more benign conditions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Attacks on commercial shipping in the Black Sea would doubtless send prices leaping again. Insurers would raise their rates or refuse to underwrite cargoes at all. Grain would not be the only casualty: some 2m barrels of oil and a further 1m barrels of refined petroleum products are exported through the Black Sea every day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the effects might again be short-lived. The Russian government is already insuring lots of the oil tankers that visit its ports, to help shipping firms evade Western sanctions. It could do the same for other exports as well. Despite rising tensions and Western pressure, lots of shipping firms are willing to transport Russian goods, says Matthew Wright of Kpler, a ship-tracking firm. What is more, Russia has a very dense network of oil pipelines. It could probably divert a good part of the oil that is normally shipped across the Black Sea to terminals in the Baltic. (The refined products would be harder to move around in this way.)</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> War and peas</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Transporting grain by road from Russia&#39;s farming heartlands in the west to distant terminals in St Petersburg, the Baltics or the Pacific would be slow and prohibitively expensive. (Ukraine already struggles to truck much smaller volumes over shorter distances.) But Russia has several grain terminals on the Black Sea and the adjoining Sea of Azov, so it could use an ever-shifting assortment of ports and shipping routes to keep cargoes out of harm&#39;s way. Given that Russia has struggled to choke off Ukraine&#39;s grain exports despite its vastly superior navy and air force, it is hard to imagine Ukraine snuffing out Russian trade.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For all these reasons, Viktor Kurilov of Rystad Energy, a consultancy, reckons attacks on commercial shipping might cause crude-oil prices to rise by only $5-7 a barrel before settling $1-2 above where they would otherwise have been. Wheat markets might be jolted more severely, at least for a time. That would not be painless: the brief spikes in food prices last year, the <small>UN</small> calculates, helped lift the number of people around the world facing severe hunger by 65m. But a lasting cataclysm is unlikely. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="The Russian Navy's submarine Rostov-on-Don sails in the Bosphorus, on its way to the Black Sea, in Istanbul, Turkey" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Not so Bosporous any more</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A critical variable in all this is the stance of Turkey, in effect the gatekeeper to the Black Sea. Under a treaty called the Montreux Convention, Turkey is obliged to let commercial shipping pass unhindered through the Bosporus and Dardanelles, the narrow straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. But the treaty places restrictions on the number and size of transiting warships. When war breaks out on the Black Sea, it gives Turkey the power to prevent belligerents from sending in reinforcements and to close the straits entirely to warships from non-littoral countries. So when Russia invaded Ukraine it barred Russia from reinforcing its Black Sea fleet, but also stopped <small>NATO</small> countries from sending in ships, despite being a member of the alliance itself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With the collapse of the grain deal, Turkey is under pressure to help prevent Russia from strangling Ukrainian trade. Bulgaria and Romania, two <small>NATO</small> members with coastline on the Black Sea but relatively weak navies, would welcome a show of force from the alliance. Some Ukrainians are calling for Western naval convoys to protect commercial shipping.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Turkey is loth to allow anything that increases the risk of a broader conflagration and that antagonises Russia. By sitting on the fence, Turkey&#39;s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has won valuable concessions from his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Russia let Turkey delay some payments for Russian gas, worth perhaps billions of dollars, a sop that helped Mr Erdogan conceal the scale of his economic mismanagement before elections earlier this year. Turkey&#39;s refusal to join other <small>NATO</small> members in imposing harsh sanctions on Russia has also been lucrative: trade between the two countries nearly doubled last year, to $62bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some analysts suspect that Mr Putin also promised Mr Erdogan that Russian troops sent to enforce a ceasefire would instead stand aside as Azerbaijan, Turkey&#39;s main regional ally, seized control of a disputed province from ethnic-Armenian rebels in late September. “Turkey is using Russian weakness to extract concessions,” says Yoruk Isik, who runs Bosphorus Observer, a consultancy. “As long as it continues to get them and as long as trade with Russia continues,” he adds, “Turkey will do its best not to confront Russia.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia is equally reluctant to rock the boat, as it were. If Russia were to attack commercial shipping, the pressure on Mr Erdogan to allow <small>NATO</small> ships into the Black Sea would increase dramatically. One thought holding Mr Putin back may be the risk of pushing Mr Erdogan into a less accommodating position.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is just another way in which neither side is likely to prevail completely in the war at sea. Ukrainian drones will continue to embarrass Russia, but the Russian navy will remain a menace to Ukrainian cities and shipping. Russia can probably push insurance rates sky-high, reckons Mr Kaushal of <small>RUSI</small> , “irrespective of how uncomfortable the Ukrainians can make Sevastopol”. And although naval battles will never be the main focus of the fighting, fears of an alarming flare-up will always linger. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 12:47:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/97jfa8dn922bjn2g8mhdcjrmmn7m7i22</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/05/the-war-in-ukraine-is-threatening-to-wash-across-the-black-sea </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Microsoft could supplant Apple as the world’s most valuable firm]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Microsoft-37a9c1204ae8d2f12b81da6615461597.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>or years</small> Microsoft has been trying to coax office workers to write reports, populate spreadsheets and create slide shows using its office software. No longer: now it wants to do the writing and populating for them. At its headquarters in Redmond, a leafy suburb of Seattle, the firm demonstrates its latest wizardry. Beyond the plate-glass windows, snow-capped mountains glisten and pine trees sway. Inside, a small grey rectangle sits at the top of a blank Word document. With a few words of instruction, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> )—or “Copilot”, as Microsoft calls it—finds a vast file in a computer folder and summarises its contents. Later, it edits its own work and succinctly answers questions about the material. It can perform plenty of other tricks, too: digging out emails on certain topics, drawing up a to-do list based on a meeting and even whipping up a passable PowerPoint presentation about your correspondent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is a glimpse into the future of work. The mind-boggling capabilities of “generative” <small>AI</small> look set to transform many desk jobs. It is also a glimpse into the future of Microsoft, which was once the world&#39;s most valuable public company and hopes to reclaim the title by selling the technology that will power the transformation. Through the firm&#39;s investment in Open <small>AI</small> , the startup behind Chat <small>GPT</small> , a popular <small>AI</small> chatbot, it is able to inject cutting-edge <small>AI</small> into its products.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pilot whale</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That does not just mean adding the Copilot to its office-work software (previously called “Office”, but recently rebranded as “Microsoft 365”), which will be rolled out in November. This week the firm will launch a Copilot for Windows, its operating system, which will be able to change your computer&#39;s settings, generate images and summarise web pages. Copilots for its sales software and human-resources offerings are already available. One for its security software is in the works. In February Microsoft added Chat <small>GPT</small> -like functions to Bing, its search engine, in effect another Copilot. With its squadron of Copilots, Microsoft is inserting generative <small>AI</small> into almost every aspect of its business. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC700.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">This is perhaps the biggest bet any company is taking on <small>AI</small> . The prize is potentially huge. Copilots could transform the world of work for the 1.2bn people who use Microsoft 365 and the 1.4bn who use Windows. This would allow Microsoft to bring in new customers and charge them more. That, in turn, could drive business to Azure, Microsoft&#39;s high-margin cloud business, possibly helping it overtake Amazon Web Services ( <small>AWS</small> ) to become the world&#39;s biggest cloud firm. It could even help Microsoft&#39;s valuation above the current $2.3trn, potentially closing the gap with Apple, currently the world&#39;s most valuable firm (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In effect <small>AI</small> offers Microsoft a tantalising chance to do something that has eluded it until now, and bring together all that it offers, argues Mark Moerdler of Bernstein, a broker. Teams, Microsoft&#39;s video-conference service, might be more attractive to <small>IT</small> managers than Zoom, a rival, if it features a Copilot that can sort through employees&#39; emails in Outlook and summon up information from their Word documents and PowerPoints. All this wizardry can also be channelled through Azure, further boosting Microsoft&#39;s business.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nonetheless Microsoft is also taking a big gamble. Next year its capital spending is expected to jump by almost two-fifths, to about $40bn. That is a near-record 16% of the firm&#39;s revenue and a higher share than any other tech giant save Meta, the parent of Facebook. Much of this will be spent on new <small>AI</small> chips and high-performance networking to go into the 120-odd extra data centres it plans to bring online. Whether such an investment will pay off is an open question. For all their promise, Copilots still have plenty of problems. At the demonstration in Redmond the <small>AI</small> -generated slide show described your correspondent as “ <small>CEO</small> of <small>ABC</small> Inc”, which he definitely is not. Competitors, in particular Alphabet (the parent of Google), are eyeing up all the same markets. As the battle over the future of work heats up, Microsoft&#39;s position is enviable but not unassailable.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Putting itself in that position has been a long endeavour. Microsoft&#39;s heyday was in the 1990s. The dominance of Windows as an operating system combined with a cut-throat business mentality made the firm mighty but roundly despised. A period of stagnation followed, as it lived off the revenue from Windows. When Satya Nadella took over in 2014, he shook things up. Windows would no longer be the firm&#39;s main focus. Instead the company was reorganised around Azure, with blockbuster programmes, such as Office, shifting to the cloud. This involved an enormous build-out of data centres. Microsoft&#39;s capital spending went from 6% of revenue in 2014 to 11% five years later. Crucially, the firm moved away from a walled-garden approach. Mr Nadella allowed Microsoft&#39;s software to run on other operating systems, such as Google&#39;s, Apple&#39;s and Linux, an open-source rival to Windows.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All the while Microsoft was also investing in <small>AI</small> . It first announced it was working with Open <small>AI</small> in 2016; it has since invested $13bn, for what is reported to be a 49% stake. The deal not only allows Microsoft to use Open <small>AI</small> ’s technology, but also stipulates that Open <small>AI</small> ’s models and tools run on Azure, in effect making Open <small>AI</small> ’s customers into indirect clients of Microsoft. And it isn&#39;t just Open <small>AI</small> . Microsoft has bought 15 <small>AI</small> -related firms since Mr Nadella took over. That includes paying $20bn for Nuance, a health-care firm with cutting-edge speech-to-text technology, in 2022. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC718.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Today Microsoft&#39;s business relies on three divisions for growth. The first is Azure. For the past five years it has been closing in on <small>AWS</small> (see chart 2). Cloud spending is slowing as <small>IT</small> managers tighten purse strings. Despite this, in the most recent quarter the business grew by 27% year on year. Microsoft does not reveal Azure&#39;s sales, but analysts think that it accounts for about a quarter of the firm&#39;s revenue, which hit $212bn last year. Gross margins for its cloud business are also secret, but Bernstein puts them at a lofty 60% or so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second is Microsoft 365, which also accounts for about a quarter of revenue. That has been growing by about 10% a year of late, thanks to take-up among smaller businesses, especially in service industries such as restaurants. The third source of growth is cybersecurity. In earnings calls Microsoft executives have said it accounts for roughly $20bn in revenue (about a tenth of the total). That is more than the combined revenues of the five biggest firms that provide only cybersecurity. What is more, revenues are growing by around 30% each year. (Microsoft&#39;s video-game arm, which brings in $15bn a year, is also set to grow substantially now that British antitrust regulators have signalled they will approve the long-delayed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, another gamemaker, for $69bn.)</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Blue fine-tuner</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Using Azure as the underlying infrastructure for Microsoft&#39;s other businesses has helped spread costs, streamline operations and boost profits. Since 2014 operating margins have risen from 29% to 43%—higher than other titans of tech (see chart 3). That has excited investors. During Mr Nadella&#39;s tenure Microsoft&#39;s market value has risen by about $2trn. Microsoft&#39;s price-to-earnings ratio, an indication of investors&#39; expectations of future profits, has more than doubled during Mr Nadella&#39;s reign, to 32. That is higher than the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 average, and more than all tech titans bar Amazon, whose figure is skewed by its paltry earnings. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBC701.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Cheerleaders say Microsoft has two big advantages when it comes to generative <small>AI</small> . The first is the range of software it sells. Asking a single chatbot to peruse emails and spreadsheets to pull together a slide show is much easier than dealing with different <small>AI</small> helpers for each programme.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, Microsoft has a first-mover advantage. It has been quicker to deploy <small>AI</small> than rivals, thanks to its tie-up with Chat <small>GPT</small> and possibly also because Mr Nadella feels that it was slow to react to smartphones and the cloud. Whatever the reason, Microsoft&#39;s speed has made Open <small>AI</small> the default for big firms trying out the technology. A recent survey of <small>IT</small> managers by JPMorgan Chase, a bank, found that over the next three years they expected 56% of their spending on generative <small>AI</small> to go to Microsoft compared with 13% for <small>AWS</small> and 12% for Google Cloud Platform ( <small>GCP</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another survey by Sequoia, a venture-capital firm, of 33 startups that it invests in, found that 90% of them used Open <small>AI</small> . Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley, a bank, argues that an ecosystem is beginning to form around Open <small>AI</small> ’s <small>GPT</small> -4 model. That includes consultants who specialise in its tools and recommend that clients use them, as well as software sellers, such as HubSpot, which build bespoke programmes that use Open <small>AI</small> ’s models.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is some evidence for the idea that Copilots could help cement Microsoft&#39;s lead. In June 2022 it launched a code-generating Copilot on GitHub, a repository for code which Microsoft had bought in 2018 for $7.5bn. The model was trained using the reams of code stored on GitHub. It has quickly become an essential tool for software developers. In a survey, 90% of users told GitHub that the Copilot improved their productivity. The firm also conducted a small study that found that coders completed tasks 55% more quickly when using the tool. Some 27,000 businesses have a subscription, twice the number of three months ago. It is so popular in tech circles that the term “copilot” has become shorthand for an <small>AI</small> assistant, whether provided by Microsoft or not.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Microsoft says firms testing a Copilot for its “productivity” software (meaning, for email, spreadsheets, word-processing and the like) report similar benefits. Kate Johnson, the boss of Lumen, a telecoms firm, describes it as a “step function change” in the way her staff work. She uses it to look back at Teams meetings and see whether quieter employees are being given a chance to speak. It also takes instant minutes and draws up to-do lists for attendees. That helps with accountability, adds Ms Johnson: the tasks staff were meant to complete after the last meeting are “right there for everyone to see”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Copilots can also act as software coaches, teaching workers how to insert charts in spreadsheets, for example. The goal is that they will eventually be able to learn users&#39; preferences and even their writing style. “We hope one day to deliver a highly effective alter ego—an agent that knows you deeply,” Mr Nadella wrote in his book “Hit Refresh”, published in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All this does not come cheap. At $30 per user per month, Copilots may mean a 52-83% mark-up, depending on the software package a firm uses. Jason Wong of Gartner, a research firm, says, “That is expensive compared to the licences but cheap if it is going to save you hours a week.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other way Microsoft will make money from Copilots is from the underlying infrastructure. In May it announced its “Copilot Stack” on Azure. This makes it easy for developers to build Copilots in their own applications or to create “plugins” for Microsoft&#39;s Copilots. The hope is that lots of firms use this infrastructure, sending much more business to Azure. Another advantage of this “platform” approach is that Microsoft may be able to strike deals to use the data of Azure&#39;s clients to bring, say, legal expertise into a Word document or email. That creates an advantage that “competitors are going to find very difficult or impossible to replicate”, a research note from Bernstein argues.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Hammerhead</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the second quarter of the year <small>AI</small> added roughly $120m to Microsoft&#39;s cloud revenues. That is expected to double in this quarter. In 2025, Mr Weiss estimates, <small>ai</small> could boost revenue by $40bn, largely through Azure&#39;s <small>AI</small> tools and 365&#39;s Copilots.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such growth would not be cheap. New Street Research, a firm of stockmarket analysts, reckons that Microsoft is the biggest customer of Nvidia, the world&#39;s largest seller of <small>AI</small> chips. Its research suggests that Microsoft spent roughly $3bn on Nvidia&#39;s <small>AI</small> chips in the second quarter of 2023, up from about $1bn in the first quarter. In a call with investors in July, Amy Hood, the chief financial officer, noted that the <small>AI</small> build-out is putting pressure on Microsoft&#39;s puffy margins in the cloud. That is being offset, she says, by more efficient data-crunching. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft&#39;s head of cloud and <small>AI</small> , says, “We are seeing inference costs [those related to asking an <small>AI</small> model a question] going down and expect to see that continue and models get more accurate and more efficient.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if spiralling costs are contained, there are plenty of other risks. Competition is white-hot. One battle is for the $340bn market for business software. In May Google announced Duet for Workspace, its version of Copilots. Last week it released features allowing Bard, its chatbot, to access user&#39;s Gmail inboxes and Google Docs. Salesforce, a software giant, has Einstein. Slack, a messaging app and one of Salesforce&#39;s subsidiaries, has Slack <small>GPT</small> . ServiceNow, whose software helps firms manage their workflow, has Now Assist. Zoom offers Zoom Companion. Intuit is selling Intuit Assist. Startups such as Adept and Cohere offer <small>ai</small> assistants, too. Open <small>AI</small> launched its enterprise-focused Chat <small>GPT</small> in August.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Supplying the infrastructure to underpin such <small>ai</small> offerings will be another battlefield. <small>AWS</small> and <small>GCP</small> both offer access to <small>AI</small> models similar to those of Open <small>AI</small> . Analysts suspect these rivals have more experience deploying specialist <small>AI</small> chips than Microsoft. In August Google unveiled a new <small>AI</small> chip for training large models. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A flying kite in the shape of the Microsoft logo" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ryan Chapman</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All generative <small>AI</small> tools, including Copilots, must also be made “enterprise ready”, says Ken Allen of T. Rowe Price, a big investor in Microsoft. One issue is legal. Most <small>AI</small> models are trained on copyrighted materials, which users may inadvertently reproduce. The head of <small>IT</small> at a big oil-and-gas-services firm says he stopped employees from using GitHub&#39;s Copilot after his firm was sued in November for breach of copyright. Microsoft, for its part, has agreed to cover customers&#39; legal fees related to its Copilots, provided they use Microsoft&#39;s safety features, such as content filters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Models can also get things wrong. Microsoft has reduced such problems by training them on accurate, up-to-date information and including more citations. But that did not prevent your correspondent&#39;s promotion to <small>ceo</small> . Jared Spataro, who is in charge of Microsoft&#39;s productivity software, says that Copilots entail an “entirely new way of working”, in which the machine helps you produce more “but it isn&#39;t always right”. Humans must be alert to this and, if necessary, make corrections.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A third concern is data governance—making sure that only the right employees get access to the right information. An analyst notes that some early users of Copilots are discovering “really scary” results. Imagine personnel files or confidential emails coming up in a search, say.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is also the near-certainty that Microsoft will be accused of abusing its market power. (Endless competition headaches plagued its previous period of ascendancy, in the late 1990s.) The firm is already fighting on many fronts. In August it announced that it would “unbundle” Teams from its software packages, after complaints from Slack triggered an <small>EU</small> investigation. Customers have also complained about the way Microsoft&#39;s software licences nudge companies to use Azure, rather than <small>AWS</small> and <small>GCP</small> . Brad Smith, Microsoft&#39;s president, has called this a “valid concern” and the firm says it has made changes. But in June Google submitted comments to a probe by America&#39;s Federal Trade Commission, claiming that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in clients”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These types of disputes will no doubt intensify as <small>AI</small> -powered software becomes prevalent. If a Windows Copilot steers users to Outlook rather than Gmail, say, trustbusters may cry foul. The upshot of this could be to weaken Microsoft&#39;s ability to use a breadth of software offerings to make Copilots more useful, one of its big competitive advantages.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even so, Microsoft is in a strong position. It failed to seize on the advent of smartphones and was slow to grasp the potential of the cloud. Today it finds itself poised to exploit a technology that could transform the world of work. It must maintain a delicate balance, moving faster than competitors while ensuring that its advance into <small>ai</small> does not upset regulators, sap profits or ruffle clients. If it slips, plenty of rivals are ready to take its place. But if it succeeds, the reward will be huge. The Copilot will be the captain of its fortunes. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 18:27:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4faffuah59d4el3mb71mfc4bt67a2pr8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/27/how-microsoft-could-supplant-apple-as-the-worlds-most-valuable-firm </item><item><title><![CDATA[Western help for Ukraine is likely to diminish next year]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Ukraine%20and%20the%20West-1b5f0cd51f99f30c3e14c553e42eaefb-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he end</small> keeps receding. There was a time when some Ukrainian officials, having halted Russia&#39;s army outside Kyiv, thought it would take only a few more months to bring the war to a conclusion. “Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year,” predicted Lieutenant-General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of military intelligence, in May 2022. By last November, shortly after a spectacular Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defence minister at the time, was still expecting a swift victory. “My feeling is that by the end of the spring, this war will be over.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact, Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive did not even begin until June. Far from hastening the war&#39;s end, it has demonstrated just how long the fighting could drag on. Ukrainian forces, stymied by Russian minefields and other defences, have inched forward on foot. The deployment of reserves and spiffy Western weapons has not yet yielded any big breakthroughs. Wet weather and a shortage of ammunition will probably bring the Ukrainian advance, such as it is, to a halt by late October, if not earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another fighting season beckons. “We must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,” warned Jens Stoltenberg, <small>NATO</small> ’s secretary-general, on September 17th. “It&#39;ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine,” agreed Mark Milley, America&#39;s top general, the same day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America insists it will stay the course for “as long as it takes”, as Joe Biden, the president, has put it several times this year. Britain, France, Germany and other allies have all used the same phrase. As ironclad as these pledges sound, they depend on two uncertain variables. One is the West&#39;s ability to furnish Ukraine&#39;s army with enough weapons and ammunition. The other is the political will to keep handing them over.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the first. Russia&#39;s defence industry moved onto a war footing in the last quarter of 2022, says Richard Connolly, an expert on Russia&#39;s economy, who points to a big jump in steel production. British officials say that Russia can now produce around 200 tanks a year, twice as many as they had previously assumed. Mr Connolly says that, with refurbished tanks included, the true figure is probably 500 to 800. Western sanctions are not crimping output much, he adds, with crucial components such as semiconductors smuggled in via Hong Kong or Central Asia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In principle, Ukraine&#39;s friends should have no trouble helping it outgun Russia. The combined <small>GDP</small> of <small>nato</small> ’s members is 12 times that of Russia, even after accounting for Russia&#39;s lower prices. The difference is that Russia is willing to spend much more heavily on the war: military spending now takes up almost 40% of the national budget, far in excess of Western levels. <small>NATO</small> countries are trying to redress this imbalance by investing in arms production, which has been neglected since the cold war ended. But there are two snags.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One is cost. Estonia spends around $5,000 to $6,000 on every new artillery shell, says Kusti Salm, the senior civil servant in the country&#39;s defence ministry. That is relatively cheap by <small>NATO</small> standards, he notes. Russia, he says, spends 60,000 roubles, or around $620. The vast difference is largely down to cheaper labour and materials, lower quality products and lower profit margins for arms manufacturers, most of which are state-owned. Inflation is exacerbating the problem. “Prices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up,” complained Admiral Rob Bauer, a <small>nato</small> bigwig, on September 16th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second issue is timing. “After a slow start,” says Mr Connolly, “Russia has reached race pace and they&#39;re in gear now. They&#39;re now going to start churning stuff out at the rate approximating what they need.” American and European investments in new capacity, having started later, will not yield much extra supply until the second half of 2024 or 2025, giving Russia more time to mobilise, build new defences and pin down Ukrainian forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take the case of artillery shells. The good news is that American and European production is soaring. American officials say that their own output has risen from an annualised rate of 168,000 shells in the spring to 336,000 today. It will continue to rise, thanks both to new facilities and to more intensive use of existing ones. European production is set to double by the end of this year or the start of next, according to Estonia&#39;s defence minister. Between them, America and Europe should comfortably produce nearly 2m shells next year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shell shock</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trouble is, that is barely enough to keep up. Russia will produce 1m-2m shells next year, according to British estimates. That is on top of a stock of around 5m shells, new and refurbished. That should allow it to fire at least 15,000 rounds a day for a year, says Mr Salm. That is roughly on a par with Ukraine&#39;s heightened consumption during its counter-offensive, according to people familiar with the data. But Ukraine can probably sustain that tempo for only a couple more months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The gap could be bridged by borrowing from elsewhere. Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive was enabled by a massive transfusion of South Korean shells. America and its allies have discreetly purchased arms and ammunition from non-aligned countries such as Egypt and Pakistan on Ukraine&#39;s behalf. But such ready sources of weaponry are running out. Western armies&#39; stockpiles have been depleted, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the Western arms industry ramps up, this problem should ease. By 2025 there might even be a “glut” of shells, says a Western official. If most of the new output goes to Ukraine, and assuming that neither China nor North Korea bails out Russia, the Ukrainian army might then be able to out-pulverise the Russian army for the first time in the conflict. But 2025 is the military equivalent of a lifetime away. Next year, meanwhile, Ukraine will probably struggle to mount a big offensive.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The year after next is also a lifetime away in terms of politics. In Europe, the political winds seem favourable to Ukraine. Polls conducted in June and July showed that 64% of Europeans favour military aid to Ukraine, with strong support not just in countries with a long-standing suspicion of Russia, such as Sweden (93%), but also in more distant member states such as Portugal (90%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some hard-right parties, such as France&#39;s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and Germany&#39;s Alternative for Germany ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ), cast the conflict as a waste of European resources. “The German public is paying three times over for this war,” complains Gunnar Lindemann, an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> member of Berlin&#39;s regional assembly, “supporting 1m refugees, carrying huge energy bills and sending weapons to Ukraine.” Both parties are rising in the polls, but both remain far from power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Olaf Scholz, Germany&#39;s chancellor, has been mindful of anti-war sentiment, notably within his own Social Democratic Party. He dithered for months before agreeing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. He still refuses to send long-range Taurus missiles, even though Britain and France have given Ukraine comparable weapons. Yet Mr Scholz has by now realised that public scepticism is mushy: as soon as he sends a new weapon, approval broadly follows. On September 18th his government announced another €400m ($429m) of arms, including ammunition, armoured vehicles and mine-clearing equipment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Emmanuel Macron, France&#39;s president, who provoked grumbling in Kyiv last year over his frequent phone calls with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, and over his hesitation in sending weapons, is now among the most gung-ho of European leaders. France has long resisted expanding the <small>EU</small> , yet Mr Macron has become a fervent supporter of Ukraine&#39;s accession to the bloc. A poll in July showed that 58% of the French backed this approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s bid for <small>eu</small> membership is proceeding at a pace that would have astonished Europe-watchers just a few years ago. It formally became a candidate to join in June, 2022. This December, barring a shock, that status will be upgraded by the opening of detailed negotiations on accession. Ukraine is dazzling <small>EU</small> officials with its swift progress on the necessary reforms. It may still take years for Ukraine to become a fully fledged member, but the war seems to be speeding up the process rather than delaying it. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives at Skrydstrup Airbase in Denmark" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Now for Congress to get on board</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: EPA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In America, however, the outlook is much more divided and uncertain. On August 10th the White House asked Congress to authorise another $24bn “supplemental” budget for Ukraine, which would bring total American aid thus far to $135bn. Supporters of such assistance, among both Democrats and Republicans, constitute a clear majority of both chambers of Congress. Were the request put to a simple up-or-down vote, it would be approved relatively easily.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is unlikely to be, because of America&#39;s dysfunctional politics. A majority of the members of the House of Representatives may support Ukraine, but a small number of Republicans hold extreme anti-Ukrainian views, including Matt Gaetz, who has proposed inviting Russia to join <small>NATO</small> , and Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conspiracy theorist who has promoted the absurd notion that aid to Ukraine is actually being siphoned off by donors to the Democrats. Since the Republicans have only a slender majority in the House and since the Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, does not want to rely on Democratic votes to push legislation through, the pro-Russia fringe has much more influence than its numbers would imply.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The likeliest course is for Mr McCarthy to attach the supplemental budget to other important legislation, making it harder to derail. Past efforts in the House to deny Ukraine funding have been overcome, although each one attracts more Republican votes. Mr Biden already has congressional approval to send a further $6bn-worth of weapons to Ukraine from existing stockpiles. But after that there is likely to be a delay of several months while Congress contorts itself over the latest request. What emerges may be dribs and drabs of aid, rather than the big packages of last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the longer run, aid for Ukraine is fast becoming a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain. Republican voters, egged on by the scepticism of Donald Trump, their party&#39;s likeliest nominee for president next year, have begun to question further aid to Ukraine. Democrats remain broadly supportive. The big budget deficit and high interest rates make politicians of all parties reluctant to rack up more debt. And even Democrats support the notion that America&#39;s European allies should be the ones taking the initiative in conflicts on their own borders.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And then there is the possibility that Mr Trump wins next year&#39;s election. His policy on Ukraine is characteristically incoherent. In March he promised that he would settle the war in “no longer than one day”, before even entering office. “We don&#39;t have ammunition for ourselves,” he complained in May, “We&#39;re giving away so much.” But he denies he would push for a deal allowing Mr Putin to keep Ukrainian territory. “Nobody was tougher on Russia than me,” he said this week, insisting he would strike “a fair deal for everybody”. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_FBC660.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Nevertheless, Western officials worry that Mr Putin will wait to see whether Mr Trump becomes president again before agreeing to negotiations. That scenario is already provoking frenetic debate in Europe. “If the United States tried to force a negotiated settlement on Ukraine,” argued Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage, a pair of Russia experts, in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> recently, “Europeans would have little capacity to resist.” Others say this is unduly fatalistic. French officials argue that, should America end its support for Ukraine, although Europe cannot replace American military aid gun for gun and missile for missile, the prudent and rational thing is for Europe to try to preserve its options by boosting arms manufacturing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The question is whether Europe alone can drum up enough cash and weapons to keep Ukraine going. Although America provided the lion&#39;s share of aid for much of the war, the latest analysis from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, finds this pattern has reversed. Europeans have long dispensed more financial aid. They are now providing more aid of all sorts, thanks in part to the <small>EU</small> ’s recent €50bn pledge, a multi-year commitment which stretches to 2027 (see chart).</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Money isn&#39;t everything</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the figures do not tell the whole story. America has been the fulcrum of the allied effort to support Ukraine, chairing the regular meetings at which donations of weapons are pledged and co-ordinated at Ramstein, an American military base in Germany. It has provided diplomatic cover for other countries&#39; aid: Mr Scholz, for instance, insisted that he would not allow German-made Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine unless Mr Biden first sent some American <small>M</small> 1 <small>A</small> 1 Abrams tanks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In some cases Europeans have sent arms to Ukraine on the understanding that they will receive new American weapons to replace the donated ones. America&#39;s security guarantees, underwritten by nuclear weapons, have given Europeans the confidence to stand up to Russian threats. Finally, America has provided vital intelligence that has helped Ukraine find and destroy high-value targets, from generals to warships. Substituting for this organisation and assistance would be a Herculean task.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may be unavoidable. “The assumption of the West was—and I think everyone has been unspoken on this—was that we give them everything we can, then they will go on this one large offensive and whatever happens at the end of this we will settle for that,” says Mr Salm, the Estonian official. “That was the plan.” A new one is required, he suggests, involving not just more arms, but also more technology to offset Russia&#39;s advantages in mass, bolder sanctions, such as expulsion from the Paris Olympics, and new training that learns from the mistakes of the summer.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Above all, a change in mentality is needed. “This is exactly what a war of attrition is about: convince the West that we can out-suffer you, we can out-fight you, we can out-last you. They know the weak points of democracies,” Mr Salm says. The task, he believes, is to persuade Mr Putin that the opposite is true. “We, as the Ramstein coalition, are 25 times richer, stronger and [more] technologically advanced than Russia…It&#39;s not that we are empty-pocketed here.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:38:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/e4olb392cfef30qkihtvtnms801edpp4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year </item><item><title><![CDATA[To endure a long war, Ukraine is remaking its army, economy and society]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1ey6m750"><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span>I</span> <small>n the autumn</small> sunshine Kyiv looks glorious. The leafy streets are full of life: café terraces bustle and hipsters throng the bars of Podil, a trendy neighbourhood. The odd air-raid siren aside, the main signs of the 18-month-old war with Russia are rusty tanks turned into makeshift war memorials and the various men in uniform enjoying some leave with their loved ones.</p><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Ukraine-33237edecb896a72ccd71824180b0500.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="article__body-text"> To Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#39;s top soldier, the scenes of children eating ice cream and men presenting flowers to their sweethearts are satisfying. “This is what we are fighting for. I just want people to have a normal life in the whole of Ukrainian territory,” he says. The critical word is “whole”: Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive has not yet produced the results he and others had hoped for. Russian lines have not crumbled. Almost a fifth of Ukrainian territory remains in Russia&#39;s hands. In the war of attrition that looms, it is not clear which side has more staying power. In part, of course, that depends on a second uncertainty: in what quantities the <a href="/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year">military and financial support</a> supplied by Ukraine&#39;s allies will keep flowing as the war grinds on.</p><h2> A break in the clouds</h2><p class="article__body-text"> For all its superficial normality, Kyiv is awash with apprehension. Ukrainians know that Russia has been stockpiling missiles and drones to attack their energy infrastructure when temperatures drop. They know that the supply of volunteers has dried up, and that men are being conscripted to replace casualties at the front. And they know no end is in sight: a year ago 50% of them thought it would be over within a year. Now only 34% believe that. Whereas Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s dictator, does not care about the lives of his own troops, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine&#39;s president, presides over a democratic society which does. “It is not just about de-occupation [at any cost]. It&#39;s about de-occupation, but not losing a lot of lives,” he recently told <i>The Economist</i> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> The prospect of an attenuated struggle has started to seep into Mr Zelensky&#39;s speeches. “We need to learn to live with [the conflict],” he told Ukrainians recently. “It depends on what kind of war. We are prepared to keep fighting for a very long period of time…[while] minimising the number of casualties. Like in Israel, for example. We can live like that.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> A war of endurance, however, will require big changes in military planning, the economy and society more broadly. The heroic improvisation and decentralisation of the early part of the war will no longer suffice. On the military side, Mr Zelensky has initiated a clear shift by installing a new minister of defence, Rustem Umerov. Like almost all Ukrainians, he has a personal stake in the war, as a Crimean Tatar, an ethnic group persecuted for Ukrainian sympathies since Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea in 2014. But, he says, “Ukraine is not about emotions, it is about a system, logistics and industries.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Umerov, a 41-year-old former entrepreneur and investor, says his mission is to build the capacity of both Ukraine&#39;s defence industry and its soldiers, so that Western allies see Ukraine not as a dependent always begging for aid, but as a partner, capable of shaping its own fortune. His previous job was managing the government&#39;s property portfolio, and he wants to bring an efficient managerial mindset to his new role. Red tape must be eliminated. “Anything that can be digitised, needs to be digitised,” he says. He is not afraid to make waves: after two weeks in the job, he replaced six of his seven deputies.</p><h2> An explosive legacy</h2><p class="article__body-text"> When it was part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had a vast defence industry. Some 1.5m Ukrainians laboured in 700 military enterprises, including 205 factories and 130 research and development sites. Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine&#39;s second president, ran the world&#39;s biggest rocket plant in the city of Dnipro in Soviet times. A flagship factory in Kharkiv produced 900 tanks a year. But corruption and neglect after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 gradually killed these businesses.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Now Ukraine is rebuilding its arms industry almost from scratch. “Anything that can be produced locally, must be produced locally,” Mr Umerov insists. In part that involves reforming state enterprises, the job of Oleksandr Kamyshin, a former investment banker who used to run the state railway company and follows Western management fads. “The first hundred days of the war were about bravery. The next 1,000 days are about steeliness,” he declares. In June, three months after his appointment, Ukraine produced as many shells as it had in the entire previous year. In July it reached double that, Mr Kamyshin says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Umerov wants to encourage private arms manufacturers, which account for only 20-30% of the local industry. He says he is prepared to pay local firms in advance if they can demonstrate their ability to make useful kit. Many are struggling with a dearth of capable managers: the defence ministry is offering to help bring such people back from the front lines. Within five years, Mr Kamyshin predicts, private firms will produce 80% of local output.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One focus is on drones. Ukraine&#39;s output of them has grown exponentially, albeit from a tiny base. “We will [produce] 120 to 150 times more drones than we did last year,” says Mykhailo Fedorov, the 32-year-old minister for digital transformation, who is co-ordinating the effort. The number of local firms in the business has risen from seven in December to 70 now, the vast majority of them private. To encourage this growth the government has eliminated tariffs on imported components and is buying drones at prices that allow margins of as much as 25%. “We can win in a technological war,” says Mr Fedorov. “We are getting help from countries with large economies and a greater level of freedom. Technologies like freedom and they like mobility. We have both.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kamyshin wants Western military contractors to start localising their production, too. <small>BAE</small> Systems, a British defence firm which makes lots of weapons supplied to Ukraine, has set up a local subsidiary, hoping to produce <small>L</small> 119 and <small>M</small> 777 howitzers, which are both in wide use at the front. Rheinmetall, Germany&#39;s biggest arms manufacturer, is already repairing Leopard tanks in Ukraine and plans to open an armoured-vehicle factory soon. As Armin Papperger, its <small>CEO</small> , told <small>CNN</small> , “[Ukrainians] have to help themselves. If they always have to wait [for] Europeans or Americans [to] help them over the next ten or 20 years…that is not possible.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Protecting such factories from Russian attacks will require ingenuity. “We will not have one Soviet-style hypergiant plant but many smaller plants spread across the country,” says Mr Kamyshin. Drones are proof of what is possible: Ukraine&#39;s surging output of reconnaissance devices, Mr Fedorov says, has helped give it parity with Russia&#39;s forces. Production of longer-range ones, which can hit targets in Crimea and deep inside Russia, is also growing. “It is an important historical moment,” he says, “when we are not simply receiving aid and hoping [that it will not run out] but when we are taking responsibility for our own lives in our own hands and starting to form our own capability.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ukraine&#39;s growing drone industry also allows its armed forces to adopt new tactics, by taking the war inside Russia. One aim is to hit military factories in an effort to disrupt whole supply chains. Recent examples include an attack on a facility that produces decalin, a fuel additive essential for rockets, and a plant that makes circuitry for Kinzhal and Iskander missiles.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A second aim is psychological: to shatter the facade of normality the Kremlin tries to preserve, particularly in big cities such as Moscow. Airports there have had to suspend flights for brief spells almost daily in recent weeks owing to drone attacks on the city. (Mr Kamyshin says he would like to set up a shop selling <small>T</small> -shirts with the slogan “Moscow never sleeps”.)</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ukraine also has a third goal in its strikes on Russian infrastructure: to deter Russian attacks on its own infrastructure. Since Russia withdrew in July from a deal allowing exports of grain from Ukraine&#39;s ports on the Black Sea, it has been bombarding those and other export routes and threatening ships calling at Ukrainian ports. Ukraine&#39;s exports have halved as a result, doing yet more damage to an already stricken economy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ukraine is trying to break the Russian blockade. Last month it established a new sea route, hugging the western coast of the Black Sea close to Romania and Bulgaria. If Ukraine can protect it, it could raise its exports to some 70% of pre-war levels. On September 17th, two ships docked at the port of Chornomorsk near Odessa to load almost 20,000 tonnes of wheat. Hours later Russia unleashed a barrage of drones and missiles at other nearby ports.</p><h2> A sea change</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Ukrainian strategists hope that, if they can threaten Russian ports on the Black Sea and strike at the military bases from which attacks on Ukrainian ports are launched, they may be able to keep Ukraine&#39;s exports afloat. Earlier this month Ukrainian missiles damaged a submarine, a ship and port facilities at a Russian naval base in Crimea. It had decent air defences, but more distant Russian facilities may not be as protected.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The focus on protecting exports reflects a sense among Ukrainian officials that the economy will also need a drastic overhaul to cope with a long war. Ukraine received $31bn in financial aid last year and is on course to receive even more this year. But Serhiy Marchenko, the finance minister, assumes that such largesse will not be forthcoming indefinitely.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, military spending has leapt from 5% of <small>GDP</small> before the war to 26% this year. Even if the fighting stopped, spending might not drop much. General Zaluzhny says, “I want the Ukrainian army to be so strong that Russia does not even dare to look in our direction.” The shrunken economy is too small to generate sufficient tax revenue to pay for Ukraine&#39;s security, Mr Marchenko notes, so the government will have to help it grow by improving the business climate and fostering industry.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The main concern for investors, says Mr Marchenko, is not physical security but the unreliable legal system, a problem that predates the war. Similarly, it is corruption rather than the damage done by the war to Ukraine&#39;s infrastructure that most Ukrainians see as the main obstacle to recovery. The independent corruption-fighting investigators, prosecutors and courts that Ukraine has put in place are making progress, but the broader judicial system remains inefficient and unpredictable.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Perhaps the worst injury that the war has inflicted on the economy has been to prompt an exodus of 7m Ukrainians—nearly 20% of the pre-war population of 37m people. More than two-thirds are women, since men of fighting age are barred from leaving the country. The working-age population has shrunk from 16.7m in 2021 to 12.4m this year.</p><h2> The call of the placid</h2><p class="article__body-text"> To lure people back, the government is offering startup grants for businesses and subsidised mortgages for those rebuilding homes. But many of the departed have settled in richer, more stable places in the <small>EU</small> , found jobs and put their children in school. They are unlikely to want more upheaval and they may see more opportunity for themselves and their children in their new homes, whatever the security situation in Ukraine. A recent survey found that about half of those who have moved to Germany, at least, intend to stay there for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is not just an economic cost to the exodus, but a social one as well. According to Olena Zelenska, Mr Zelensky&#39;s wife, who heads a government mental-health initiative, there has already been a rise in the number of divorces “because women and children are abroad and men are here”. Mr Zelensky says there is a real risk that a war of attrition could accelerate an outflow of people from Ukraine, creating further economic problems and widening the gap between those who left and those who have stayed.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This is not the only source of social tension. Roman Hasko, a lieutenant from the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade, who volunteered in the first week of the war, says he feels disappointed to see the bustle of night-time Kyiv, having just arrived on leave from the front line near Bakhmut. “I see a lot of potential recruits. I have many free positions in my unit. Not all have been killed—some are wounded or sick…If we are talking about winning this war, these empty lines need to be filled.”</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span><meta><img src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230923_FBC677.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In the first weeks of the war men like Mr Hasko queued up to enlist. Now Ukraine is filling the ranks through conscription. Some young men who have not yet been called up are nervous about leaving home or passing checkpoints for fear of being dragooned. Many try to bribe their way out of military service and to leave the country illegally. Last month Mr Zelensky sacked the heads of all the regional military recruitment centres. He replaced them with soldiers with battlefield experience who had been vetted by intelligence services. Earlier this month the Ministry of Defence drastically cut the number of medical exemptions.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ukrainians clearly have some concerns about how the country is being run. Approval of the army and the president remain sky high, but confidence in the country&#39;s politicians in general is down from 60% in December to 44% in June. The share of Ukrainians who say the country is on the right track has also slipped (see chart). There is disquiet about corruption in particular.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But 76% tell pollsters they do not want new elections until the war is over. Support for Ukraine&#39;s independence is the highest it has ever been, at 82%. Most do not complain about restrictions on movement or other wartime curtailment of civil liberties. “War has become part of a new horrific normal,” says Darina Solodova, a sociologist with the United Nations Development Programme in Kyiv.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Resistance to Russia&#39;s aggression remains a unifying principle for the vast majority. “It is not the question of whether to resist or not, but who has done more or less for that resistance,” says Ms Solodova. Across Ukraine 42% say that even if Russia intensifies its bombing of cities Ukraine should keep fighting. Some 21% think that the conflict should be frozen without making any concessions to Russia. Only 23% think it is worth initiating negotiations. Even in the east and south, which have borne the brunt of the war, support for negotiations is relatively low, at 32% and 39% respectively. Only 5% of Ukrainians are willing to cede any territory to Russia and only 18% to forswear joining <small>NATO</small> .</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Research by the Centre for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development, a think-tank in Cyprus, suggests that Ukrainians have become more optimistic about the future despite the war. Most believe that future generations will be better off. Ms Zelenska is not surprised: “People know what they are fighting for, not just what against.” <span>■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:14:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ppv93sn16mkmpo0os26ioqogg623s8kn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/to-endure-a-long-war-ukraine-is-remaking-its-army-economy-and-society </item><item><title><![CDATA[The hard right is getting closer to power all over Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Europe_s%20hard%20right-3da6c3966e318901bdd99c67b92e03ad.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>N SINT-GENESIUS-RODE</small> , a well-to-do commuter town in the hills south of Brussels, a crowd of 50 or so gathered on September 2nd in a parish hall to drink champagne and promote the dismemberment of Belgium. The meeting was organised by Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest), a right-wing party that rails against such threats to the Flemish way of life as Islam, immigration and—most pernicious of all—the French language. The town is in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking half of Belgium), but French-speakers have been moving in for decades and are now the majority. The only way to stop the rot, explains Klaas Slootmans, a member of the Flemish regional parliament from Vlaams Belang, is for Flanders to declare independence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may sound parochial, chauvinist and disruptive if not delusional, but it goes down well. People have a right “to be the boss in their own country”, Mr Slootmans proclaims; the crowd applauds. Vlaams Belang is Belgium&#39;s most popular party, with an average of 22% support in recent polling. Barring a sudden reversal, it should triumph in simultaneous elections next year for the national, European and regional parliaments. Other Belgian parties have hitherto declared it too extreme to do business with, and refused to include it in coalitions. But this so-called <i>cordon sanitaire</i> may have to be abandoned if the party wins a fifth or more of parliamentary seats. Anyway, the ostracism may in fact be helping Vlaams Belang. Its support has tripled over the past five years.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The right moment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a common pattern. Across much of Europe, populist right-wing parties like Vlaams Belang, once relegated to the fringe, are going from strength to strength. In Hungary, Italy and Poland they hold power. In Finland, Sweden and Switzerland they have a share of it. In Germany polls put the <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/germanys-rampant-hard-right-afd-puts-other-parties-in-a-fix">Alternative for Germany</a> ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ) party at 22%, up from 10% in the election in 2021. In France the National Rally ( <small>RN</small> ), the biggest hard-right party, has 24% support. Add in 5% for Reconquest, another anti-immigrant party, and the hard right becomes the biggest voting block in the country. In the Netherlands, too, a smattering of right-wing populists claim a quarter or more of the vote. Even newish democracies that for decades lacked big nationalist parties—Portugal, Romania and Spain—now have them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The advance of the hard right is neither uniform nor one-way. Support for populist nationalists has recently slumped in Denmark and Spain, for instance. Nor are all these parties the same: some are eager Atlanticists, others pro-Russian; some are libertarian, others want a more generous welfare state, albeit only for people of native stock. What is more, hard-right groups tend to mellow the closer they get to power, or to splinter, or both. The government of Italy, for one, although led by the Brothers of Italy ( <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> ), a party with links to fascism, has proved much more moderate than many had feared. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Nonetheless, the trend is alarming, for three reasons. First, it is remarkably broad. Four of the five most populous countries in the European Union have hard-right parties either in government or polling above 20% (see map). Second, the current circumstances are especially propitious for populist parties, with immigration rising after a hiatus during the pandemic, inflation high and the growing cost of climate policy creating a potent new focus for popular ire. Third, and most important, the hard right does not need to win power to have a baleful impact on politics. Simply by attracting a big share of voters, it is already skewing the debate, and so making it harder for European governments to adopt sensible policies on pressing problems, such as the war in Ukraine, immigration and climate change.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Freedom fighters</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When the Freedom Party, Austria&#39;s main hard-right outfit, joined a coalition government in 2000, other <small>EU</small> governments were so horrified that they reduced contact with Austria&#39;s to the bare minimum in protest. To no avail: the hard right has since broken through barrier after barrier. It first led a government in 2010, when Fidesz, a once-centrist outfit that had taken a populist turn, swept to power in Hungary. Those who said the same thing could never happen in mature democracies in western Europe were proved wrong last year when <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> took power in Italy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">More milestones loom. Hard-right parties are expected to do well in next year&#39;s European elections. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> and prime minister of Italy, is trying to persuade the centre-right alliance in the European Parliament, the European People&#39;s Party ( <small>EPP</small> ), to join forces with the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists ( <small>ECR</small> ), which she heads. That would move the legislature of all of the <small>EU</small> in a populist direction. In France, meanwhile, the hard right&#39;s performance is improving at each presidential election (see chart). It is possible that Marine Le Pen, the runner-up at the past two contests, may win the next one, in 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A series of external factors are helping to propel support for the hard right. Illegal immigration, which spurred support for populist parties when it surged in 2015, is growing again after a lull during the pandemic. There have already been more than 165,000 unauthorised arrivals in Europe this year, as many as in all of last year, although still well below the level of 2015. Populists also tend to do well in times of economic upheaval, and so are benefiting from the high inflation that has plagued Europe for the past two years, and especially from soaring energy prices.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Expensive petrol, heating and electricity have helped foment a backlash against policies to fight climate change, which the hard right has seized on. This began in France with the <i>gilets jaunes</i> movement in late 2018, initially a protest against a carbon-tax hike on motor fuel. The <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s rise this year was touched off by a proposed government ban on oil and gas boilers in homes. In the Netherlands the Farmer-Citizen Movement ( <small>BBB</small> ), a new populist party, began as a farmers&#39; protest against nitrogen-emission limits. It won an astounding 20% of the vote in regional elections in March.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There has also been a broader slide in trust in government in many European countries, after a brief resurgence during the pandemic, to the benefit of the hard right. American-style culture wars are becoming fiercer, too, which, again, helps the populists. Maximilian Krah, the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s lead candidate in the European elections, went viral over the summer with dating advice posted on TikTok: “Real men are right-wing. Don&#39;t watch porn.” In other videos Mr Krah argues that “multicultural means multi-criminal”, bemoans rainbow flags and warns that BlackRock, an investment firm, wants to replace Germans with “minorities and immigrants”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The European politician most adept at exploiting such ideas to win and hold power is Viktor Orban, Fidesz&#39;s leader and the prime minister of Hungary since 2010. He readily bashes migrants, gay people and the <small>EU</small> as at odds with homespun Hungarian values. He has used the parliamentary majorities he has won with such talk to pack the courts with loyalists and gerrymander the electoral system. Cronies have bought up critical media outlets. In addition to undermining democracy at home, Mr Orban&#39;s rule has scrambled policymaking at <small>NATO</small> and in the <small>EU</small> , owing to his friendliness with both China and Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But harnessing right-wing populism to take control of a state is not easy. When Poland&#39;s Law and Justice ( <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ) party came to power in 2015, it followed Mr Orban&#39;s script. It turned the state media into a propaganda bureau and tried to pack the courts. But <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s efforts have not got as far as Fidesz&#39;s. Many judges have fought back, and the <small>EU</small> has withheld billions of euros in aid to force <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> to reverse some of its court-packing. The media have not been cowed. The opposition remain competitive, even though <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> is favoured in next month&#39;s election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other right-wing populists using Mr Orban&#39;s template have also had mixed results. Janez Jansa, a former prime minister of Slovenia nicknamed “Marshal Tweeto” for a social-media style reminiscent of Donald Trump, lost power in 2022. Estonia&#39;s far-right <small>EKRE</small> party tried to go after the media while in government in 2019, but that coalition collapsed and the party did poorly in an election this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even where it has been electorally successful, the hard right has struggled to put in place radical policies such as ending political asylum or scrapping measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Take Sweden, where the Sweden Democrats, long shunned by other parties because of their roots in the neo-Nazi movement, took 21% of the vote in 2022. They signed a confidence-and-supply deal to back a centre-right minority government, giving them direct influence over policy on immigration and crime. But in a speech in August Jimmie Akesson, the party&#39;s leader, had to make excuses for the government&#39;s slow progress implementing the deal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ms Meloni is the first leader in western Europe with the parliamentary clout to enact a hard-right agenda. Yet so far, she has run a fairly conventional government. Her only populist measures have been to introduce a misconceived tax on banks, limit some airline fares and prevent same-sex parents from registering their partner&#39;s child as their own. In part, she is constrained by European fiscal rules. But the <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> is also simply less extreme than it once was. ”This is a pragmatic centre-right government with, now and again, some identitarian [culture-war] policies,” argues Giovanni Orsina of the <small>LUISS</small> school in Rome.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On the question of Europe, in particular, many hard-right parties have softened. A few of the edgiest populists want to dismantle the union they sneeringly refer to as the “ <small>EUSSR</small> ”. But <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> abandoned the idea of leaving the euro and restructuring the <small>EU</small> before coming to power. Ms Meloni instead wants the <small>EU</small> to do more to help Italy, by keeping out the migrants that flood Italy&#39;s shores. This summer she went to Tunisia with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission&#39;s president, to negotiate a migration deal. She also wants the bloc to relax its fiscal rules so that her government can spend more. She even cultivates Europhiles by praising the union as the guardian of European peace and civilisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>RN</small> , in similar fashion, no longer calls for France to leave the <small>EU</small> and the euro. Its rhetoric remains anti-European, but with few specifics. This retreat from more radical policies was presumably intended precisely to broaden the <small>RN</small> ’s appeal and so help it win power. And even if Ms Le Pen were to become president, she might still struggle to implement her policies, despite the immense formal powers of the office. After all, reforms to state pensions championed by Emmanuel Macron, the incumbent, met ferocious opposition even though he clearly advertised them during his re-election campaign last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Far-right parties, which are often young, full of zealous ideologues and dependent on charismatic leaders, are prone to schisms. The Finns Party&#39;s first stint in government, in 2015, split it in two. Its second, which began in May, has already been marred by scandals and resignations. In Poland, <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s generous benefits policies have alienated fiscal conservatives, some of whom have defected to a libertarian party called Confederation. Ms Le Pen, having softened her radical image, now faces competition on the right from Reconquest, whose lead candidate in the European election is her niece, Marion Maréchal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most vivid illustration of such chaos is in the Netherlands, which since 2002 has seen a series of right-wing populist parties rocket to prominence only to implode. In provincial elections in 2019 Forum for Democracy, a party led by Thierry Baudet, a dandyish Eurosceptic, finished first with 17%. Within months it had split into three. Mr Baudet now hawks conspiracy theories about covid-19 and immigration; his rump of the party is polling at 3%. Earlier this year the <small>BBB</small> had a brief moment as the standard-bearer of the right, but it has already slumped to 11% in the polls. It has been losing votes to yet another new party on the right with populist overtones, New Social Contract, which was launched by an <small>MP</small> famous for investigating abuses by the tax authority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What all these parties have in common is a vague sense that they stand with ordinary people against the elite. Their positions on hot-button issues can be hazy, as with the <small>RN</small> ’s new stance on Europe. At a local level their candidates are often pragmatic. In June the rural town of Raguhn-Jessnitz in Saxony-Anhalt became the first to elect an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> mayor. Hannes Loth is an energetic 42-year-old former vegetable farmer (“cabbage, sweetcorn, onions—all kinds of onions”). During the pandemic, when locals had trouble getting travel permits because of the lack of a covid-testing centre, Mr Loth opened one himself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Loth&#39;s main concerns are run-down streets and fire stations and the town&#39;s budget deficit, which was €1.5m ($1.6m) last year. That is partly because high energy prices sent heating bills for the <i>Rathaus</i> (town hall) through the roof. Mr Loth, toeing the <small>a</small> f <small>d</small> ’s line, says the solution is to restart the nuclear plants the government has closed and negotiate peace in Ukraine so gas pipelines to Russia can reopen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The disconnect between genuine problems and far-fetched solutions encapsulates something important about hard-right populist parties. Mr Loth is acutely sensitive to his constituents&#39; suffering from high energy costs. But the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s response is in part a fantasy: whatever it might wish, cheap Russian gas will not be an option for the foreseeable future. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="rotesters raising their hands making a Nazi salute while carrying a Spanish flag with the words"Long live the unity of Spain" are seen during a protest of far right wing party" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Making their presence felt</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similarly, the worries of the voters at the meeting in Sint-Genesius-Rode are natural. They have seen their town change its language around them; they have trouble finding good Dutch-language schools for their kids. But Vlaams Belang&#39;s solutions are illusory. Flemish independence is unlikely. Even if it happened, there is no way to force Sint-Genesius-Rode to speak mostly Dutch again. It has become French-speaking not because of a bureaucratic conspiracy, but because immigrants are more interested in learning French (a widely spoken language) than Dutch (a relatively obscure one).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The changes Europe&#39;s populist parties rail against tend to be inexorable or at least not easily reversed: demography, sexual liberation, gender equality, the shift away from fossil fuels. As with Vlaams Belang, the policies they propose to set the world to rights tend to be incoherent or unachievable. For populists, unrealistic programmes are no bad thing: candidates cannot thunder indignantly at election rallies about problems that have been solved.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Moreover, simply by railing and attracting support, far-right parties help to shift the debate. All across the continent, centre-right parties have toughened their immigration policies and heightened their culture-war rhetoric to stop voters defecting to the populists. The most glaring example of this was in Britain, where Brexit was set in train by the Conservative Party&#39;s decision to support a referendum on Brexit in an effort to diminish the appeal of the insurgents of the <small>UK</small> Independence Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is probably the biggest risk of the rising vote share of Europe&#39;s far-right parties. Certainly, they tend to be associated with bigotry and misogyny, and to undermine the rule of law. Occasionally they may win enough power to damage democracy, as in Hungary and Poland. But more often, big populist-right blocs simply impede countries from getting to grips with their most pressing problems by offering illusory solutions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is the last thing the <small>EU</small> needs. The next European Parliament must make grave decisions regarding institutional reform in the <small>EU</small> , energy security, climate, support for Ukraine and more. If a quarter of its members refuse to wrestle seriously with such problems, they are unlikely to be solved. The hard right does not need to seize control of the levers of power to gum them up. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i><b>Correction (September 18th, 2023):</b> A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Germany&#39;s election took place last year.

No longer: of the six countries invited to join the bloc at its annual summit on August 22nd, four—Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> )—are from the region. If they all accept, the Middle East will account for more than a third of the expanded bloc&#39;s members.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The invitations are one sign among many that the Middle East is changing. Wealthy Gulf states are trying to establish themselves as non-aligned middle powers. Saudi Arabia has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. The <small>UAE</small> , which will host this year&#39;s global climate summit, <small>cop</small> 28, wants to fashion a dual role as both oil exporter and green-energy powerhouse. The six-member Gulf Co-operation Council ( <small>GCC</small> ) is one of the world&#39;s economic hotspots, drawing the talented and the ultra-rich from east and west and deploying vast pools of capital abroad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even more striking is the Middle East&#39;s newfound (and relative) calm. A ceasefire has quietened the eight-year war in Yemen. Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to ease their 40-year feud in March. Qatar has repaired relations with its neighbours. The region has even reconciled with Syria&#39;s murderous dictator, Bashar al-Assad. America, meanwhile, is urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, under which four other Arab countries have established ties with Israel since 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Five years ago Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia&#39;s crown prince and de facto ruler, offered a hopeful vision of where things might go. “I think that the new Europe is the Middle East,” he said. “The next global renaissance will be in the Middle East.” His comments fit an increasingly popular narrative in the Gulf, that a “new” Middle East will be focused on economics rather than democratisation, Islamisation or other distracting ideologies. Diplomacy will bring stability, which will foster investment and growth that helps everyone move beyond the upheavals of decades past. The Gulf states have long applied this model at home; now they want to export it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Middle East has huge potential. First, and most obvious, it is awash with hydrocarbons. It accounts for 36% of world oil production, 46% of oil exports, 22% of natural-gas output and 30% of liquefied natural gas ( <small>LNG</small> ) exports. Those numbers will only rise. The region has vast reserves (52% of the world&#39;s total for oil and 43% for gas) and low production costs. At a time when Western oil majors are skittish about investing, Gulf firms are adding capacity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Location is important, too: the region connects Europe, Africa and Asia. Some 30% of the world&#39;s shipping containers pass through the Suez canal in Egypt, while 16% of its air cargo flies via airports in the Gulf. Its young population is another asset: 55% of Middle Easterners are under 30, compared with 36% of the population of the <small>OECD</small> , a club mostly of rich countries.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Monumental misfortune</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the story of the past two decades has been one of conflict and despair. First came America&#39;s ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003. The fury of the Arab spring followed, bringing upheaval but not democracy: all the countries affected eventually either reverted to dictatorship or collapsed into civil war. Islamist violence and sectarian strife compounded the region&#39;s woes. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The Middle East accounts for 6% of the world&#39;s population but just 4% of economic output. Strip out a few big oil producers and that figure falls below 2%. In much of the region <small>GDP</small> per person is stagnant or falling (see chart 1). Poverty rates have soared in Egypt and Lebanon, to say nothing of war-torn Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But three big shifts are under way that could change the place of the Middle East in the world. The first is the growing distance between the Gulf states and America. Three successive presidents have sought to reduce America&#39;s military presence in the Middle East. Joe Biden, the current one, is not trying to impose democracy on the region; he does not even seem too interested in reining in Iran&#39;s nuclear programme. America has other priorities: competition with China, the war in Ukraine, political turmoil at home.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s economic role is also decreasing. Over the past 30 years the share of Middle Eastern exports going to China and India has climbed from 5% to 26%, according to the <small>IMF;</small> the share sent to Europe and America has fallen from 34% to 16%. Much of this reflects Asia&#39;s booming appetite for oil, the region&#39;s main export. In the 1990s China took less than 1% of Saudi Arabia&#39;s crude exports, and India less than 3%; by 2021 those figures were 28% and 12%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Oil is at the heart of the second shift, in energy markets. The region is trying to become an even bigger force in oil and gas to finance a transition away from hydrocarbons, contradictory though that may sound. Recent high oil prices have brought a windfall. Aramco, the state-owned Saudi giant, posted a record $161bn profit last year, up from $110bn in 2021. It plans to expand its capacity by 1m barrels a day (roughly 10%) over the next three years. The <small>UAE</small> has a similar target. It has also made itself a transit point for Iranian and Russian oil, which are subject to Western sanctions. Qatar, already the world&#39;s biggest exporter of <small>LNG</small> , plans to boost production by 63% by 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The proceeds are being poured into new industries. Instead of parking its petrodollars in American treasuries, as it once did, Saudi Arabia is snapping up everything from European footballers to stakes in electric-car firms. This summer the kingdom struck a $2.6bn deal with Brazil&#39;s largest mining firm, part of a plan to spend $170bn on the industry by 2030.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final shift is in attitudes. Surveys show that Arabs view the economy as their top concern. About a third of young Arabs say the cost of living is the region&#39;s biggest problem and another third cite unemployment; almost half say it is hard to find a job in their country. Asked whether stability or democracy is more important, 82% choose the former. Growing numbers believe that democracy is bad for economic growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Citizens have lost interest in political Islam, too. Islamist parties have been forced out of government by Tunisian voters and Egyptian soldiers. Armed Islamists failed to take control of Iraq, Libya and Syria. <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/07/a-year-after-iran-was-shaken-by-protests-zealots-have-tightened-their-grip">Widespread protests</a> in Iran last year were a sign of popular frustration with its religious rulers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The leaders of the Gulf countries, too, seem to have a new outlook. Over the past decade they had sought to use force to change the region. They tried to impose a friendly government on Yemen; Saudi Arabia sent weapons to Syrian rebels; the <small>UAE</small> attempted to install Khalifa Haftar, a warlord, as Libya&#39;s leader. Each effort failed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At least for now, the era of macho foreign policy is over. The most unexpected diplomatic shift was the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. They have been at odds since the latter&#39;s Islamic revolution in 1979, fighting a proxy war that eventually spread to Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. With a nudge from China, though, they agreed in March to reopen their embassies, which had been closed since 2016, to tone down criticism of one another in state-backed media and to boost economic ties. They are hardly friends, but the deal has reduced the chance of conflict in the Gulf.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most unsavoury shift is Mr Assad&#39;s reintegration. He did nothing to earn it: after destroying Syria to keep power, he has made no gestures towards reform or reconciliation. But in May the Saudis let him reclaim Syria&#39;s seat at the Arab League.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The easing of tensions has nonetheless brought a measure of calm, which may help explain the improving economic outlook. The <small>IMF</small> expects the non-oil portion of the Gulf states&#39; economies to grow by 4.2% this year (unchanged from last year), even as the oily bit expands by just 1.9% (down from 10.3% in 2022). The region attracted 6% of global flows of foreign direct investment last year, up from 3% in 2019.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Capital markets are booming. Firms in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the <small>UAE</small> , accounted for 14% of the world&#39;s <small>IPO</small> s in the first quarter of 2023. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that foreign ownership of Middle Eastern equities climbed from 2% in 2017 to 10% last year. It sees the region&#39;s weight in emerging-market indices rising to 10% in the next few years, from 7% today.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Big domestic reforms are making headway: 31% of Saudi women were employed in the first quarter of this year, compared with 16% at the same point in 2017. Gulf states are also trying to be more exacting when doling out aid. Some still comes with few strings attached: Tunisia, for instance, secured a surprise $500m bail-out (most of it loans) from Saudi Arabia in July. But Egypt is having to raise money by selling stakes in state-run firms to sovereign-wealth funds from Qatar and the <small>UAE</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists muse about where this could lead. A calmer Middle East would mean fewer risks to global trade and energy flows, and fewer refugees (the region accounts for over 8m of the world&#39;s 35m). As Western firms seek to diversify supply chains, a youthful Middle East could become a new manufacturing base.摩洛哥蓬勃发展的汽车工业每年生产约 700,000 辆汽车并维持 220,000 个就业岗位，这证明了一切皆有可能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">该地区还可以开展更多的自营业务。中东内部的贸易仅相当于该地区<small>GDP</small>的 2.9%，而<small>欧盟</small>内部的这一比例为 22%。阿联酋零售巨头 Majid al-Futtaim 和咨询公司麦肯锡的研究人员估计，取消贸易壁垒可能会使该地区的<small>GDP</small>增加 2300 亿美元（5%）。如果沙特阿拉伯和以色列言归于好，与中东最具活力的经济体建立商业联系将成为可能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">基础设施也可以拼接在一起。<small>海湾合作委员会</small>国家长期以来一直在讨论整合其铁路，这些铁路也可以很容易地与伊拉克、以色列和约旦的铁路相连。管道可以将低成本的沙特氢气穿过地中海输送给欧洲消费者；升级后的输电线路可以让阳光充足的地区输出太阳能。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是一个诱人的愿景，但也存在许多陷阱。首先是这几年经济发展不平衡。中东长期以来一直存在革命派和保皇党、民族主义者和伊斯兰主义者、逊尼派和什叶派之间的政治分裂。然而，今天最重要的区别是经济上的富裕国家和贫穷国家之间的区别。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">不幸的是，中东大部分地区都很贫穷。即使在地区平静的时期，严峻的经济形势也威胁着这些国家的稳定。仅在过去五年中，自从穆罕默德亲王首次开始谈论地区复兴以来，阿尔及利亚、伊朗、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩和苏丹都发生了大规模抗议活动。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">法老管理不善</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃及作为阿拉伯世界人口最多的国家，情况尤其令人担忧。自 2013 年政变以来执掌该国的士兵阿卜杜勒-法塔赫·塞西 (Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi) 在医疗和教育方面的支出一直低于宪法要求。但他已经找到了资金用于宏伟的项目，例如在沙漠中建造新首都以及为军队大量购买武器（埃及是世界第六大武器进口国）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃及债务占<small>GDP的</small>比例已升至93%，其中36%的贷款以外币计价。其非石油经济已连续33个月收缩，过去90个月中有81个月收缩。过去两年，该货币已贬值一半，并且可能很快会再次贬值。 7 月份年度通胀率创下 38% 的历史新高。今年夏天，由于政府无力进口足够的发电厂燃料，居民们在酷暑中忍受停电。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一场全面的国际收支危机似乎有可能发生。即使政府一瘸一拐地继续前进，当这个最大的国家陷入困境时，也很难重塑该地区。如果骚乱爆发到足够规模，甚至可能损害海湾国家的经济前景。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个风险是，即使是该地区的繁荣国家也无法创造其承诺的就业和增长。无可否认，迄今为止，他们比中东其他地方的同行做得更好。 1975年，沙特和利比亚的人均国内<small>生产总值</small>大致相同；今天，沙特的数字高出 353%。海湾地区和以色列（该地区的另一个繁荣地区）人口仅占中东地区的 14%，但却占中东地区<small>GDP</small>的 60%、货物出口的 73% 和<small>外国直接投资</small>的 75%（见图 2）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但沙特阿拉伯和其邻国一样，正在与深层次的结构性问题作斗争。公民仍然将一份轻松的公共部门工作视为与生俱来的权利。政府雇佣了 53% 的沙特就业人员，尽管这一比例低于 2019 年的 66%。学校不教授适销对路的技能。沙特的工资太高，无法成为制造业中心，至少在没有昂贵的国家补贴的情况下是这样。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">穆罕默德亲王希望到 2030 年，年度外国直接投资将达到 1000 亿美元。去年仅为 80 亿美元。这使得政府成为经济转型的主要推动者，这在两个方面令人担忧。首先，其财务状况受制于石油市场。分析师估计，如果算上主权财富基金的预算外支出，当油价跌至每桶 100 美元以下时，沙特将出现赤字。目前价格约为 90 美元，为近一年来的最高水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次，目前还不清楚政府的多元化投资是否会获得回报。沙特王国的经济蓝图“2030 年愿景”预计，到本十年末，旅游业将占沙特<small>GDP</small>的 10%。官员们声称，该行业将创造 100 万个就业岗位，足以雇佣二十分之一的沙特人，这一比例高于法国或西班牙。但几乎没有证据表明每年将有 1 亿游客涌入。据<small>联合国</small>估计，去年的人数仅为 1600 万人，比该愿景通过的 2016 年减少了约 150 万人。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个担忧是，领导人如此急于掩盖的意识形态争论将在某个时候重新浮出水面。尽管伊朗继续为其流氓核计划生产高浓缩铀，但沙特阿拉伯仍在寻求与伊朗缓和关系。如果该政权进一步制造炸弹，可能会引发地区军备竞赛，甚至引发战争。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img

edweubf1">图片：安东尼·杰拉斯/盖蒂图片社</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">过去二十年来，以巴冲突相对缓和，但不太可能永远保持这种状态。圣地的严重冲突可能会动摇阿拉伯与以色列的协议。利比亚、叙利亚和也门的暴力事件已经减少，但潜在的争端仍未解决。上个月，阿萨德在南部省份苏维达面临一波抗议活动。沙特阿拉伯和<small>阿联酋</small>虽然是新中东的主要支持者，但在外交政策和经济问题上经常存在分歧。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最后一个风险是该地区地缘政治平衡的做法是错误的。美国仍然是唯一愿意并且能够在该地区投射军事力量的国家，其对全球金融体系的主导地位赋予其无与伦比的经济影响力。海湾国家不能冒险失去它作为合作伙伴。然而，他们与俄罗斯和中国的调情正在引发华盛顿日益增长的愤怒。美国对<small>阿联酋</small>的几家公司实施了制裁，其中包括一家被指控向俄罗斯供应无人机的公司。由于有指控称中国军队驻扎在阿布扎比港口，该公司推迟了向该国出售<small>F</small> -35战斗机的交易。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">英国智库国际战略研究所的埃米尔·霍卡耶姆指出，海湾国家“在一定程度上基于中国经济持续崛起的假设来规划未来的繁荣”。不过，中国经济也亮起了警灯：增长缓慢、人口老龄化、房地产市场停滞不前。对中国的大赌注会疏远美国，可能会让海湾地区陷入困境。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，穆罕默德亲王并不是第一个对中东复兴大肆宣扬的地区领导人。当前时代与 20 世纪 90 年代有许多相似之处，90 年代该地区似乎试图将暴力的过去抛在脑后。奥斯陆协议似乎预示着以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突的结束。黎巴嫩长期内战已经停止。埃及、约旦和叙利亚的独裁者谈论开放其墨守成规的经济。当时的沙特王储阿卜杜拉·本·阿卜杜勒阿齐兹也是如此，他承诺进行大胆改革，并寻求改善与伊朗的关系。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 1993年，时任以色列外交部长西蒙·佩雷斯写了一本名为《新中东》的书，认为贸易将安抚该地区。 “最终，中东将在一个共同市场中团结起来，”他表示。 “这个共同市场的存在本身将促进维护长期和平的切身利益。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">可悲的是，历史却有不同的想法。以巴和平进程逐渐陷入停滞。美国于 2003 年入侵伊拉克，以色列于 2006 年向黎巴嫩南部派遣军队。事实证明，整个地区的现代化独裁者在现代化方面表现得相当糟糕，从而促成了阿拉伯之春。除了迪拜以外，海湾经济体一直处于石油状态，迪拜本来就没有太多石油。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">和平与发展的时代是一个诱人的愿景，但要实现这一愿景，该地区的独裁者必须认真维护和平，并明智地修复经济。目前的情况给了他们改变的机会，技术和地缘政治力量提供了激励。剩下的就看他们的了。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:59:01

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>今年早些时候</small><span>，</span>突尼斯总统凯斯·赛义德警告说，来自撒哈拉以南非洲的“大批非正规移民”正密谋改变突尼斯的人口结构，取代占多数的阿拉伯人。他补充说，非洲黑人带来了“暴力、犯罪和不可接受的做法”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">实际上，他允许突尼斯人公开种族主义。突然间，许多人可以随意使用以前被视为禁忌的侮辱性词语，其中包括一种针对黑人的侮辱性词语，字面意思是“奴隶”。八月份<i>《经济学人》</i>在街上采访的大多数当地人都使用这个词。 “奴隶正在取代我们，”首都突尼斯的家具修理工尼扎尔说。 “他们正在抢走所有的工作。”更糟糕的是，“他们穿着内衣站在阳台上喝酒。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">仇恨的浪潮席卷全国。 7月，在突尼斯第二城市斯法克斯，一名阿拉伯人在与移民的斗殴中被杀，暴徒烧毁了非洲黑人住宿的房屋。房东害怕失去财产，驱逐了黑人房客。当<i>《经济学人》</i>访问时，数百名撒哈拉以南的移民正在市中心露宿，挤在一起寻求保护。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “看看我的头，”来自几内亚的画家穆罕默德指着锤击留下的疤痕说道。他说，暴徒用石头和汽油弹将他赶出了公寓；然后警察抓住了他，把他扔到了沙漠里，没有水。许多移民就这样死去，但穆罕默德却以某种方式回到了斯法克斯。他迫切地想要去欧洲。 </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMcuv4eccCA?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">总统的讲话纯属捏造。没有计划改变突尼斯的人口结构。非洲黑人只占人口的一小部分，而且大部分只是过客。如果他们犹豫不决，那只是因为他们正在为穿越地中海的危险旅程存钱。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在演讲之前，由于经济不景气，赛义德先生不受欢迎。此后，他似乎赢得了更多支持。民意调查并不可靠，但 11 月份的一项民意调查显示他的支持率还不到 30%； 6 月份的另一项调查显示，69% 的人会投票给他。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他发誓要保护突尼斯人民免受幽灵威胁，从而将他们团结在自己身后。他还转移了对该国弊病的指责。经济学家认为突尼斯的通货膨胀主要是由政府造成的，但来自斯法克斯的穆斯塔法将责任归咎于黑人，他说黑人吃光了所有面包，推高了物价。他计划在下次选举中投票给赛义德先生。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">总统散播仇恨的行为也分散了人们对他一直在做的其他有争议的事情的注意力，例如压制媒体、清洗司法机构和关闭国家反腐败监管机构。他一直在废除促进良好、廉洁治理的制衡机制，并取得了可预见的结果。突尼斯变得更加恐惧、更加不自由、更加腐败。自2021年赛义德开始废除其年轻而充满希望的民主以来，其在监督机构透明国际编制的清廉指数（ <small>CPI</small> ）上的得分显着恶化。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

e190yofl0">突尼斯反映了一种全球趋势：越来越多的领导人正在利用民族主义作为积累权力并滥用权力的工具（见图 1）。尽管民族主义曾经是瓦解可悲的殖民帝国的一种手段，但它正日益成为消除对政府权力的合法限制的手段。对制衡感到不满的领导人需要一个借口来废除它们。他们不能承认他们想要压制媒体并清洗法院，因为他们发现遵守规则令人厌烦，并且更愿意以不受约束的权威进行统治。因此他们指责记者和法官是叛徒或外国势力的代理人。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">民族主义可以是积极的，也可以是消极的。积极的一面——热爱自己的国家——可以成为一股向善的力量。亚沙·蒙克在《伟大的实验：如何让多元化民主发挥作用》一书中写道：“这是人们之间团结的最坚实基础，否则他们可能没有什么共同点。” “最好的情况是，它可以激励生活在田纳西州农村的白人基督徒对生活在洛杉矶的西班牙裔无神论者感到特别关心，反之亦然。”因为它是良性的，而且除了少数西方大学外，几乎所有政治家都拥护毫无争议的、积极的民族主义。几乎没有人会承认自己不爱自己的国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">危险在于他们拥护消极的民族主义：外来者的恐惧和怀疑。局外人可能是外国人，也可能是国内少数民族。也许因为这种偏执的变体是基于根深蒂固的本能——保护自己部落的愿望——所以它非常有效。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当人们感到自己的国家受到威胁时，他们就会奋起保卫国家，有时甚至是英勇的。当弗拉基米尔·普京入侵乌克兰时，乌克兰人为抵抗他做出了巨大牺牲。这对乌克兰有利，否则乌克兰就会成为一个附庸国。它还提高了乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽伦斯基的民意支持率：人们团结在这位领导国家国防的人周围。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">唉，不择手段的领导人发现，他们可以通过发誓保护人民免受虚假威胁来赢得类似的民意调查。普京声称，他对乌克兰的无端攻击实际上是为了保卫俄罗斯免受西方侵略和乌克兰纳粹的侵害。许多俄罗斯人相信他。尽管这场战争给俄罗斯带来了鲜血、财富和国际孤立的代价，但独立民意调查显示，自战争开始以来，普京的支持率有所上升。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">偏执的民族主义的主要缺点是显而易见的。这对于其目标来说是可怕的，无论他们是突尼斯的移民还是土地上埋有地雷的乌克兰人。偏执的民族主义政权的邻国有理由感到紧张，与俄罗斯或中国接壤的任何地方都可以证明这一点。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个大缺点不太为人所知：基于偏执的政治为暴政和腐败打开了大门。过去二十年来，随着普京加强民族主义宣传，他的亲信一直在掠夺俄罗斯。尽管他无疑是最极端的例子，但他并不孤单。事实上，民族主义和腐败之间存在明显的统计相关性。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>《经济学人》</i>分析了瑞典哥德堡大学附属智库 V-Dem 研究所的数据。每年它都会要求专家描述世界各国政府如何向选民或公民证明自己的合理性。然后它会根据结果创建一个比例。按人口对各国进行加权后，我们发现 2012 年至 2021 年间，各国政府变得更加依赖民族主义来为自己辩护。 （具体来说，是包含民族主义元素的意识形态。它还可能包含其他元素，例如民粹主义或伊斯兰主义。）这种变化是重大的：一个典型的公民看到她的国家使用民族主义的增加大致相当于中国的增加在“战狼”国家主席习近平的领导下。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

<small>TI</small> ) 2012 年至 2021 年公共部门腐败认知数据结合起来。利用统计模型，我们发现，如果政府依靠民族主义言论来维持权力，专家认为公共部门的腐败程度要高得多（见图2）。此外，回顾2012年，通过比较不同时期的国家，我们发现民族主义言论越多，腐败越多，民族主义越少，腐败越少。在控制了平均收入及其变化以及全球民族主义和腐败趋势后，这两个发现仍然成立。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">也有明显的例外（例如，中国变得更廉洁、更沙文主义），但这种关系在统计上是显着的：民族主义每增加一个标准差，腐败就会猛增 5.31（范围从 0 到 100）在比较国家时，在内部比较时跃升 0.13 个百分点。后者可能看起来很小，但腐败分数通常不会有太大变化。有趣的是，当民族主义首先出现时，它就预示着未来腐败的增加。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为什么会这样呢？ <small>TI</small>的负责人丹尼尔·埃里克森 (Daniel Eriksson) 提出了民族主义助长权力滥用的三种方式。政治家可能会煽动民族主义热情来赢得或保住职位。通过给予他们的亲属或亲信影响力，他们可能会试图夺取国家。通过将批评者称为叛徒，他们可能会削弱防止掠夺公共资金的制衡机制。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">诉诸民族主义是有效的，因为它们简单易懂，而且比任何基本的政策建议都更加情绪化。 “投票给我，我将为学校做出渐进式的改进”是一个很好的平台，但却是一个乏味的口号。 “隔壁的部落正在攻击我们！”是一个令人振奋的。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">选择你的毒药</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">敌人可以有多种形式。可能是移民，就像突尼斯那样。或者是地缘政治对手：中国和俄罗斯的宣传不断妖魔化美国。或者少数派信仰：印度执政党夸大占人口不到 15% 的穆斯林对占多数的印度教徒构成的不存在的威胁。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">或者敌人可能是文化变革。许多民族主义领导人将任何令人不舒服的新社会趋势描述为外国人，甚至是外国人企图颠覆其国家价值观的恶毒企图。伊朗政权利用这一论点来讨论妇女权利；乌干达关于对同性恋者的宽容。非自由政权习惯性地将他们反对的价值观描述为外来价值观，这比解释他们为什么错了要容易。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">每个民族主义领导人都是独一无二的，很难判断哪些人相信自己的言论。无论哪种方式，偏执的民族主义都为他们提供了获得权力、巩固权力并掩饰滥用权力的工具。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以尼加拉瓜为例。总统丹尼尔·奥尔特加曾经是一位革命马克思主义者。他于 1979 年一路上台，但在 1990 年的选举中失利。为了重新获得并保留权力，他压制了自己的马克思主义，加大了反美的夸夸其谈，赢得了 2006 年的选举，并从那时起逐渐扼杀了民主。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他对妖怪的选择是精明的。四十年前，美国确实资助了他的国家的暴力革命者。这种威胁早已不复存在，但奥尔特加先生仍然声称他的对手是“洋基帝国的代理人”，“很久以前就不再是尼加拉瓜人了”。今年二月，他剥夺了 300 多名持不同政见者的公民身份。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t

e190yofl0">按照埃里克森先生的剧本，奥尔特加先生让他的亲属掌握了权力。他的副总统和可能的继任者是他的妻子罗萨里奥·穆里略(Rosario Murillo)。他们的九个孩子中有八个帮助他们管理国家。他们的儿子劳雷亚诺是总统顾问。他监督了与一家中国公司就修建横跨尼加拉瓜、耗资 500 亿美元的运河的谈判。该项目于 2015 年因诈骗指控而失败。劳雷亚诺也是一位歌剧歌手。并非所有歌剧迷都相信他的才华。一位评论家将他的声音比作“山羊分娩时的尖叫声”。但他经常在由他经营的基金会支持的歌剧中担任主角，该基金会由尼加拉瓜纳税人资助。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">盗窃独裁者</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">奥尔特加家族经营着尼加拉瓜的主要电视频道。这让他们能够偏向对自己有利的消息。这也是有利可图的。 2018年至2020年间，尼加拉瓜政府从奥尔特加斯家族拥有或控制的三大<small>电视</small>频道购买了价值约5900万美元的广告，而在与他们无关的频道上花费了区区23万美元。据信该家族总共控制着从能源到房地产等行业的 22 家公司。按照<small>TI</small>的规模计算，尼加拉瓜的腐败程度比 2012 年高出 10 个百分点，目前排名低于刚果。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在更富裕、更成熟的民主国家，偏执的民族主义也为局外人提供了一种吸引注意力、闯入国家政治或保持领先地位的快捷方式。五月，匈牙利总理维克多·欧尔班在一次保守派会议上声称，“我们都受到了攻击。”他发誓要捍卫匈牙利人免受移民、伊斯兰教和同性恋权利的侵害。他宣布匈牙利各民族团结一致，包括邻国的匈牙利人。他给他们养老金，并让他们在匈牙利选举中投票；他们倾向于投票给他。因此，煽动民族主义帮助他赢得了四次选举。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">匈牙利媒体现在主要由欧尔班先生的亲信控制，鹦鹉学舌地重复他关于外国阴谋的说法。当来自欧盟的大量援助流入他的密友的口袋，国家资产被转移到他的盟友控制的基金会时，温和的法院很少提出反对意见。洛林克·梅萨罗斯 (Lorinc Meszaros) 是欧尔班先生的前同学，拥有一家规模不大的管道配件企业，现已成为匈牙利首富，福布斯估计其财富为 14 亿美元。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在匈牙利和其他地方，民族主义为削弱制衡提供了一个听起来合理的借口。看门狗可以被指定为“外国代理人”并被绝育。诚实的公务员可能会被贴上“不爱国”的标签，并被忠诚者取代。不正当交易可以以国家安全的名义保密。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">普京先生是这种方法的先驱。 2012年，他出台了一项法律，限制从国外接受资金的<small>非政府</small>组织的活动。 2022 年，他扩大了该法律的范围。现在，如果国家认为任何个人或团体“受到外国影响”，则可以将其宣布为“外国代理人”（这在许多人听来就像“间谍”）。所谓的“外国代理人”可以被禁止参与任何类型的政治活动，或者干脆被关闭。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">普京方法的要素已被世界各地广泛模仿。据国际特赦组织称，近年来至少有 50 个国家颁布了限制公民社会的规则。更广泛地说，根据我们的姊妹组织经济学人智库的衡量，在 2012 年至 2022 年间清廉指数显着恶化的 31 个国家中，80% 的国家的公民自由也受到限制。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">将监管机构贴上“外国代理人”的标签会阻碍他们的工作。紧张的当地捐助者越来越不愿意资助活跃的非政府<small>组织</small>；广告商避开独立媒体，以免他们的品牌名称因联想而受损。印度利用其《外国捐款监管法》来骚扰和压制从乐施会到绿色和平组织的团体。中国的“外国影响力”规则限制任何可能惹恼共产党的与外国有联系的非政府<small>组织</small>的活动。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 7月，津巴布韦总统签署了一项“爱国法案”，允许任何“故意损害津巴布韦主权和国家利益”的人被判处长期监禁。反对派表示，他们将上周选举前对政府的批评定为犯罪，执政党不公平地“赢得”了选举。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管名称如此，该法案似乎旨在让津巴布韦的治理更加恶化。这使得公民社会的成员——对盗窃执政党的主要制约因素——与外国人进行任何接触变得危险。如果一名独立记者与外国外交官交谈，或者当地选举监督组织与国际组织分享数据，或者反腐败监督机构向国外专家寻求建议，那么监狱可能会等待着您。除此之外，该法律还要求检察官证明那些滥用职权的人知道自己的行为是错误的，从而加大了惩罚掠夺性官员的难度。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在一个又一个国家，现任者发现民族主义或宗派论点可以用来骚扰那些挑战现状的人或将他们排除在公职之外。伊朗腐败的神权政治坚持要求所有总统候选人都符合其对伊斯兰虔诚的定义。 2021 年，它取消了其中 585 人的资格，其中包括所有潜在的改革者，只允许 7 人参选。波兰的一项新法律可能会禁止被认为受到俄罗斯不当影响的政客任职；它的可能目标是唐纳德·图斯克，一位根本不亲俄罗斯的主要反对派候选人。自2015年波兰民族主义执政党上台以来，该国的清廉指数已上升了八个百分点。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">贪婪的阴影</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一个更加民族主义的政府并不必然意味着一个更加腐败的政府。一个国家有可能变得更加喧闹，但不会变得更加肮脏，至少在一段时间内是这样。然而，从长远来看，如果一个领导人利用民族主义来削弱制衡，他周围的人或他的继任者就更容易进行掠夺。这种情况发生在津巴布韦，那里的民族主义独裁者罗伯特·穆加贝对权力的兴趣远大于金钱，他未能阻止亲信的掠夺，最终被他们推翻。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">因此，无论出发点如何，偏执的民族主义往往会使国家治理更差、更不稳定。诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿比吉特·巴纳吉 (Abhijit Banerjee) 与人合着的一篇论文发现，当选民根据种族而不是诚实或能力等因素来挑选候选人时，他们最终会选出不诚实、能力较差的代表。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哥伦比亚大学的安德烈亚斯·威默 (Andreas Wimmer) 分析了近 500 场内战的数据，发现当政党以种族为基础时，内战的可能性几乎是原来的两倍。如果相关国家既不是独裁国家（可以在骚乱升级之前镇压动乱）也不是完全民主国家（通常和平解决争端），那么不稳定的可能性可能会增加 30 倍。简而言之，当领导者援引鲜血和土壤时，预计事情会变得血腥或肮脏。 <span
