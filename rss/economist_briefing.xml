e190yofl0"><span>当</span><small>俄罗斯</small>去年入侵乌克兰时，黑海似乎不太可能成为战场。毕竟，乌克兰海军只有一艘军舰，当俄罗斯军队逼近尼古拉耶夫市正在维修的造船厂时，乌克兰海军被迫将其凿沉。蛇岛是守卫乌克兰最大港口敖德萨西部通道的海上前哨基地，在战争的第一天就被俄罗斯攻击者攻陷。敖德萨本身就做好了两栖攻击的准备，这将完全切断乌克兰与海洋的联系。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">登陆从未到来的事实是俄罗斯对海洋的统治并不像看上去那么绝对的第一个迹象。去年四月，乌克兰用新开发的反舰导弹成功击沉了俄罗斯黑海舰队的旗舰“<i>莫斯科”</i>号，这更明显地表明了这一点。两个月后，乌克兰的猛烈轰炸将占领者赶出了蛇岛。但直到最近，乌克兰才开始展示打击黑海目标的能力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">八月初，一架乌克兰海军无人机——另一种新武器——在新罗西斯克附近击毁了一艘俄罗斯登陆舰，新罗西斯克是远离战区东部的一个俄罗斯大港口。第二天，另一架无人机在克里米亚附近损坏了一艘俄罗斯油轮，克里米亚是黑海半岛的主宰，俄罗斯于 2014 年从乌克兰手中夺取了克里米亚半岛。10 月 1 日，无人机袭击了索契的一个直升机基地，该基地距离最近的乌克兰控制点约 600 公里。领土。最引人注目的是，在过去的一个月里，乌克兰的导弹和无人机多次袭击克里米亚各地的目标，最终于9月22日摧毁了位于塞瓦斯托波尔的俄罗斯黑海舰队总部。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">俄罗斯似乎也在加剧海上战争。 7月，它退出了一项由<small>联合国</small>监督的协议，该协议允许乌克兰粮食出口安全过海。它威胁要击沉所有停靠乌克兰港口的货船，并多次轰炸乌克兰码头和粮仓，以扼杀乌克兰的海上贸易。由于俄罗斯和乌克兰都有能力打击航运，而且正如一位外交官所说，黑海对粮食的争夺就像波斯湾对石油的争夺一样，海战的升级可能会对全球粮食市场产生痛苦的影响。事实上，黑海也是石油的重要通道，不仅是俄罗斯和乌克兰的经济中心，也是土耳其和其他沿岸国家的经济中心。如果它真的成为战区，世界将会感受到影响。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">海胆</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在很大程度上，乌克兰战争主要由步兵、坦克和大炮以及远程无人机和导弹主导。但尽管俄罗斯在敌对行动爆发前部署到黑海的六艘两栖攻击舰尚未投入使用，但对乌克兰南部海岸的威胁在某种程度上影响了冲突。一方面，沿海登陆的可能性意味着俄罗斯可以从三个方向威胁乌克兰，并迫使乌克兰分散兵力作为回应。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">大致相同的逻辑也适用于空中战争。不包括伊朗制造的无人机，今年 1 月至 3 月期间，俄罗斯对乌克兰发动的所有导弹袭击中约有五分之一源自海上。来自海上、陆地和空中的攻击使俄罗斯能够对乌克兰的防空系统施加更大的压力，乌克兰的防空系统必须警惕来自除西方以外各个方向的攻击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰的反应在某些方面是一次胜利。<i>莫斯科号</i>的沉没迫使俄罗斯将其船只远离海岸。对塞瓦斯托波尔的持续轰炸使一个巨大的海军基地变成了某种负担。此前停泊在那里的几艘船只已被拉回新罗西斯克。 “他们就像逃跑的老鼠，”一名乌克兰海军军官嘲笑道。英国国防部副部长詹姆斯·希佩本周夸奖说，乌克兰已经实现了“对俄罗斯黑海舰队的功能性击败”。 </p><div

e190yofl0">但尽管取得了所有成功，乌克兰的主要目标——确保货船能够安全地进出敖德萨及其其他港口——仍然难以实现。俄罗斯退出<small>联合国</small>粮食计划后，乌克兰建立了一条新的航线，沿着其海岸线一直延伸到蛇岛以西的罗马尼亚边境（见地图）。其目的是让民用船只尽可能远离俄罗斯的枪支，并尽快让它们进入<small>北约</small>成员国罗马尼亚的领海，俄罗斯可能会犹豫是否要发动袭击。迄今为止，已有十艘船以这种方式抵达敖德萨，装载谷物并再次起航，尽管受到俄罗斯的威胁，没有发生任何事故。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一名乌克兰高级官员告诉<i>《经济学人》</i> ，情报显示俄罗斯正计划对民用航运发动袭击，试图破坏新的出口航线。俄罗斯军舰可以发射射程2500公里的导弹，这使得它们能够在安全距离内攻击货船。伦敦智库皇家联合军种研究所 ( <small>RUSI</small> ) 的西德哈斯·考沙尔 (Sidharth Kaushal) 表示，出于同样的原因，即使俄罗斯水面舰艇被迫远离，俄罗斯也可以使用潜艇布设水雷（尽管乌克兰人认为浅水区沿着新的出口路线将使这变得困难）。即使乌克兰以某种方式击沉了整个俄罗斯舰队，从克里米亚发射的导弹也可以轻松摧毁敖德萨附近一艘笨重的货船。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一位乌克兰官员指出，俄罗斯对乌克兰港口的袭击已经导致黑海沿岸的保险费上涨：“保险公司知道事情的发展方向。他们并不愚蠢。”但是，第一个补充道，“这个游戏可以两个人玩。”乌克兰警告称，如果俄罗斯袭击民用船只，它将以牙还牙。他说，它一直在展示其打击遥远海军目标的能力，不是为了让黑海战争升级，而是为了阻止俄罗斯这样做。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">两国的赌注都很高。战前，乌克兰约 60% 的出口通过黑海港口进行。此后，贸易量急剧萎缩，这既是因为俄罗斯的封锁，也是因为战争对农场、工厂和基础设施造成的更广泛破坏。即使在粮食计划实施期间，乌克兰的出口也只是以前的一小部分（见图表）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些失踪的书卷已被转移到多瑙河上的驳船上。乌克兰官员表示，目前他们每月可以通过这种方式出口超过 300 万吨谷物。另外 100 万吨通过火车出口，少量通过卡车出口。但这些替代方案都比在巨型货轮上堆放货物要慢得多，而且成本也高得多。例如，通过内河驳船出口一吨谷物的成本约为 120 美元，而通过海运出口则为 30-40 美元。俄罗斯也在轰炸新航线。更重要的是，乌克兰根本没有足够的公路、铁路和驳船能力来替代深海港口。其结果是对已经被战争摧毁的经济造成进一步打击，并导致不可持续借贷的政府进一步损失税收和外汇。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但俄罗斯也有很多损失。其80%以上的粮食出口和约30%的石油出口通过黑海港口。到目前为止，这些货物几乎没有受到战争的影响。俄罗斯在叙利亚的军事力量也依赖通过黑海运输的燃料和补给。如果海上战争范围扩大，这艘“叙利亚快车”可能会在乌克兰的潜在目标名单上名列前茅。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">克里米亚和惩罚</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了对俄罗斯经济造成严重伤害，乌克兰不需要击沉所有驶往俄罗斯的船只，而只需损坏足够多的船只，导致保险费飙升，俄罗斯港口变得缺乏商业吸引力。 “我们没有无人机来阻止所有俄罗斯贸易。但如果你问我们是否可以大幅增加财务风险？当然，没问题，”一位乌克兰官员说道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这不仅对俄罗斯不利，对全球食品市场也不利。战争初期，他们陷入了恐慌。毕竟，战争爆发时，俄罗斯和乌克兰的卡路里贸易量合计占全球卡路里贸易量的八分之一。 2021年，它们分别是全球第一和第五大小麦出口国，出口量分别为3900万吨和1700万吨，占全球贸易供应量的28%。两国还种植大量用于饲养动物的谷物，如玉米和大麦，并且是葵花籽的两大生产国，占据植物油市场 11.5% 的份额。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">几天之内，入侵导致小麦价格从两个月前的每蒲式耳 7 美元上涨至 12 美元以上；玉米价格升至十年来最高水平。这主要是因为俄罗斯封锁了乌克兰黑海港口。贸易商还担心战争和西方制裁可能会阻碍俄罗斯的出口。包括<i>《经济学人》</i>在内的许多人警告称，全球粮食短缺迫在眉睫。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管黑海局势升级的风险越来越大，但农产品市场现在平静得多。目前小麦的价格略高于每蒲式耳 5 美元，低于战争开始前的价格。事实上，价格在 2022 年夏季回落至战前水平，并一直保持在该水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这与其说是因为<small>联合国</small>恢复乌克兰粮食出口的协议，不如说是因为其他地方的丰收。农业不受西方制裁的俄罗斯在2022年收获了前所未有的1亿吨小麦。从巴西到印度，其他国家也获得了丰收。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今年看起来也很相似。由于谷物协议的废除，乌克兰的小麦产量比战前减少，其出口也大幅下降。但俄罗斯再次获得丰收，许多其他出口国也是如此。荷兰合作银行的卡洛斯·梅拉指出，去年农作物受到拉尼娜现象的威胁，拉尼娜现象是一种经常导致北半球大片谷物种植区减产的气候现象，而今年，相反的厄尔尼诺现象则预示着更多的农作物产量将下降。良性条件。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对黑海商业航运的袭击无疑会导致价格再次飙升。保险公司会提高费率或根本拒绝承保货物。粮食并不是唯一的受害者：每天通过黑海出口约 200 万桶石油和另外 100 万桶精炼石油产品。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但影响可能再次是短暂的。俄罗斯政府已经为许多停靠其港口的油轮投保，以帮助航运公司逃避西方制裁。对于其他出口也可以起到同样的作用。船舶跟踪公司 Kpler 的马修·赖特 (Matthew Wright) 表示，尽管紧张局势不断升级，受到西方压力，许多航运公司仍愿意运输俄罗斯货物。更重要的是，俄罗斯拥有非常密集的石油管道网络。它可能会将通常穿过黑海运输到波罗的海码头的大部分石油转移。 （精炼后的产品将更难以这种方式移动。）</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">战争与豌豆</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">通过公路将粮食从俄罗斯西部的农业中心地带运输到遥远的圣彼得堡、波罗的海或太平洋的码头将是缓慢且昂贵的。 （乌克兰已经很难在较短的距离内运输小得多的货物。）但俄罗斯在黑海和毗邻的亚速海拥有几个谷物码头，因此它可以利用不断变化的港口和航线来阻止货物进入俄罗斯。害之道。鉴于俄罗斯尽管拥有极其优越的海军和空军力量，但仍难以阻止乌克兰的粮食出口，因此很难想象乌克兰会扼杀俄罗斯的贸易。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">出于所有这些原因，咨询公司 Rystad Energy 的维克托·库里洛夫 (Viktor Kurilov) 认为，对商业航运的攻击可能会导致原油价格每桶仅上涨 5-7 美元，然后会比原本的价格上涨 1-2 美元。小麦市场可能会受到更严重的冲击，至少在一段时间内是这样。这并非没有痛苦：据<small>联合国</small>计算，去年粮食价格的短暂上涨导致全球面临严重饥饿的人数增加了 6500 万。但持久的灾难不太可能发生。 </p><div

e190yofl0">所有这一切的一个关键变量是土耳其的立场，土耳其实际上是黑海的看门人。根据一项名为《蒙特勒公约》的条约，土耳其有义务让商业航运不受阻碍地通过博斯普鲁斯海峡和达达尼尔海峡，这两个海峡是连接黑海和地中海的狭窄海峡。但该条约对过境军舰的数量和规模进行了限制。当黑海爆发战争时，土耳其有权阻止交战方派遣增援部队，并对非沿岸国家的军舰完全关闭该海峡。因此，当俄罗斯入侵乌克兰时，它禁止俄罗斯增援其黑海舰队，同时也阻止<small>北约</small>国家派遣舰艇，尽管它们本身也是北约成员国。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着粮食协议的破裂，土耳其面临着帮助阻止俄罗斯扼杀乌克兰贸易的压力。保加利亚和罗马尼亚这两个拥有黑海海岸线但海军实力相对较弱的<small>北约</small>成员国将欢迎联盟展示武力。一些乌克兰人呼吁西方海军护航队保护商业航运。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但土耳其不愿意允许任何增加更大范围战火风险并激怒俄罗斯的事情。通过骑墙观望，土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安赢得了俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京的宝贵让步。俄罗斯允许土耳其推迟支付俄罗斯天然气的部分款项，价值可能达数十亿美元，这一举措帮助埃尔多安在今年早些时候的选举前掩盖了其经济管理不善的规模。土耳其拒绝与其他<small>北约</small>成员国一起对俄罗斯实施严厉制裁也是有利可图的：去年两国之间的贸易额几乎翻了一番，达到 620 亿美元。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些分析人士怀疑，普京还向埃尔多安承诺，当土耳其的主要地区盟友阿塞拜疆于九月底从亚美尼亚叛军手中夺取了对一个有争议省份的控制权时，派去执行停火的俄罗斯军队将袖手旁观。 “土耳其正在利用俄罗斯的弱点来获取让步，”博斯普鲁斯观察家咨询公司的负责人约鲁克·伊西克(Yoruk Isik)表示。他补充道：“只要继续获得它们，只要与俄罗斯的贸易继续下去，土耳其就会尽力不与俄罗斯对抗。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">俄罗斯同样不愿意破坏现状。如果俄罗斯攻击商业航运，埃尔多安允许<small>北约</small>船只进入黑海的压力将急剧增加。一种阻碍普京的想法可能是将埃尔多安推向不太宽松的境地。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这只是海上战争中双方都不可能完全获胜的另一种方式。乌克兰无人机将继续让俄罗斯难堪，但俄罗斯海军仍将对乌克兰城市和航运构成威胁。 <small>RUSI</small>的考沙尔先生认为，俄罗斯可能会将保险费推高，“无论乌克兰人会让塞瓦斯托波尔感到多么不舒服”。尽管海战永远不会成为战斗的主要焦点，但对令人震惊的爆发的担忧将永远挥之不去。

用户的工作世界。这将使微软能够吸引新客户并向他们收取更高的费用。反过来，这可能会推动微软高利润云业务 Azure 的业务发展，并可能帮助其超越亚马逊网络服务 ( <small>AWS</small> )，成为全球最大的云公司。它甚至可能帮助微软的估值高于当前的 2.3 万亿美元，从而有可能缩小与目前全球市值最高公司苹果公司的差距（见图 1）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伯恩斯坦经纪人马克·莫尔德勒 (Mark Moerdler) 认为，事实上，<small>人工智能</small>为微软提供了一个诱人的机会，可以做一些迄今为止一直未能实现的事情，并将其提供的所有功能整合在一起。微软的视频会议服务 Teams 可能比竞争对手 Zoom 对<small>IT</small>经理更有吸引力，因为它配备了一个 Copilot，可以在 Outlook 中对员工的电子邮件进行分类，并从他们的 Word 文档和 PowerPoint 中调出信息。所有这些魔法也可以通过 Azure 传递，进一步推动微软的业务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，微软还是下了一场豪赌。明年其资本支出预计将增加近五分之二，达到约 400 亿美元。这占该公司收入的 16% 接近创纪录的水平，比除 Facebook 母公司 Meta 之外的任何其他科技巨头都要高。其中大部分将用于新的<small>人工智能</small>芯片和高性能网络，以进入其计划上线的 120 多个额外数据中心。这样的投资是否会带来回报是一个悬而未决的问题。尽管副驾驶做出了所有承诺，但他们仍然面临很多问题。在雷德蒙德的演示中，<small>人工智能</small>生成的幻灯片将您的通讯员描述为“ <small>ABC</small>公司的<small>首席执行官</small>”，但他绝对不是。竞争对手，尤其是 Alphabet（谷歌的母公司），正在关注所有相同的市场。随着未来工作之争的白热化，微软的地位令人羡慕，但并非无懈可击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">将自己置于这个位置是经过长期努力的。微软的全盛时期是 20 世纪 90 年代。 Windows 作为操作系统的主导地位与残酷的商业心态相结合，使该公司变得强大但遭到全面鄙视。随后经历了一段停滞期，因为它依靠 Windows 的收入生存。 2014 年萨蒂亚·纳德拉 (Satya Nadella) 上任后，他彻底改变了现状。 Windows 将不再是公司的主要关注点。相反，该公司围绕 Azure 进行了重组，将 Office 等热门项目转向云。这涉及到数据中心的大规模扩建。微软的资本支出占收入的比例从 2014 年的 6% 上升到五年后的 11%。至关重要的是，该公司放弃了围墙花园的做法。纳德拉允许微软的软件在其他操作系统上运行，例如谷歌、苹果和Linux（Windows的开源竞争对手）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，微软也在投资<small>人工智能</small>。它于 2016 年首次宣布与 Open <small>AI</small>合作；此后，该公司已投资 130 亿美元，据报道持有 49% 的股份。该交易不仅允许微软使用Open <small>AI</small>的技术，还规定Open <small>AI</small>的模型和工具在Azure上运行，实际上使Open <small>AI</small>的客户成为微软的间接客户。这不仅仅是开放<small>人工智能</small>。自纳德拉接任以来，微软已经收购了 15 家<small>人工智能</small>相关公司。其中包括在 2022 年斥资 200 亿美元收购拥有尖端语音转文本技术的医疗保健公司 Nuance。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如今，微软的业务增长依赖于三个部门。第一个是蔚蓝。在过去的五年里，它一直在逼近<small>AWS</small> （见图 2）。随着<small>IT</small>经理紧缩开支，云支出正在放缓。尽管如此，最近一个季度的业务同比增长了27%。微软没有透露Azure的销售额，但分析师认为它约占该公司收入的四分之一，去年该公司收入达到2120亿美元。其云业务的毛利率也是秘密，但伯恩斯坦认为其高达 60% 左右。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次是 Microsoft 365，它也占收入的约四分之一。由于小型企业，尤其是餐馆等服务行业的采用，这一数字最近每年增长约 10%。第三个增长源是网络安全。微软高管在财报电话会议上表示，该公司的收入约为 200 亿美元（约占总收入的十分之一）。这比仅提供网络安全的五家最大公司的收入总和还要多。更重要的是，收入每年增长约 30%。 （微软的视频游戏部门每年带来 150 亿美元的收入，现在英国反垄断监管机构已表示将批准以 690 亿美元收购另一家游戏制造商动视暴雪 (Activision Blizzard) 的交易，该交易拖延已久。）</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">蓝色微调器</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">使用Azure作为微软其他业务的底层基础设施有助于分摊成本、简化运营并提高利润。自 2014 年以来，营业利润率从 29% 上升至 43%，高于其他科技巨头（见图 3）。这让投资者兴奋不已。在纳德拉先生任职期间，微软的市值增长了约 2 万美元。微软的市盈率（反映投资者对未来利润的预期）在<small>纳德拉</small>执政期间增长了一倍多，达到 32。该比率高于<small>标准普尔</small>500 指数的平均水平，也高于除亚马逊之外的所有科技巨头。该公司的数字因其微薄的收入而受到扭曲。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">啦啦队人士表示，微软在生成<small>人工智能</small>方面有两大优势。首先是它销售的软件范围。要求单个聊天机器人仔细阅读电子邮件和电子表格以制作幻灯片放映比为每个程序处理不同的<small>人工智能</small>助手要容易得多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次，微软具有先发优势。由于与 Chat <small>GPT 的</small>合作，该公司部署<small>人工智能的</small>速度比竞争对手更快，也可能是因为纳德拉认为该公司对智能手机和云的反应缓慢。无论出于何种原因，微软的速度已经使开放<small>人工智能</small>成为尝试该技术的大公司的默认选择。摩根大通银行最近对<small>IT</small>经理进行的一项调查发现，未来三年他们预计 56% 的生成式<small>AI</small>支出将流向微软，而<small>AWS</small>的这一比例为 13%，谷歌云平台 ( <small>GCP</small> ) 的比例为 12% 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">风险投资公司红杉资本对其投资的 33 家初创公司进行的另一项调查发现，其中 90% 使用 Open <small>AI</small> 。摩根士丹利银行的 Keith Weiss 认为，围绕 Open <small>AI</small>的<small>GPT</small> -4 模型的生态系统正在开始形成。其中包括专门研究其工具并推荐客户使用这些工具的顾问，以及 HubSpot 等软件销售商，它们使用 Open <small>AI</small>的模型构建定制程序。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">有一些证据表明 Copilots 可以帮助巩固微软的领先地位。 2022 年 6 月，它在 GitHub 上推出了代码生成 Copilot，这是微软在 2018 年以 75 亿美元收购的代码存储库。该模型是使用 GitHub 上存储的大量代码进行训练的。它已迅速成为软件开发人员的必备工具。在一项调查中，90% 的用户告诉 GitHub，Copilot 提高了他们的工作效率。该公司还进行了一项小型研究，发现使用该工具时，程序员完成任务的速度提高了 55%。约有 27,000 家企业订阅了该服务，数量是三个月前的两倍。它在科技圈如此流行，以至于“副驾驶”一词已成为<small>人工智能</small>助手的简写，无论是否由微软提供。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">微软表示，测试 Copilot 的“生产力”软件（即电子邮件、电子表格、文字处理等）的公司也报告了类似的好处。电信公司 Lumen 的老板凯特·约翰逊 (Kate Johnson) 将其描述为员工工作方式的“阶跃功能变化”。她用它来回顾 Teams 会议，看看是否给安静的员工提供了发言的机会。它还可以即时记录并为与会者制定待办事项列表。约翰逊女士补充道，这有助于问责制：员工在上次会议后要完成的任务“就在那里，让每个人都可以看到”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">例如，副驾驶还可以充当软件教练，教员工如何在电子表格中插入图表。目标是他们最终能够了解用户的偏好，甚至他们的写作风格。纳德拉在 2017 年出版的《Hit Refresh》一书中写道：“我们希望有一天能够提供一个高效的另一个自我——一个深入了解你的代理人。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">所有这一切并不便宜。按照每位用户每月 30 美元的价格，Copilots 可能意味着 52-83% 的加价，具体取决于公司使用的软件包。研究公司 Gartner 的杰森·黄 (Jason Wong) 表示：“与许可证相比，这很昂贵，但如果每周可以节省您的时间，那么价格就便宜了。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">微软从 Copilots 赚钱的另一种方式是通过底层基础设施。 5 月份，它宣布在 Azure 上推出“Copilot Stack”。这使得开发人员可以轻松地在自己的应用程序中构建 Copilots 或为 Microsoft 的 Copilots 创建“插件”。希望许多公司使用此基础设施，向 Azure 发送更多业务。这种“平台”方法的另一个优点是，微软可能能够达成交易，使用 Azure 客户的数据，将法律专业知识引入 Word 文档或电子邮件中。伯恩斯坦的一份研究报告认为，这创造了一种“竞争对手将很难或不可能复制”的优势。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">锤头鲨</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今年第二季度，<small>人工智能</small>为微软的云收入增加了约 1.2 亿美元。预计本季度将翻一番。 Weiss 估计，到 2025 年，<small>人工智能</small>可以使收入增加 400 亿美元，这主要是通过 Azure 的<small>人工智能</small>工具和 365 的 Copilots 实现的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这样的增长并不便宜。股票市场分析师公司 New Street Research 认为，微软是全球最大的<small>人工智能</small>芯片销售商英伟达的最大客户。其研究表明，微软在 2023 年第二季度在 Nvidia 的<small>AI</small>芯片上花费了约 30 亿美元，高于第一季度的约 10 亿美元。在 7 月份与投资者的电话会议中，首席财务官艾米·胡德 (Amy Hood) 指出，<small>人工智能</small>的发展正在给微软云计算领域的浮夸利润带来压力。她说，这可以通过更高效的数据处理来抵消。微软云和<small>人工智能</small>主管斯科特·格思里 (Scott Guthrie) 表示：“我们看到推理成本（与向<small>人工智能</small>模型提出问题相关的成本）正在下降，并期望看到这种情况继续下去，模型变得更加准确和高效。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使不断上升的成本得到控制，仍然存在许多其他风险。竞争已经白热化。一场争夺价值 3400 亿美元的商业软件市场的战争。 5 月，谷歌发布了 Duet for Workspace，它的 Copilots 版本。上周，该公司发布了允许其聊天机器人 Bard 访问用户 Gmail 收件箱和 Google 文档的功能。软件巨头Salesforce拥有爱因斯坦。 Slack 是一款消息应用程序，也是 Salesforce 的子公司之一，拥有 Slack <small>GPT</small> 。 ServiceNow 的软件可以帮助公司管理他们的工作流程，它有 Now Assist。 Zoom 提供 Zoom Companion。 Intuit 正在销售 Intuit Assist。 Adept 和 Cohere 等初创公司也提供<small>人工智能</small>助手。 Open <small>AI</small>于 8 月推出了面向企业的 Chat <small>GPT</small> 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">提供支撑此类<small>人工智能</small>产品的基础设施将是另一个战场。 <small>AWS</small>和<small>GCP</small>都提供对类似于 Open <small>AI</small>的<small>AI</small>模型的访问。分析师怀疑这些竞争对手在部署专业<small>人工智能</small>芯片方面比微软拥有更多经验。八月，谷歌推出了一款用于训练大型模型的新型<small>人工智能</small>芯片。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t

Rowe Price 的 Ken Allen 表示，包括 Copilots 在内的所有生成式<small>人工智能</small>工具都必须“为企业做好准备”。其中一个问题是合法的。大多数<small>人工智能</small>模型都是根据受版权保护的材料进行训练的，用户可能会无意中复制这些材料。一家大型石油和天然气服务公司的<small>IT</small>负责人表示，在公司于 11 月份因侵犯版权而被起诉后，他阻止员工使用 GitHub 的 Copilot。微软方面已同意支付客户与其副驾驶相关的法律费用，前提是他们使用微软的安全功能，例如内容过滤器。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">模型也可能出错。微软通过对他们进行准确、最新信息的培训以及增加引用来减少此类问题。但这并不妨碍<small>本报记者晋升为首席执行官</small>。负责微软生产力软件的 Jared Spataro 表示，Copilots 带来了一种“全新的工作方式”，机器可以帮助你生产更多的东西，“但它并不总是正确的”。人类必须对此保持警惕，并在必要时进行纠正。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第三个问题是数据治理——确保只有合适的员工才能访问正确的信息。一位分析师指出，Copilots 的一些早期用户发现了“非常可怕”的结果。想象一下，在搜索中会出现人事文件或机密电子邮件。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">几乎可以肯定的是，微软将被指控滥用其市场力量。 （在 20 世纪 90 年代末期，无休止的竞争问题一直困扰着它之前的崛起时期。）该公司已经在许多方面展开了斗争。 8 月，在 Slack 的投诉引发<small>欧盟</small>调查后，该公司宣布将从其软件包中“分拆”Teams。客户还抱怨微软的软件许可证促使公司使用 Azure，而不是<small>AWS</small>和<small>GCP</small> 。微软总裁布拉德史密斯称这是“合理的担忧”，该公司表示已经做出了改变。但今年 6 月，谷歌向美国联邦贸易委员会的调查提交了评论，声称微软使用不公平的许可条款来“锁定客户”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着<small>人工智能</small>驱动的软件变得普遍，这些类型的争议无疑将会加剧。例如，如果 Windows Copilot 将用户引导至 Outlook 而不是 Gmail，那么反垄断者可能会大喊大叫。这样做的结果可能会削弱微软利用广泛的软件产品使副驾驶变得更有用的能力，而这正是微软的一大竞争优势。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即便如此，微软仍处于强势地位。它未能抓住智能手机的出现，也未能及时抓住云的潜力。如今，它发现自己已准备好利用一项可以改变工作世界的技术。它必须保持微妙的平衡，比竞争对手更快地行动，同时确保其在<small>人工智能</small>领域的进步不会扰乱监管机构、削弱利润或激怒客户。如果它下滑，许多竞争对手已经准备好取代它。但如果成功的话，回报将是巨大的。副驾驶将成为其命运的船长。

class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们最近对<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的更多报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>终点</span><small>不断</small>后退。曾经有一段时间，一些乌克兰官员将俄罗斯军队停在基辅郊外，认为只需要几个月就能结束战争。军事情报部门负责人凯里洛·布达诺夫中将在 2022 年 5 月预测，“大部分积极的战斗行动将在今年年底完成”。去年 11 月，在乌克兰对哈尔科夫发动大规模攻势后不久，弗拉基米尔·哈夫雷洛夫 (Volodymyr Havrylov)时任国防部副部长的他仍然期待着能够迅速取得胜利。 “我的感觉是，到春天结束时，这场战争就会结束。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，乌克兰的反攻直到6月份才开始。它非但没有加速战争的结束，反而证明了战斗可能会持续多久。乌克兰军队受到俄罗斯雷区和其他防御工事的阻碍，正在步行缓慢前进。储备物资和西方先进武器的部署尚未取得任何重大突破。潮湿的天气和弹药短缺可能会导致乌克兰的进攻在十月下旬甚至更早之前停止。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">又一个战斗季节即将到来。<small>北约</small>秘书长延斯·斯托尔滕贝格 9 月 17 日警告说：“我们必须为乌克兰的长期战争做好准备。”美国最高将领马克·米利当天同意说：“从军事上将 20 万以上的俄罗斯军队逐出俄罗斯占领的乌克兰需要相当长的时间。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">正如美国总统乔·拜登今年多次表示的那样，美国坚称“只要需要”，就会坚持到底。英国、法国、德国和其他盟国都使用了同样的短语。尽管这些承诺听起来铁一般，但它们取决于两个不确定的变量。一是西方有能力为乌克兰军队提供足够的武器弹药。另一个是继续移交他们的政治意愿。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从第一个开始。俄罗斯经济专家理查德·康诺利 (Richard Connolly) 表示，俄罗斯国防工业在 2022 年最后一个季度进入了战备状态，并指出钢铁产量大幅跃升。英国官员表示，俄罗斯现在每年可以生产约200辆坦克，是他们之前假设的两倍。康诺利表示，包括翻新坦克在内，真实数字可能是 500 到 800 辆。他补充说，西方制裁并没有对产量造成太大影响，因为半导体等关键零部件是通过香港或中亚走私进来的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">原则上，乌克兰的朋友应该可以毫不费力地帮助它打败俄罗斯。即使考虑到俄罗斯较低的物价，<small>北约</small>成员国的<small>GDP</small>总和也是俄罗斯的 12 倍。不同的是，俄罗斯愿意在战争上投入更多资金：军费开支现在几乎占国家预算的40%，远远超过西方水平。<small>北约</small>国家正试图通过投资武器生产来纠正这种不平衡，而自冷战结束以来，武器生产一直被忽视。但有两个障碍。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一是成本。爱沙尼亚国防部高级公务员库斯蒂·萨​​尔姆 (Kusti Salm) 表示，爱沙尼亚每枚新炮弹的花费约为 5,000 至 6,000 美元。他指出，按照<small>北约</small>标准，这相对便宜。他说，俄罗斯花费了 60,000 卢布，约合 620 美元。巨大的差异很大程度上归因于廉价的劳动力和材料、较低质量的产品以及武器制造商较低的利润率，其中大部分是国有的。通货膨胀正在加剧这一问题。 “装备和弹药的价格正在飙升，”北约大佬、<small>海军上将</small>罗布·鲍尔 (Rob Bauer) 9 月 16 日抱怨道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个问题是时机。 “在缓慢的起步之后，”康诺利先生说，“俄罗斯队已经达到了比赛的速度，他们现在已经准备好了。他们现在将开始以接近他们需要的速度生产产品。”美国和欧洲对新产能的投资起步较晚，直到 2024 年下半年或 2025 年才会产生太多额外供应，这让俄罗斯有更多时间动员、建立新的防御设施并牵制乌克兰军队。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以炮弹为例。好消息是美国和欧洲的产量正在飙升。美国官员表示，他们自己的年产量已从春季的 168,000 枚炮弹增至今天的 336,000 枚。由于新设施和现有设施的更密集使用，这一数字将继续上升。爱沙尼亚国防部长表示，到今年年底或明年初，欧洲产量将翻一番。明年，美国和欧洲将轻松生产近 200 万枚炮弹。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">炮弹冲击</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题是，这还不足以跟上。据英国估计，俄罗斯明年将生产100万至200万枚炮弹。除此之外，还有大约 500 万枚新的和翻新的炮弹库存。萨尔姆先生说，这应该允许它一年内每天至少发射 15,000 发子弹。据知情人士透露，这与乌克兰反攻期间增加的消费量大致相当。但乌克兰可能只能再维持几个月。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这一差距可以通过从其他地方借款来弥补。乌克兰的反攻得益于韩国大量炮弹的输送。美国及其盟国代表乌克兰谨慎地从埃及和巴基斯坦等不结盟国家购买武器弹药。但这种现成的武器资源正在耗尽。西方军队的库存也已经耗尽。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着西方军火工业的发展，这个问题应该会得到缓解。一位西方官员表示，到 2025 年，贝壳甚至可能出现“过剩”。如果大部分新产出流向乌克兰，并且假设中国和朝鲜都不救助俄罗斯，那么乌克兰军队可能会在冲突中首次击败俄罗斯军队。但 2025 年在军事上相当于一生的遥远距离。与此同时，明年乌克兰可能很难发动大规模攻势。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">就政治而言，后年也是一生的时间。在欧洲，政治风向似乎对乌克兰有利。 6月和7月进行的民意调查显示，64％的欧洲人赞成对乌克兰提供军事援助，不仅在瑞典等长期怀疑俄罗斯的国家（93％）中得到强烈支持，而且在距离较远的成员国中也得到大力支持，例如瑞典（93％）。如葡萄牙（90%）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些极右翼政党，例如玛丽娜·勒庞领导的法国国民联盟和德国另类选择党（ <small>AfD</small> <small>）</small> ，将这场冲突视为对欧洲资源的浪费。 “德国公众为这场战争付出了三倍的代价，”柏林地区议会的<small>AfD</small>成员 Gunnar Lindemann 抱怨道，“支持 100 万难民<small>，</small>承担巨额能源费用并向乌克兰运送武器。”两党的民调支持率都在上升，但距离执政还很远。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">德国总理奥拉夫·肖尔茨一直关注反战情绪，尤其是他自己的社会民主党内部的反战情绪。在同意向乌克兰派遣豹式坦克之前，他犹豫了几个月。尽管英国和法国已经向乌克兰提供了类似的武器，但他仍然拒绝发射远程金牛座导弹。然而，肖尔茨先生现在已经意识到，公众的怀疑情绪是很模糊的：一旦他发射了一种新武器，就会得到广泛的认可。 9 月 18 日，他的政府宣布再提供 4 亿欧元（4.29 亿美元）的武器，包括弹药、装甲车和扫雷设备。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙(Emmanuel Macron)去年因频繁与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)通话以及在派遣武器方面犹豫不决而在基辅引发了抱怨，但现在他已成为最热情的欧洲领导人之一。法国长期以来一直抵制<small>欧盟</small>扩张，但马克龙却成为乌克兰加入欧盟的热心支持者。 7月份的一项民意调查显示，58%的法国人支持这一做法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰申请加入<small>欧盟的</small>进展速度几年前还会让欧洲观察人士感到惊讶。它于 2022 年 6 月正式成为候选国。今年 12 月，除非出现意外，否则将通过启动详细的入盟谈判来提升其地位。乌克兰在必要改革方面取得的迅速进展令<small>欧盟</small>官员眼花缭乱。乌克兰可能还需要数年时间才能成为正式成员，但战争似乎正在加速而不是推迟这一进程。

edweubf0">现在国会要加入</span><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：E​​PA</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，在美国，前景的分歧和不确定性要大得多。 8 月 10 日，白宫要求国会批准为乌克兰再提供 240 亿美元的“补充”预算，这将使迄今为止美国的援助总额达到 1,350 亿美元。民主党和共和党中此类援助的支持者在国会两院均占明显多数。如果对该请求进行简单的赞成或反对投票，那么它将相对容易地获得批准。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但由于美国政治功能失调，这种情况不太可能发生。众议院多数议员可能支持乌克兰，但少数共和党人持有极端反乌克兰观点，其中包括提议邀请俄罗斯加入<small>北约的</small>马特·盖茨、以及曾提出邀请俄罗斯加入北约的阴谋论者马乔里·泰勒·格林等。宣扬了一种荒谬的观念，即对乌克兰的援助实际上被民主党的捐助者抽走了。由于共和党在众议院仅占微弱多数，而且议长凯文·麦卡锡不想依靠民主党选票来推动立法通过，亲俄边缘派的影响力比其数字所暗示的要大得多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">麦卡锡最有可能的做法是将补充​​预算附加到其他重要立法中，从而使其更难脱轨。众议院过去拒绝资助乌克兰的努力已经被克服，尽管每一项都吸引了更多的共和党选票。拜登已获得国会批准，从现有库存中再向乌克兰运送价值 60 亿美元的武器。但此后可能会推迟几个月，因为国会会扭曲自己的最新要求。出现的可能是点点滴滴的援助，而不是去年的大笔援助。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从长远来看，对乌克兰的援助正迅速成为一个党派问题，这使得其前景变得更加不确定。共和党选民在共和党明年最有可能的总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)的怀疑态度的怂恿下，开始质疑对乌克兰的进一步援助。民主党人仍然普遍支持。庞大的预算赤字和高利率使得各方政客不愿增加债务。甚至民主党人也支持这样的观点，即美国的欧洲盟友应该在自己边境的冲突中采取主动。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">此外，特朗普还有可能赢得明年的大选。他对乌克兰的政策一贯缺乏连贯性。今年三月，他承诺在就职之前“不超过一天”内解决战争。 “我们自己没有弹药，”他在五月份抱怨道，“我们放弃了太多。”但他否认自己会推动一项允许普京保留乌克兰领土的协议。 “没有人比我对俄罗斯更强硬，”他本周表示，并坚称他将达成“对每个人都公平的协议”。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，西方官员担心普京会等到特朗普是否再次当选总统后才同意谈判。这种情况已经在欧洲引发了激烈的争论。两位俄罗斯问题专家利亚纳·菲克斯和迈克尔·金马奇最近在<i>《外交事务》杂志</i>上表示，“如果美国试图通过谈判强行解决乌克兰问题，欧洲人几乎没有能力抵抗。”其他人则说这是过度的宿命论。法国官员认为，如果美国终止对乌克兰的支持，尽管欧洲无法取代美国的军事援助，但谨慎而理性的做法是，欧洲应该通过促进武器制造来保留自己的选择。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题是欧洲是否能够单独筹措足够的现金和武器来维持乌克兰的运转。尽管美国在战争的大部分时间里提供了大部分援助，但德国智库基尔世界经济研究所的最新分析发现，这种模式已经发生了逆转。欧洲人长期以来一直提供更多的财政援助。他们现在正在提供更多各种援助，部分归功于<small>欧盟</small>最近承诺提供 500 亿欧元，这是一项持续到 2027 年的多年承诺（见图表）。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">金钱不是一切</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，这些数字并不能说明全部情况。美国一直是盟军支持乌克兰的支点，在美国驻德国拉姆施泰因军事基地主持定期会议，承诺捐赠武器并进行协调。它为其他国家的援助提供了外交掩护：例如，肖尔茨先生坚称，除非拜登先生首先派遣一些美国<small>M</small> 1 <small>A</small> 1艾布拉姆斯坦克，否则他不会允许将德国制造的豹式坦克运送到乌克兰。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在某些情况下，欧洲人向乌克兰运送武器是因为他们将收到美国的新武器来取代捐赠的武器。美国以核武器为保障的安全保证让欧洲人有信心抵御俄罗斯的威胁。最后，美国提供了重要情报，帮助乌克兰发现并摧毁从将军到军舰等高价值目标。取代这种组织和援助将是一项艰巨的任务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这可能是不可避免的。 “西方的假设是——我想每个人都没有明言这一点——是我们为他们提供我们所能提供的一切，然后他们将继续发动大规模攻势，无论最终发生什么，我们都会满足于此， ”爱沙尼亚官员萨尔姆先生说道。 “这就是计划。”他建议，需要一种新的制裁，不仅涉及更多的武器，还涉及更多的技术，以抵消俄罗斯在大规模、更大胆的制裁方面的优势，例如取消巴黎奥运会的参赛资格，以及从夏季错误中吸取教训的新训练。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最重要的是，需要改变心态。 “这正是消耗战的意义所在：让西方相信我们可以比你们更受苦，我们可以比你们战斗，我们可以比你们更持久。他们知道民主国家的弱点，”萨尔姆先生说。他认为，任务是让普京相信事实恰恰相反。 “作为拉姆施泰因联盟，我们比俄罗斯富裕、强大、技术先进 25 倍……这并不是说我们口袋空空。” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

“这就是我们为之奋斗的目标。我只是希望人们在整个乌克兰领土上过上正常的生活，”他说。关键是“整体”：乌克兰的反攻尚未产生他和其他人所希望的结果。俄罗斯防线并未崩溃。乌克兰近五分之一的领土仍然掌握在俄罗斯手中。在即将到来的消耗战中，尚不清楚哪一方更有持久力。当然，这在一定程度上取决于第二个不确定性：随着战争的继续，乌克兰盟友提供的<a

的人相信这一点。俄罗斯独裁者弗拉基米尔·普京并不关心自己军队的生命，而乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基领导的民主社会则关心自己军队的生命。 “这不仅仅是[不惜一切代价]解除占领。这是关于解除占领，但不是失去很多人的生命，”他最近告诉<i>《经济学人》</i> 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">斗争减弱的前景已经开始渗透到泽连斯基的讲话中。 “我们需要学会忍受[冲突]，”他最近告诉乌克兰人。 “这取决于什么样的战争。我们准备继续战斗很长一段时间……[同时]尽量减少伤亡人数。例如在以色列。我们可以这样生活。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，一场持久战需要在军事规划、经济和更广泛的社会方面做出重大改变。战争初期英勇的即兴发挥和权力下放已不再足够。在军事方面，泽伦斯基先生通过任命新的国防部长鲁斯泰姆·乌梅罗夫（Rustem Umerov）开始了明显的转变。和几乎所有乌克兰人一样，作为一名克里米亚鞑靼人，自俄罗斯 2014 年吞并克里米亚以来，克里米亚鞑靼人这个族群因同情乌克兰人而受到迫害，这场战争与他个人息息相关。但是，他说，“乌克兰与情感无关，而是与系统、物流和工业。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 41岁的前企业家和投资者乌梅罗夫表示，他的使命是建设乌克兰国防工业及其士兵的能力，以便西方盟友将乌克兰视为合作伙伴，而不是总是乞求援助的依赖者。 ，有能力塑造自己的命运。他之前的工作是管理政府的房地产投资组合，他希望为新角色带来高效的管理思维。必须消除繁文缛节。 “任何可以数字化的东西都需要数字化，”他说。他并不害怕掀起波澜：上任两周后，他更换了七名副手中的六名。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">爆炸性的遗产</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当乌克兰还是苏联的一部分时，它拥有庞大的国防工业。大约 150 万乌克兰人在 700 家军工企业工作，其中包括 205 家工厂和 130 家研发中心。乌克兰第二任总统列昂尼德·库奇马在苏联时期在第聂伯罗市经营着世界上最大的火箭工厂。哈尔科夫的一家旗舰工厂每年生产 900 辆坦克。但 1991 年苏联解体后，腐败和忽视逐渐扼杀了这些企业。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">现在乌克兰几乎从头开始重建其军火工业。 “任何可以本地生产的东西都必须本地生产，”乌梅罗夫先生坚称。其中一部分涉及国有企业改革，这是前投资银行家亚历山大·卡梅辛 (Oleksandr Kamyshin) 的工作，他曾经营国有铁路公司，追随西方管理潮流。 “战争的前一百天是关于勇敢的。接下来的 1000 天将是钢铁般的日子，”他宣称。六月，即他上任三个月后，乌克兰生产的炮弹数量与去年全年一样多。 Kamyshin 先生表示，7 月份这一数字达到了两倍。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌梅罗夫希望鼓励私营军火制造商，这些制造商仅占当地工业的20-30%。他说，如果当地公司能够证明自己有能力制造有用的工具包，他准备提前向他们付款。许多人都因缺乏有能力的管理人员而苦苦挣扎：国防部正在提出帮助将这些人从前线召回。 Kamyshin 先生预测，五年内，私营企业将生产当地 80% 的产出。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中一个焦点是无人机。乌克兰的此类产品产量呈指数级增长，尽管基数很小。 “我们将生产比去年多 120 到 150 倍的无人机，”负责协调这项工作的 32 岁数字化转型部长米哈伊洛·费多罗夫 (Mykhailo Fedorov) 说道。从事该行业的本地公司数量已从 12 月的 7 家增加到目前的 70 家，其中绝大多数是私营公司。为了鼓励这种增长，政府取消了进口零部件的关税，并以允许利润高达 25% 的价格购买无人机。 “我们可以在技术战争中获胜，”费多罗夫先生说。 “我们正在从经济规模大、自由度较高的国家获得帮助。技术喜欢自由，也喜欢移动性。我们两者都有。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">卡梅辛先生希望西方军事承包商也开始本地化生产。英国<small>BAE</small>系统公司是一家为乌克兰生产大量武器的英国国防公司，该公司在当地设立了一家子公司，希望生产在前线广泛使用的<small>L</small> 119和<small>M</small> 777榴弹炮。德国最大的武器制造商莱茵金属公司已经在乌克兰修理豹式坦克，并计划很快开设一家装甲车工厂。正如其<small>首席执行官</small>阿明·帕珀格 (Armin Papperger) 告诉<small>CNN 的</small>那样，“[乌克兰人]必须自助。如果他们总是不得不等待欧洲人或美国人在未来十年或二十年里帮助他们……那是不可能的。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">保护这些工厂免受俄罗斯的攻击需要独创性。卡梅辛先生表示：“我们不会拥有一座苏联式的巨型工厂，而是会在全国各地分布许多小型工厂。”无人机证明了一切皆有可能：费多罗夫表示，乌克兰侦察设备产量激增，有助于其与俄罗斯军队平起平坐。能够击中克里米亚和俄罗斯腹地目标的远程导弹的产量也在增长。 “这是一个重要的历史时刻，”他说，“当我们不仅仅是接受援助并希望[援助不会耗尽]，而是当我们将自己的生活掌握在自己手中并开始形成我们自己的能力。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰不断发展的无人机产业也使其武装部队能够采取新的战术，将战争带入俄罗斯境内。目标之一是打击军工厂，以扰乱整个供应链。最近的例子包括对生产十氢化萘（火箭必需的燃料添加剂）的设施以及为“匕首”和“伊斯坎德尔”导弹制造电路的工厂的攻击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个目标是心理上的：打破克里姆林宫试图维持的常态的表象，特别是在莫斯科等大城市。最近几周，由于无人机袭击该市，那里的机场几乎每天都不得不短暂暂停航班。 （卡梅辛先生说他想开一家商店，出售印有“莫斯科不夜城”口号的<small>T</small>恤。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰对俄罗斯基础设施的袭击还有第三个目标：阻止俄罗斯对其自身基础设施的袭击。自从俄罗斯7月退出允许乌克兰黑海港口出口谷物的协议以来，它一直在轰炸这些航线和其他出口航线，并威胁停靠乌克兰港口的船只。乌克兰的出口因此减少了一半，对本已陷入困境的经济造成了更大的损害。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰正试图打破俄罗斯的封锁。上个月，它开辟了一条新的海上航线，紧邻黑海西海岸，靠近罗马尼亚和保加利亚。如果乌克兰能够保护它，它的出口可能会增加到战前水平的70%左右。 9月17日，两艘船停靠在敖德萨附近的切尔诺莫斯克港，装载近2万吨小麦。几小时后，俄罗斯向附近其他港口发射了一系列无人机和导弹。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">翻天覆地的变化</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰战略家希望，如果他们能够威胁黑海的俄罗斯港口并打击对乌克兰港口发动袭击的军事基地，他们也许能够保持乌克兰的出口。本月早些时候，乌克兰导弹损坏了克里米亚俄罗斯海军基地的一艘潜艇、一艘船只和港口设施。它拥有不错的防空系统，但更远的俄罗斯设施可能没有得到如此保护。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对保护出口的关注反映了乌克兰官员的一种感觉，即经济也需要进行彻底改革以应对长期战争。乌克兰去年获得了 310 亿美元的财政援助，今年有望获得更多。但财政部长谢尔盖·马尔琴科 (Serhiy Marchenko) 认为，这种慷慨不会无限期地出现。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，军费开支占<small>GDP</small>的比例从战前的5%跃升至今年的26%。即使战斗停止，支出也可能不会减少太多。扎卢日内将军说：“我希望乌克兰军队强大到俄罗斯不敢朝我们这边看。”马尔琴科指出，萎缩的经济规模太小，无法产生足够的税收来维持乌克兰的安全，因此政府必须通过改善商业环境和培育工业来帮助其发展。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">马尔琴科表示，投资者主要担心的不是人身安全，而是不可靠的法律体系，这个问题早在战争之前就存在了。同样，大多数乌克兰人认为，经济复苏的主要障碍是腐败，而不是战争对乌克兰基础设施造成的破坏。乌克兰设立的独立反腐败调查员、检察官和法院正在取得进展，但更广泛的司法系统仍然效率低下且不可预测。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">也许战争对经济造成的最严重伤害是导致 700 万乌克兰人外逃——几乎是战前 3700 万人口的 20%。超过三分之二是女性，因为达到战斗年龄的男性被禁止离开该国。劳动年龄人口从2021年的1670万减少到今年的1240万。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">平静的呼唤</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了吸引人们回来，政府为企业提供启动补助，并为重建房屋的人提供抵押贷款补贴。但许多离开的人已经在<small>欧盟</small>更富裕、更稳定的地方定居，找到工作并让孩子上学。他们不太可能想要更多的动乱，无论乌克兰的安全局势如何，他们都可能会在新家里为自己和孩子看到更多的机会。最近的一项调查发现，至少约有一半移居德国的人打算在可预见的未来留在那里。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">人口外流不仅会带来经济成本，还会带来社会成本。泽连斯基先生的妻子奥琳娜·泽连斯卡（Olena Zelenska）是政府心理健康项目的负责人，她表示，离婚数量已经有所上升，“因为妇女和儿童在国外，而男人在国内”。泽伦斯基表示，消耗战确实存在风险，可能会加速乌克兰人口外流，造成进一步的经济问题，并扩大离开者与留下者之间的差距。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这并不是社会紧张局势的唯一根源。在战争第一周志愿参军的第 80 空降突击旅中尉罗曼·哈斯科 (Roman Hasko) 表示，他刚刚从巴赫穆特附近的前线休假抵达，对基辅夜间的喧嚣感到失望。 “我看到了很多潜在的新员工。我单位有很多空缺职位。并不是所有人都被杀了——有些人受伤或生病了……如果我们谈论赢得这场战争，这些空缺的队伍需要被填补。”

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在战争的头几周，像哈斯科这样的人就排队入伍。现在乌克兰正在通过征兵来填补队伍空缺。一些尚未被征召入伍的年轻人在离开家或通过检查站时感到紧张，因为担心被抓。许多人试图通过贿赂退出兵役并非法离开该国。上个月，泽连斯基解雇了所有地区征兵中心的负责人。他用经过情报部门审查、有战场经验的士兵取代了他们。本月早些时候，国防部大幅削减了医疗豁免的数量。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰人显然对国家的治理方式有些担忧。军队和总统的支持率仍然很高，但对该国政界人士的总体信心从 12 月的 60% 下降到 6 月的 44%。认为国家走在正确轨道上的乌克兰人比例也有所下降（见图表）。人们尤其对腐败感到不安。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但 76% 的人告诉民调机构，在战争结束之前他们不想举行新的选举。对乌克兰独立的支持率达到历史最高水平，达到 82%。大多数人并不抱怨行动限制或其他战时对公民自由的限制。 “战争已成为新的可怕常态的一部分，”基辅联合国开发计划署的社会学家达琳娜·索洛多娃说。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">抵抗俄罗斯的侵略仍然是绝大多数人的统一原则。 “It is not the question of whether to resist or not, but who has done more or less for that resistance,” says Ms Solodova. Across Ukraine 42% say that even if Russia intensifies its bombing of cities Ukraine should keep fighting. Some 21% think that the conflict should be frozen without making any concessions to Russia. Only 23% think it is worth initiating negotiations. Even in the east and south, which have borne the brunt of the war, support for negotiations is relatively low, at 32% and 39% respectively. Only 5% of Ukrainians are willing to cede any territory to Russia and only 18% to forswear joining <small>NATO</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Research by the Centre for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development, a think-tank in Cyprus, suggests that Ukrainians have become more optimistic about the future despite the war. Most believe that future generations will be better off. Ms Zelenska is not surprised: “People know what they are fighting for, not just what against.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:14:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ppv93sn16mkmpo0os26ioqogg623s8kn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/to-endure-a-long-war-ukraine-is-remaking-its-army-economy-and-society </item><item><title><![CDATA[The hard right is getting closer to power all over Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Europe_s%20hard%20right-3da6c3966e318901bdd99c67b92e03ad.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>N SINT-GENESIUS-RODE</small> , a well-to-do commuter town in the hills south of Brussels, a crowd of 50 or so gathered on September 2nd in a parish hall to drink champagne and promote the dismemberment of Belgium. The meeting was organised by Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest), a right-wing party that rails against such threats to the Flemish way of life as Islam, immigration and—most pernicious of all—the French language. The town is in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking half of Belgium), but French-speakers have been moving in for decades and are now the majority. The only way to stop the rot, explains Klaas Slootmans, a member of the Flemish regional parliament from Vlaams Belang, is for Flanders to declare independence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may sound parochial, chauvinist and disruptive if not delusional, but it goes down well. People have a right “to be the boss in their own country”, Mr Slootmans proclaims; the crowd applauds. Vlaams Belang is Belgium&#39;s most popular party, with an average of 22% support in recent polling. Barring a sudden reversal, it should triumph in simultaneous elections next year for the national, European and regional parliaments. Other Belgian parties have hitherto declared it too extreme to do business with, and refused to include it in coalitions. But this so-called <i>cordon sanitaire</i> may have to be abandoned if the party wins a fifth or more of parliamentary seats. Anyway, the ostracism may in fact be helping Vlaams Belang. Its support has tripled over the past five years.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The right moment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a common pattern. Across much of Europe, populist right-wing parties like Vlaams Belang, once relegated to the fringe, are going from strength to strength. In Hungary, Italy and Poland they hold power. In Finland, Sweden and Switzerland they have a share of it. In Germany polls put the <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/germanys-rampant-hard-right-afd-puts-other-parties-in-a-fix">Alternative for Germany</a> ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ) party at 22%, up from 10% in the election in 2021. In France the National Rally ( <small>RN</small> ), the biggest hard-right party, has 24% support. Add in 5% for Reconquest, another anti-immigrant party, and the hard right becomes the biggest voting block in the country. In the Netherlands, too, a smattering of right-wing populists claim a quarter or more of the vote. Even newish democracies that for decades lacked big nationalist parties—Portugal, Romania and Spain—now have them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The advance of the hard right is neither uniform nor one-way. Support for populist nationalists has recently slumped in Denmark and Spain, for instance. Nor are all these parties the same: some are eager Atlanticists, others pro-Russian; some are libertarian, others want a more generous welfare state, albeit only for people of native stock. What is more, hard-right groups tend to mellow the closer they get to power, or to splinter, or both. The government of Italy, for one, although led by the Brothers of Italy ( <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> ), a party with links to fascism, has proved much more moderate than many had feared. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBM930.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Nonetheless, the trend is alarming, for three reasons. First, it is remarkably broad. Four of the five most populous countries in the European Union have hard-right parties either in government or polling above 20% (see map). Second, the current circumstances are especially propitious for populist parties, with immigration rising after a hiatus during the pandemic, inflation high and the growing cost of climate policy creating a potent new focus for popular ire. Third, and most important, the hard right does not need to win power to have a baleful impact on politics. Simply by attracting a big share of voters, it is already skewing the debate, and so making it harder for European governments to adopt sensible policies on pressing problems, such as the war in Ukraine, immigration and climate change.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Freedom fighters</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When the Freedom Party, Austria&#39;s main hard-right outfit, joined a coalition government in 2000, other <small>EU</small> governments were so horrified that they reduced contact with Austria&#39;s to the bare minimum in protest. To no avail: the hard right has since broken through barrier after barrier. It first led a government in 2010, when Fidesz, a once-centrist outfit that had taken a populist turn, swept to power in Hungary. Those who said the same thing could never happen in mature democracies in western Europe were proved wrong last year when <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> took power in Italy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBC553.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">More milestones loom. Hard-right parties are expected to do well in next year&#39;s European elections. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> and prime minister of Italy, is trying to persuade the centre-right alliance in the European Parliament, the European People&#39;s Party ( <small>EPP</small> ), to join forces with the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists ( <small>ECR</small> ), which she heads. That would move the legislature of all of the <small>EU</small> in a populist direction. In France, meanwhile, the hard right&#39;s performance is improving at each presidential election (see chart). It is possible that Marine Le Pen, the runner-up at the past two contests, may win the next one, in 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A series of external factors are helping to propel support for the hard right. Illegal immigration, which spurred support for populist parties when it surged in 2015, is growing again after a lull during the pandemic. There have already been more than 165,000 unauthorised arrivals in Europe this year, as many as in all of last year, although still well below the level of 2015. Populists also tend to do well in times of economic upheaval, and so are benefiting from the high inflation that has plagued Europe for the past two years, and especially from soaring energy prices.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Expensive petrol, heating and electricity have helped foment a backlash against policies to fight climate change, which the hard right has seized on. This began in France with the <i>gilets jaunes</i> movement in late 2018, initially a protest against a carbon-tax hike on motor fuel. The <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s rise this year was touched off by a proposed government ban on oil and gas boilers in homes. In the Netherlands the Farmer-Citizen Movement ( <small>BBB</small> ), a new populist party, began as a farmers&#39; protest against nitrogen-emission limits. It won an astounding 20% of the vote in regional elections in March.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There has also been a broader slide in trust in government in many European countries, after a brief resurgence during the pandemic, to the benefit of the hard right. American-style culture wars are becoming fiercer, too, which, again, helps the populists. Maximilian Krah, the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s lead candidate in the European elections, went viral over the summer with dating advice posted on TikTok: “Real men are right-wing. Don&#39;t watch porn.” In other videos Mr Krah argues that “multicultural means multi-criminal”, bemoans rainbow flags and warns that BlackRock, an investment firm, wants to replace Germans with “minorities and immigrants”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The European politician most adept at exploiting such ideas to win and hold power is Viktor Orban, Fidesz&#39;s leader and the prime minister of Hungary since 2010. He readily bashes migrants, gay people and the <small>EU</small> as at odds with homespun Hungarian values. He has used the parliamentary majorities he has won with such talk to pack the courts with loyalists and gerrymander the electoral system. Cronies have bought up critical media outlets. In addition to undermining democracy at home, Mr Orban&#39;s rule has scrambled policymaking at <small>NATO</small> and in the <small>EU</small> , owing to his friendliness with both China and Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But harnessing right-wing populism to take control of a state is not easy. When Poland&#39;s Law and Justice ( <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ) party came to power in 2015, it followed Mr Orban&#39;s script. It turned the state media into a propaganda bureau and tried to pack the courts. But <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s efforts have not got as far as Fidesz&#39;s. Many judges have fought back, and the <small>EU</small> has withheld billions of euros in aid to force <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> to reverse some of its court-packing. The media have not been cowed. The opposition remain competitive, even though <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> is favoured in next month&#39;s election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other right-wing populists using Mr Orban&#39;s template have also had mixed results. Janez Jansa, a former prime minister of Slovenia nicknamed “Marshal Tweeto” for a social-media style reminiscent of Donald Trump, lost power in 2022. Estonia&#39;s far-right <small>EKRE</small> party tried to go after the media while in government in 2019, but that coalition collapsed and the party did poorly in an election this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even where it has been electorally successful, the hard right has struggled to put in place radical policies such as ending political asylum or scrapping measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Take Sweden, where the Sweden Democrats, long shunned by other parties because of their roots in the neo-Nazi movement, took 21% of the vote in 2022. They signed a confidence-and-supply deal to back a centre-right minority government, giving them direct influence over policy on immigration and crime. But in a speech in August Jimmie Akesson, the party&#39;s leader, had to make excuses for the government&#39;s slow progress implementing the deal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ms Meloni is the first leader in western Europe with the parliamentary clout to enact a hard-right agenda. Yet so far, she has run a fairly conventional government. Her only populist measures have been to introduce a misconceived tax on banks, limit some airline fares and prevent same-sex parents from registering their partner&#39;s child as their own. In part, she is constrained by European fiscal rules. But the <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> is also simply less extreme than it once was. ”This is a pragmatic centre-right government with, now and again, some identitarian [culture-war] policies,” argues Giovanni Orsina of the <small>LUISS</small> school in Rome.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On the question of Europe, in particular, many hard-right parties have softened. A few of the edgiest populists want to dismantle the union they sneeringly refer to as the “ <small>EUSSR</small> ”. But <small>F</small> d <small>I</small> abandoned the idea of leaving the euro and restructuring the <small>EU</small> before coming to power. Ms Meloni instead wants the <small>EU</small> to do more to help Italy, by keeping out the migrants that flood Italy&#39;s shores. This summer she went to Tunisia with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission&#39;s president, to negotiate a migration deal. She also wants the bloc to relax its fiscal rules so that her government can spend more. She even cultivates Europhiles by praising the union as the guardian of European peace and civilisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>RN</small> , in similar fashion, no longer calls for France to leave the <small>EU</small> and the euro. Its rhetoric remains anti-European, but with few specifics. This retreat from more radical policies was presumably intended precisely to broaden the <small>RN</small> ’s appeal and so help it win power. And even if Ms Le Pen were to become president, she might still struggle to implement her policies, despite the immense formal powers of the office. After all, reforms to state pensions championed by Emmanuel Macron, the incumbent, met ferocious opposition even though he clearly advertised them during his re-election campaign last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Far-right parties, which are often young, full of zealous ideologues and dependent on charismatic leaders, are prone to schisms. The Finns Party&#39;s first stint in government, in 2015, split it in two. Its second, which began in May, has already been marred by scandals and resignations. In Poland, <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ’s generous benefits policies have alienated fiscal conservatives, some of whom have defected to a libertarian party called Confederation. Ms Le Pen, having softened her radical image, now faces competition on the right from Reconquest, whose lead candidate in the European election is her niece, Marion Maréchal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most vivid illustration of such chaos is in the Netherlands, which since 2002 has seen a series of right-wing populist parties rocket to prominence only to implode. In provincial elections in 2019 Forum for Democracy, a party led by Thierry Baudet, a dandyish Eurosceptic, finished first with 17%. Within months it had split into three. Mr Baudet now hawks conspiracy theories about covid-19 and immigration; his rump of the party is polling at 3%. Earlier this year the <small>BBB</small> had a brief moment as the standard-bearer of the right, but it has already slumped to 11% in the polls. It has been losing votes to yet another new party on the right with populist overtones, New Social Contract, which was launched by an <small>MP</small> famous for investigating abuses by the tax authority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What all these parties have in common is a vague sense that they stand with ordinary people against the elite. Their positions on hot-button issues can be hazy, as with the <small>RN</small> ’s new stance on Europe. At a local level their candidates are often pragmatic. In June the rural town of Raguhn-Jessnitz in Saxony-Anhalt became the first to elect an <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> mayor. Hannes Loth is an energetic 42-year-old former vegetable farmer (“cabbage, sweetcorn, onions—all kinds of onions”). During the pandemic, when locals had trouble getting travel permits because of the lack of a covid-testing centre, Mr Loth opened one himself.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Loth&#39;s main concerns are run-down streets and fire stations and the town&#39;s budget deficit, which was €1.5m ($1.6m) last year. That is partly because high energy prices sent heating bills for the <i>Rathaus</i> (town hall) through the roof. Mr Loth, toeing the <small>a</small> f <small>d</small> ’s line, says the solution is to restart the nuclear plants the government has closed and negotiate peace in Ukraine so gas pipelines to Russia can reopen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The disconnect between genuine problems and far-fetched solutions encapsulates something important about hard-right populist parties. Mr Loth is acutely sensitive to his constituents&#39; suffering from high energy costs. But the <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ’s response is in part a fantasy: whatever it might wish, cheap Russian gas will not be an option for the foreseeable future. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="rotesters raising their hands making a Nazi salute while carrying a Spanish flag with the words"Long live the unity of Spain" are seen during a protest of far right wing party" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_FBP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Making their presence felt</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similarly, the worries of the voters at the meeting in Sint-Genesius-Rode are natural. They have seen their town change its language around them; they have trouble finding good Dutch-language schools for their kids. But Vlaams Belang&#39;s solutions are illusory. Flemish independence is unlikely. Even if it happened, there is no way to force Sint-Genesius-Rode to speak mostly Dutch again. It has become French-speaking not because of a bureaucratic conspiracy, but because immigrants are more interested in learning French (a widely spoken language) than Dutch (a relatively obscure one).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The changes Europe&#39;s populist parties rail against tend to be inexorable or at least not easily reversed: demography, sexual liberation, gender equality, the shift away from fossil fuels. As with Vlaams Belang, the policies they propose to set the world to rights tend to be incoherent or unachievable. For populists, unrealistic programmes are no bad thing: candidates cannot thunder indignantly at election rallies about problems that have been solved.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Moreover, simply by railing and attracting support, far-right parties help to shift the debate. All across the continent, centre-right parties have toughened their immigration policies and heightened their culture-war rhetoric to stop voters defecting to the populists. The most glaring example of this was in Britain, where Brexit was set in train by the Conservative Party&#39;s decision to support a referendum on Brexit in an effort to diminish the appeal of the insurgents of the <small>UK</small> Independence Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is probably the biggest risk of the rising vote share of Europe&#39;s far-right parties. Certainly, they tend to be associated with bigotry and misogyny, and to undermine the rule of law. Occasionally they may win enough power to damage democracy, as in Hungary and Poland. But more often, big populist-right blocs simply impede countries from getting to grips with their most pressing problems by offering illusory solutions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is the last thing the <small>EU</small> needs. The next European Parliament must make grave decisions regarding institutional reform in the <small>EU</small> , energy security, climate, support for Ukraine and more. If a quarter of its members refuse to wrestle seriously with such problems, they are unlikely to be solved. The hard right does not need to seize control of the levers of power to gum them up. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i><b>Correction (September 18th, 2023):</b> A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Germany&#39;s election took place last year.

No longer: of the six countries invited to join the bloc at its annual summit on August 22nd, four—Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> )—are from the region. If they all accept, the Middle East will account for more than a third of the expanded bloc&#39;s members.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The invitations are one sign among many that the Middle East is changing. Wealthy Gulf states are trying to establish themselves as non-aligned middle powers. Saudi Arabia has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. The <small>UAE</small> , which will host this year&#39;s global climate summit, <small>cop</small> 28, wants to fashion a dual role as both oil exporter and green-energy powerhouse. The six-member Gulf Co-operation Council ( <small>GCC</small> ) is one of the world&#39;s economic hotspots, drawing the talented and the ultra-rich from east and west and deploying vast pools of capital abroad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even more striking is the Middle East&#39;s newfound (and relative) calm. A ceasefire has quietened the eight-year war in Yemen. Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to ease their 40-year feud in March. Qatar has repaired relations with its neighbours. The region has even reconciled with Syria&#39;s murderous dictator, Bashar al-Assad. America, meanwhile, is urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, under which four other Arab countries have established ties with Israel since 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Five years ago Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia&#39;s crown prince and de facto ruler, offered a hopeful vision of where things might go. “I think that the new Europe is the Middle East,” he said. “The next global renaissance will be in the Middle East.” His comments fit an increasingly popular narrative in the Gulf, that a “new” Middle East will be focused on economics rather than democratisation, Islamisation or other distracting ideologies. Diplomacy will bring stability, which will foster investment and growth that helps everyone move beyond the upheavals of decades past. The Gulf states have long applied this model at home; now they want to export it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Middle East has huge potential. First, and most obvious, it is awash with hydrocarbons. It accounts for 36% of world oil production, 46% of oil exports, 22% of natural-gas output and 30% of liquefied natural gas ( <small>LNG</small> ) exports. Those numbers will only rise. The region has vast reserves (52% of the world&#39;s total for oil and 43% for gas) and low production costs. At a time when Western oil majors are skittish about investing, Gulf firms are adding capacity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Location is important, too: the region connects Europe, Africa and Asia. Some 30% of the world&#39;s shipping containers pass through the Suez canal in Egypt, while 16% of its air cargo flies via airports in the Gulf. Its young population is another asset: 55% of Middle Easterners are under 30, compared with 36% of the population of the <small>OECD</small> , a club mostly of rich countries.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Monumental misfortune</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the story of the past two decades has been one of conflict and despair. First came America&#39;s ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003. The fury of the Arab spring followed, bringing upheaval but not democracy: all the countries affected eventually either reverted to dictatorship or collapsed into civil war. Islamist violence and sectarian strife compounded the region&#39;s woes. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC438.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The Middle East accounts for 6% of the world&#39;s population but just 4% of economic output.

Poverty rates have soared in Egypt and Lebanon, to say nothing of war-torn Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But three big shifts are under way that could change the place of the Middle East in the world. The first is the growing distance between the Gulf states and America. Three successive presidents have sought to reduce America&#39;s military presence in the Middle East. Joe Biden, the current one, is not trying to impose democracy on the region; he does not even seem too interested in reining in Iran&#39;s nuclear programme. America has other priorities: competition with China, the war in Ukraine, political turmoil at home.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s economic role is also decreasing. Over the past 30 years the share of Middle Eastern exports going to China and India has climbed from 5% to 26%, according to the <small>IMF;</small> the share sent to Europe and America has fallen from 34% to 16%. Much of this reflects Asia&#39;s booming appetite for oil, the region&#39;s main export. In the 1990s China took less than 1% of Saudi Arabia&#39;s crude exports, and India less than 3%; by 2021 those figures were 28% and 12%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Oil is at the heart of the second shift, in energy markets. The region is trying to become an even bigger force in oil and gas to finance a transition away from hydrocarbons, contradictory though that may sound. Recent high oil prices have brought a windfall. Aramco, the state-owned Saudi giant, posted a record $161bn profit last year, up from $110bn in 2021. It plans to expand its capacity by 1m barrels a day (roughly 10%) over the next three years. The <small>UAE</small> has a similar target. It has also made itself a transit point for Iranian and Russian oil, which are subject to Western sanctions. Qatar, already the world&#39;s biggest exporter of <small>LNG</small> , plans to boost production by 63% by 2027.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The proceeds are being poured into new industries. Instead of parking its petrodollars in American treasuries, as it once did, Saudi Arabia is snapping up everything from European footballers to stakes in electric-car firms. This summer the kingdom struck a $2.6bn deal with Brazil&#39;s largest mining firm, part of a plan to spend $170bn on the industry by 2030.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final shift is in attitudes. Surveys show that Arabs view the economy as their top concern. About a third of young Arabs say the cost of living is the region&#39;s biggest problem and another third cite unemployment; almost half say it is hard to find a job in their country. Asked whether stability or democracy is more important, 82% choose the former. Growing numbers believe that democracy is bad for economic growth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Citizens have lost interest in political Islam, too. Islamist parties have been forced out of government by Tunisian voters and Egyptian soldiers. Armed Islamists failed to take control of Iraq, Libya and Syria. <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/07/a-year-after-iran-was-shaken-by-protests-zealots-have-tightened-their-grip">Widespread protests</a> in Iran last year were a sign of popular frustration with its religious rulers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The leaders of the Gulf countries, too, seem to have a new outlook. Over the past decade they had sought to use force to change the region. They tried to impose a friendly government on Yemen; Saudi Arabia sent weapons to Syrian rebels; the <small>UAE</small> attempted to install Khalifa Haftar, a warlord, as Libya&#39;s leader. Each effort failed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At least for now, the era of macho foreign policy is over. The most unexpected diplomatic shift was the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. They have been at odds since the latter&#39;s Islamic revolution in 1979, fighting a proxy war that eventually spread to Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. With a nudge from China, though, they agreed in March to reopen their embassies, which had been closed since 2016, to tone down criticism of one another in state-backed media and to boost economic ties. They are hardly friends, but the deal has reduced the chance of conflict in the Gulf.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most unsavoury shift is Mr Assad&#39;s reintegration. He did nothing to earn it: after destroying Syria to keep power, he has made no gestures towards reform or reconciliation. But in May the Saudis let him reclaim Syria&#39;s seat at the Arab League.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The easing of tensions has nonetheless brought a measure of calm, which may help explain the improving economic outlook. The <small>IMF</small> expects the non-oil portion of the Gulf states&#39; economies to grow by 4.2% this year (unchanged from last year), even as the oily bit expands by just 1.9% (down from 10.3% in 2022). The region attracted 6% of global flows of foreign direct investment last year, up from 3% in 2019.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Capital markets are booming. Firms in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the <small>UAE</small> , accounted for 14% of the world&#39;s <small>IPO</small> s in the first quarter of 2023. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that foreign ownership of Middle Eastern equities climbed from 2% in 2017 to 10% last year. It sees the region&#39;s weight in emerging-market indices rising to 10% in the next few years, from 7% today.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Big domestic reforms are making headway: 31% of Saudi women were employed in the first quarter of this year, compared with 16% at the same point in 2017. Gulf states are also trying to be more exacting when doling out aid. Some still comes with few strings attached: Tunisia, for instance, secured a surprise $500m bail-out (most of it loans) from Saudi Arabia in July. But Egypt is having to raise money by selling stakes in state-run firms to sovereign-wealth funds from Qatar and the <small>UAE</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists muse about where this could lead. A calmer Middle East would mean fewer risks to global trade and energy flows, and fewer refugees (the region accounts for over 8m of the world&#39;s 35m). As Western firms seek to diversify supply chains, a youthful Middle East could become a new manufacturing base. Morocco&#39;s thriving car industry, which produces around 700,000 vehicles a year and sustains 220,000 jobs, shows what is possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The region could also do more business with itself. Trade within the Middle East is equivalent to only 2.9% of the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> , compared with 22% within the <small>EU</small> . Researchers at Majid al-Futtaim, an Emirati retail giant, and McKinsey, a consultancy, estimate that dropping barriers to trade could boost the region&#39;s <small>GDP</small> by $230bn (5%). If Saudi Arabia and Israel buried the hatchet, commercial ties with the Middle East&#39;s most dynamic economy would become possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Infrastructure could be stitched together as well. The <small>GCC</small> countries have long mooted integrating their railways, which could easily be connected to those of Iraq, Israel and Jordan, too. Pipelines could bring low-cost Saudi hydrogen across the Mediterranean to consumers in Europe; upgraded transmission lines could allow a sun-baked region to export solar power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is an alluring vision, but there are many pitfalls. The first is that the economic progress of the past few years has been uneven. The Middle East has long been riven with political schisms, between revolutionaries and royalists, nationalists and Islamists, Sunnis and Shias. Today, though, the most important distinction is economic, between the prosperous states and the penurious ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Unfortunately, most of the Middle East is penurious. Even in a time of regional calm, dire economies threaten these countries&#39; stability. In the past five years alone, since Prince Muhammad first began talking about a regional renaissance, there have been big protests in Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Sudan.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pharaonic mismanagement</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt, the most populous country in the Arab world, is especially alarming. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the soldier who has run it since a coup in 2013, has consistently spent less than the constitution requires on health and education. But he has found the money for grandiose projects such as a new capital city in the desert and for big purchases of weapons for the army (Egypt is the world&#39;s sixth-largest arms importer).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Egypt&#39;s debt-to- <small>GDP</small> ratio has risen to 93%, with 36% of the loans denominated in foreign currencies. Its non-oil economy has been in contraction for 33 consecutive months and for 81 of the past 90 months. The currency has lost half its value over the past two years and will probably be devalued again soon. Annual inflation hit a record high of 38% in July. Citizens endured blackouts in sweltering heat this summer because the government could not afford to import enough fuel for power plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A fully fledged balance-of-payments crisis seems likely. Even if the government limps on, it will be hard to reinvent the region when its largest country is moribund. And should unrest erupt on a sufficient scale, it could even damage the economic prospects of the Gulf countries. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBC440.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Another risk is that even the region&#39;s prosperous countries will fail to create the jobs and growth they have promised. They have undeniably done better to date than their counterparts elsewhere in the Middle East. In 1975 Saudis and Libyans had roughly the same <small>GDP</small> per person; today the Saudi figure is 353% higher. The Gulf and Israel (the region&#39;s other prosperous spot) account for just 14% of the Middle East&#39;s population, but 60% of its <small>GDP</small> , 73% of its exports of goods and 75% of its <small>FDI</small> (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Saudi Arabia, like its neighbours, is battling deep structural problems. Citizens still see a cushy public-sector job as a birthright. The government employs fully 53% of working Saudis, although that is down from 66% in 2019. Schools do not teach marketable skills. Wages are too high for the kingdom to become a manufacturing hub, at least without costly state subsidies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Prince Muhammad hopes annual foreign direct investment will be $100bn by 2030. Last year it was just $8bn. That leaves the government as the main agent of economic transformation, which is worrying in two respects. First, its finances are hostage to oil markets. Analysts estimate that the kingdom runs a deficit when the price drops below $100 a barrel, if off-budget spending by its sovereign-wealth funds is included. It is currently about $90—its highest for almost a year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, it is far from clear that the government&#39;s investments in diversification will pay off. Vision 2030, the kingdom&#39;s economic blueprint, predicts tourism will contribute 10% of Saudi <small>GDP</small> by the end of the decade. Officials claim the industry will generate 1m jobs, enough to hire one in 20 Saudis, a higher share than in France or Spain. But there is scant evidence of the hoped-for flood of 100m annual visitors. Last year there were just 16m, estimates the <small>UN</small> —about 1.5m fewer than in 2016, the year the vision was adopted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another worry is that the ideological arguments that leaders are so eagerly papering over will at some point resurface. Saudi Arabia is pursuing a détente with Iran even as the latter continues to produce highly enriched uranium for its rogue nuclear programme. Should the regime go further and manufacture a bomb, it could trigger a regional arms race—or even a war. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Collage juxtaposing an image of a tank and an excavator" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Anthony Gerace/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been relatively subdued for the past two decades, but it is unlikely to stay that way for ever. Serious conflict in the Holy Land could shake Arab agreements with Israel. Violence has ebbed in Libya, Syria and Yemen, but the underlying disputes remain unresolved. Mr Assad faced a wave of protests last month in Sweida, a restive southern province. And Saudi Arabia and the <small>UAE</small> , although the main cheerleaders for the new Middle East, often disagree about both foreign policy and economic matters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The final risk is that the region gets its geopolitical balancing act wrong. America is still the only country willing and able to project military power across the region, and its domination of the global financial system gives it unmatched economic clout. The Gulf states cannot risk losing it as a partner. Yet their dalliances with Russia and China are prompting mounting anger in Washington. America has imposed sanctions on a few firms in the <small>UAE</small> , including one accused of supplying drones to Russia. It has delayed a deal to sell <small>F</small> -35 fighter jets to the country because of allegations of a Chinese military presence at a port in Abu Dhabi.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Gulf states are “planning in part their future prosperity on the assumption that China&#39;s economic rise will continue”, notes Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. There are warning lights flashing over China&#39;s economy, though: slow growth, an ageing population, a moribund property market. A big gamble on China that alienates America could leave the Gulf in a difficult spot.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact is, Prince Muhammad is not the first regional leader to wax lyrical about a renaissance in the Middle East. There are many parallels between the current era and the 1990s, another time when the region seemed to be trying to put its violent past behind it. The Oslo accords appeared to herald an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Lebanon&#39;s long civil war had sputtered to a halt. Autocrats in Egypt, Jordan and Syria talked about opening their hidebound economies. So did Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, the Saudi crown prince of the day, who promised bold reforms and sought better relations with Iran.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 1993 Shimon Peres, then Israel&#39;s foreign minister, wrote a book called “The New Middle East” arguing that trade would pacify the region. “Ultimately, the Middle East will unite in a common market,” he stated. “And the very existence of this common market will foster vital interests in maintaining the peace over the long term.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> History, sadly, had other ideas. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process gradually ground to a halt. America invaded Iraq in 2003 and Israel sent its army into southern Lebanon in 2006. Supposedly modernising autocrats across the region proved quite bad at the modernising bit, which precipitated the Arab spring. Gulf economies stayed oily, save for Dubai, which never had much oil to begin with.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An era of peace and development is a tempting vision, but to attain it, the region&#39;s autocrats must be serious about keeping the peace and smart about fixing their economies.

Black Africans, he added, brought “violence, crimes and unacceptable practices”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In effect, he gave Tunisians permission to be openly racist. Suddenly, many felt free to use slurs that were previously taboo, including one for black people that means, literally, “slave”. Most locals interviewed by <i>The Economist</i> in the street in August used this term. “The slaves are replacing us,” said Nizar, a furniture repair man in Tunis, the capital. “They are taking all the jobs.” Worse, “They stand on the balcony in their underwear drinking alcohol.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A wave of hatred has crashed over the country. In July, after an Arab was killed in a brawl with migrants in Sfax, Tunisia&#39;s second city, mobs torched homes where black Africans were lodging. Landlords, scared of losing their property, evicted black tenants. When <i>The Economist</i> visited, hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants were sleeping rough in the town centre, huddled together for protection.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Look at my head,” said Muhammad, a painter from Guinea, pointing to a hammer-blow scar. He was driven from his flat by thugs wielding stones and petrol bombs, he said; then police grabbed him and dumped him in the desert with no water. Many migrants have died this way, but Muhammad somehow made it back to Sfax. He is desperate to get to Europe. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMcuv4eccCA?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s speech was pure fabrication. There is no plot to change Tunisia&#39;s demography. Black Africans are a tiny share of the population, and largely just passing through. If they linger, it is simply because they are saving for the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before the speech, Mr Saied was unpopular, thanks to a dire economy. After it, he appears to have won more support. Polls are unreliable, but one in November gave him less than 30% backing; a different one in June found that 69% would vote for him.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> By vowing to guard Tunisians from a phantom menace, he has rallied them behind him. He has also deflected blame for the country&#39;s ills. Economists think Tunisia&#39;s inflation is largely caused by the government, but Mustafa, from Sfax, blames black people, who he says are driving up prices by eating all the bread. He plans to vote for Mr Saied at the next election.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The president&#39;s hate-mongering has also distracted attention from other controversial things he has been doing, such as muzzling the press, purging the judiciary and shutting down the national anti-corruption watchdog. He has been dismantling the checks and balances that promote good, clean governance, with predictable results. Tunisia has grown more fearful, less free and more corrupt. Its score on the Corruption Perceptions Index ( <small>CPI</small> ) compiled by Transparency International, a watchdog, has worsened significantly since 2021, when Mr Saied started dismantling its young, hopeful democracy. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC328.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Tunisia reflects a global trend: more leaders are using nationalism as a tool to amass power—and to abuse it (see chart 1). Whereas nationalism was once a means to dismantle deplorable colonial empires, it is increasingly becoming a device to remove legitimate constraints on government power. Leaders who chafe at checks and balances need a pretext to scrap them. They cannot admit that they want to muzzle the press and purge the courts because they find it irksome to follow the rules and would prefer to rule with unfettered authority. So they accuse journalists and judges of being traitors, or agents of foreign powers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nationalism can be positive or negative. The positive sort—love of one&#39;s country—can be a force for good. “It is the strongest foundation for solidarity between people who might otherwise have few things in common,” writes Yascha Mounk in “The Great Experiment: How to Make Diverse Democracies Work”. “At its best, it can inspire a white Christian living in rural Tennessee to feel special concern for a Hispanic atheist living in Los Angeles—and vice versa.” Because it is benign and, except at a few Western universities, uncontroversial, positive nationalism is embraced by nearly all politicians. Hardly any would admit to not loving their country.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The danger is when they espouse negative nationalism: the fear and suspicion of outsiders. The outsiders could be foreigners or domestic minorities. Perhaps because this paranoid variant is based on a deep-seated instinct—the desire to protect one&#39;s tribe—it is highly potent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When people feel their country is threatened, they rise to defend it, sometimes heroically. When Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Ukrainians made great sacrifices to resist him. This benefited Ukraine, which would otherwise have become a vassal state. It also boosted the poll ratings of Ukraine&#39;s president, Volodymyr Zelensky: people rallied round the man who led their country&#39;s defence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Alas, unscrupulous leaders have found they can win similar poll bumps by vowing to defend people against confected threats. Mr Putin claims that his unprovoked attack on Ukraine is really about defending Russia from Western aggression and Ukrainian Nazis. Many Russians believe him. Despite the war&#39;s cost to Russia in blood, treasure and international isolation, independent polls suggest that Mr Putin&#39;s approval rating has risen since he started it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The main drawback of paranoid nationalism is obvious. It is terrible for its targets, whether they be immigrants in Tunisia or Ukrainians whose land has been sown with mines. Neighbours of paranoid nationalist regimes have cause to be nervous, as anywhere that shares a border with Russia or China can attest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other big drawback is less well understood: politics based on bigotry opens the door to misrule and corruption. As Mr Putin has ratcheted up nationalist propaganda over the past two decades, his cronies have been plundering Russia. And though he is surely the most extreme example, he is far from alone. In fact, there is a clear statistical correlation between nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>The Economist</i> analysed data from the V-Dem Institute, a think-tank attached to the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. Every year it asks experts to describe how the world&#39;s governments justify themselves to voters or citizens. It then creates a scale with the results. After weighting countries by population, we found that between 2012 and 2021 governments became more reliant on nationalism to justify themselves. (Specifically, on an ideology that included a nationalist element. It could also include other elements, such as populism or Islamism.) The change was significant: a typical citizen has seen an increase in her state&#39;s use of nationalism roughly equivalent to what China has seen under its “Wolf Warrior” president, Xi Jinping. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBC332.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> We combined our measure of how nationalist governments are with data on perceptions of public-sector corruption from Transparency International ( <small>TI</small> ) for the years 2012 to 2021. Using a statistical model, we found that where governments rely on nationalist rhetoric to stay in power, experts think the public sector is much more corrupt (see chart 2). Moreover, comparing countries with themselves over time, going back to 2012, we find that more nationalist rhetoric has been associated with more corruption, and less nationalism with less corruption. Both these findings remain true after controlling for average incomes, and changes in them, and worldwide trends in nationalism and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There were notable exceptions (China, for instance, became cleaner and more jingoistic) but the relationship is statistically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in nationalism was correlated with a jump of 5.31 (on a scale of 0 to 100) in corruption when comparing countries, and a 0.13 point jump when comparing within them. The latter may seem small, but corruption scores usually do not change much at all. Interestingly, when an increase in nationalism came first, it predicted a future increase in corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why might this be so? Daniel Eriksson, the head of <small>TI</small> , suggests three ways that nationalism can foster the abuse of power. Politicians may whip up nationalist passions to win office or hang on to it. By granting their kin or cronies influence, they may attempt to capture the state. And by branding critics as traitors, they may erode the checks and balances that prevent the looting of public funds.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Appeals to nationalism are effective because they are simple to understand, and far more emotive than any bread-and-butter policy proposal. “Vote for me and I&#39;ll make incremental improvements to schools” is a fine platform but a dull slogan. “The tribe next door are attacking us!” is an electrifying one.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pick your poison</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The enemy can take many forms. It could be immigrants, as in Tunisia. Or a geopolitical rival: Chinese and Russian propaganda constantly demonise America. Or a minority faith: India&#39;s ruling party plays up the non-existent threat that Muslims, less than 15% of the population, pose to the Hindu majority.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Or the enemy could be cultural change. Many nationalist leaders describe any new social trend that makes people uncomfortable as foreign, or even a vicious attempt by foreigners to subvert their country&#39;s values. Iran&#39;s regime uses this argument about women&#39;s rights; Uganda&#39;s, about tolerance for gay people. Illiberal regimes habitually describe the values they oppose as alien, which is easier than explaining why they are wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Each nationalist leader is unique, and it is hard to tell which ones believe their own rhetoric. Either way, paranoid nationalism gives them tools to gain power, consolidate it, and disguise their abuse of it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Consider Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega, the president, was once a revolutionary Marxist. He shot his way to power in 1979 but lost an election in 1990. Determined to regain and retain power, he muffled his Marxism, dialled up the anti-American bombast, won an election in 2006 and has gradually throttled democracy ever since.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> His choice of bogeyman is shrewd. The United States really did sponsor violent revolutionaries in his country—four decades ago. That threat is long gone, but Mr Ortega still claims that his opponents are “agents of the Yankee empire” who “stopped being Nicaraguans long ago”. In February he had more than 300 dissidents stripped of their citizenship. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FBM902.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Following Mr Eriksson&#39;s script, Mr Ortega has put his kin in positions of power. His vice-president and likely successor is his wife, Rosario Murillo. Eight of their nine children help them run the country. Their son Laureano is a presidential adviser. He oversaw negotiations with a Chinese firm to build a $50bn canal across Nicaragua. The project collapsed in 2015 amid allegations of skulduggery. Laureano is also an opera singer. Not all opera fans are convinced of his talent. One critic likened his voice to the “shrieks of a goat giving birth”. But he regularly lands the starring role in operas backed by a foundation he runs, which is funded by Nicaraguan taxpayers.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Grand theft autocrat</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Ortega family run the main television channels in Nicaragua. This lets them slant the news in their favour. It is also lucrative. Between 2018 and 2020 Nicaragua&#39;s government bought advertising worth an estimated $59m from the three biggest <small>TV</small> channels owned or controlled by the Ortegas, while spending a measly $230,000 at channels not affiliated with them. In all, the family is thought to control 22 companies in industries from energy to property. Nicaragua is a whopping ten points more corrupt on <small>TI</small> ’s scale than in 2012, and now ranks lower than Congo.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In richer, more established democracies, too, paranoid nationalism offers a quick way for outsiders to grab attention and break into national politics, or remain on top. In May Viktor Orban, Hungary&#39;s prime minister, claimed at a conservative conference, “We are all under attack.” He vows to defend Hungarians against immigration, Islam and gay rights. He proclaims the unity of all ethnic Hungarians, including those in neighbouring countries. He gives them pensions and lets them vote in Hungarian elections; they tend to vote for him. Inflaming nationalism has thus helped him win four elections.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Hungarian media, which are now largely controlled by Mr Orban&#39;s cronies, parrot his claims of foreign plots. Tame courts raise few objections when rivers of aid from the European Union flow into the pockets of his chums and state assets are transferred to foundations controlled by his allies. Lorinc Meszaros, a former schoolmate of Mr Orban who owned a modest pipe-fitting business, has become the richest man in Hungary, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $1.4bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Hungary and elsewhere, nationalism offers a plausible-sounding excuse to weaken checks and balances. Watchdogs can be designated “foreign agents” and neutered. Honest public servants can be labelled “unpatriotic” and replaced with loyalists. Dodgy dealings can be kept secret in the name of national security.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Putin was a pioneer of this approach. In 2012 he introduced a law restricting the activities of <small>ngo</small> s that received money from abroad. In 2022 he broadened the law&#39;s scope. Now the state can declare any individual or group to be a “foreign agent” (which sounds to many ears like “spy”) if it deems them to be “under foreign influence”. So-called “foreign agents” can be banned from any kind of political activity, or simply shut down.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Elements of the Putin method have been widely imitated around the world. At least 50 countries have enacted rules to curb civil society in recent years, according to Amnesty International. More broadly, of the 31 countries that showed a significant deterioration on the Corruption Perceptions Index between 2012 and 2022, 80% also suffered a constriction of civil liberties, as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister organisation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Labelling watchdogs “foreign agents” impedes their work. Nervous local donors grow reluctant to fund feisty <small>ngo</small> s; advertisers shun independent media, lest their brand names be tarnished by association. India has used its Foreign Contributions Regulation Act to harass and muzzle groups from Oxfam to Greenpeace. China&#39;s “foreign influence” rules restrict the activities of any foreign-linked <small>ngo</small> that might annoy the Communist Party.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In July Zimbabwe&#39;s president signed a “Patriotic Bill” allowing long jail terms for anyone caught “wilfully damaging the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe”. The opposition says it criminalised criticism of the government in the run-up to an election last week, which the ruling party “won” unfairly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Despite its name, the bill seems designed to make Zimbabwe worse-governed. It makes it hazardous for members of civil society, the principal check on a thieving ruling party, to have any contact with foreigners. If an independent journalist talks to a foreign diplomat, or a local election-monitoring group shares data with an international one, or an anti-corruption watchdog seeks advice from an expert abroad, jail may await. As a cherry on top, the law also makes it harder to punish predatory officials, by requiring prosecutors to prove that those who abuse office knew that their actions were wrong.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In country after country, incumbents have found that nationalist or sectarian arguments can be used to harass or exclude from office those who challenge the status quo. Iran&#39;s corrupt theocracy insists that all presidential candidates meet its definition of Islamic piety. In 2021 it disqualified 585 of them, including all the would-be reformers, and allowed only seven to run. A new Polish law could bar from office politicians deemed to be unduly influenced by Russia; its probable target is Donald Tusk, a leading opposition candidate who is not pro-Russian at all. Since 2015, when Poland&#39;s nationalist ruling party took charge, the country has grown eight points grubbier on the Corruption Perceptions Index.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Shades of greed</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A more nationalist government does not automatically mean a more corrupt one. It is possible for a country to become more tub-thumping, but no dirtier, at least for a while. However, in the long run, if a leader uses nationalism to erode checks and balances, it becomes easier for the people around him or his successors to plunder. This happened in Zimbabwe, where a nationalist autocrat who was far more interested in power than money, Robert Mugabe, failed to stop looting by his cronies and was ultimately overthrown by them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thus, regardless of the starting point, paranoid nationalism tends to make countries worse governed and less stable. A paper co-written by Abhijit Banerjee, a Nobel prize-winning economist, found that when voters pick candidates by ethnicity instead of, say, probity or competence, they end up with less honest, less competent representatives.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Andreas Wimmer of Columbia University crunched data from nearly 500 civil wars and found that when political parties are ethnically based, civil war is nearly twice as likely. And instability is perhaps 30 times as likely if the country in question is neither a dictatorship (which can crush unrest before it escalates) nor a full democracy (where disputes are typically resolved peacefully). In short, when a leader invokes blood and soil, expect things to get bloody, or soiled. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Inspect all our code, data and models on <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/the-economist-nationalism-and-corruption/tree/master">GitHub</a></i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 09:10:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ttf827decbkegnfcmlacnisovs2h4nbg</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/31/how-cynical-leaders-are-whipping-up-nationalism-to-win-and-abuse-power </item><item><title><![CDATA[El Niño and global warming are mixing in alarming ways]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20El%20Ni_o-c8f29ab72a33fa5f13dc4d00f5112413.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>FTER YEARS</small> of praying for more rain, Californians unexpectedly found themselves wishing for less this week, when tropical storm Hilary blew in from Mexico on August 21st. Rainfall records were smashed in Los Angeles and San Diego. Death Valley, farther inland, was deluged with as much rain in a day as it normally receives in a year. Inundated roads completely cut off the nearby city of Palm Springs (pictured) for a time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hurricanes and tropical storms hit California only very rarely: none had even come close since 1997, and the previous one to make landfall was in 1939. Most of the few that have reached the state, however, including Hilary, have coincided with El Niño, a weather pattern that temporarily raises global temperatures while redistributing heat and moisture around the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meteorologists predict that the current El Niño, which began in June, will be a strong one—perhaps as severe as the one that ended in 2016, which helped make that year the hottest ever recorded. If they are right, the record is almost certain to fall this year or next. “We are in uncharted waters,” says Maarten van Aalst, director of the Dutch meteorological agency and former head of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “We have never had an El Niño on top of so much global warming, so we don&#39;t know what is going to happen.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> El Niños form and eventually dissipate owing to interactions between the trade winds that blow to the south of the equator and the ocean beneath them. The resulting accumulations of hotter- or colder-than-average water and high or low pressure in the atmosphere affect temperatures, winds and rainfall. Most of the time, the trade winds blow warm water from the central Pacific westward, towards Australia and Asia. That movement, in turn, helps draw cooler water up from the depths in the eastern Pacific, near South America. But every two-to-seven years, conditions conspire to create a vast pool of warmer-than-average surface water all the way across the Pacific, as far as South America.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> • <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/08/30/el-nino-is-back-and-could-bring-devastation-far-beyond-extreme-weather">Listen to experts on our science podcast discuss  why the current El Niño is alarming climatologists</a> .</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Peruvian fishermen named this phenomenon after the baby Jesus ( <i>el niño Jesus</i> in Spanish) because it tends to reach its peak around Christmas. It is of more than passing interest to them: the vast shimmering shoals of <i>anchovetas</i> on which their livelihood depends prefer colder water, and so vanish when El Niño appears.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent weeks small fishing boats in the port of Pisco have been unloading species rarely found nearby: butterfish, sierra, sardines. Meanwhile, the industrial fishing fleet, which relies on <i>anchovetas</i> , languishes in the harbour. Farther down the waterfront, factories that normally grind its catch into fishmeal are shuttered. No smoke billows from their chimneys; no fishy odour lingers in the air. An industry with exports of $2bn a year has been brought to a standstill.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The hiatus has contributed to an economic contraction in Peru and is likely to keep global fishmeal prices high for much of the year. That, in turn, will raise costs for the fish farms and livestock businesses around the world that use the stuff as feed. But those are only the beginnings of El Niño&#39;s impacts. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toKK4bGaKWQ?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tropical Pacific is so immense that the warming of its surface by an extra degree or two is enough to supercharge the global climate. More water evaporates, which warms the upper atmosphere and fuels tropical thunderstorms. Convection carries this additional energy to colder regions to the north and south, on either side of the equator. The spinning of the Earth spreads the energy east, as well. The net result is a vast redistribution of heat and moisture. In climate jargon, El Niño is a prime example of the “teleconnection” of the world&#39;s weather systems. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_EPM933.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">No two El Niños are the same, but some general patterns exist. Broadly speaking, the Amazon Basin, Australia, the Indian subcontinent, the Sahel, South-East Asia and southern Africa often suffer drier conditions; Central and East Asia, the Horn of Africa, the southern cone of South America and the southern United States tend to get wetter (see map). Sometimes, the consequences can be devastating. A relatively mild El Niño in 2018-19 helped to fuel some of the worst wildfires in Australia&#39;s history. The exceptionally strong El Niño of 2014-16 brought droughts and floods that left some 60m people around the world short of food, drove huge outbreaks of Zika virus across South America and bleached 29% of Australia&#39;s Great Barrier Reef.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At times, the changes in the weather can also bring benefits. This year rains in Argentina are expected to increase grain production, breaking a long drought. El Niño years typically yield milder Atlantic hurricane seasons, reducing damage to property and crops (though that may not hold this year because of unusually hot waters in the North Atlantic). El Niño&#39;s impacts are hugely varied, too, going far beyond fisheries and agriculture. In 2015 production at a lithium plant in northern Chile that accounted for 30% of the world&#39;s output was disrupted by heavy rain. The ensuing jitters in the lithium market were not something forecasters had predicted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such diversity makes it hard to assess whether the overall effect of El Niño is positive or negative for the world economy. A study by researchers at the International Monetary Fund published in 2016 found that El Niño had little effect one way or the other. But a paper published earlier this year in <i>Science</i> by Christopher Callahan of Stanford University and Justin Mankin of Dartmouth College finds that the El Niño cycles of 1982-83 and 1997-98 permanently reduced global <small>gdp</small> by $4.1trn and $5.7trn respectively. The first cycle, however, coincided with a period when the Federal Reserve, America&#39;s central bank, was raising interest rates; the second with the Asian financial crisis. In both periods, in other words, as El Niño unfolded, other completely unrelated factors were also curbing economic growth in emerging markets. Disaggregating the impact of these different events is extremely difficult.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All analyses, however, agree that poor countries are hit harder by El Niño than rich ones. Even in the <small>IMF</small> study that found little overall impact, big costs in the developing world were offset by higher agricultural yields in the United States in particular. Inflation, meanwhile, rose almost everywhere as commodity prices jumped.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> ENSO on ENSO on</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The more severe the El Niño, naturally, the bigger the impact. According to the latest forecast from <small>NOAA</small> , the American government&#39;s meteorological agency, there is a 66% chance that the current one will be “strong”. The assessment rests on the rise in surface temperatures above the norm within a specific area of the Pacific known as “Niño 3.4”. A 1.5°C rise constitutes a strong event; more than 2°C counts as “very strong”, on a par with the biggest El Niños of the past century. The previous El Niño, in 2018-19, peaked inside Niño 3.4 at 0.9°C. A climatologist calls it a “little futz of an El Niño”. The one before that, in 2014-16, spanned two winters and peaked at 2.6°C (see chart). Global average temperatures reached successive records in 2015 and 2016. According to Michelle L&#39;Heureux, who co-ordinates <small>NOAA</small> ’s El Niño forecast updates, there is a 30% chance that this year&#39;s will end up just as mighty. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBC223.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Three factors are likely to compound this El Niño, bringing new extremes. First, it arrives right on the heels of three consecutive years of La Niña, the inverse of El Niño, when winds propel warm Pacific water more strongly than usual westward, towards Asia, temporarily reducing global temperatures. The wind patterns that dominate during La Niña tend to push heat deeper into the ocean. Some of that heat resurfaces during subsequent El Niños. Three straight years of La Niña mean there is more heat to be released.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But it is not just La Niña that has been storing heat in the world&#39;s oceans. So has global warming. For decades researchers have been taking the temperature not only at the surface but also at depths of up to 2,000 metres. Since the 1990s these deeper waters have been running an ever-rising fever. Some climate researchers are wondering whether the off-the-charts surface temperatures observed in the past month or so around the world&#39;s oceans could be linked to this pelagic flu.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although El Niño does cause surface temperatures to rise outside the Niño 3.4 region, that usually does not happen until much later in the year. A possible explanation of the early surge in temperatures is that some of the heat accumulated in the deep ocean is starting to resurface. “Perhaps we&#39;re beginning to see some of that redistribution of heat now manifesting itself,” says Piers Forster of the University of Leeds in Britain.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The theory that shifting thermal dynamics within the oceans may be intensifying this El Niño is not yet proved, but there is no question that global warming more broadly is set to make El Niños worse. “As climate change unfolds, the impacts for a given El Niño are not the same, they&#39;re bigger,” says Adam Scaife of the Met Office, Britain&#39;s meteorological agency. Global warming means the air is more charged with water, rainfall fluctuations are increasing, “and therefore, a given El Niño with the same strength as we had in the past can dump more water or cause a bigger drought.” Whereas the “triple dip” La Niña masked some warming, making temperatures cooler than they would otherwise have been, an El Niño will amplify it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “I am confident that 2024 will be unprecedented in terms of global temperatures,” says Dr Scaife. Currently, the planet is 1.26°C warmer than before the invention of the steam engine. As a rule of thumb, climatologists say, every degree of warming in the Niño 3.4 region during an El Niño temporarily adds 0.07°C to global average temperatures. A strong or very strong event could therefore push the total rise in the average temperature to 1.4°C.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That means that the regions that often suffer drought and wildfires during El Niño—Australia, Indonesia and parts of the Amazon Basin—are at heightened risk. In Australia alone, even the weak El Niño of 2019 helped to incinerate 240,000 square kilometres of bush, killing nearly 500 people, destroying thousands of homes and wiping out A$5bn ($3.5bn) of crops and livestock. This year&#39;s El Niño is likely to be compounded by the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole ( <small>IOD</small> ), a weather pattern characterised by fluctuating surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean that further accentuates dry conditions in Australia and Indonesia. Three years of heavy rains under La Niña, meanwhile, have boosted plant growth. Lingering moisture in the soil and plants may offer some protection. But if all that vegetation dries out, it will fuel fiercer blazes. To make matters worse, heavy rain and shortening winters have shrunk the window to carry out controlled burns, which are used to reduce the amount of fire-prone vegetation. New South Wales, Australia&#39;s most populous state, has conducted only 20% of its scheduled burn this year, according to Greg Mullins, a former fire commissioner.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Dipolar disorder</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>IOD</small> can also reinforce the wet conditions that El Niño typically brings to east Africa. On the face of things, that should be a positive after years of drought. But the rainfall is likely to be excessive, and might flood farmland and damage the roads used to bring crops to market. “We are on watch,” says Laura Harrison of the Climate Hazards Centre at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disasters of this sort will also create havoc in agricultural markets. As it is, India&#39;s government has declared a ban on exports of certain types of rice, in anticipation of drier-than-usual conditions while the current crop is growing. The ban affects about half of India&#39;s annual exports, which in total account for 40% of the global trade in rice by volume. It has sent world rice prices to their highest level since 2011.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The outlook for the rice market may get worse before it gets better. El Niños have in the past driven down rice yields: in 2015-16 South-East Asia&#39;s crop declined by 15m tonnes, 7% of global stocks. The spectre of potential shortages has prompted panic-buying among Asian governments since the beginning of the year. Indonesia, for example, has been snaffling up rice from Vietnam, the third-largest exporter after India and Thailand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Wheat, too, could be in for a wild ride. Australia produces 12-15% of the global crop and yields can halve in El Niño years. “Given the precarious situation of the wheat market, with the Russia-Ukraine war and other things, that Australian wheat crop is a very important one, and one we&#39;re watching closely,” says Paul Hughes of <small>S&amp;P</small> Global Commodity Insights, a research firm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Palm oil is another vulnerable product. A drought in Indonesia and Malaysia, the two biggest exporters, would diminish yields. <small>S&amp;P</small> Global reckons that Malaysian exports could fall by 10% if the incipient El Niño is mild and double that if it is severe. After Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine last year, palm oil helped make up for a dearth of sunflower oil, 75% of which is normally produced by the two adversaries. El Niño will thus come as a second blow to the already stretched market for edible oils. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Fishermen take a break after fishing anchovy" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FBP003.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Not what they wanted for Christmas</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Reuters</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another likely outcome of a strong El Niño is an increase in disease. Viruses replicate more quickly in vectors like mosquitoes as temperatures rise. Mosquitoes also bite more in the heat. Heavy rainfall creates more places for insects to breed, as can droughts, as people collect more water in accessible receptacles. Research collated by the World Health Organisation found that the dry conditions associated with El Niños across two decades boosted malaria cases in Colombia and Venezuela by more than a third. A strong El Niño in 1997-98 was associated with big malaria epidemics in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. This year heavy rains and floods exacerbated Peru&#39;s worst-ever outbreak of dengue, overwhelming hospitals in the north.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Flooding can result in poor sanitation, causing an increase in diarrheal diseases. The displacement and overcrowding that occurs after disaster strikes makes such outbreaks worse. If the Horn of Africa is indeed drenched by rain, a surge in cholera cases is likely.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Malnutrition exacerbates vulnerability to disease, particularly in the very young or very old. Save the Children, a charity, claims that the disruption brought by the El Niño of 2015-16 left an additional 6m children worldwide undernourished, three times the number affected in the same way by covid-19. And the pandemic has left health services overstretched and weakened. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a health charity, estimates that covid led to the biggest sustained decline in immunisation rates in 30 years, prompting a surge in outbreaks of preventable illnesses such as measles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The fact that many of these ill-effects are foreseeable does at least mean that governments and aid agencies can try to prepare for them. Since 2015 the humanitarian community has increasingly been incorporating seasonal forecasts into their planning, explains Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a climate forecaster at Columbia University and the Red Cross. In Honduras, for instance, the Red Cross activated an emergency protocol at the end of June based on the El Niño forecast issued by <small>NOAA</small> . It is distributing cash and kits to sanitise water to places at risk of drought.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But careful preparation only gets you so far, especially in poor countries with weak institutions and widespread corruption. Since the last strong El Niño, Peru has shuffled through six presidents. Precious little of the $14bn set aside for rebuilding and climate-proofing had been invested before floods and landslides hit the same areas again this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> More climate-related disasters will probably only deepen popular discontent and dysfunctional politics in Peru, further eroding the government&#39;s capacity to respond. In fact, oscillations in the climate have spurred the rise and fall of civilisations in South America for thousands of years. El Niño, writes author Brian Fagan, “can destroy the people&#39;s faith in the legitimacy of their leaders and in the foundations of their society”. Fempellec, a legendary ruler of an ancient Peruvian kingdom, provides a salutary example. According to myth, after sustained, unseasonable rains laid waste to crops, his people decided he was to blame. So they tied him up and tossed him into the sea. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more coverage of climate change, sign up for the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-climate-issue">Climate Issue</a> , our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our <a href="https://www.economist.com/climate-change">climate-change hub</a> .</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 24 Aug 2023 12:47:07 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/d56htlo5ta05tv3jtuuopgtfdsgg62sh</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/24/el-nino-and-global-warming-are-mixing-in-alarming-and-unpredictable-ways </item><item><title><![CDATA[China’s defeated youth]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Generation%20Stagnation-5b74b0eeebb6f535254c9a4bbc148da0.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>N THE SOUTHERN</small> city of Huizhou an electronics factory is hiring. The monthly salary on offer is between 4,500 and 6,000 yuan (or $620 and $830), enough to pay for food and essentials, but not much else. The advertisement says new employees are expected to “work hard and endure hardship”. The message might have resonated with Chinese of an older generation, many of whom worked long hours in poor conditions to give their children a brighter future. But many of those children now face similar drudgery—and are unwilling to endure it. “I can&#39;t sit on an assembly line,” says Zhang, a 20-something barista with dyed-red hair at a local tea shop. He scoffs at the idea of making such sacrifices for so little gain. The job at the tea shop pays just 4,000 yuan a month, but he enjoys chatting up customers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before you dismiss Zhang as just another Gen <small>Z</small> moper, consider that he has been working for seven years, including time spent in a factory. He sends half of his wages after rent back home to support his parents. He sees no hope of buying a house or making enough money to get married and have children. Working at the electronics factory in Huizhou would not improve his situation by much; and in other ways it would make him miserable. “Hard work is important,” he says. “But eating bitterness will make you unhappy.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Across China young people are disillusioned. They have been raised on stories of economic dynamism and social mobility. The Chinese economy more than doubled in size every ten years from 1978, when Communist Party leaders first adopted market reforms, until 2018. City kids could study hard, get into a good university and expect a white-collar job upon graduation. Lucky students from small towns or the countryside might do the same and make their way into the middle class. Less-educated young people had fewer options. But they could travel to cities, where rising wages in factories or on building sites were enough to start a family.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the decades before Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China had also been more open. Party leaders Jiang Zemin (1989-2002) and Hu Jintao (2002-12) were hardly liberals. But they left some space for civil society, intellectuals and the media to operate. Private enterprise flourished. Firms were encouraged to go out into the world and learn from the West. More and more Chinese travelled and studied abroad. A dynamic, aspirational, even hedonistic consumer and digital culture emerged. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC161.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For young people today, though, the outlook is much gloomier. The economy is struggling and they are feeling the worst of it. Unemployment among urban Chinese aged 16 to 24 has been running at over 20% for months, about double the age group&#39;s pre-pandemic level (see chart 1). The official job numbers for this group are so stubbornly awful that China recently <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/17/chinas-consumers-officials-and-statisticians-all-lack-confidence">stopped publishing</a> them altogether. Higher education is no longer a reliable ladder to a solid career. Our calculations show that in 2021 over 70% of those unemployed youngsters were graduates. Along with scarce jobs, they face sky-high property prices. Their modest dreams of finding work, buying a house and supporting a family seem increasingly out of reach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To get a sense of how young people feel, we have interviewed dozens of them. Their message is strikingly consistent. “We have no hope,” says a 27-year-old in Huizhou. The malaise felt by him and his cohort has led to the emergence of a new nihilistic vocabulary, featuring phrases such as<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/03/china-urges-its-people-to-struggle-some-say-no"><i>tang</i> <i>ping</i> (lying flat)</a> and <i>bailan</i> (letting it rot). Using sentiment-analysis tools to extract feelings from text on social media, we found that the mood of young Chinese is growing ever darker.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That should trouble officials in Beijing. Some 360m Chinese (a quarter of the population) are between the ages of 16 and 35. Their gloom has profound implications for the future of China, its economy and the party&#39;s ambitions. But rather than soothe the young, the government tends to scold them. Last year Mr Xi said they must “abandon arrogance and pampering”. Editorials in state media encourage them to “embrace struggle” and sacrifice their youth to the cause of national rejuvenation, as defined by the party. Repression is increasing. “Eat bitterness,” Mr Xi tells youngsters. His admonition, though a worn Chinese cliché, is sure to strike a nerve among people such as the barista in Huizhou.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The grind</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not as if young Chinese do not work hard. From an early age they face enormous pressure to do well in school and ace China&#39;s notoriously tough university-entrance exam, known as the <i>gaokao</i> . Nearly 13m youngsters took it this year. Many of them will have spent years cramming at the expense of other activities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet there is a growing feeling among young people that no matter how hard they study or work, they will not be rewarded with a better quality of life. They speak of <i>neijuan</i> , or “involution”, an academic word used to describe a situation in which extra input no longer yields more output. The idea was captured in “A Love for Dilemma”, a popular <small>TV</small> drama released in 2021. In the show, two characters liken the competition in educational attainment to an unruly audience at a cinema: someone stands up to get a clearer view, which obliges everyone behind them to stand. Then people climb on seats and ladders. But in the end, despite all of their effort, no one is able to see the screen any better.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The data support this sense of <i>neijuan</i> . As the number of university graduates has increased, the number of jobs for which they are suited has not risen at anywhere near the same rate. It has not helped that a large number of youngsters who decided to extend their studies during the pandemic are also now joining the job market, creating an even bigger surfeit of graduates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One problem is a mismatch between the skills that graduates are acquiring from school and those required by employers. According to one academic study of Zhaopin, a recruitment portal, 39% of job-seekers in first-tier cities had at least two surplus years of education, over and above those required by the jobs they sought. Outside these big cities, the proportion was more like 70%. Tales abound on social media of educated young people taking low-skilled jobs, such as sorting trash. One cigarette-maker hired students with master&#39;s degrees for its production line.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Young Chinese once dreamed of being lucky enough to get jobs in tech. Jack Ma, the idolised founder of Alibaba, proudly espoused a “996” culture, referring to a work schedule of 9am to 9pm, six days a week, often without extra pay. But in recent years tech workers began to complain of feeling like drones with dim prospects (made dimmer more recently with lay-offs). During an online outpouring of grievances in 2019, Mr Ma responded, perhaps unconvincingly, that “being able to work 996 is a huge blessing.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many young people now seek poorly paid but more stable government jobs that were once scorned by ambitious types. About 2.6m people sat exams for such positions last year, up from 1.4ma decade earlier. Only one in every 70 got one. Even jobs in provincial backwaters have become more attractive. Wu Xiaomei, 23, is from Guizhou, a remote mountainous province in the south-west. She complains that more people have been moving there from nearby provinces where the exams to gain work as a teacher are more competitive. That has made it tougher for locals to get such jobs. Ms Wu ended up teaching in a small-town school in another nearby province with less competition.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Those born in such places have the most difficult time moving up in the world. They have little chance of getting into a good university in a big city, where the admissions system favours locals. Most are stuck in low-skilled service jobs, such as delivering food in cities. The <i>hukou</i> system, a household registry, forces most who migrate to cities to live precarious lives, without access to local benefits like medical insurance. Since the mid-2010s, the wage growth of blue-collar workers has slowed significantly, according to a study led by Scott Rozelle of Stanford University. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC193.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Whether their collars are white or blue, few youngsters earn enough to buy a house in a good location (see chart 2). Between 1998 and 2021 homes in Chinese cities became four times less affordable, judged by the ratio of average house prices to median disposable incomes. In the capital, Beijing, this ratio rose to 25 in 2021, more than twice that of London. While ruing their inability to afford a nice home, the young can also look forward to a growing burden of caring for their parents and grandparents, due to the demographic distortions wrought by nearly 40 years of the one-child policy (see chart 3). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC182.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile, the relatively open cultural atmosphere of the Hu and Jiang eras has vanished under Mr Xi. He has replaced it with an “empire of tedium”, to borrow a phrase from Geremie Barmé, a noted sinologist. Censorship has become far more heavy-handed. Chatter on the internet has turned into a dreary chorus of nationalist talking points. On Chinese television depictions of “effeminate men” and women&#39;s cleavage have been banned. Video games have been deemed too much fun; authorities have ordered the removal of gore and tried to limit kids&#39; playing hours.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At entertainment venues, bands are asked to send authorities videos of their sets before gigs. Directors of plays know that in the audience there are people checking that actors stick to approved scripts. Comedians plead for their audiences not to record them. Earlier this year Li Haoshi, a Beijing-based comic, used an army slogan—“Forge exemplary conduct! Fight to win!”—in a joke about how his dogs eagerly chased a squirrel. That was deemed insulting to the armed forces. Media companies were told not to hire the comic. Police said he was under investigation for causing a bad influence on society.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Xi has also tightened control over China&#39;s education system. Foreign textbooks were banned in 2020. The same year, schools across the country undertook to remove books that authorities said could “damage societal stability” or promote “deviant” values. Since 2021 students at primary and secondary schools have been assigned turgid texts devoted to Mr Xi&#39;s personal ideology. Universities have been told to become “strongholds of the Communist Party&#39;s leadership”. Several liberal scholars have been dismissed. Officials want Chinese history to be taught in a way that glorifies the party. To do otherwise is deemed “historical nihilism”. In 2021 a government hotline was set up for citizens to report such nihilism if they see it online.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The conservative turn has been especially hard on young women. Feminist activists are under close scrutiny. Authorities kept a tight lid on #MeToo activism. Sexism is rampant. In a survey by Zhaopin, the recruitment portal, 61% of women graduates said they were asked about their marriage and child-bearing status when applying for jobs, compared with just 32% of men. Women were also less likely to secure a job before graduation. A discouraging message about their future comes straight from the top. For the first time in decades the Politburo has no female member.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Let it rot</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dejected and demoralised, young people still find places to vent online. Baidu Tieba is a Reddit-like forum where discussions take place in various sub-groups organised by subject. We wrote a program to download posts from three sub-groups focusing on people born in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. We analysed over 150,000 contributions from 2019 to mid-2023, applying an algorithm to detect the presence of positive, negative or neutral words. Terms like <i>bailan</i> (let it rot), for example, are tagged as negative. Using this information, the algorithm then classified the posts as positive, negative or neutral in sentiment. The results show an improvement in the collective mood after the government lifted its draconian zero-covid restrictions in December. But, in general, China&#39;s young people have been growing more pessimistic in recent years (see chart 4). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBC162.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Our findings come with caveats. We have focused on a single platform, which may not be representative of other social media in China. Indeed, our results could be subject to selection effects, where users of different dispositions flock to certain sites. Baidu Tieba tends to attract an older crowd. And algorithms have trouble detecting irony and sarcasm.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless, the results are worthy of discussion. Take the differences across generations. Those born in the 1980s are the least glum. Growing up in hardship, they experienced the benefits of reform and opening and took advantage of the opportunities presented by China&#39;s economic boom. Those born in the 1990s, by contrast, are the most downbeat. They grew up during the boom years, in the heyday of globalisation, but are entering the workforce just as the economy stagnates and China turns inward. Some may once have entertained hopes of political liberalisation, which were gradually snuffed out as Mr Xi consolidated power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disillusioned youngsters commonly express feelings of exhaustion and resignation. Some talk of “lying flat”, or dropping out of the rat race and abandoning material ambitions that do not seem attainable. The notion of “letting it rot” is even more nihilistic: it describes an attitude of self-indulgence. Those born in the 1990s used this phrase most often in our analysis. For a sense of what it means in practice, consider Qin, whom we met in Huizhou. He is 30 and used to work in a factory. The pay was not enough for him to afford much of a life. Clutching a beer outside an internet bar, he says he now has a part-time job in construction. “I work a few days, then play a few days.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Young people are pulling back in other ways, too. “Why would I get married? Why would I go on a date?” asks Qin, citing the cost of each. High house prices are a particular concern for young men because home-ownership is often seen as a prerequisite for marriage. Dowries, which more traditional families demand for marrying their daughters, have been increasing. Some ask for sums that would bankrupt prospective grooms and their families. Such economic burdens, along with changing societal views, have resulted in a decline in marriages. Around 6.8m couples got hitched last year, about half the number of a decade ago.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A surprising number of young couples are not even having sex. In a survey conducted in 2020, 14.6% and 10.1% of partnered men and women born between 1995 and 2003 reported having had no sex in the past year. A trio of scholars at Peking University and Fudan University, evaluating these figures, wrote, “Whether and why sex has lost its appeal for a large fraction of young people needs to be further studied.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> None of this bodes well for China&#39;s dismal fertility rate (the number of children a woman can be expected to have in her lifetime). It fell to a historic low of 1.2 in 2021—far below the replacement rate of 2.1. Besides home prices, analysts point to the rocketing cost of child-rearing as a factor. YuWa Population Research, a think-tank in Beijing, calculated the average cost of raising a first child to the age of 18 at 485,000 yuan ($67,000) in 2019. That equated to nearly seven times China&#39;s <small>gdp</small> per person, one of the highest rates in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Efforts to remedy the situation have been unsuccessful. In 2016 the government swapped the one-child policy for a two-children-per-couple limit. In 2021 it switched to a three-children policy, now more a goal than a cap. Incentives such as cash handouts, tax breaks and longer maternity leave have not made much difference. Last year, when a young man was told by police that the punishment for violating pandemic-control rules would affect his family for three generations, he responded, “We are the last generation, thank you.” The exchange, caught on video, went viral, his defiant words transformed into another cynical meme (until it was censored).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some young people who can afford to are looking to leave China. Last year netizens took to using a Chinese character that sounds like the English word <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/05/05/chinas-young-elite-are-considering-moving-abroad">“run”</a> as a coded way of talking about emigration. Reports of well-heeled Chinese leaving for places such as Singapore are common. The number of Chinese trying to get to the United States via Latin America has <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/08/14/return-to-china-xing-would-rather-die-in-the-jungle">surged</a> .</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Eat this</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s leaders are not blind to these trends, but they are not wholly sympathetic. Mr Xi cites the gruelling hardships suffered by previous generations of youngsters as a model to emulate, not a nightmare to leave behind. He came of age during the Cultural Revolution, a period of Maoist madness from 1966 to 1976. (Mr Xi&#39;s father was one of many officials deemed insufficiently loyal and tortured; his half-sister took her own life.) Only a teenager at the time, Mr Xi was sent to the countryside, along with millions of other city dwellers, to learn from the peasants. Unable to cope, he ran back to Beijing. But after being returned to the village, he learned the virtues of hard work, according to party lore. Mr Xi was supposedly the first to jump into the cesspool to shovel manure. He believes today&#39;s youngsters should seek their own enlightening hardships.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, he has tried to respond to some of the underlying causes of young people&#39;s despair. Policymakers have repeated the mantra that “housing is for living in, not for speculation”, a slogan that reflects concern for people priced out of owning a home by people who own several. Regulators have urged e-commerce firms like Meituan, a food-delivery company, to improve pay and conditions for gig workers, softening the algorithms that punish them for late deliveries. They also cracked down on private tutoring businesses after Mr Xi warned that the industry had become a “social problem”, exploiting the educational anxieties of China&#39;s parents.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This regulatory storm, as it became known, was part of Mr Xi&#39;s grander pursuit of “common prosperity”, an effort to narrow inequality and “improve the channels of upward mobility” that many disillusioned youngsters believe are blocked. Along the way authorities made examples of some of China&#39;s wealthiest business celebrities by arresting them or, as with Mr Ma of Alibaba, forcing them out of public life. Mr Ma gave up control of his company and now lives in relative obscurity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the government&#39;s moves have mostly backfired. The public humiliation of tech entrepreneurs was a punch in the stomach for ambitious youngsters inspired by their example (though young leftists have celebrated the party&#39;s humbling of billionaires). And the regulatory crackdowns on their companies, as well as on property developers, have hobbled some of the most reliable employers of China&#39;s university-educated youth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Communist Party propaganda has played down the young generation&#39;s jobless woes. The <i>Economic Daily</i> , a party newspaper, said in July that many youngsters were simply choosing “slow employment”—a phrase that was widely mocked online. A recent report from the China Macroeconomy Forum, a think-tank at Renmin University of China, takes a dimmer view. It concluded the problem of youth unemployment may not abate for a decade, with potentially bigger ramifications for the country&#39;s leadership. “If it is not handled properly, it will cause other social problems beyond the economy, and it could even ignite the fuse of political problems,” the report said.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Disaffected young people are a <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/01/21/might-freedom-seeking-youths-rise-up-again">recurrent wild card</a> in Chinese politics. In 1919 thousands of students took to the streets to protest against China&#39;s harsh treatment by its allies at the end of the first world war and to demand modernising reforms. During the Cultural Revolution, young people again took centre-stage when Mao Zedong unleashed his Red Guards, many of them teenagers. And in 1989 students flocked to Tiananmen Square in Beijing to demand more freedoms. Thousands may have been killed in the crackdown that followed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Since then students have played a far more muted role in political life. Three years of harsh covid-19 controls pushed some to breaking point. In November, after deaths from a fire in Xinjiang were blamed on covid restrictions, young people <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows">gathered in the streets</a> and on campuses across China to protest. They held up blank sheets of paper in a nod to China&#39;s curbs on free expression. But these protesters probably numbered in the hundreds, not thousands, in a country of 1.4bn. More broadly there appears to be no real sense of revolutionary zeal among today&#39;s youth.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> No-motivation nation</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The danger China&#39;s leaders face is not so much a social eruption as social erosion, an unspectacular but unremitting loss of the “vitality, stamina and hope” that Mr Xi claims the young can impart to Chinese socialism. This enervation might manifest itself in a variety of ways. Chinese women may give birth later or not at all, contributing to a decline in population. Forecasts for China&#39;s economy often assume rates of childbirth will enjoy a modest rebound, based on the record of other low-fertility countries. But most of those reference points are European countries with strong welfare systems that permit a better balance between family and career.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China is relying on increases in “human capital” (like education) to offset its decrease in humans. But the lying-flat phenomenon and high graduate unemployment show that is not enough. The tightening grip of the authorities over civil society, popular culture and entrepreneurs also would seem to discourage the risk-taking that marked earlier generations.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some of China&#39;s best-educated youngsters will no doubt emigrate. Others are seeking a different kind of safe harbour. Applications for the civil service are expected to jump again this year. And the share of graduates ranking state-owned enterprises as their first-choice employer has increased for three years in a row, according to the survey by Zhaopin. These businesses offer stability and security over dynamism and ingenuity. If China is to become the more innovative economy Mr Xi demands, it cannot afford to lose too many of its best minds to its least efficient firms. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A delivery rider takes a rest on his bike in Beijing" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_FBP001.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">Phoning it in</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: AP</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Does Mr Xi understand this? His thoughts on how to achieve national greatness have evolved, along with his message to young people. A few months after coming to power in 2012 he met a group of young entrepreneurs, volunteers and students, telling them to “dare to dream, to bravely chase their dreams and to strive to fulfil them”. Their ambitions will make China great, he said. One beaming participant, who had recently climbed Mount Everest, said it was a good time to be young.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Now, though, Mr Xi says the “Chinese Dream” of national rejuvenation is to be achieved by focusing on collective goals, rather than by encouraging individual aspirations. He admonishes the young to obey the party and toughen up—to “engrave the blood of their youth on the monuments of history, just as our fathers did.” That is a message that relatively few young people are taking to heart. Told to eat bitterness, they prefer to let it rot. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 17 Aug 2023 09:02:18 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qabpdca5tvlp08j1g9d8eh50q6ig41d7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/17/chinas-defeated-youth </item><item><title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia is spending a fortune on sport]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20Global%20sport-dfd7e75ad9bee9509953215809856f32.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>O</span> <small>n august</small> <small>11th</small> Saudi Arabia&#39;s biggest football competition, the Saudi Pro League, will kick off for the 2023-24 season. Last season&#39;s tournament did not exactly set pulses racing. Just 9,300 fans attended games on average. For three of the past five seasons the top scorer has been Abderrazak Hamdallah, a Moroccan who has not played for any of the world&#39;s top clubs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But this season may be different. Mr Hamdallah&#39;s team, Al Ittihad, has just signed Karim Benzema, winner of the 2022 Ballon d&#39;Or award for best player in the world, from Real Madrid, and N&#39;Golo Kante, a star midfielder from Chelsea. Cristiano Ronaldo, a five-time winner of the Ballon d&#39;Or, moved to Al Nassr, another Saudi club, in January from Manchester United. Former Liverpool winger, Sadio Mané, joined him there, while Liverpool&#39;s captain, Jordan Henderson, signed for Al Ettifaq. The list goes on. Teams in the Saudi league have spent more than $480m on fees this summer, catapulting them among the biggest spenders in global football.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Pro League&#39;s moves are just one part of a multi-billion dollar push by Saudi Arabia into global sports, backed by Muhammad bin Salman, known as <small>mbs</small> , the country&#39;s crown prince and de facto ruler. It goes far beyond football and is roiling global golf, Formula 1 motor racing, boxing and more. <small>mbs</small> ’s ambition is to use sport to modernise Saudi Arabia, and to transform the outside world&#39;s perception of the desert kingdom of 36m people.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Saudi splurge is happening just as the global sports industry is being shaken by digital disruption and a new wave of private-equity investment. Cynics accuse <small>mbs</small> of vanity projects and “sportswashing”—using sport to whitewash the country&#39;s reputation for human-rights abuses. Saudi officials bridle at such criticism. Fahad Nazer of the Saudi embassy in Washington, <small>dc</small> , says the idea that the country is sportswashing “could not be further from the truth”. He says such claims reek of “ethnocentricity”: everything has been done with Saudi Arabia and its citizens—not Westerners—in mind, he says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many observers believe the moves will change not just Saudi Arabia, but global sport itself, wresting the initiative from stuffy Western guardians of teams and tournaments and introducing a dynamic new force. The spending has been going on for several years but until recently its full scope was obscured by a scatter-gun approach. Investments and negotiations have taken place in multiple layers of the sports industry, including buying players, purchasing foreign clubs, developing domestic clubs and buying or developing tournaments at home and abroad.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These deals have been pursued by a squad of Saudi entities including the government itself, the Public Investment Fund ( <small>pif</small> ), a sovereign wealth fund, and even Saudi Aramco, the oil firm that is the world&#39;s most profitable company. The scope is impressive, with at least $10bn spent across half a dozen major sports.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Howay, the lads</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 2021 a Saudi-led consortium took control of Newcastle United, a storied but struggling English Premier League ( <small>epl</small> ) team, for $391m. As well as developing its domestic league, there is intense speculation that Saudi Arabia will launch a bid to host the World Cup, perhaps in 2030, following in the footsteps of neighbouring Qatar in 2022. Gulf money is thought to have supported a 2021 attempt to create a European super league, which collapsed after opposition from fans.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In golf, America&#39;s main body, the <small>pga</small> Tour, has just agreed to a merger with <small>liv</small> Golf, a Saudi upstart tournament that threw the sport into turmoil by offering top players hundreds of millions of dollars to switch their allegiance. Europe&#39;s <small>dp</small> World Tour, another organising body, is also part of the deal. Donald Trump, whose courses host <small>liv</small> events, describes it as a “beautiful and glamorous deal”. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, two left-leaning senators, recently condemned “the Saudi regime&#39;s latest attempt to sanitise its abuses” in a public letter to the <small>us</small> Justice Department.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi Arabia hosts a new Formula 1 Grand Prix in Jeddah and is building a track near the capital, Riyadh; Saudi investors were reported to have considered bidding $20bn for the whole of Formula 1 last year. The Saudi sports minister dismissed the reports as “purely speculation”. Aramco remains a major sponsor of <small>f</small> 1.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An official at the men&#39;s <small>atp</small> tennis tour has admitted to “positive” talks with possible investors, <small>pif</small> among them. The women&#39;s tennis tour, the <small>wta</small> , is considering whether to hold an event in Saudi and an official recently visited. The kingdom now hosts big boxing matches, wrestling bouts and e-sports events. Despite its climate, it has also been selected to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A league of their own</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why is the country splurging on sports? Vanity and envy play a part. Many Saudi royals are fans. They have invested in teams elsewhere and now want some of their own. They also want to be taken seriously among the global sports elite. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the <small>pif</small> , is a golf nut. Documents released as part of recent congressional hearings into the <small>pga</small> Tour- <small>liv</small> deal suggest that one idea proposed as part of the transaction was that he might gain membership of Augusta, America&#39;s most exclusive club.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudis have watched as their neighbours have stepped up. The race began in 1993, says Danyel Reiche of Georgetown University in Qatar. That was when Qatar first hosted an <small>atp</small> men&#39;s tennis tournament (Boris Becker won). It spent $200bn preparing to host the 2022 World Cup. One of its royals also owns Paris St Germain, a top French club. Manchester City, owned by an Abu Dhabi royal, is now the world&#39;s most valuable football brand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the Saudi plan goes far beyond perks for its elites and keeping up with the neighbours. Buoyant energy prices and production mean that its oil exports are expected to surpass $166bn this year, or 16% of <small>gdp</small> . With a global energy transition looming, the kingdom&#39;s “Vision 2030” plan aims to diversify its economy away from oil by developing new industries and liberalising the economy, including by getting more women into the workforce. The <small>pif</small> is a key player, using its more than $700bn of funds to redeploy capital into new areas of the economy and make strategic investments in brands and technology.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The kingdom wants the Saudi Pro League to attract investment and fans. It aims to welcome 100m visitors a year by 2030 (there were 64m in 2021). Officials hope the league will quadruple its revenue to $480m by then, though that still pales beside, for instance, the <small>epl,</small> which generated ten times as much last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Sport, it is hoped, will have a spillover effect on the rest of the economy. Part of this is a rebranding exercise in a region known for religious strife, extremism and war. “It is better for everyone to be working together for prosperity in the region, not in conflict, and the Saudis want to be seen at the forefront of it,” explains Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A better brand and more events can boost the tourism sector, which the government hopes will increase from 3% of <small>gdp</small> in 2019 to 10% in 2030. When you want to become a holiday hotspot, star-power helps: Lionel Messi, perhaps football&#39;s greatest player, is a Saudi tourism ambassador and posts sun-drenched snaps to his 482m followers on Instagram.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Sport may even be useful as a mechanism to complement social reform. The Saudi government has in recent years become more accepting of the sexes mixing in public and has taken some steps to rein in its over-zealous religious police. Women were finally allowed to drive in 2018. Now it is backing women&#39;s sports as well as men&#39;s. The Saudi women&#39;s football team gained its first ranking from <small>fifa</small> in March. All of this may make the country more attractive to female tourists.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Across the region, hosting sports events has “generally been positively perceived by residents,” says Wadih Ishac, an assistant professor in sport management at Qatar University. Mr Nazer of the Saudi embassy in Washington points out that 70% of the Saudi population is under 35 and that young people love the sporting events.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The master plan faces two big risks. The first is that its business models may not work. Gulf owners can clearly run sports businesses well. Manchester City has thrived under its <small>uae</small> investor (though in February the <small>epl</small> accused it of allegedly breaking financial rules, a charge the club denies). During the first year of Saudi ownership, Newcastle United spent around £100m ($126m) and moved out of the relegation zone. In the second, the club came fourth, qualifying for the Champions League, Europe&#39;s main club competition, for the first time in 20 years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, within Saudi Arabia, sport is a state-backed, rather than an entrepreneurial, concern, with the problems that can entail. In June some top football clubs, previously under the control of the Ministry of Sports, were notionally privatised. But <small>pif</small> has a 75% stake in four teams. Aramco, the oil firm, has another team and <small>neom</small> , a metropolis being built in the desert, has one in the second division, too. “It&#39;s almost like football clubs have become quangos in Saudi Arabia,” says Simon Chadwick of Skema Business School in Paris. Rather than a new dynamic engine of the economy, sports could become a manifestation of its old, state-run patronage system.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In order to attract stars, salaries must be huge. Mr Benzema reportedly signed a two-year contract worth $440m and Mr Ronaldo is rumoured to be earning $200m per year. Al Hilal this summer offered a record-smashing bid of €300m ($330m) to Paris St Germain for Kylian Mbappé, a French star, who so far has declined. Phil Mickelson, a golfer, pocketed $200m from <small>liv</small> Golf despite once describing the Saudis as “scary motherfuckers” (he later apologised). Colossal wage bills mean even the most successful European teams struggle to make money. Over half of the teams in the <small>epl</small> made losses in 2022, and overall the leagues in Italy, Germany and Spain are in the red. (Exor, which has a stake in <i>The Economist</i> ’s parent company, is also an investor in Juventus, an Italian football club, and Ferrari, an Italian carmaker.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thanks to its oil wealth, the Saudi experiment will not break the bank. According to <small>pif</small> ’s annual report in 2021, leisure and entertainment accounted for just 1.6% of its assets. But the combination of low domestic revenues and high costs may mean many Saudi sports ventures cannot sustain themselves or compete globally without subsidies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi Arabia may face some of the same issues with football as China, which tried to raise the fortunes of its Chinese Super League in the past decade. Expensive imported stars may grumble about the standard of football and there will be plenty of scepticism about the sustainability of the current level of spending. But the state&#39;s backing for the league will negate the financial problems and political scrutiny which have hampered the Chinese project. The Saudis are also trying to attract younger talent, and not just be like the United States, where many top players from European clubs have traditionally gone to play out their twilight years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Saudi&#39;s smallish domestic audience may also impede its ambitions. There is an example of an emerging economy taking a dominant role in the business operations of a global sport. In 2008 India launched the Indian Premier League ( <small>ipl</small> ), a cricket tournament. Last year the rights to show matches over the next five years were sold for more than $6bn, making it the world&#39;s second-most lucrative sports league per game after the <small>nfl</small> , an American-football competition. India&#39;s financial clout has given it a powerful voice over cricket worldwide. But the foundation of India&#39;s success has been the sheer scale of the audience there, with 1.4bn cricket-mad citizens. Saudi cannot rival that. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Collage showing sports players Dustin Johnson and Jordan Henderson" width="1844" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Israel Vargas/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second big danger is that the surge triggers a backlash. Sport can be a sensitive industry in which to invest and Saudi Arabia&#39;s status as an autocratic state does not help. Several human-rights groups have accused the Saudis of sportswashing, for instance when <small>fifa</small> awarded them the Club World Cup for 2023.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a new spin on an old idea, of nasty regimes using sports to show off their political models, as Mussolini did with the World Cup in 1934 and Hitler with the Olympics in 1936. East Germany and the Soviet Union had state-sponsored doping programmes in the 1970s and 1980s. More recently China was accused of sportswashing when it hosted the Winter Olympics last year, as was Russia when it staged the football World Cup in 2018. Qatar faced plenty of blowback in 2022, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Today critics point to Saudi Arabia&#39;s dearth of democratic freedoms and suppression of women&#39;s and gay rights. The gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken journalist, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 has not been forgotten, nor has the kingdom&#39;s central role in the <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/09/can-yemen-hold-together">bloody war in Yemen</a> .</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Insular peninsula</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet Saudi Arabia&#39;s autocratic politics will probably not prevent it from taking a growing role in global sports. Qualification for the Champions League has gone a long way to stilling criticism of Saudi investment in Newcastle United. President Joe Biden, having described the kingdom as a “pariah” in 2019, is now keen to repair America&#39;s alliance. But its reputation may make deals more fiddly. The proposed <small>pga</small> Tour- <small>liv</small> golf merger has created a stink and is being assessed by the <small>us</small> Justice Department to see if it violates antitrust law.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>pga</small> Tour executives were hauled before a Senate committee last month. Senator Richard Blumenthal complained that a gagging clause in the deal, which could stop players from badmouthing Saudi Arabia, is “about as broad a non-disparagement clause as I have ever seen”. The deal&#39;s backers at the <small>pga</small> Tour are doubtless keen to suggest the Saudis will have a backseat role: probably a very different vision from that of <small>mbs</small> , in which the Saudis are in control and no longer just the “dumb money”. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC114.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But even if some deals do not transform the country in the way <small>mbs</small> hopes, Saudi Arabia is part of a broader shift that is changing global sports. The surge in capital from the kingdom is part of the rise of a new cohort of sovereign and private-equity funds that are investing in sports at scale. Bloomberg reported that private-equity firms spent $51bn on sports transactions in 2021, nearly double the total of 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ownership rules are being liberalised as clubs and tournaments seek new sources of capital to stay competitive. American sports leagues are the world&#39;s best at raking in money (see chart 1). Since 2019, several big American leagues have relaxed their rules to allow minority investments by institutional investors. In July Qatar&#39;s investment authority reached a deal to buy 5% of the parent company of the Washington Wizards, an American basketball team. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230812_FBC085.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Digital disruption has also finally reached live sports, which had been one of the last bastions of traditional television (see chart 2). Increasingly viewers who have “cut the cord” on television instead watch sports through streaming services which offer live games but also on-demand highlights, analysis and other digital add-ons. This digital shift is being accompanied by unexpected swirls and shifts in audiences. For example, Formula 1, once notable for having little presence in the United States, is now gaining some traction there, boosted by tie-ups with Netflix.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Saudi&#39;s sports splurge partly reflects the dynamics within the kingdom: a new flood of petrodollars; <small>mbs</small> ’s ambition to create a more socially liberal society and to restore his tarnished reputation in the West. But the moves also reflect a sense that there is a new window of opportunity in global sports: to grab bigger and newer audiences, to create different kinds of events and tournaments and to reinvent old ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The latest annual report from <small>pif</small> , released this week, includes the announcement of a sports-specific investment vehicle, hinting at broader future plans. Mr Benzema and Mr Ronaldo are likely to be hitting the back of the net come the autumn. The kingdom itself has plenty of other goals of its own. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 10 Aug 2023 09:43:51 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/mgpccuuoqi169phpnfcir925l82ddj1u</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/10/saudi-arabia-is-spending-a-fortune-on-sport </item><item><title><![CDATA[Could America’s economy escape recession?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/013%20Briefing%20-%20The%20American%20economy-bf961e49c10312b0be271e3b672c368f.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>s covid-19 spread</small> throughout the world three years ago, many pored over the history of a previous pandemic, the Spanish flu of 1918-19, for clues about how the disaster would unfold. Now that the plague has abated, history may also provide a few lessons for the aftermath. As the first world war and the Spanish flu receded, interest rates were low and government spending high. Inflation surged. In order to bring prices back under control, America&#39;s central bankers cranked rates up, triggering a severe recession. The Federal Reserve described its actions in 1921 as “painful but…unavoidable” following “an unprecedented orgy of extravagance”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These days Fed officials tend to avoid the word orgy, but they are wrestling with similar circumstances. They have been raising rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s. Hawkish economists argue that, to quell inflation, the Fed will have to raise them yet higher, even though that would certainly raise unemployment and probably induce a recession. Doves counter that the Fed has already gone too far and that further economic pain is unnecessary. A third possibility, that the Fed is getting things just right, and that the economy will slow and inflation dissipate without a recession (a “soft landing” in the jargon), was until recently seen as nigh on impossible.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> An orgy of tightening</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The odds are still stacked against it. Since March 2022 the Fed has lifted short-term interest rates from 0% to 5%. Such rapid jumps tend to go hand-in-hand with recessions. As higher rates raise the cost of borrowing, they drag down both spending by consumers and investment by companies. As a general rule, the bigger the increase in rates, the bigger the drag. Thus, for much of the past year, the dominant view on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms has been that America&#39;s economy would end up in a funk. As of June, the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg pegged the probability of a recession in the next 12 months at about 65%. The Conference Board, a business group, put the probability at 99% in February. Stanley Druckenmiller, Silicon Valley&#39;s favourite macroeconomic prognosticator, recently said that he expects a “hard landing”, involving a slump in corporate profits and a big rise in unemployment. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC893.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The gloomiest portent has been an extreme inversion of yield curves. Normally, rates on long-term bonds are higher than on those with short terms because investors expect extra compensation for the risk of holding securities that mature well into the future. When short-term yields are higher, the implication is that investors expect the central bank to cut rates, typically because they think growth is set to weaken. Inversions have a nearly perfect record in foreshadowing recessions in America over the past half-century, and they have been screaming trouble for some time now. Yield curves inverted for the first time in this economic cycle in October 2022, and are now deeply upside-down. The lag from the onset of inversion to the dawn of recession averages about 350 days, which would put the start of a potential recession in September. The Fed&#39;s New York branch calculates the probability of a recession based on the yield curve. In May it put the odds of one at more than 70%, the highest since 1982 (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other indicators confirm this bleak outlook. Consumer sentiment, as measured by a closely watched survey from the University of Michigan, plunged to an all-time low last year. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and a couple of other financial institutions in March provided evidence that the rapid rate hikes are harming vulnerable firms, and the ensuing financial instability added to economic headwinds. Banks have made their lending standards much stricter, another sign of a looming recession. Smaller businesses—the lifeblood of America&#39;s economy—remain extremely pessimistic. Manufacturing is already contracting, with output down since late in 2022. The debate among economists has been less about whether a recession is coming and more about whether it will be long or short, deep or shallow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the past couple of weeks, though, the mood has shifted. Despite the many ill omens, the most important indicator of the economy&#39;s health—the labour market—has remained amazingly resilient. The unemployment rate sits at just 3.6%, a smidgen above a five-decade low. A brief rise in claims for unemployment insurance during the spring has petered out. America has added new jobs for 30 consecutive months, lifting total employment to about its pre-pandemic level.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At the same time, inflation is receding. In the year to June 2022 consumer prices leapt by 9.1%. In the year to this June they rose by just 3%, the smallest increase in more than two years. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, is higher, but after a few months of stasis is moving in the right direction again. As post-pandemic supply-chain snarls untangle, the cost of most goods is rising only slowly, and in some cases falling. Rents, hitherto a big element of inflation, are falling according to private indices, and are likely to start declining soon in the official data, too. Labour costs are still rising, but the rate of increase has slowed, which bodes well for the prices of restaurant meals, car repairs, tax accounting and more.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To say that the combination of ebbing inflation and a robust labour market is unexpected is an understatement: many economists had assumed it was impossible. They had believed that there was a short-term trade-off between jobs and prices: that, all else being equal, a low unemployment rate is associated with a rising inflation rate, a relationship known as the Phillips curve. In the decade before the pandemic the Phillips curve had come into question, because inflation remained quiescent even though the jobless rate plunged. But the resurgence of inflation last year brought the Phillips curve back into fashion, in part because the labour market appeared to have become less efficient after the pandemic. Debate focused not on whether unemployment would need to go up for inflation to come down, but rather on just how many people would need to lose their jobs before prices were brought under control. In one much-discussed speech last year, Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, said the jobless rate might need to climb as high as 10%.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A bacchanal of employment</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America does have an ultra-tight labour market: too many companies competing to hire too few workers. That would normally lead to sharply rising wages and thus higher inflation. The obvious way to curb that inflation, in turn, would be to inflict enough pain on companies through higher interest rates that they resort to widespread lay-offs. But another way to bring the labour market into balance is to increase the supply of workers. That has happened to a certain extent: fully 84% of those of those aged 25-54 have jobs or are looking for work, the highest share since 2002. It also helps that immigrants—a vital, if politically contentious, part of the American labour force—have returned: more than 1m arrived last year, the highest figure since 2017. Since February 2020 the economy has added nearly 4m jobs, much faster growth than the long-term trend. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC003.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Employers, meanwhile, have been hesitant to fire workers. Some may well be hoarding them, having found it very difficult to recruit enough over the past couple of years. Instead of firing staff, they are cutting back on hiring. The net result of more workers and fewer help-wanted ads is a slightly calmer labour market, despite the lack of lay-offs. Goldman Sachs calculates that there are roughly 3.2m more jobs than workers in America at the moment. That is still above 2m, which it considers the maximum for a not-too-tight, not-too-loose jobs market, but the overshoot is well down from its peak of 5.7m early in 2022. As the number of vacancies has declined, the relentless upward march of wages has eased somewhat (see chart 2). Economists at the doveish end of the spectrum are beginning to trumpet these achievements, if not quite declare victory. “The economy is defying predictions that inflation would not fall absent significant job destruction,” Lael Brainard, head of the National Economic Council, said on July 12th.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Two additional things help explain America&#39;s run of good fortune. First, the looming problems were probably overstated because of pandemic oddities. Economists&#39; models of the probability of a recession have for months been flashing red. But there is reason to think the models may be giving unreliable signals. They are designed to predict trouble whenever there are abrupt shifts in the data. Recently, though, such shifts have reflected a return to normal after the pandemic, rather than incipient economic weakness. People are buying markedly fewer laptops and exercise bikes than they did in 2020, for instance, not because they are cutting back sharply on spending but because they are not working from home as much. It may be, therefore, that manufacturing&#39;s weak spell is less a harbinger than a hangover.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The yield-curve inversion could also be misleading. Long-term rates may have fallen below short-term ones not because a recession is imminent, but for a far more pleasant reason: that as inflation melts away, the Fed will be able to lower rates. Provided it can make those cuts before growth gives out, it will have a good chance of guiding America to a soft landing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second factor relates to the economy&#39;s underlying strength. Monetary policy may be tight, but there are countervailing forces. One is government spending. America is running a budget deficit worth over 5% of <small>GDP</small> —unheard of outside recessions and wars. That is putting money in people&#39;s pockets. There are plenty of reasons to worry about the sustainability of such fiscal largesse, but, for now, it is a cushion for the economy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Several big pieces of legislation from the first two years of the presidency of Joe Biden, enacted before Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives, are also starting to affect the economy. Spending on highways, ports, power plants and more, enabled by an infrastructure law passed in 2021, is worth about 0.25% of <small>GDP</small> a year. Subsidies for electric vehicles, renewable energy and semiconductors appear to have catalysed a surge in private-sector investment: spending on manufacturing facilities is up 70% this year in real terms compared with pre-pandemic levels, hitting a record high.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another countervailing force is households, whose spending accounts for about two-thirds of <small>GDP</small> . They entered the era of high inflation and rising rates well prepared. During the pandemic they had accumulated “excess savings” worth about $2trn, a consequence both of having fewer opportunities to spend their money and of receiving three rounds of stimulus cheques as well as other forms of government support. Many people have drawn down these savings as the cost of living has risen. Nevertheless, researchers with the Fed&#39;s branch in San Francisco estimate that there is still a residual amount of extra savings—$500bn or so—enough to last for most of this year. In any case, these savings matter less than they used to: for the first time in a few years nominal wage growth is eclipsing the rate of inflation, meaning that most Americans now have rising incomes in real terms. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC886.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What could go wrong? Policy lags are a known unknown that could yet trip up the economy. Lags refer to the length of time needed for changes in monetary policy to start affecting business activity. Economists used to think that it could take more than two years for a rise in interest rates to ripple through the economy. Stricter credit standards have yet to make their impact fully felt: for instance, interest rates on credit cards have just started to shoot up, and it may be another few months before delinquencies follow them higher.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But cutting against that is evidence that, in some respects, there is much less of a lag than there used to be, thanks to twitchy financial markets. For example, mortgage rates rose sharply in early 2022 prompted solely by the expectation that the Fed would soon begin raising rates, as indeed it did. The housing industry, arguably the most rate-sensitive part of the economy, is now in the throes of a mini-rebound, with both sales and construction beginning to rise (see chart 3). A new financial-conditions index developed by the Fed suggests that, on balance, the drag on growth arising from higher interest rates has actually diminished in the past few months, in part because investors in American stocks have anticipated an end to the cycle of rising rates.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A debauched degree of listlessness</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is crucial to note that a soft landing does not equate to roaring growth. Far from it. What is needed to help bring inflation to heel is a period—potentially a long one—of subdued growth, which would lower the economic temperature. Such an interlude may, in fact, be well under way. Although <small>gdp</small> growth has held up well over the past few quarters, its close relative, gross domestic income ( <small>GDI</small> ), has been anaemic. In theory the two ought to be aligned. <small>GDP</small> tracks all final expenditures in the economy, summing up consumption, investment, government spending and net exports over a specific period. <small>GDI</small> tracks the earnings associated with that expenditure, summing up wages, profits and any other income. In reality the two never match perfectly, since they are derived from different sources. Recently the gaps have been unusually large—perhaps another consequence of distortions related to the pandemic. Whereas <small>GDP</small> increased by 2% on an annualised basis in the first quarter of this year, <small>GDI</small> fell by 1.8%. It is not clear which number is more accurate, but one common approach to reconciling the two is to split the difference. That would imply that growth is already very low which, in turn, may further sap inflation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There are big risks to this rosy outlook. Inflation could prove stubborn again, as it has for the past two years. Much of the recent optimism has been tied to a better-than-expected inflation reading in June. Drawing sweeping conclusions from a single datum is never a good idea, not least when underlying trends are so volatile.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even if inflation falls again in July and August, there are also questions about how low it will go if the number of vacant jobs continues to outstrip the number of available workers to such a large extent. Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, and Ben Bernanke, a former chairman of the Fed, estimated in a paper in May that, at the current level of tightness in the labour market, the unemployment rate would need to rise above 4.3% for some time to bring inflation down to the Fed&#39;s target. That would imply that roughly 1m people would have to lose their jobs—no small dislocation. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_FBC036.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The resilience of the economy is, in this respect, discomfiting. If the rebound in housing gains steam, it could easily spur an increase in rents and goods prices (all those new homes need sofas, fridges, carpets and more). If wages continue to grow at about 5% annually, they, too, will put a floor under prices in the service sector. Expectations of inflation, although declining, do not suggest the Fed has everything under control (see chart 4). A feedback loop between a strong economy and sticky inflation would pose a stiff challenge for the Fed, leaving it with little choice but to raise rates to new heights—at which point fears of a tightening-induced recession might well come true.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The absence of a downturn to date has allowed the Fed to avoid confronting any serious trade-off in its tightening. Jerome Powell, the Fed&#39;s chairman, and his peers deserve high marks for raising rates as quickly, albeit belatedly, as they have. But it has been easy for them to be resolute given the health of the jobs market. Were conditions to deteriorate, their resolve would be sorely tested. Richard Clarida, a former vice-chairman of the Fed, says the central bank may ratchet down rates next year with inflation headed to a “two-point-something destination”, instead of actually back to its target of 2%. That might help to avoid a recession. But it would also represent a shifting of the goalposts, with the Fed tolerating a higher rate of inflation because it does not want to inflict wrenching economic pain. That, in itself, would make it harder to fight inflation in the future.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All these risks notwithstanding, it remains remarkable that America has so far avoided a hard landing. The economy is winding its way down a treacherous road from the highest peak in inflation in 40 years. Defying conventional wisdom, it has managed to add millions of jobs during the hair-raising ride. Its descent is far from over. But a soft landing, once a faint hope, is now among the plausible outcomes. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 08:54:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/a9d4lsdn2nop513pvmea6lvj87dvhrj6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/20/could-americas-economy-escape-recession</item></channel></rss>
