data-caps="initial">F</span> <small>EW 的访客</small>可以期待印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪 (Narendra Modi) 将于本月晚些时候在华盛顿<small>特区</small>受到的那种欢迎。美国总统乔•拜登在白宫为他举办了一场正式的宴会。国会两院的领导人也不甘示弱，邀请他第二次在联席会议上发表讲话——此前只有温斯顿·丘吉尔等人才能获得这一荣誉。用白宫一份滔滔不绝的新闻稿的话来说，这次访问将“确认美国和印度之间深厚而密切的伙伴关系”。</p><p class="article__body-text">事实上，印度和美国之间的伙伴关系从未如此深入或密切。但美国的领导人，无论是共和党还是民主党，都希望如此。他们将印度视为与中国日益激烈的竞争中不可或缺的盟友。毕竟，印度最近成为了世界上人口最多的国家。它的外交政策最近变得更加自信，对中国更加敌视，即使它仍然反对美国主导的秩序的想法（见下一个故事）。它的侨民是世界上最大的，也非常有影响力（见国际部分）。但印度作为盟友的吸引力还在于其经济可能终于开始发挥其潜力的感觉。它已经是世界第五大。莫迪先生已承诺实现某种增长，使其成为世界经济的支柱，与美国、中国或欧盟并驾齐驱。尽管他的政府在经济管理上存在许多失误，但这并不是一个难以置信的目标。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">莫迪的副手们认为，印度的经济将会蓬勃发展，这要归功于其年轻的劳动力、强有力的产业政策以及西方公司突然对中国保持警惕所带来的机遇。许多雄心勃勃的商人被说服了。刚刚在印度开设第一家门店的苹果公司老板蒂姆库克上个月向投资者宣称，“市场的活力、活力令人难以置信……印度正处于一个转折点。”几天后，台湾电子公司富士康在印度投资 5 亿美元的工厂破土动工。印度一季度<small>GDP</small>同比增长6.1%。投资占<small>GDP</small>的比重达到十多年来的最高水平。</p><p class="article__body-text">不乏怀疑者。一些人指出任人唯亲和保护主义阻碍了经济发展；其他人则抱怨不可靠的统计数据夸大了它的增长。它在大流行期间受到严重打击，给穷人带来了持久的痛苦。西方人将莫迪对民主规范的侵蚀和日益增长的宗派主义视为增长的潜在威胁。与此同时，中国官员认为印度不够独裁。今年 3 月，你的记者听到有人告诉全球老板听众，印度的语言多样性、立法层级和工人教育程度低，使其成为一个没有吸引力的经商之地。</p><p class="article__body-text">但要使印度成为世界经济的支柱，所有这些成绩都不需要奇迹般的改善。它只需要保持大致目前的增长速度即可。高盛预计，印度的<small>GDP</small>将在 2051 年超过欧元区，到 2075 年超过美国。假设未来五年的增长率为 5.8%，2030 年代为 4.6%，之后会更低。</p><p class="article__body-text">高盛的信心部分取决于人口结构。根据主要由富裕国家<small>组成</small>的经合组织的预测，中国和<small>欧盟</small>的劳动力将随着人口老龄化而减少，而印度的劳动力将持续增长直到 2040 年代后期。在高盛对未来五年年度经济增长的预测中，不断扩大的劳动力供应占了整整一个百分点。然而，印度仍将相对贫穷。即使到 2075 年，其人均产出也将比中国低 45%，比美国低 75% 左右。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> 1700 年印度占世界<small>GDP</small>的 24%，超过中国（此数字使用购买力平价；本文其他所有使用市场汇率）。在金融危机之后，它在 1993 年跌至 1% 的屈辱低点。此后增长相对较快，这一趋势自 2014 年莫迪当选以来一直持续。印度目前占全球<small>GDP</small>的 3.6%，与 2000 年的中国持平。<small>国际货币基金组织</small>预测，到 2028 年，这一比例将达到 4.2%，超越德国和日本。印度的影响力也在其他方面上升：其股市是仅次于美国、中国和日本的第四大股市。其商品和服务出口占国内<small>生产总值的</small>比重离年度历史高点不远。在过去十年中，它们增长了 73%，因此印度在全球出口中的份额从 2012 年的 1.9% 上升到 2022 年的 2.4%。</p><p class="article__body-text">在莫迪先生和他最近的前任领导下，交通基础设施得到了显着改善。与 2010 年代中期相比，对它的投资占<small>GDP</small>的份额增加了两倍多。自 2014 年以来，公路网络的长度增加了约 25%，达到 600 万公里。机场的数量翻了一番——其中许多新机场可与发达国家中最灵活的机场相媲美。数字基础设施也蓬勃发展，截至去年共有 8.16 亿宽带连接，以及从电子银行到福利支付等一系列国家资助的数字服务，覆盖了数亿人。能源基础设施也有大量建设：据彭博新能源财经报道，印度将在 2023 年增加太阳能发电量，超过美国和中国以外的任何其他地方。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度对发展中经济体的服务异常依赖：它们约占所有出口的 40%。这使印度成为世界第七大服务出口国，占全球总量的 4.5%，高于十年前的 3.2%。自大流行开始以来，其大型技术服务公司一直在快速增长，急切地招聘并磨练他们的软件，这些软件在世界各地销售。侨民与硅谷的联系有助于保持创新的步伐并支持新生的创业文化（见国际部分）。</p><p class="article__body-text">问题在于， <small>IT</small>服务行业虽然赚取了 2000 多亿美元的巨额出口收入，但直接雇用的员工只有 500 万左右。事实上，在印度总共超过 9 亿处于工作年龄的人口中，只有大约一半参与了劳动力大军，大约 6000 万拥有正式工作。解决这个问题的一种方法是通过促进制造业创造更多的蓝领就业机会。三十年来，这一直是印度决策的当务之急。</p><p class="article__body-text">莫迪先生打着“印度制造”的口号推进制造业，旨在抓住西方公司将供应链从中国转移出去的愿望。印度的基础设施得到改善，它提供了一个相当大的国内市场，并且充满了潜在的工人。<small>国际货币基金组织</small>4 月份发表的一项研究得出结论，如果供应链在地缘政治鸿沟的任何一方都得到重塑，印度将成为少数几个受益的地方之一。为此，莫迪先生在 2020 年推出了一项 330 亿美元的补贴计划，使用“与生产挂钩的激励措施”（ <small>PLI</small> ），如果销售额达到特定目标，就会奖励从制药到太阳能电池板等 14 个行业的公司。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">一些制造业蓬勃发展：机械、电子和汽车或零部件的出口在过去五年中增长了63%，已成为出口总额的五分之一。据彭博社报道，苹果目前 7% 的手机在印度组装。包括塔塔集团在内的印度国内企业集团正在投资电子产品。尽管如此，尽管<small>PLI</small>引发了大量公告，但迄今为止实际部署的资本可能低于 100 亿美元。据一些报道，一个耗资 190 亿美元的位于古吉拉特邦的半导体工厂的大项目已经停滞。</p><p class="article__body-text">制造业在 2022 年最后一个季度同比仅增长 4.5%，占<small>GDP</small>的比重为 17%，仅略高于过去十年的平均水平。自 2019 年以来，按价值计算的商品出口增长中约有三分之一反映了印度对俄罗斯石油的购买量不断增加，其中一些经过提炼和再出口。越南从中国转移的活动比印度多，印度在全球商品出口中的份额仅略有上升，从 2012 年的 1.6% 上升到 2022 年的 1.8%。简而言之，印度的制造业没有大爆炸，尽管稳定增长可能继续。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种不寻常的增长模式是否可持续？该公式的要素经久不衰，包括丰富的劳动力、强大的精英教育、创业文化以及与有影响力的侨民的宝贵联系。预计莫迪先生明年将赢得第三个任期。这将为中央层面的经济决策提供连续性，尤其是在基础设施建设方面。他所追求的与美国建立更密切的关系也对经济有帮助。毕竟，美国是印度许多服务出口的买家。由于银行系统相对封闭，印度将继续依赖西方网络进行跨境支付。</p><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，过去经常出现的金融不稳定似乎风险较小。银行系统已经清理干净，企业债务很低。与中国一样，印度拥有大量外汇储备。它还禁止外国投资其银行和政府债务市场，以减少破坏稳定的资本外逃的风险。 1 月份卖空者对关系密切的企业集团 Adani Group 的攻击揭示了印度资本市场的缺陷，例如治理不透明，但也有一定程度的弹性：他们很快对这一事件不以为然。</p><p class="article__body-text">但三大威胁确实迫在眉睫。首先， <small>IT</small>服务的繁荣可能会失去动力。印度的科技公司拥有大量熟练劳动力，因此采用了劳动密集型模式。但包括人工智能在内的新技术可能会破坏这一战略。在准备过程中，许多人正在多元化发展新业务，例如会计和管理咨询。上个季度，此类非技术服务约占服务出口总额的五分之一。</p><p class="article__body-text">第二个风险是，莫迪提拔国内龙头企业和削弱包括法院在内的机构，可能会开始阻碍外国投资。许多中国科技公司已被禁止。跨国公司越来越觉得有必要与国内大公司达成交易：欧洲水泥公司 Holcim 将其印度分公司卖给了阿达尼； Meta 投资了 Reliance Industries，后者拥有庞大的数字部门。</p><p class="article__body-text">对不公平竞争环境的恐惧或许可以解释为什么外国直接投资总流入量从过去几年的平均每月 70 亿美元放缓至 2 月和 3 月的 50 亿美元以下。大型外国投资者还有其他试探性迹象。我们研究了印度最活跃的四家全球银行在印度的风险敞口，这些银行通常迎合跨国公司的需求。以美元计算，到 2022 年，他们对印度的敞口平均下降了 11%。</p><p class="article__body-text">但印度政府可能认为，从长远来看，它的规模足以吸引西方公司，无论它如何扭曲游戏规则。他们在那里的子公司的销售额接近四分之一万亿美元。根据我们对中央银行数据的分析，在过去五年中，印度所有跨国公司的利润增长了 80%，达到 560 亿美元。这足以弥补很多令人头疼的问题。</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>社会契约</b></p><p class="article__body-text">最后一个风险是印度隐含的“涓滴”经济战略会引起民众的强烈反对。它不是制造工作岗位，而是依靠相对较少的正规行业的财富在经济中流动，使更多的人口受益，而这些人往往受教育程度较低。这不一定是天上掉下来的馅饼：例如，随着为富裕人群建造更多住房，建筑业发展迅速，吸引了非熟练工人。莫迪先生的部分议程是扩大涓滴经济。政府已迫使成群结队的以前未注册的小公司开始纳税，从而激励它们进行整合、正规化和投资。印度的数字福利计划使向穷人提供的援助更加一致和高效，并可用于更大规模地补充收入。</p><p class="article__body-text">尽管如此，如果印度庞大的未充分就业大军的愿望至少部分得不到满足，印度的增长很可能会受到影响。即使避免了广泛的社会动荡，也可能是因为政客们试图以无益的方式满足或转移挫败感。莫迪先生将经济现代化与非自由主义和宗教沙文主义结合起来。为了安抚失业者，他和他的继任者可能变得更加压抑和宗派化。公众舆论也可能反对经济开放。与印度拉近距离的西方国家可能会被这些事态发展推迟。印度的经济崛起是真实的，而且可能是持久的，但并非没有陷阱。

“女性对职业和家庭生活的渴望在全球范围内趋同，”多普克先生说。受正规教育年限较少的女性的生育率已下降到受教育程度较高的同龄人的水平。事实上，在美国，受过 16 年教育的女性（主要是那些拥有本科学位的女性）平均生育的孩子比那些受过更多教育的女性要少。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J

class="article__body-text">出于同样的原因，低生育率已经从意大利和日本等富裕国家蔓延到泰国（1.3）和巴西（1.6）等中等收入国家。更值得注意的是，印度的生育率近期已跌破2.1，并有望继续下降。由于它占世界人口的五分之一，这将产生全球影响。世界上最大的 15 个经济体，包括巴西、中国、印度和墨西哥，生育率都低于 2.1。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 2021 年，生育率低于替代率的国家有 7.82 亿人年龄在 21 岁至 30 岁之间。到 2050 年，这一群体，实际上是本土进入劳动力市场的潜在人数，预计将减少五分之一，至 6.19 亿。今年秋天并不是什么主观和有问题的预测：那一代人中的大多数人已经出生，生育率不会迅速变化。在生育率低于 1.5 的国家（几乎包括整个东亚和欧洲大部分地区），降幅将更为极端，同一群体将收缩 37%。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些国家将不再是金字塔形的人口结构，每一代都比之前的一代更大，甚至成为支柱，所有世代的规模都差不多，这些国家将变成倒金字塔，老一代被越来越小的群体所取代.在世界部分地区，这种情况已经发生：中国 21 岁至 30 岁的人口数量已经从 2012 年高峰期的 2.32 亿下降到 2021 年的 1.81 亿。到 2040 年代，下降速度将迅速加快，使中国人口不足 1 亿在 2050 年代中期的同一个游泳池中。同期，欧洲同一年龄段的人口将从 8500 万左右下降到 6000 万以下。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J

href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/28/a-new-wave-of-mass-migration-has-begun">移民</a>，尽管近年来产生了政治紧张局势，但在许多富裕国家，移民人数仍在增加。但随着人口下降影响到越来越多的国家，受过教育的移民将越来越难找到，即使许多富裕国家的本土出生人口正在加速萎缩。对于拥有约 14 亿人口的中国来说，认为可以找到足够多的移民来扭转出生率下降的影响的想法纯属天方夜谭。尽管印度的人口仍在增长，但它将在 2060 年代达到顶峰，甚至更早。撒哈拉以南非洲地区是世界上唯一一个在未来许多年内可能成为潜在移民重要来源的地区。但即使在那里，出生率的下降速度也比过去预测的要快。尽管移民将在未来几十年继续缓解许多国家的人口下降，但从长远来看，它无法完全弥补大经济体的婴儿潮。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些人口变化的一些后果是众所周知的。人口老龄化意味着公共养老金和医疗保健支出增加，但需要缴纳税款的工作年龄人口将减少。富裕国家目前大约有 3 个 20 至 64 岁的人与 1 个 65 岁以上的人相对应。到 2050 年，这一比例将缩小到不到 2 比 1。这将需要推迟退休年龄、提高税收或两者兼而有之。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，人口下降的经济后果不仅仅是财政方面的。劳动力是增长的三个主要决定因素之一，另外两个是资本和两者的使用效率（生产率）。在其他条件相同的情况下，劳动力缩减会自动导致经济增长放缓。但人口下降也会对资本和生产力产生连锁反应，而这种影响却鲜为人知。</p><p class="article__body-text">许多经济学家认为，工作人口减少将压低实际利率（即在考虑通货膨胀后），因为投资机会将减少，而那些已退休或即将退休的人将积累大量储蓄。但其他人，例如英格兰银行前官员查尔斯·古德哈特 (Charles Goodhart)，认为效果会适得其反。随着越来越多的人退休并停止储蓄但继续消费，投资资金将会减少，从而推高实际利率。</p><p class="article__body-text">双方都同意人口老龄化会同时减少储蓄和投资，但对于哪一个下降得更快，双方意见不一。但证据的平衡表明实际利率较低：许多发展中经济体仍需积累数十年的储蓄，退休人员往往会紧握储蓄而不是耗尽储蓄。无论哪种方式，人口变化都将对市场产生巨大影响。从广义上讲，低实际利率对那些已经积累了资产的人有利，但对那些仍在努力储蓄的人不利，包括越来越多即将退休但储备金不足的工人。</p><p class="article__body-text">但人口下降可能对生产力产生最令人不安的影响。年轻人拥有更多心理学家所说的“流体智力”，即解决新问题和接受新想法的能力。年长的人有更多的“结晶智力”——随着时间的推移积累的关于事物如何运作的知识储备。没有精确的界限，但大多数研究表明，流体智力往往在成年初期达到顶峰，并在 30 多岁时开始下降。两种类型的情报都是有用的：公司、行业和经济体既需要能够应对新挑战的年轻人，也需要对他们的行业有详细了解的经验丰富的老手。但在创新方面，两者并不具有同等价值。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB

使用一个包含 40 多年来提交的 300 万项专利的数据库来探索创新与年龄之间的关系。根据科学学科的不同，作者指出，专利申请率在研究人员 30 多岁和 40 多岁时达到顶峰。然后专利申请率只会在他们 40 多岁和 50 多岁时逐渐下降。</p><p class="article__body-text">但对于从根本上改变科学领域的颠覆性创新，情况就大不相同了。研究人员使用<!-- -->一种基于特定发明在未来专利中被引用次数的颠覆性衡量标准。如果一项特定专利被后续发明人引用，但该专利的技术前辈没有引用，则该专利被归类为破坏性创新，而不是渐进式创新。例如，获得诺贝尔奖的生物化学家卡里·穆利斯 (Kary Mullis) 在聚合酶链反应方面的工作为许多现代基因和医学测试奠定了基础。在 Mullis 发表他的作品后，同一领域中对现有技术的引用急剧下降。 Jaffe 先生、Kaltenberg 女士和 Lachman 女士发现，最年轻的发明家申请的专利更有可能是全新的、颠覆性的创新，而且随着发明家年龄的增长，他们申请的专利越来越多。</p><p class="article__body-text">这很重要，因为创新可以提高生产力。改进现有流程并发明全新的做事方式，可以用相同数量的劳动力和资本生产更多产品。从长远来看，只有提高生产力才能提高生活水平。随着时间的推移，人口下降将削弱这种贡献，因为年轻工人灵活的头脑所产生的新颖想法的数量会减少。</p><p class="article__body-text">即使生产率增长率稍微低一点，多年来也会复合，从而使经济规模显着缩小。 1947 年至 1973 年间，在富裕国家战后经济增长特别迅速的繁荣时期，美国、英国、法国、意大利、日本和西德的生产率增长约占人均产出增长的 60%。自 2007-09 年全球金融危机以来，美国的增长速度远高于其他发达国家，这在很大程度上要归功于其生产力的更大提高。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果生育率的下降仅限于少数国家或特定地区，那么对创新的影响可能不会那么严重。一个国家发明的技术最终会传播到其他国家。纺纱珍妮和计算机芯片不必在世界每个角落都重新发明来提高全球生产力。但事实上，大部分国家的生育率同时下降，这意味着全球都会感受到创新减少的后果。</p><p class="article__body-text">一些研究人员认为，这种由人口驱动的创新减少现象已经在世界部分地区发生。中国经济学家和人口学家梁建章指出，老龄国家的创业精神明显较低：一个国家的中位年龄每增加一个标准差，相当于大约 3.5 岁，会导致下降 2.5 个百分点<!-- -->在创业率（成年人创业的比例）中。考虑到 2010 年全球创业率约为 6.1%，这是一个巨大的影响。</p><p class="article__body-text">更重要的是，这种关系似乎不仅仅是老龄化社会中年轻人相对缺乏的结果。这些国家的年轻人开办企业的比率似乎也低于不那么发达的社会中的同龄人。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

In November he won re-election in Florida by a resplendent 19-point margin. In damning contrast, Mr Trump&#39;s attempts to play kingmaker in the midterm elections went disastrously wrong, with many of the candidates he endorsed losing races that the Republican Party had considered in the bag. Mr Trump appeared suitably deflated when he launched his presidential campaign on November 15th at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Back then some opinion polls put the two candidates neck-and-neck among primary voters. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZ8j_CZLFm8?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> Six months later it is Mr DeSantis who has been stumbling. He has been criticised as an isolationist for dismissing the war in Ukraine as a mere “territorial dispute”, as an anti-corporatist for picking fights with Disney and as an extremist for signing a ban on abortion beyond six weeks of pregnancy. Mr Trump, meanwhile, has recovered his step, making a triumphant return to the campaign trail. He and his team have spent months pummelling Mr DeSantis. In retrospect, the governor&#39;s decision to wait until Florida&#39;s legislature had completed its annual session earlier this month before announcing his candidacy looks like a miscalculation, although the delay was in part to allow lawmakers to pass a bill permitting him to run for president without resigning as governor. During the long interlude he has endured a protracted beating on the airwaves without offering much defence. It is as if Brutus had overslept on the Ides of March, giving Julius Caesar a chance to put on his armour, but had tried to proceed with his hit job all the same. The plot to overthrow Mr Trump, which once seemed plausible, now looks forlorn.</p><h2> Lend me your cheers</h2><p class="article__body-text"> In 2016 Mr Trump ran as an insurgent. In 2020 he ran as the incumbent. For 2024, he is running as a hybrid of the two—insurrectionist and institutionalist all at once. It is proving to be a potent combination, which has helped to build a huge lead in the early polling. Among likely voters in the primary, Mr Trump retains the stature of a former president, but is also seen as the put-upon underdog, owing to his claims that the election of 2020 was stolen, his bans from social media and his <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/25/how-donald-trumps-trials-and-the-republican-primary-will-intersect" data-tegid="tc50p4ub3qvuq8tedqkquurcoq9ubbhu">many legal troubles</a> . Early stumbles, such as his lacklustre campaign launch and an embarrassing dinner with a white supremacist, have been righted by a new campaign operation that is more professional than the chaotic family affairs of Mr Trump&#39;s past runs. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> What is more, the Republican Party has been thoroughly Trumpified. This is especially true at the state level, where most of the rules for primaries are set. Unlike 2016, when the party establishment shunned Mr Trump, today he dominates the race for elite endorsements. Many big donors have defected to alternatives such as Mr DeSantis, but this is not as damaging as it sounds. Mr Trump will have no trouble raising money from his army of small-dollar donors and will again be able to portray himself as the authentic tribune of the people, assailed by the henchmen of the out-of-touch elite. Among the Republican base, he has universal name recognition and near-universal admiration.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This reverence for Mr Trump makes it difficult for his competitors to attack him. Most of them come not to bury Trumpism, but to praise it. But the resulting muddle blunts their appeal. Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, puts it this way, “Why would you go to see a Rolling Stones tribute band, when the Rolling Stones themselves are still on tour?”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Are the primaries over before they have begun? Some think so. “Hope is not a strategy,” says Rick Wilson, a former Republican operative who now runs the Lincoln Project, an anyone-but-Trump outfit. He thinks Mr Trump would have to be incapacitated to lose. “Donald Trump will start taking DeSantis&#39;s head off in debates and kicking it around like a soccer ball. And the Republican base voters want that show,” he says. Ask closeted anti-Trump Republicans around Washington how the primary will go, and many conjure scenes of brutality worthy of the Gallic wars.</p><p class="article__body-text"> More optimistic sorts, however, point out that there is still a long way to go, even if Mr Trump&#39;s chariot is building speed. “We&#39;re still months and months and months away from voting. National polls are pretty meaningless—they are going to mean something once voting has started,” says David Kochel, a Republican consultant based in Iowa (the first state to vote) who previously worked with Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush. Consultants for struggling campaigns swap Cinderella stories about late-breaking candidates who went from 2% in Iowa to 20% in the space of a month. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC288.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Early polls, it is true, do not predict the final results as well as later ones. But that does not mean they are useless. There is a correlation between early strength and the final results (see chart 1). At present, Mr Trump commands the support of almost 55% of primary voters according to a polling average constructed by FiveThirtyEight, a data-journalism outfit. That is more than 30 percentage points more than Mr DeSantis&#39;s average. In contested primaries over the past 40 years, six of the eight candidates who have polled above 30% this far ahead of the voting went on to capture their party&#39;s nomination. The two candidates who failed to capitalise on such big leads were Ted Kennedy, who ran against an incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, in 1980, and Hillary Clinton, who was eventually upstaged in 2008 by the charismatic Barack Obama. The Republican candidate who comes closest to both Carter-like incumbency and Obama-like magnetism this year is, of course, Mr Trump.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem is not simply one of a divided field. Although there are already six declared, halfway plausible candidates, with more to come in all likelihood, even a two-horse race would favour Mr Trump. Recent polling conducted for <i>The Economist</i> by YouGov finds that, in a head-to-head contest, Republican primary voters prefer Mr Trump to Mr DeSantis by 58% to 25%. And the former president&#39;s support is not at all reluctant or half-hearted. Fully 64% of Republicans want Mr Trump to run again, despite the many alternatives. Democrats, by contrast, are much less energised about Joe Biden, their presumptive nominee: only 53% of them want the president to run again.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In 2016 Mr Trump&#39;s opponents thought his outrageous statements and chaotic campaign would inevitably lead to political failure. That proved hopelessly Pollyannaish. Most now assume there is little that Mr Trump could say or do to alienate his base. But some opponents still hope that his campaign will implode because of the sort of messy infighting that characterised his entire time in the White House.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The hitch is that the chaos candidate is a bit more orderly this time. In 2016 Mr Trump&#39;s campaign attracted a fair number of charlatans. Current management is more stable. Susie Wiles, one of its leaders, ran Mr Trump&#39;s successful operation in Florida in both 2016 and 2020. She also headed Mr DeSantis&#39;s run for governor in 2018, when he was Mr Trump&#39;s protégé. There is little family involvement: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president&#39;s daughter and son-in-law, who served as senior advisers when he was in the White House, are not expected to play any part in the campaign. Mr Trump also has much more personal experience: this is his third run for president (fourth if you count his abortive campaign with the Reform Party in 2000). His Republican opponents are all running for the first time. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBC295.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump&#39;s team is assiduous. “Shortly after I got elected, the next day or a couple of days later, I received a voicemail from President Trump congratulating me,” says Mike Brown, the chairman of the Republican Party in Kansas. The Trump campaign has been “exceptional” in communicating about the primary in the state, he says. The rules that will translate the results of individual state primaries and caucuses (in effect, decentralised party conferences) into votes for contenders for the nomination at the party&#39;s national convention are arcane and ever-changing. Unlike the Democratic primaries, in which a state&#39;s votes are typically split among the candidates in proportion to their share of the vote, many Republican primaries follow a winner-take-all system. That can turn a relatively narrow lead in terms of the share of the vote into a crushing dominion over delegates. While Mr Trump was president, he encouraged states to adopt such systems or other rules that help the front-runner. And the dates of the primaries keep moving even further forward, giving insurgent candidates ever less time to build momentum (see chart 2).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump&#39;s team has been seizing a march on its adversaries in other respects, too, diligently soliciting endorsements from senior figures in the party with calls and invitations to the imperial court at Mar-a-Lago. Such support was not forthcoming in 2016, but has been flooding in ahead of next year&#39;s contest. Mr Trump has already racked up the endorsements of 51 of the 222 Republicans in the House of Representatives and ten of the 49 Republican senators. His opponents have just seven representatives and two senators among them all. The Trump campaign takes particular pride in its success with Florida&#39;s delegation to Congress, who have largely spurned their state&#39;s governor. Eleven of Florida&#39;s 20 Republican representatives have endorsed Mr Trump, compared with just one for Mr DeSantis. Mr DeSantis and Mr Scott could not expect many endorsements before entering the race, of course, but they have a lot of catching up to do.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Operationally, at least, Mr DeSantis can certainly hope to catch up. He is a prodigious fundraiser, taking in an astounding $217m during his gubernatorial run in 2022, much of which went unspent. Because Mr DeSantis is the favourite among deep-pocketed donors (though his stances on abortion, Disney and Ukraine have irked some), he will rely heavily on an organisation called “Never Back Down”, a so-called super <small>PAC</small> that can take unlimited donations as long as it does not co-ordinate with the official campaign. A person familiar with Mr DeSantis&#39;s thinking says he could raise $250m between his official campaign and the super <small>PAC</small> . The mastermind of Never Back Down is Jeff Roe, the founder of a consultancy called Axiom Strategies, which worked on both the failed presidential campaign in 2016 of Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, and Glenn Youngkin&#39;s successful bid for governor in Virginia in 2021. Never Back Down is expected to carpet-bomb television with advertisements and also pay for the canvassers and organisers who must traipse around early-voting states for months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The official campaign will be run by members of Mr DeSantis&#39;s inner circle in Florida. The likely campaign manager, Generra Peck, headed his most recent campaign for governor. His polling guru will probably be another homegrown talent, Ryan Tyson. Mr DeSantis is the favourite to win the arms race for donations. He will have plenty of campaign veterans who know how to spend his takings.</p></div><h2> I came, I saw, I squandered</h2><p class="article__body-text"> If cash were all it took to become president, America would be midway through the first term of Michael Bloomberg, a tycoon and former mayor of New York who lavished $1.1bn on a failed campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Persuading Republican voters to defect from Mr Trump, as Mr DeSantis must now do, is a difficult task. Many obvious avenues of attack, the ones that might appeal to swing voters in a general election, are non-starters in the primary. Mr Trump&#39;s encouragement of the mob that stormed Congress on January 6th 2021 hardly imperils his standing in the party, most of which believes that the election of 2020 was stolen. Nor can his opponents make hay from the inquiries, investigations and lawsuits that have dogged the president since he left office, from the <small>FBI</small> ’s search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago to his recent indictment by Manhattan&#39;s district attorney for fraudulent book-keeping. These indignities, far from diminishing Mr Trump in Republicans&#39; eyes, have turned him into a martyr. Even political rivals like Mr DeSantis have felt obliged to come to his defence. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230527_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Florida Governor Ron DeSantis listensduring a press conference to sign several bills related to public education and teacher pay, in Miami, Tuesday, May 9, 2023.

The old neoconservative and business-friendly order has been swept away. The other candidates&#39; failure to present a “value proposition”, says Mr Miller of the Trump campaign, “will impede their ability to build coalitions and actually go and challenge the president…Saying that you&#39;re Trump without the drama, which is kind of where it seems Ron DeSantis is going—that just doesn&#39;t work.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Presidential primaries are often popularity contests more than they are policy debates—and this one will be little different. All the candidates agree that Mr Biden is intentionally wrecking the country, that wokeness has run amok and that the southern border must be sealed. There are only modest signs of disagreement. Mr Trump is attacking Mr DeSantis from the left on fiscal matters, arguing that he will endanger Social Security (the state pension) and Medicare (free health care for the elderly), two sacrosanct programmes among older voters. Mr Scott is calling for less confrontational politics. More internationalist candidates such as Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, argue that continuing to back Ukraine is vital for America&#39;s national security. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Others are more isolationist than Mr Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy Indian-American entrepreneur from Ohio, says, “We&#39;ve got to be willing to ban most <small>US</small> businesses from doing business in China until the <small>CCP</small> [Chinese Communist Party] falls or until the <small>CCP</small> radically reforms itself.” That is a harder decoupling than the other candidates have proposed. He also wants to ban affirmative action, shut down the <small>FBI</small> and use the army to dismantle Mexican cartels that ship fentanyl across the border. Early polls show some success in peeling off Trump voters, but it is a delicate operation. “We rally behind America first for a reason. It&#39;s not Trump first,” says Mr Ramaswamy. “I&#39;m running against him, but to be clear, I still recoil at the idea that the nominee should somehow be the product of some plot of Republican donors.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the conspirators must at some point coalesce if they are to be rid of Caesar. In 2016 the fractured field, combined with winner-take-all primary rules, helped Mr Trump triumph. Whereas Democrats united behind Mr Biden in 2020 when it became apparent that Bernie Sanders, a left-wing ideologue, might secure the nomination, Republicans may be hard to corral. At the moment, Mr DeSantis certainly looks like the strongest rival to Mr Trump. But the other candidates seem much keener to attack him than the former president, for fear of alienating the base. Ms Haley has taken to denouncing Mr DeSantis for feuding with Disney, for instance. Other prominent Republicans, such as Kari Lake, a failed candidate for governor of Arizona last year, and Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, have taken to swiping at Mr DeSantis as well. They may be auditioning for the job of vice-president to Mr Trump, and see such attacks as a quick way into his good graces.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Despite his stumbles in recent months, Mr DeSantis is a clever and driven man. He may regain his lean and hungry look and let slip the dogs of war. Many voters will pay close attention to the televised debates, the first of which will be held in August in Wisconsin (although the former president may not participate). Mr DeSantis could point out that the national debt soared by $8trn during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency; that crime and illegal immigration both increased despite all the former president&#39;s big talk on both scores; that covid-19 was poorly contained and that another epidemic, of wokeness, became more rather than less contagious during his presidency. It might help to point out that Mr Trump, a man famous for peremptory sackings, failed to dismiss Anthony Fauci, the public face of efforts to repress covid, who is about as popular in conservative circles as gun seizures and sharia law.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such barbs could draw some blood. If wielded with enough force and frequency, they might even fell a man as mighty as Caesar. Luckily for Mr Trump, he is facing a fractious, squabbling and timid bunch. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Editor&#39;s note (May 25th 2023):</b> This article was updated after Ron DeSantis&#39;s announcement.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 24 May 2023 18:57:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rl58dgle0sccdmq1um7jogm86d0fcdjt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/24/ron-desantis-has-little-chance-of-beating-donald-trump </item><item><title><![CDATA[Henry Kissinger explains how to avoid world war three]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Henry Kissinger photographed by Vincent Tullo for The Economist, New York 2023.Credit: The Economist/Vincent Tullo" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_FBP503.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: The Economist/Vincent Tullo</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>N BEIJING THEY</small> have concluded that America will do anything to keep China down.

Nobody alive has more experience of international affairs, first as a scholar of 19th-century diplomacy, later as America&#39;s national security adviser and secretary of state, and for the past 46 years as a consultant and emissary to monarchs, presidents and prime ministers. Mr Kissinger is worried. “Both sides have convinced themselves that the other represents a strategic danger,” he says. “We are on the path to great-power confrontation.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the end of April <i>The Economist</i> spoke to Mr Kissinger for over eight hours about how to prevent the contest between China and America from descending into war. These days he is stooped and walks with difficulty, but his mind is needle-sharp. As he contemplates his next two books, on artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> ) and the nature of alliances, he remains more interested in looking forward than raking over the past. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger is alarmed by China&#39;s and America&#39;s intensifying competition for technological and economic pre-eminence. Even as Russia tumbles into China&#39;s orbit and war overshadows Europe&#39;s eastern flank, he fears that <small>AI</small> is about to supercharge the Sino-American rivalry. Around the world, the balance of power and the technological basis of warfare are shifting so fast and in so many ways that countries lack any settled principle on which they can establish order. If they cannot find one, they may resort to force. “We&#39;re in the classic pre-world war one situation,” he says, “where neither side has much margin of political concession and in which any disturbance of the equilibrium can lead to catastrophic consequences.”</p><h2> Study war some more</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger is reviled by many as a warmonger for his part in the Vietnam war, but he considers the avoidance of conflict between great powers as the focus of his life&#39;s work. After witnessing the carnage caused by Nazi Germany and suffering the murder of 13 close relatives in the Holocaust, he became convinced that the only way to prevent ruinous conflict is hard-headed diplomacy, ideally fortified by shared values. “This is the problem that has to be solved,” he says. “And I believe I&#39;ve spent my life trying to deal with it.” In his view, the fate of humanity depends on whether America and China can get along. He believes the rapid progress of <small>AI</small> , in particular, leaves them only five-to-ten years to find a way.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>More on this:</b></p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/kissinger-highlights">Eight highlights of the conversation</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/kissinger-transcript">A full transcript</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/05/20/henry-kissinger-on-averting-world-war" data-tegid="d627nbqe60ospoqtvd42npr5unob63al">Our daily podcast on the interview</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger has some opening advice to aspiring leaders: “Identify where you are. Pitilessly.” In that spirit, the starting-point for avoiding war is to analyse China&#39;s growing restlessness. Despite a reputation for being conciliatory towards the government in Beijing, he acknowledges that many Chinese thinkers believe America is on a downward slope and that, “therefore, as a result of an historic evolution, they will eventually supplant us.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> He believes that China&#39;s leadership resents Western policymakers&#39; talk of a global rules-based order, when what they really mean is America&#39;s rules and America&#39;s order. China&#39;s rulers are insulted by what they see as the condescending bargain offered by the West, of granting China privileges if it behaves (they surely think the privileges should be theirs by right, as a rising power). Indeed, some in China suspect that America will never treat it as an equal and that it&#39;s foolish to imagine it might.</p><p class="article__body-text"> However, Mr Kissinger also warns against misinterpreting China&#39;s ambitions. In Washington, “They say China wants world domination…The answer is that they [in China] want to be powerful,” he says. “They&#39;re not heading for world domination in a Hitlerian sense,” he says. “That is not how they think or have ever thought of world order.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> In Nazi Germany war was inevitable because Adolf Hitler needed it, Mr Kissinger says, but China is different. He has met many Chinese leaders, starting with Mao Zedong. He did not doubt their ideological commitment, but this has always been welded onto a keen sense of their country&#39;s interests and capabilities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger sees the Chinese system as more Confucian than Marxist. That teaches Chinese leaders to attain the maximum strength of which their country is capable and to seek to be respected for their accomplishments. Chinese leaders want to be recognised as the international system&#39;s final judges of their own interests. “If they achieved superiority that can genuinely be used, would they drive it to the point of imposing Chinese culture?” he asks. “I don&#39;t know. My instinct is No…[But] I believe it is in our capacity to prevent that situation from arising by a combination of diplomacy and force.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> One natural American response to the challenge of China&#39;s ambition is to probe it, as a way to identify how to sustain the equilibrium between the two powers. Another is to establish a permanent dialogue between China and America. China “is trying to play a global role. We have to assess at each point if the conceptions of a strategic role are compatible.” If they are not, then the question of force will arise. “Is it possible for China and the United States to coexist without the threat of all-out war with each other? I thought and still think that it [is].” But he acknowledges success is not guaranteed. “It may fail,” he says. “And therefore, we have to be militarily strong enough to sustain the failure.” </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/513/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/769/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/820/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1025/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1281/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1640/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD001.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The urgent test is how China and America behave over Taiwan. Mr Kissinger recalls how, on Richard Nixon&#39;s first visit to China in 1972, only Mao had the authority to negotiate over the island. “Whenever Nixon raised a concrete subject, Mao said, &#39;I&#39;m a philosopher. I don&#39;t deal with these subjects. Let Zhou [Enlai] and Kissinger discuss this.&#39;…But when it came to Taiwan, he was very explicit. He said, &#39;They are a bunch of counter-revolutionaries. We don&#39;t need them now. We can wait 100 years. Someday we will ask for them. But it&#39;s a long distance away.&#39;” </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/01-china.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger believes that the understanding forged between Nixon and Mao was overturned after only 50 of those 100 years by Donald Trump. He wanted to inflate his tough image by wringing concessions out of China over trade. In policy the Biden administration has followed Mr Trump&#39;s lead, but with liberal rhetoric.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger would not have chosen this path with respect to Taiwan, because a Ukrainian-style war there would destroy the island and devastate the world economy. War could also set back China domestically, and its leaders&#39; greatest fear remains upheaval at home.</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite><i>“</i> It is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text"> The fear of war creates grounds for hope. The trouble is that neither side has much room to make concessions. Every Chinese leader has asserted his country&#39;s connection to Taiwan. At the same time, however, “the way things have evolved now, it is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s way out of this impasse draws on his experience in office. He would start by lowering the temperature, and then gradually build confidence and a working relationship. Rather than listing all their grievances, the American president would say to his Chinese counterpart, “Mr President, the two greatest dangers to peace right now are us two. In the sense that we have the capacity to destroy humanity.” China and America, without formally announcing anything, would aim to practise restraint. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Never a fan of policymaking bureaucracies, Mr Kissinger would like to see a small group of advisers, with easy access to each other, working together tacitly. Neither side would fundamentally change its position on Taiwan, but America would take care over how it deploys its forces and try not to feed the suspicion that it supports the island&#39;s independence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s second piece of advice to aspiring leaders is: “Define objectives that can enlist people. Find means, describable means, of achieving these objectives.” Taiwan would be just the first of several areas where the superpowers could find common ground and so foster global stability.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In a recent speech Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, suggested that these should include climate change and the economy. Mr Kissinger is sceptical about both. Although he is “all for” action on the climate, he doubts it can do much to create confidence or help establish a balance between the two superpowers. On the economy, the danger is that the trade agenda is hijacked by hawks who are unwilling to give China any room to develop at all.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That all-or-nothing attitude is a threat to the broader search for detente. If America wants to find a way to live with China, it should not be aiming for regime change. Mr Kissinger draws on a theme present in his thought from the very beginning. “In any diplomacy of stability, there has to be some element of the 19th-century world,” he says. “And the 19th-century world was based on the proposition that the existence of the states contesting it was not at issue.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some Americans believe that a defeated China would become democratic and peaceful. Yet, however much Mr Kissinger would prefer China to be a democracy, he sees no precedent for that outcome. More likely, a collapse of the communist regime would lead to a civil war that hardened into ideological conflict and only added to global instability. “It&#39;s not in our interest to drive China to dissolution,” he says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Rather than digging in, America will have to acknowledge China has interests. A good example is Ukraine.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s president, Xi Jinping, only recently contacted Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Many observers have dismissed Mr Xi&#39;s call as an empty gesture designed to placate Europeans, who complain that China is too close to Russia. By contrast, Mr Kissinger sees it as a declaration of serious intent that will complicate the diplomacy surrounding the war, but which may also create precisely the sort of opportunity to build the superpowers&#39; mutual trust. </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/02-inevitable.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger begins his analysis by condemning Russia&#39;s president, Vladimir Putin. “It was certainly a catastrophic mistake of judgment by Putin at the end,” he says. But the West is not without blame. “I thought that the decision to…leave open the membership of Ukraine in <small>NATO</small> was very wrong.” That was destabilising, because dangling the promise of <small>NATO</small> protection without a plan to bring it about left Ukraine poorly defended even as it was guaranteed to enrage not only Mr Putin, but also many of his compatriots.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The task now is to bring the war to an end, without setting the stage for the next round of conflict. Mr Kissinger says that he wants Russia to give up as much as possible of the territory that it conquered in 2014, but the reality is that in any ceasefire Russia is likely to keep Sevastopol (the biggest city in Crimea and Russia&#39;s main naval base on the Black Sea), at the very least. Such a settlement, in which Russia loses some gains but retains others, could leave both a dissatisfied Russia and a dissatisfied Ukraine. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/779/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/513/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/769/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/820/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1025/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1281/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1640/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In his view, that is a recipe for future confrontation. “What the Europeans are now saying is, in my view, madly dangerous,” he says. “Because the Europeans are saying: &#39;We don&#39;t want them in <small>NATO</small> , because they&#39;re too risky. And therefore, we&#39;ll arm the hell out of them and give them the most advanced weapons.&#39;” His conclusion is stark: “We have now armed Ukraine to a point where it will be the best-armed country and with the least strategically experienced leadership in Europe.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> To establish a lasting peace in Europe requires the West to take two leaps of imagination. The first is for Ukraine to join <small>NATO</small> , as a means of restraining it, as well as protecting it. The second is for Europe to engineer a rapprochement with Russia, as a way to create a stable eastern border. </p></div><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/03-weird-position.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Plenty of Western countries would understandably balk at one or other of those aims. With China involved, as an ally of Russia&#39;s and an opponent of <small>NATO</small> , the task will become even harder. China has an overriding interest to see Russia emerge intact from the war in Ukraine. Not only does Mr Xi have a “no-limits” partnership with Mr Putin to honour, but a collapse in Moscow would trouble China by creating a power vacuum in Central Asia that risks being filled by a “Syrian-type civil war”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Following Mr Xi&#39;s call to Mr Zelensky, Mr Kissinger believes that China may be positioning itself to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. As one of the architects of the policy that pitted America and China against the Soviet Union, he doubts that China and Russia can work together well. True, they share a suspicion of the United States, but he also believes that they have an instinctive distrust of one another. “I have never met a Russian leader who said anything good about China,” he says. “And I&#39;ve never met a Chinese leader who said anything good about Russia.” They are not natural allies. </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/04-russia.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The Chinese have entered diplomacy over Ukraine as an expression of their national interest, Mr Kissinger says. Although they refuse to countenance the destruction of Russia, they do recognise that Ukraine should remain an independent country and they have cautioned against the use of nuclear weapons. They may even accept Ukraine&#39;s desire to join <small>NATO</small> . “China does this, in part, because they do not want to clash with the United States,” he says. “They are creating their own world order, in so far as they can.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> The second area where China and America need to talk is <small>AI</small> . “We are at the very beginning of a capability where machines could impose global pestilence or other pandemics,” he says, “not just nuclear but any field of human destruction.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He acknowledges that even experts in <small>AI</small> do not know what its powers will be (going by the evidence of our discussions, transcribing a thick, gravelly German accent is still beyond its capabilities). But Mr Kissinger believes that <small>AI</small> will become a key factor in security within five years. He compares its disruptive potential to the invention of printing, which spread ideas that played a part in causing the devastating wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p class="article__body-cite"> <cite>“There are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable…[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text"> “[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness,” Mr Kissinger warns. Despite the doctrine that a human should be in the loop, automatic and unstoppable weapons may be created. “If you look at military history, you can say, it has never been possible to destroy all your opponents, because of limitations of geography and of accuracy. [Now] there are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AI</small> cannot be abolished. China and America will therefore need to harness its power militarily to a degree, as a deterrent. But they can also limit the threat it poses, in the way that arms-control talks limited the threat of nuclear weapons. “I think we have to begin exchanges on the impact of technology on each other,” he says. “We have to take baby steps towards arms control, in which each side presents the other with controllable material about capabilities.” Indeed, he believes that the negotiations themselves could help build mutual trust and the confidence that enables the superpowers to practise restraint. The secret is leaders strong and wise enough to understand that <small>AI</small> must not be pushed to its limits. “And if you then rely entirely on what you can achieve through power, you&#39;re likely to destroy the world.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s third piece of advice for aspiring leaders is to “link all of these to your domestic objectives, whatever they are.” For America, that involves learning how to be more pragmatic, focusing on the qualities of leadership and, most of all, renewing the country&#39;s political culture.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger&#39;s model for pragmatic thinking is India. He recalls a function at which a former senior Indian administrator explained that foreign policy should be based on non-permanent alliances geared to the issues, rather than tying up a country in big multilateral structures.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such a transactional approach will not come naturally to America. The theme running through Mr Kissinger&#39;s epic history of international relations, “Diplomacy”, is that the United States insists on depicting all its main foreign interventions as expressions of its manifest destiny to remake the world in its own image as a free, democratic, capitalist society.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The problem for Mr Kissinger is the corollary, which is that moral principles too often override interests—even when they will not produce desirable change. He acknowledges that human rights matter, but disagrees with putting them at the heart of your policy. The difference is between imposing them, or saying that it will affect relations, but the decision is theirs. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="2300" height="1536" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2300/1536/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/134/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/401/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/534/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/668/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/855/90/media-assets/image/20230520_FBD003.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> “We tried [imposing them] in Sudan,” he notes. “Look at Sudan now.” Indeed, the knee-jerk insistence on doing the right thing can become an excuse for failing to think through the consequences of policy, he says. The people who want to use power to change the world, Mr Kissinger argues, are often idealists, even though realists are more typically seen as willing to use force.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is an essential counterweight to China&#39;s growing power. Yet it also has a worsening record of religious intolerance, judicial bias and a muzzled press. One implication—though Mr Kissinger did not directly comment—is that India will therefore be a test of whether America can be pragmatic. Japan will be another. Relations will be fraught if, as Mr Kissinger predicts, Japan takes moves to secure nuclear weapons within five years. With one eye on the diplomatic manoeuvres that more or less kept the peace in the 19th century, he looks to Britain and France to help the United States think strategically about the balance of power in Asia.</p><h2> Big-shoe-fillers wanted</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership will matter, too. Mr Kissinger has long been a believer in the power of individuals. Franklin D. Roosevelt was far-sighted enough to prepare an isolationist America for what he saw as an inevitable war against the Axis powers. Charles de Gaulle gave France a belief in the future. John F. Kennedy inspired a generation. Otto von Bismarck engineered German unification, and governed with dexterity and restraint—only for his country to succumb to war-fever after he was ousted.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Kissinger acknowledges that 24-hour news and social media make his style of diplomacy harder. “I don&#39;t think a president today could send an envoy with the powers that I had,” he says. But he argues that to agonise about whether a way ahead is even possible would be a mistake. “If you look at the leaders whom I&#39;ve respected, they didn&#39;t ask that question. They asked, &#39;Is it necessary?&#39;”</p><p class="article__body-text"> He recalls the example of Winston Lord, a member of his staff in the Nixon administration. “When we intervened in Cambodia, he wanted to quit. And I told him, &#39;You can quit and march around this place carrying a placard. Or you can help us solve the Vietnam war.&#39; And he decided to stay… What we need [is] people who make that decision—that they&#39;re living in this time, and they want to do something about it, other than feel sorry for themselves.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Leadership reflects a country&#39;s political culture. Mr Kissinger, like many Republicans, worries that American education dwells on America&#39;s darkest moments. “In order to get a strategic view you need faith in your country,” he says. The shared perception of America&#39;s worth has been lost.</p><p class="article__body-text"> He also complains that the media lack a sense of proportion and judgment. When he was in office the press were hostile, but he still had a dialogue with them. “They drove me nuts,” he says. “But that was part of the game…they weren&#39;t unfair.” Today, in contrast, he says that the media have no incentive to be reflective. “My theme is the need for balance and moderation. Institutionalise that. That&#39;s the aim.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Worst of all, though, is politics itself. When Mr Kissinger came to Washington, politicians from the two parties would routinely dine together. He was on friendly terms with George McGovern, a Democratic presidential candidate. For a national security adviser from the other side that would be unlikely today, he believes. Gerald Ford, who took over after Nixon resigned, was the sort of person whose opponents could rely on him to act decently. Today, any means are considered acceptable.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think Trump and now Biden have driven [animosity] over the top,” Mr Kissinger says. He fears that a situation like Watergate could lead to violence and that America lacks leadership. “I don&#39;t think Biden can supply the inspiration and…I&#39;m hoping that Republicans can come up with somebody better,” he says. “It&#39;s not a great moment in history,” he laments, “but the alternative is total abdication.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> America desperately needs long-term strategic thinking, he believes. “That&#39;s our big challenge which we must solve. If we don&#39;t, the predictions of failure will be proved true.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> If time is short and leadership lacking, where does that leave the prospects for China and the United States finding a way to live together in peace?</p><p class="article__body-text"> “We all have to admit we&#39;re in a new world,” Mr Kissinger says, “for whatever we do can go wrong. And there is no guaranteed course.” Even so he professes to feel hope. “Look, my life has been difficult, but it gives ground for optimism. And difficulty—it&#39;s also a challenge. It shouldn&#39;t always be an obstacle.” </p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2022/audio-player/?manifest=kissinger/05-kant.json" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"> He stresses that humanity has taken enormous strides. True, that progress has often occurred in the aftermath of terrible conflict—after the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic wars and the second world war, for example, but the rivalry between China and America could be different. History suggests that, when two powers of this type encounter each other, the normal outcome is military conflict. “But this is not a normal circumstance,” Mr Kissinger argues, “because of mutually assured destruction and artificial intelligence.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> “I think it&#39;s possible that you can create a world order on the basis of rules that Europe, China and India could join, and that&#39;s already a good slice of humanity. So if you look at the practicality of it, it can end well—or at least it can end without catastrophe and we can make progress.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is the task for the leaders of today&#39;s superpowers. “Immanuel Kant said peace would either occur through human understanding or some disaster,” Mr Kissinger explains. “He thought that it would occur through reason, but he could not guarantee it. That is more or less what I think.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> World leaders therefore bear a heavy responsibility. They require the realism to face up to the dangers ahead, the vision to see that a solution lies in achieving a balance between their countries&#39; forces, and the restraint to refrain from using their offensive powers to the maximum. “It is an unprecedented challenge and great opportunity,” Mr Kissinger says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The future of humanity depends on getting it right. Well into the fourth hour of the day&#39;s conversation, and just weeks before his birthday celebrations, Mr Kissinger adds with a characteristic twinkle, “I won&#39;t be around to see it either way.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 17 May 2023 14:41:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ljr6qha8c5njtiqbn0u45vjmrjjcduc6</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/17/henry-kissinger-explains-how-to-avoid-world-war-three </item><item><title><![CDATA[China learns to manage decline]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBD000.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">T</span> <small>HE DEMOGRAPHIC</small> milestones come thick and fast in “My Home in the Forest”, the official tourism anthem of Yichun, a sprawling city in China&#39;s far north-east.

Its focus on ecotourism reflects hopes and fears that are specific to Yichun, a city trying to reinvent itself after its vast state-owned timber mills closed about a decade ago. Its boosterism shows off the entrepreneurial side of Chinese bureaucrats, who for several decades now have earned bonuses and promotions by presiding over local economic growth. When Chaguan visited recently, city officials tirelessly showed off Yichun&#39;s attractions, from tasty blueberries to its dinosaur museum. By way of emphasis, officials unexpectedly interrupted an interview to break into “My Home in the Forest”, clapping and swaying as they sang. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Still, the ballad&#39;s wistful evocation of family life should haunt Communist Party bosses all across China. Chaguan was not in Yichun to talk about berries, but because the city is at the leading edge of a demographic crisis that will soon hit the whole country. Birth rates are falling in China. The most recent national census, in 2020, revealed a total fertility rate (births per woman) of 1.3. The <small>UN</small> put the number at 1.2 last year. That is among the world&#39;s lowest and far below that needed to maintain a stable population, namely, just over two children per woman.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/is-chinese-power-about-to-peak">Is Chinese power about to peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak">At what height will China&#39;s economy peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap">How Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power">How China measures national power</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/the-fall-of-empires-preys-on-xi-jinpings-mind">The fall of empires preys on Xi Jinping&#39;s mind</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> The census found an extreme situation in Yichun. No Chinese city has as few children, as a share of its population. Just 7.4% of its 879,000 residents are under 14. For comparison, children in the same age range account for almost 18% of the Chinese population as a whole. Even in some of the greyest cities in Japan or South Korea, children are more common than in Yichun. The latest numbers are grim. In 2021 just 2,321 babies were born there, against 8,817 deaths. A generation earlier, in 2000, the city&#39;s overall population was about a third larger than today. Yichun saw over 17,000 births that year, or eight times as many babies as now.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Though exceptionally bad, Yichun&#39;s baby bust reflects demographic woes across China&#39;s north-east rustbelt. The total fertility rate in the province of Heilongjiang, of which Yichun is part, is just 0.76 babies per woman of child-bearing age. One cause is working adults heading south. Marriage rates are also falling among those who stay.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A shrinking population will test China&#39;s growth-orientated political system. On May 5th President Xi Jinping signalled new realism about this challenge at a meeting of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs, a powerful body that he chairs. The commission heard that lower birth rates, an ageing population and demographic disparities between regions are a “new normal” to which policymakers must adapt. Officials were told to focus on education, on building a “childbirth-friendly society” and on helping the old to lead active lives. Rather than growth, the talk is of “high-quality population development”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Few cities like to admit to shrinking. That is in part because officials are rewarded for <small>GDP</small> growth, and in part because land sales are a big source of local-government revenue. As long as cities kept expanding, officials could easily justify auctioning new plots to developers. But the latest census leaves less room for denial.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yichun is a good place to see these trends. In 2001 the city published a plan predicting that the population would grow to 1.4m by 2020: a spectacular overestimate. In person, officials still dodge questions about birth statistics, preferring to offer anecdotes about friends having babies. Wang Hao, head of the city&#39;s Communist Youth League branch, enthuses about Yichun supporting new jobs that appeal to the young, such as tagging traffic lights on maps and street-view images for makers of autonomous cars. Tellingly, though, Mr Wang admits that he has only one child, murmuring that he and his wife are too busy for more.</p><h2> The politics of contraction</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, Yichun has quietly merged some urban districts and combined some schools. In January it shed a series of outlying subdistricts, turning them into rural townships: a rare example of de-urbanisation. Dusty, apparently deserted housing estates are not hard to spot on the edge of town. Long Ying, an urban planner at Tsinghua University, co-wrote a recent study that used satellite images of night-time lighting to identify over 750 cities in China that shrank between 2013 and 2018. He describes different causes. Some cities lose people because natural resources run out. Others shed working-age adults to nearby big cities. Remote border towns are a third category. Not all are economic laggards. Professor Long wonders if China will see a fourth category in the near-future: coastal cities that lose workers to robots while still booming. Managing decline is very new for Chinese officials, he says. But he sees examples of pragmatism, pointing to north-eastern cities that turned derelict neighbourhoods into large parks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s one-child policy limited births from 1980 to 2016. It left a heavy mark on cities like Yichun, with large state employers that enforced family-planning rules strictly. Now Heilongjiang offers subsidies to promote second and even third births. The money offered does not offset the economic pain of losing Yichun&#39;s timber industry, says a man collecting his only grandchild from primary school. Before, he scoffs, “people wanted to have children but weren&#39;t allowed. Now they allow it but people can&#39;t afford children”. Politically, expansion is an easier sell than squeezing more from less. Party bosses are becoming more open about the task ahead.

The Communist Party felt the time was right to publish a speech by Xi Jinping, China&#39;s supreme leader, that he had delivered a year earlier, as the economy reeled from the impact of his “zero-covid” policy.

He insists that China&#39;s “great rejuvenation”, to be achieved by the 100th anniversary of Communist rule in 2049, is “irreversible”. That is, the country will, by then, become even stronger and more influential. But he has stressed the need to avoid mistakes that caused the fall of dynasties during the country&#39;s 2,100-year-long imperial era, which ended in 1911, as well as those that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union 80 years later. Since he took power more than a decade ago, he has often mused on the inconstancy of national greatness and threats to the party&#39;s rule. History clearly haunts him. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi talks of the “cyclical nature of history”, whereby strong and prosperous regimes sooner or later unravel. The speech he gave a year ago, to the party&#39;s chief enforcers of internal discipline, was about how China must “jump out” of this historical pattern. State media summarised Mr Xi&#39;s remarks shortly after he delivered them, but the (still only partial) text that was published in January was fuller and more dramatic. In it, Mr Xi&#39;s anxiety is clear. He told the officials that the cyclical tendency was a “major issue”, relating to “the life and death of the party, and the rise or fall or success or failure of our country&#39;s socialist system”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Discussion of this cycle has a long history in China. Official literature traces it back to the party&#39;s days as a guerrilla force at the end of the second world war when its leader, Mao Zedong, was reportedly asked by an inquisitive visitor to his base how the party would avoid the trap. His (disingenuous) answer was “democracy—only if people are allowed to supervise the government will it dare not to relax”. Mr Xi insists that China has become democratic already, far more so than Western countries. But state media credit him with another means of avoiding decline. He calls it “self-revolution”, a euphemism for endless purges of officials who are corrupt or disloyal.</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more</b> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/is-chinese-power-about-to-peak">Is Chinese power about to peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak">At what height will China&#39;s economy peak?</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/08/china-v-america-how-xi-jinping-plans-to-narrow-the-military-gap">How Xi Jinping plans to narrow the military gap</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power">How China measures national power</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/china-learns-to-manage-decline">China learns to manage decline</a></li></ul></aside><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Xi dwells on the collapse of the Soviet Union even more than his predecessors did. In his view, its causes were chiefly political: ideological laxity and a lack of discipline within its ruling party. In his published speeches, he does not spend much time on other problems that may have played a part, such as the financial burden of military competition with the West, or the costs of having swathes of the economy under the control of inefficient state-owned enterprises. To Mr Xi, the simple moral is that China&#39;s Communist Party needs to be much tougher. As he puts it, nobody in the Soviet Union was “man enough” to crush opposition when the crunch came. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP004.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="Statue of KGB founder Feliks Dzerzhinsky falls in front of KGB Lubyanka headquarters.

But he also warns of mounting perils ahead. “At present and in the future, we are facing many contradictions, risks and challenges at home and abroad, and we must not take it lightly,” he said in 2016, even before Donald Trump was elected as president and tensions with America began to escalate. If China were to fail to respond effectively, he added, problems in areas such as the economy, society and the environment could “evolve into political contradictions, risks and challenges that will ultimately endanger the party&#39;s ruling status and national security”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> As more difficult years loom—with an ageing society, shrinking population and slowing growth—logic might seem to prod Mr Xi to consider economic and social reforms. Useful ones would include scaling back state-owned firms, giving private businesses freer rein in critical parts of the economy and providing rural migrants with fairer access to state-funded health care and education in cities. But his end-of-dynasty fears will complicate decision-making. He views state enterprises as a bulwark of party rule and big private firms, notably those in the tech industry, with suspicion. He sees the middle class as another pillar of support: he may not want to alienate it by appearing to splurge on urban society&#39;s underdogs.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The dilemma is captured in a mid-19th-century book by Alexis de Tocqueville: “The Old Regime and the Revolution”. Translations of the French historian&#39;s classic work about his country&#39;s revolution in 1789 have been hot sellers in China since the months before Mr Xi took over. It owes its popularity to an unexplained recommendation by Wang Qishan, a party bigwig who became Mr Xi&#39;s chief enforcer of discipline and, later, vice-president (he stepped down in March). Readers comb Tocqueville&#39;s analysis of France&#39;s turmoil for insights into China&#39;s future.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One clause is usually highlighted. It is that “experience teaches that the most critical moment for bad governments is the one which witnesses their first steps toward reform.” It is unlikely that Mr Wang meant to imply that the party was ruling badly, or that reforms should cease. But he could have been suggesting that a period of relative prosperity, such as France experienced before the revolution, can be fraught with political danger. The party must be on its guard.</p><h2> Learning from Tacitus</h2><p class="article__body-text"> There is little sign of regime-threatening discontent brewing in China. But Mr Xi is certainly watchful. In 2019 China&#39;s head of public security said that preventing a “colour revolution” in China was a priority for the police. Protests in November against the zero-covid policy, though small and scattered, will have reinforced Mr Xi&#39;s concerns. Such open displays of dissent are rare. Even more unusually, some demonstrators called on Mr Xi to step down.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As economic growth slows in the years ahead, unease over living standards is likely to grow, and with it Mr Xi&#39;s anxiety. In 2014 he referred to what Chinese scholars call the “Tacitus trap”. This is the idea, taken from the Roman historian&#39;s writings, that “when a ruler once becomes unpopular, all his acts, be they good or bad, tell against him.” Mr Xi said: “Of course, we haven&#39;t got to this stage yet, but the problems we face can&#39;t be described as unserious. We must use huge energy to resolve them.” Since then, his warnings have become more strident. “The more we proceed, the harder and more dangerous it gets,” he said in 2018. Mr Xi has yet to refer publicly to the Peak China concept, but the risks of stalling are clearly on his mind. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>订阅者可以订阅我们新的每周时事通讯<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">《鼓楼》</a> ，以了解世界对中国的影响以及中国对世界的影响。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 11:16:37 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/bhma0j6088tai5o65e5pcgv54u68rla0</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/the-fall-of-empires-preys-on-xi-jinpings-mind </item><item><title><![CDATA[How China measures national power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="XI'AN, CHINA - APRIL 12: A general view of the Terracotta Warriors are seen on April 12, 2017 in Xi'an, China (Ian Hitchcock/Getty Images)" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230513_FBP001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>N “GUANZI”,</small> a text from the seventh century <small>BC</small> , a statesman thought to be called Guan Zhong lays out the “eight views” needed to assess a country&#39;s status. “Tour its mountains and lakes,” he says, “observe its agriculture, and calculate its production of six types of livestock.

In a paper from 2002, Hu Angang and Men Honghua, then of Tsinghua University, listed eight categories of resources, taking in everything from farmland to computers. <small>CNP</small> is calculated as a weighted average of these resources as a share of the world&#39;s total. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has a similar model, but uses different indicators and weightings. Who is right? Some indexes rely for their weightings on polls of experts, but that&#39;s just a sophisticated version of the conventional wisdom. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1156/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1156/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/380/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/570/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/761/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1141/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1217/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1521/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1901/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2434/90/media-assets/image/20230513_FBC108.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Another problem is that the calculation of <small>CNP</small> produces a single number, but the components that make it up are not interchangeable.

A country&#39;s cultural exports can convey soft power, but they are of little use in a war.

Instead, it has spurred researchers to come up with their own, improved versions. <i>The Economist</i> has counted 69 of them. Not to be deterred, we have added to the pile. Drawing inspiration from an article by Michael Beckley of Tufts University, we zoom in on the three essential ingredients of national power: economic heft, productive efficiency and military might.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A country cannot be powerful if its economy is inefficient. In the 19th century China lost two opium wars to Britain, despite having a <small>GDP</small> twice the size. On the other hand, neither can a country be powerful if its economy is efficient but small. Luxembourg has not won many wars. And countries cannot fight without a decent army. In the Song dynasty the deadly Mongol cavalry outmatched even the finest Chinese infantry. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Our hard-power index therefore uses <small>GDP</small> per person to stand for efficiency, military expenditure for might, and non-military <small>GDP</small> for economic heft. These are multiplied, so that countries suffer for their deficiency in any one of them. In the extreme, if any element is zero, then a country&#39;s power is zero, too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Of course, old weapon stocks and nuclear arms also convey might. And <small>GDP</small> does not always translate into economic heft or efficiency. But, at least in the current era, our proxies seem reasonable enough.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By our measure, China has been gaining on America, but the latter is still comfortably on top.

No peak was in sight.去年年底，该银行重新审视了它的计算。 It now thinks China&#39;s economy will not overtake America&#39;s until 2035 and at its high point will be only 14% bigger (see chart).</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s peak looks similar in an influential forecast from last year by Roland Rajah and Alyssa Leng of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. Others see an even lower summit. Capital Economics, a research firm, argues that China&#39;s economy will never be number one.它将在 2035 年达到美国面积的 90%，然后逐渐缩小。 In so far as the Peak China thesis can be captured in a single projection, this is it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What accounts for the lower expectations for China&#39;s economy?减少多少是必要的？ The answers hinge on three variables: population, productivity and prices.从人口开始。 China&#39;s workforce has already peaked, according to official statistics. It has 4.5 times as many 15- to 64-year-olds as America. By mid-century it will have only 3.4 times as many, according to the <small>UN</small> ’s “median” forecast. By the end of the century the ratio will drop to 1.7.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But China&#39;s demographic prospects have not changed much over the past decade, even as forecasts for economic growth have shrunk.事实上，高盛的新预测假设中国劳动力的下降比旧劳动力更温和，因为健康状况的改善可能会让年长的工人在磨刀石上工作更长时间。 The bank believes the labour supply in China will drop by about 7% from 2025 to 2050. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The biggest swing in sentiment relates not to population but to productivity.早在 2011 年，高盛就认为劳动生产率在未来 20 年内平均每年增长约 4.8%。现在银行认为它会增长3%左右。 Mark Williams of Capital Economics takes a similar view. China will fall “off the path of an Asian outperformer onto the path of a solidly respectable emerging economy”, he says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are good reasons to be gloomy about Chinese workers&#39; productivity. As China ages, it will have to devote more of its economic energies to serving the elderly, leaving less to invest in new kit and capacity.更重要的是，经过几十年的快速资本积累，新投资的回报正在减少。 A new high-speed rail line across mountainous Tibet yields far smaller benefits at much greater cost than connecting Beijing and Shanghai, for instance.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s rulers are trying to impose more discipline on local governments, which build much of China&#39;s questionable infrastructure.不幸的是，他们似乎同样热衷于将自己的意志强加于中国民营企业。 In China, unlike elsewhere, firms earn a smaller return on their assets as they grow bigger, points out Capital Economics: “Get to a certain size and companies have to give as much thought to meeting the needs of officials as those of consumers.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> It is not just their own government that is hobbling Chinese businesses. In October America imposed controls on sales of advanced computer chips to China. This will hurt Chinese firms making products like mobile phones, medical equipment and cars. Goldman Sachs has not incorporated this damage into its long-term forecasts, but estimates that China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> towards the end of this decade could be about 2% smaller than it would otherwise have been.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The tech war could go further. Diego Cerdeiro of the <small>IMF</small> and his co-authors have examined a scenario in which America curtails its own technology trade with China, persuades other <small>OECD</small> members to follow suit, and forces countries outside this club to pick sides in the battle. Under this extreme scenario, China&#39;s economy could be about 9% smaller in ten years&#39; time than it otherwise would be. The idea that China&#39;s productivity growth might be closer to 3% than 5%, in other words, is not far-fetched.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Any predictions of the economic future must, of course, be taken with a pinch of salt. Forecasts often go awry. Small differences in the evolution of productivity or population when combined and compounded over many years can yield starkly different outcomes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Forecasts are also sensitive to prices—especially the relative price of currencies. Unexpected shifts in exchange rates can make a mockery of predictions of relative economic heft. At the moment, a basket of goods and services that costs $100 in America costs only about $60 in China. That suggests its currency, the yuan, is undervalued. Capital Economics thinks this undervaluation will persist.另一方面，高盛认为它会缩小，要么是因为人民币升值，要么是因为中国的物价上涨速度快于美国。 This process will, in Goldman&#39;s view, add about 20% to China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> by mid-century. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> If China&#39;s prices or exchange rate fail to rise as Goldman Sachs expects, then China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> might never overtake America&#39;s. If China&#39;s labour productivity grows just half a percentage point slower than Goldman Sachs envisages, its <small>GDP</small> , everything else constant, will also never surpass America&#39;s (see chart). The same is true if America grows half a point faster (as Capital Economic projects).如果中国的生育率进一步下降（到本世纪中叶每名妇女生育 0.85 个孩子），它可能会在 2030 年代勉强领先，但到 2050 年代就会失去领先优势。 Even if China&#39;s economy does become the biggest in the world, its lead is likely to remain small. It is unlikely to establish an edge over America equivalent to the 40% lead America now enjoys over it, Mr Rajah and Ms Leng argue.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It also seems safe to say that China and America will remain in a position of near-parity for decades.在高盛的设想中，中国在 40 多年的时间里保持着对美国的微小但持续的领先优势。 Even in Capital Economics&#39;s projection, China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> will still be over 80% of America&#39;s as late as 2050. China will remain a geopolitical rival to be reckoned with. That is crucial: if China&#39;s peak is more Table Mountain than <small>K</small> 2, its leaders will have little incentive to rush to confrontation before decline sets in. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>订阅者可以订阅我们新的每周时事通讯<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/drum-tower">《鼓楼》</a> ，以了解世界对中国的影响以及中国对世界的影响。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 10:37:50 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/gnrpiemprbp0a4nps2vir4luvk15nhmf</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak</item></channel></rss>
