日</small>，美国最大的货运公司之一 Yellow 宣布破产，并宣布将在经营 99 年后结束业务。该公司在销售额下降和巨额债务的重压下崩溃了。这对于其所有者和 30,000 名员工来说是一个沉重的打击。这也象征着美国物流业正在发生急剧逆转。</p><p class="article__body-text">从 2020 年开始，巨额刺激支票，加上封锁导致的服务支出紧缩，导致美国消费者在商品上挥霍无度。电器、汽车和家具堵塞了港口、仓库和卡车仓库。由于购物者避开商店，在线送货量激增，从而增加了需求。根据美国人口普查局的数据，随着消费者对长时间延误的抱怨，物流行业的收入猛增，从 2020 年初到 2022 年中期增加了约三分之一。该行业的公司雇佣了 100 万工人，并建造了 18 亿平方英尺（近三个曼哈顿）的新存储空间，希望泡沫能够持续下去。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1"

class="article__body-text">现在，随着推动其崛起的力量逐渐消退，美国的物流繁荣正在走向衰退。消费者正在用材料换取体验，选择在假期和招待上挥霍，而不是胡佛。经通胀调整后的商品支出停滞不前，导致零售商库存过剩。消费者也开始回归实体店，减少了商品到达目的地所需的里程数。物流行业收入现已连续三个季度环比下降（见图表）。衡量铁路和卡车活动的卡斯货运指数去年下降了 5%。供应链技术公司 Descartes 的数据显示，7 月份流经美国港口的货物量比去年同月减少了 14%。</p><p class="article__body-text">随着需求下降，价格也下降。物流数据提供商<small>DAT</small> Freight &amp; Analytics 的数据显示，“干货车”运输（公路运输不易腐烂货物的最常见方式）的成本比 2022 年初降低了 21%。这反过来又挤压了利润率并使竞争力较弱的公司破产。另一家数据提供商<small>ACT</small> Research 表示，自 2022 年中期以来，约有 20,000 家卡车运营商（占全国总数的近 3%）停止了活动。</p><p class="article__body-text">那些幸存下来的公司正在裁员。根据美国劳工统计局的数据，自去年 10 月该行业就业达到顶峰以来，美国包裹递送公司已解雇了 38,700 名工人。仓库经营者已裁员60,800人。鉴于过去几年的疯狂招聘，可能还会有更多裁员。就业门户网站 Glassdoor 的首席经济学家亚伦·特拉萨斯 (Aaron Terrazas) 认为，鉴于消费者支出停滞不前，该行业的裁员情况迄今为止尚未达到人们的预期。 <small>ACT</small> Research 的蒂姆·德诺耶 (Tim Denoyer) 认为，由于长期遭受劳动力短缺的困扰，许多公司一直不愿裁员。</p><p class="article__body-text">投资也在削减。仓储巨头普洛斯(Prologis)观察到，美国在建仓库数量较一年前下降了40%。美国最大的在线零售商亚马逊在疫情期间将其在该国的仓库面积增加了一倍。物流咨询公司<small>MWPVL</small>估计，在过去的一年里，电子帝国要么推迟了投资，要么取消了计划，要么关闭了 116 处房产。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">工会的麻烦加剧了该行业的头痛。今年早些时候，几个西海岸港口的码头工人举行了与薪资谈判有关的罢工。美国最大的两家包裹递送公司<small>UPS</small>和 FedEx 也面临着动荡。 Yellow 的管理层将其崩溃归咎于卡车司机工会，该工会阻止了重组计划。</p><p class="article__body-text">乐观者希望，一旦零售商清理完多余库存并开始重新补货，该行业将在下半年再次开始发展。分析师预计，过去三个季度营收同比萎缩的<small>UPS</small>将在 2023 年底前恢复增长。联邦快递预计明年将再次实现增长。只要美国经济继续出人意料地强劲，这种情况很可能会成为现实。但对于那些在此过程中破产的企业来说，这将是冰冷的安慰。 <span

data-caps="initial">经历</span><small>了</small>一段坎坷的旅程。作为上市公司的头六个月，Uber 的股价暴跌了四分之一，原因是人们对这家公司能否长期盈利的质疑不断。亏损者永远会盈利。此后，它出现了波动，在大流行时代对科技股的热潮中飙升，然后由于利率上升破坏了投资者对依赖廉价融资的企业的兴趣而回落。</p><p class="article__body-text">自去年 7 月跌至最低点以来，有迹象显示，Uber 的财务纪律更加严格，已将 Uber 股价推回到 2019 年首次交易的水平。票价上涨了。本月，该公司公布今年第二季度营业利润为 3.26 亿美元，首次实现盈利。 8 月 8 日，Uber 的主要竞争对手 Lyft 再次报告运营亏损 1.59 亿美元，这让 Uber 更加高兴。 Lyft 的市值依然低迷，较 2019 年（比 Uber 早六周）开始公开交易的水平下降了 85%。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">不过，对于 Uber 来说，收支平衡是成功的门槛很低。即使加上最新的利润，自 2014 年首次发布业绩以来，该公司的净亏损已达到 310 亿美元。投资者目前在该公司持有 210 亿美元的投资资本。按年计算最近季度营业利润意味着税后资本回报率约为 5%。这还不到该公司当前资本成本的一半，这表明投资者的资金可以更有效地配置在其他地方。</p><p class="article__body-text">当然，人们希望优步的利润在突破地面后，将飙升至最高水平。稍安毋躁。过去五年，该公司超过 60% 的收入增长来自于网约车以外的业务。最重要的是食品配送，在疫情期间激增。优步在运送餐食时的利润率（扣除利息、税项、折旧及摊销前）还不到运送乘客时的一半。</p><p class="article__body-text">优步承诺，随着业务的成熟，该业务将继续变得更加有利可图。然而，DoorDash 的利润率也好不到哪里去，该公司在美国的食品配送销售额几乎是 Uber 的三倍。在优步的第三大业务货运领域，该公司正在亏损，因为它在经济低迷的阵痛中在<a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/10/americas-logistics-boom-has-turned-to-bust" data-tegid="s22ek803kqis1bb6dnjh6sguvhfqkip5">拥挤的行业</a>中争夺空间。</p><p class="article__body-text">更令人担忧的是，优步专注于美国以外的扩张，但目前该公司在美国几乎没有增长。尽管它没有按地域分配利润，但它的利润率可能是美国最好的，它占据了约车市场近四分之三的销售额。在其他地方，它面临着来自当地竞争对手的激烈竞争：欧洲的 Bolt 和<small>FREENOW</small> 、东南亚的 Gojek 和 Grab 以及印度的 Ola。这将严格限制利润率。</p><p class="article__body-text">投资者对 Uber 的押注是基于这样的理念：叫车服务是赢家通吃的业务。这证明，在争夺市场份额的竞争中投入数十亿美元是合理的，Uber 看到了 Lyft 的困境，确实赢得了胜利——至少在国内是这样。收购这一切是否能让 Uber 成为投资者曾经希望的巨大提款机，则是另一个问题。 <span

data-caps="initial">我们</span><small>的专栏作家</small>刚刚体验了苦乐参半的乐趣，驾驶着一辆新型 Fisker Ocean 电动<small>SUV</small> ，沿着美国太平洋海岸行驶，风吹过他仅剩的头发。太棒了，因为他处于“加州模式”——这是一个巧妙的功能，只需按一下按钮即可降低所有车窗，包括后挡风玻璃，拉回太阳能电池板屋顶，并将汽车变成仅次于全能汽车的最好的东西。 -电动敞篷车。痛苦的是，因为一旦他归还了试用车，他就必须开着他的起亚 Niro <small>EV</small>回家，这种电动车体积更小，续航里程更短，而且没有开放式车顶——称之为“雨天英国模式”。令人欣慰的是，它轻了大约一吨，如果你像熊彼特那样驾驶<small>电动汽车</small>，为了彰显你的低碳街头信誉，轻量级而不是重量级应该算数。</p><p class="article__body-text">但事实并非如此。看看<small>电动汽车</small>初创公司 Fisker 8 月 3 日推出的未来产品阵容就知道了。其中包括：一款强化版越野版 Ocean，该汽车制造商的丹麦联合创始人 Henrik Fisker 表示，该车适合参加巨型卡车拉力赛；续航里程为 1,000 公里（600 英里）的“超级跑车”，以及直接从“黄石公园”出来的皮卡车，配有牛仔帽支架。当然，还有一款价格实惠的六座车，名为 Pear。不过，尽管菲斯克表示可持续发展是其创立原则之一，但它却沉迷于汽车公司几乎普遍存在的特征：制造更大、更坚固的汽车，即使是电动汽车。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">有两个原因。首先是利润。与传统汽车一样，更大的<small>电动汽车</small>会产生更高的利润。二是消费者偏好。几十年来，驾驶员一直选择<small>SUV</small>和皮卡车，而不是小型汽车，现在这也适用于电池充电的汽车。<small>电动汽车</small>司机担心充电基础设施的可用性，他们想要更大的续航里程，因此需要更大的电池。咨询公司<small>BNEF</small>表示，结果是，从 2018 年到 2022 年，全球平均电池尺寸每年增加 10%。这可能有助于让乘坐更加安心。但最终，超大尺寸趋势将被证明是不可持续且不安全的。</p><p class="article__body-text">这已经近乎荒谬了。通用汽车的悍马<small>电动车</small>重量超过 4,000 公斤，比非电动车重近一个起亚 Niro。仅其电池就与本田思域一样重。通用汽车最近还推出了一款重3,800公斤的雪佛兰Silverado电动皮卡，可以牵引拖拉机，续航里程可达720公里。特斯拉计划今年开始生产其电动“Cyber​​truck”，其老板埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)将其描述为“一辆超酷的、未来派的装甲运兵车”。这种肌肉卡车可能是说服墨守成规的皮卡车司机使用电动汽车所需要付出的代价。然而，规模对于郊区居民来说也很重要。官方预测机构国际能源署计算出，去年全球销售的电动汽车中有一半以上是<small>SUV</small> 。</p><p class="article__body-text">目前，汽车制造商可以辩称，无论电动设备有多大，它们都会对地球产生积极影响。尽管制造<small>电动</small>汽车（包括采购其中的金属和矿物）比传统汽车产生更多的温室气体，但它们很快就通过不排放尾气来弥补这一点。欧洲<small>非政府组织</small>运输与环境的卢西恩·马蒂厄表示，即使是最大的<small>电动汽车</small>，其终生碳排放量也比普通传统汽车低。即使在中国等燃煤发电充足的地方也是如此。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">但从长远来看，出于经济和环境原因，更大电池的趋势可能会适得其反。首先，电池越大，供应链的压力就越大。如果电池尺寸增加，锂和镍的短缺可能会迫在眉睫。这将推高锂离子电池的成本，损害汽车制造商的盈利能力。</p><p class="article__body-text">其次，以碳中和的方式为更大的电池充电需要更多的低碳电力。这可能会在电网上造成瓶颈。第三，对<small>电动汽车</small>生产至关重要的稀缺资源的压力越大，生产对大众市场电气化至关重要的价格实惠的电动汽车就越困难。这将减缓交通运输的整体脱碳进程。最后，还有安全。一辆眨眼之间时速从 0 到 100 公里的战斗坦克不仅会对任何挡道的人造成负担。轮胎、制动器以及道路上的磨损也会产生危险的污染物，车辆越重，情况就越严重。</p><p class="article__body-text">政府有办法鼓励<small>电动</small>汽车规模缩小。最重要的是支持充电基础设施的扩张，这将减少里程焦虑并推广小型汽车。税收可能会惩罚较重的车辆，而补贴可能会促进轻型车辆的发展。在地方层面，拥堵和停车费也可能产生类似的影响。至少，汽车制造商可能需要标注其车辆的能源和材料效率，就像欧盟的电器制造商所做的那样。</p><h2>精神错乱的焦虑</h2><p

1）。台湾制造业巨头<small>台积电</small>正斥资 400 亿美元在亚利桑那州建设两座晶圆厂。韩国三星公司正在德克萨斯州投资 170 亿美元。美国芯片制造冠军英特尔将斥资 400 亿美元在亚利桑那州和俄亥俄州建设四家晶圆厂。在《 <small>CHIPS</small>法案》庆祝一周年之际，随着政府准备开始发放资金，目前在其他方面几乎没有达成一致的民主党人和共和党人都认为这是两党的胜利。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，任何必胜论都可能为时过早。与亚洲相比，美国正在建设的领先晶圆厂建设速度较慢，运营成本较高，而且规模较小。让事情变得更加复杂的是，芯片制造商在美国的投资狂潮发生之际，他们的产品需求似乎正在降温，至少在短期内如此。这可能会对该行业的长期盈利能力产生影响。</p><p class="article__body-text">智库安全与新兴技术中心估计，在中国大陆和台湾，企业在大约 650 天内建成一座新工厂。在美国，制造商必须遵守一系列联邦、州和地方政府法规，将平均施工时间延长至 900 天。建设成本约占新晶圆厂资本支出的一半，在美国的成本可能比亚洲高出 40%。其中一些额外费用可以通过<small>《CHIPS</small>法案》的施舍来支付。但这仍然留下年度运营费用，美国的运营费用比亚洲高 30%，部分原因是美国工人的工资更高。如果能找到这些工人的话：7 月<small>，台积电</small>将其<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/05/america-is-building-chip-factories-now-to-find-the-workers">在亚利桑那州第一家晶圆厂</a>的启动推迟了一年，直至 2025 年，因为它找不到足够的具有半导体行业经验的工人。</p><p class="article__body-text">计划中的美国项目规模较小，进一步损害了经济效益。晶圆厂生产的芯片越多，单位成本就越低。在亚利桑那州，<small>台积电</small>计划每月生产 50,000 片晶圆，相当于该公司所说的两个“大型晶圆厂”。回到台湾本土，<small>台积电</small>运营着四家“巨型晶圆厂”，每家每月至少生产 100,000 片晶圆（此外还有众多大型晶圆厂）。<small>台积电</small>创始人张忠谋警告说，美国制造的芯片将会更加昂贵。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1"

class="article__body-text"><small>台积电</small>现任首席执行官CC Wei暗示，该公司将消化这些更高的成本。他有能力这样做，因为<small>台积电</small>将继续在台湾而不是美国以更便宜的价格生产大部分芯片。三星也是如此，该公司将把近90%的资本预算花在国内。甚至英特尔对外国晶圆厂的投资也多于对美国晶圆厂的投资（见图 2）。因此，如果所有计划投资得以实现，美国将生产足够的尖端芯片来满足国内仅三分之一的需求。苹果将​​继续从台湾为其 iPhone 采购高端处理器。美国新兴的<small>人工智能</small>产业综合体很可能也会如此。</p><p class="article__body-text">该法律也可能会产生意想不到的后果。接受国家援助的芯片公司被禁止扩大在中国的产能。除了抑制<small>台积电</small>和三星等拥有大量中国客户的公司加大对美国晶圆厂投资的意愿外，这些规定还促使中国芯片制造商投资生产不太精美的半导体。我们希望许多老一代芯片至少能够完成一些更高级芯片无法完成的任务。</p><p class="article__body-text">根据行业研究组织<small>SEMI 的</small>数据，2019 年中国制造了约五分之一的“后缘”芯片，这些芯片应用于从洗衣机到汽车和飞机的各种领域。到 2025 年，产量将超过三分之一。荷兰后置芯片制造商恩智浦半导体<small>(NXP</small> Semiconductor) 7 月警告称，中国公司的供应过剩正在给价格带来下行压力。从长远来看，这可能会损害成本较高的西方生产商，甚至导致其中一些生产商破产。 7月，美国商务部长吉娜·雷蒙多承认，中国对后缘的关注“是我们需要考虑的问题”。</p><p class="article__body-text">最难预测的是<small>《CHIPS</small>法案》对半导体行业臭名昭著的繁荣与萧条周期的影响。通常芯片制造商会在需求上升时提高产能。现在情况恰恰相反。大流行时代的芯片短缺已经被供过于求所取代，因为消费者对所有数字事物的贪得无厌的胃口似乎终于得到了满足。<small>台积电</small>第二季度销售额同比下降 10%，该公司目前预计 2023 年全年也会出现类似下降。英特尔截至 6 月份的三个月营收同比下降 15% 。三星将其收入和利润下降归咎于芯片供应过剩。英特尔的股价仅为 2021 年初近期峰值的一半。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB

class="article__body-text">芯片高管指出，他们的行业前景仍然乐观。他们认为需求必然会在某个时候复苏，这一点可能是正确的。然而，“库存调整”（用简单的英语来说，减少供应过剩）所花费的时间比预期的要长。当库存最终调整时，出现的业务利润可能会降低。自 2021 年初以来，英特尔、三星和<small>台积电</small>已经损失了其总市值的三分之一，即近 5000 亿美元。可能还需要几个周年纪念日才能正确评估<small>CHIPS</small>法案对美国经济安全的影响。投资者已经做出了决定。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 19:45:19 GMT</pubDate><guid

亿美元。百事可乐公司（第 245 位）仅第二季度就将其软饮料和零食的价格提高了 15%。其营业利润增长了四分之三，达到 37 亿美元。目前预计今年销售额将增长 10%，净利润将增长 12%，高于此前预测的 8% 和 9%。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国人不仅仅在​​糖果和可乐上花钱。航空旅行正在迅速复苏，尤其是国际旅行。美国航空（ <small>AI</small>指数第 266 位）、达美航空（第 193 位）和联合航空（第 183 位）上季度净利润合计达 42 亿美元，为 2015 年以来最高水平。由于休闲和商务旅客众多，酒店享有强大的定价能力。希尔顿连锁酒店（排名较低，排名第 421 位）表示，其每间可用客房的收入（首选的行业衡量标准）同比增长了 12%。</p><p class="article__body-text">繁荣能持续多久？购物者正在逐渐提取他们在大流行期间积累的储蓄，当时他们收到了政府的刺激支票，但缺乏使用方式。根据旧金山联邦储备银行的数据，2021 年 8 月至今年 5 月期间，家庭支出了超过 1.5 万亿美元的储蓄。</p><p class="article__body-text">按照这个速度，他们将在年底之前消耗掉大约 5000 亿美元的资金。尽管 7 月份失业率仍接近历史低点 3.5%，但工资增长已放缓。咨询公司牛津经济研究院(Oxford Economics)表示，在最高法院驳回拜登完全取消部分学生债务的计划后，10月份恢复学生贷款偿还可能会导致消费者支出每月减少多达90亿美元。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果利率上升最终抑制需求，企业将发现继续提高价格变得更加困难，从而使利润率更加脆弱。较高的利率也会打击资产负债表薄弱的公司。今年上半年，信用评级机构标普全球 ( <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> Global) 旗下的 340 家公司宣布破产，这是自 2010 年以来的最高数字。更多的公司可能会遭受类似的命运，特别是如果经济衰退真的来袭的话。</p><p class="article__body-text">这并非完全不可能。高盛银行认为，未来 12 个月美国经济衰退的可能性为 20%。另一家银行花旗集团预计 2024 年初经济将出现低迷。如果这种情况发生，即使是对<small>人工智能</small>最友好的公司也将无法毫发无伤。 <span

data-caps="initial">由于</span>Zoom，新冠肺炎<small>(covid</small> -19) 大流行导致许多工作旅行取消。但不是全部。一些远方的面对面会议即将回归。商务飞行也是如此。只要经常飞行，就可以轻松获得许多明显的航空旅行礼节以及飞行里程。作为一名经验丰富的旅行者，您可能已经熟记于心。尽管如此，与大流行前相比，空怒事件仍显着增加——美国增加了 50%，英国更是高达 200%。有些人可以复习一下。</p><p class="article__body-text">许多飞机礼仪规则适用于所有旅行。但作为一名商务旅行者，您不仅代表自己，还代表您的雇主，您的夹克或笔记本电脑包上可能会印有雇主的标志。因此遵守这些原则至关重要。他们在您登机前开始申请。提早到达登机口并保持时尚——不要为了逃命而气喘吁吁，甚至更糟，当你在免税店浏览商品时，要稳住飞机，让 200 个人等着你。插队者和推车者在地狱里都有自己的位置。

class="article__body-text">上船后，请记住基本知识。与人交谈时不要戴上耳机，当有人告诉你烤鸡已经做好时不要大惊小怪，或者，但愿不要在公共场合进行任何个人修饰。赤脚放在座位或舱壁上是禁忌。在笔记本电脑上打字也是如此。应避免在空乘人员的工作区域内摊开身体和进行“厨房瑜伽”。</p><p class="article__body-text">谨防饮酒。在离地面 30,000 英尺的高度，即使在加压舱内，酒精的影响也会更加明显，因为氧气含量较低。如果在起飞和着陆期间机舱压力变化时您容易感到恶心，请避免在飞行期间饮用伏特加。不守规矩、有权利的乘客往往是酗酒的乘客，反之亦然。你不想成为 TikTok 红人，你的雇主也不想。受过训练有礼貌且专业的机组人员的语气应该一致。</p><p class="article__body-text">经济舱是最棘手的。随着航空公司在经济舱上增加座位，腿部空间变得稀缺，而且您自己的餐盘也会占用您的空间。这并不能成为将脚放在小桌板上、倾斜时猛地向后靠座椅或在空乘人员分发食物时递垃圾的借口。头顶行李箱是要共享的。扶手也是如此。你无法控制谁坐在你旁边，但你有代理权。如果您发现自己与健谈的凯茜并肩而行，可以说“对不起”并戴上降噪耳机。</p><p class="article__body-text">您可能应该避免从事任何非常敏感的事情。正如你们公司的安全主管经常提醒您的那样，有些人很爱管闲事。即使那些不这样做的人也可能会无意中偷看您的电子表格。 Take the time to think about strategy or <a

class="article__body-text"> Corporate dress codes may have relaxed but opt for transatlantic athleisure only if you have time to change before heading to your meeting after you land. Boarding the red-eye in pyjama bottoms is not <small>OK</small> . Elasticated waistbands are acceptable. Yoga pants and flip-flops are not; they clash with the spirit of work—especially if colleagues and clients might be on the same flight. And you never know whom you might run into at the luggage carousel.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For those lucky enough to work for firms with fat travel budgets, business class helps attenuate these problems. You can work more freely and never need to kick the seat in front of you to let the passenger in the row ahead know they are reclining too comfortably (which, incidentally, you shouldn&#39;t do in economy either). Even so, remember you are not alone. Do not violate other passengers&#39; personal space with your body, voice (just because you are a senior vice-president at Goldman Sachs does not mean others want to listen to your phone conversation while you board) or odour (splash on your hypnotic sandalwood cologne in moderation).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Most of these challenges are eliminated if you fly first class. You get a personal suite, à la carte dining, vintage champagne and, on some flights, doorstep baggage pick-up, check-in and drop-off by airline employees (though even that probably doesn&#39;t excuse flip-flops). Or so this guest Bartleby is told. When she suggested corroborating it herself for the purposes of research, her request was regrettably denied. You will have to work this part out on your own.

That was better than expected—and provoked a roughly 10% jump in the company&#39;s share price. Yet it was a fraction of the 42% sales growth that Amazon reported for the same quarter in 2020, and slower than the giant&#39;s pre-pandemic trend. The same day Wayfair, an online purveyor of furniture that surged amid covid-19, reported its ninth consecutive quarter of declining sales. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC022.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> A slowing economy is only partly to blame for the reversal. After spiking in early 2020, the online share of retail spending in America has remained stagnant at around 15%, roughly what it would have been had the pre-pandemic trend continued uninterrupted (see chart). The story is much the same in Britain, France and Germany, according to figures from Euromonitor, a market-research firm.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In certain categories, including clothing and furniture, e-commerce penetration in America has tumbled from its pandemic peak, according to <small>TD</small> Cowen, an investment bank. Consumers have flocked back to physical stores to inspect their dresses and dressers in person.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The share of American grocery shopping online, which jumped from 4% in 2019 to 7% in 2020, is still edging up—but at a statelier pace. Last year it reached 9%. Many shoppers, it seems, still cherish the human interaction of the till or the butcher&#39;s counter. Few appreciate the squashed or under-ripe produce that arrives in the delivery van, or luck-of-the-draw substitutes for ordered fare that was out of stock. Retailers, for their part, struggle with the tricky economics of selling groceries online. Grocery is a business with wafer-thin operating margins of between 2% and 4%, according to Bain, a consultancy. Adding the cost of personnel picking products from store shelves and drivers ferrying them to customers quickly turns it into a loss-making endeavour. Relying on automated fulfilment centres instead of stores helps only a little; Ocado, a British online grocer following that strategy, oscillates between losses and the slimmest of profits.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One solution, notes Stephen Caine of Bain, is to boost margins by selling advertising; plenty of advertisers are happy to pay to show off their wares to e-shoppers. Last year Amazon generated $38bn of sales that way, some 9% of its total, excluding cloud computing. Yet most retailers, Amazon included, rely on added delivery fees to make online grocery delivery stack up. That, in turn, slows adoption. Fully 47% of Americans would do more of their grocery shopping online if delivery fees were lower, according to one survey by McKinsey, another consultancy. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> For now, much of the growth in online grocery shopping will be in kerbside pickup, reckons Mr Caine, with customers collecting pre-picked goodies from stores to save on delivery fees. Amazon&#39;s $14bn acquisition of Whole Foods, a posh supermarket, in 2017 was an admission that physical stores would remain central to the grocery business for the foreseeable future. Brick-and-mortar retailers, with their vast store networks, continue to dominate the category. Walmart, the mightiest of them all, sells 17% of Americans&#39; groceries, according to GlobalData, a research firm. Amazon&#39;s share is less than 2%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, competition in more mature areas of e-commerce is heating up. Shein, a Chinese online fast-fashion retailer popular with Gen <small>Z</small> shoppers in the West, is expanding into things like electronics and furniture. This year it launched a marketplace for third-party sellers. Its mobile app already has a third as many monthly active users in America as Amazon&#39;s. Temu, a tendril of Pinduoduo, a rising e-commerce star in China, has also grown rapidly since launching in America last year.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Another challenge comes from TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app beloved of youngsters. To monetise its users&#39; hours of scrolling, TikTok lets businesses squeeze ads and live demonstrations into their feeds, with links to purchase products without leaving the app. This model of “shoppable entertainment”, as TikTok calls it, has fuelled the success of Douyin, its sister app in China. Douyin now sells more clothes and accessories than <small>T</small> mall, the Chinese e-commerce platform operated by Alibaba, a local tech champion.</p><p class="article__body-text"> TikTok harbours similar ambitions in the West. Last October it was reported to be readying its own fulfilment network in America. Rumours are swirling that it will soon begin purchasing products from China and selling them to consumers itself; an experiment is already under way in Britain. TikTok&#39;s aspirations would be thwarted if the American government bans it outright on national-security grounds, which many politicians are calling for. In that event, Reels, a TikTok lookalike offered by Meta, a homespun tech giant, could perhaps take the place of the disruptor.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A final challenge to the West&#39;s e-commerce incumbents is brands&#39; growing appetite for selling directly to consumers. Euromonitor reckons that direct-to-consumer sales now account for 16% of e-commerce, a share that has quadrupled over the past eight years. More access to shoppers&#39; data helps brands to speed up innovation, notes Michelle Evans of Euromonitor. By cutting out the middleman, it also often improves margins. Shopify, a Canadian e-commerce platform, has built a booming business selling tools to make it easy for companies to build online shops. On August 2nd the firm reported an Amazon-trouncing 31% year-on-year growth for the second quarter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Well-known brands like Nike, a sportswear heavyweight, are among those to have embraced the trend. Direct-to-consumer sales have risen from 17% to 42% of its total revenue over the past decade, with more than half of those sales generated online. Upstart brands such as Allbirds and Casper, makers of shoes and mattresses, respectively, have also shunned traditional wholesale arrangements, harnessing the web to sell to customers directly. More recently, though, the newcomers have been opening physical outposts for consumers to touch and feel products. The digitally native brands, too, may be preparing for a world without much more e-commerce. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line">Bottom Line</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 17:50:34 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4dqf787ht9m34nmj638e4kqdf9r5r5qb</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/04/has-e-commerce-peaked </item><item><title><![CDATA[Meet America’s most profitable law firm]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Lady justice holding a shield stands behind a city skyline" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD000.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">image: Brett Ryder</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">B</span> <small>IG LAW</small> enjoys a long life.<!-- --> For an illustration, examine “The Partners: Inside America&#39;s Most Powerful Law Firms”, by James Stewart, published four decades ago. With a few exceptions, the book&#39;s starring firms remain in excellent health. Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and Kirkland &amp; Ellis are still some of Wall Street&#39;s busiest limousine-chasers. Less fortunate firms have fizzled out, rather than blown up. One shop, Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine, closed in 1998. Another, Shearman &amp; Sterling, has announced a merger with a British rival.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Stewart&#39;s book gave only a walk-on role to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz. The same omission would be unthinkable today. Set up in 1965 by graduates of New York University, Wachtell is America&#39;s pre-eminent boardroom adviser. Bosses tapped the firm to counsel on transactions worth $100bn in the first half of this year, and paid handsomely for the privilege. According to <i>American Lawyer</i> , an industry journal, last year Wachtell&#39;s partners earned $7.3m apiece, bested only slightly by Kirkland &amp; Ellis, a Chicago outfit which fills its boots advising on private-equity deals. Measured by profits per lawyer, Wachtell and its dealmakers, who include fewer junior staff (“associates”) for each of its senior ones (“partners”), look nearly twice as productive as the next best firm. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Supernormal profits are not the only unusual thing about Wachtell. While rivals opened up shop abroad, Wachtell&#39;s flirtation with establishing a London outpost remained just that. The five next most profitable firms have an average of 1,700 lawyers toiling in 16 offices; Wachtell employs fewer than 300 under one roof in Manhattan. There is no formal partnership agreement. Partners are paid in “lockstep” according to seniority rather than their individual contribution. Meritocracy is prized. A Harvard Business School case study recounts the firm&#39;s guiding principles. “The firm is not a business,” reads one.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This structure reflects Wachtell&#39;s speciality: advising American bosses on bet-the-company deals. The firm built its reputation during the 1980s and, since then, Wachtell&#39;s clients have found plenty to worry about. They have often called Martin Lipton, one of Wachtell&#39;s founding partners. Mr Lipton&#39;s most famous paper invention is the shareholder-rights plan, a way of defending against a hostile takeover by threatening to issue lots of new shares. The “poison pill”, as it has come to be known, was such a boardroom hit that by 1986 around a third of <i>Fortune</i> 500 firms had adopted one. When shareholder activists emerged as the new boardroom scourge in the 2000s, bosses found a vocal defender in Mr Lipton. Corporate raiders have largely lost their teeth and activism isn&#39;t the jaunt it was a decade ago, but his influence persists. Mr Lipton also helped pioneer the notion of “stakeholder capitalism”, which relies on statesmen <small>CEO</small> s identifying and attending to interests other than those of shareholders. The idea was adopted by the Business Roundtable, a coven of business leaders, in 2019.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some see these innovations as shields for imperial bosses rather than brakes on the excesses of financial capitalism. And the impact of the firm&#39;s academic standing on its bottom line is probably less than it used to be. All corporate advisers must worry about whom to advise, weighing the number of potential clients and the depth of their pockets. But in hitching itself so fully to American bosses in their most trying moments, Wachtell chose the right horse. This has proved enormously lucrative. Lawyers usually bill their services by the hour. Wachtell often charges for the value of the engagement, asking its clients to stump up a fee in the event of a successful outcome, a model similar to how investment bankers shake down their clients. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Not everyone is happy. X (the company formerly known as Twitter) sued Wachtell in July. Wachtell acted for Twitter after Elon Musk attempted to back out of his $44bn agreement to take the social-media platform private. Mr Musk caved in last October and Wachtell was paid $90m for its trouble, a fee X now argues was unconscionable. On the conservative assumption that the value of Twitter fell by 17% between April and October, in line with the techie <small>NASDAQ</small> index, Twitter&#39;s shareholders got a fantastic deal by retaining Wachtell: collectively their stock might have been worth around $7bn less had Mr Musk managed to wriggle out of the transaction. In such circumstances, tipping the scales even slightly can be enormously valuable to both king and courtier.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What can other corporate <i>consiglieri</i> learn from this success? Some elements of Wachtell&#39;s operating model work only at small firms offering similarly high-value services. When compensating staff in lockstep, the problem of free-riders becomes unbearable in a larger enterprise. It is not generally wise to turn back the clock and operate firms as unwritten gentlemen&#39;s agreements (Centerview, a boutique investment bank, recently fought in court over profits allegedly owed to one of its former partners).</p><p class="article__body-text"> The real lesson is that focusing relentlessly on your strengths and rejecting growth can pay off. And with fundamental changes to the lives and livelihoods of bankers, lawyers and consultants already on the horizon, there are others, too.</p><h2> Computer says maybe</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Tasks which should have been upended by office software—20-somethings tweaking boiler-plate valuation multiples till the wee hours—ought to become much easier and cheaper with recent advances in computing. Progress may be slow, but bosses should increasingly expect to farm out commoditised tasks. That may mean fewer billable hours courtesy of costly junior staff. Meanwhile, knife-edge calls in testy situations will remain valuable: the realities of language in contracts and egos in the boardroom mean that corporate clashes will never be in short supply. In response, expect surviving firms to adopt the associate-light model employed by Wachtell, replacing their army of minions and boosting their margins in the process. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Read more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business:</b><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/24/why-walmart-is-trouncing-amazon-in-the-grocery-wars">Why Walmart is trouncing Amazon in the grocery wars</a> (Jul 24th)</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/19/hollywoods-blockbuster-strike-may-become-a-flop">Hollywood&#39;s blockbuster strike may become a flop</a> (Jul 19th)</i><br> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/11/the-last-unfulfilled-dream-of-jamie-dimon-king-of-wall-street" data-tegid="bso0mkfi7litiv9uidvughm4tor8en96">The last, unfulfilled dream of Jamie Dimon, king of Wall Street</a> (Jul 11th)</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Also: If you want to write directly to Schumpeter, email him at <a href="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c5f4f4459415c4958495e6c494f43424341455f58024f4341"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5f2c3c372a322f3a2b3a2d1f3a3c30313032362c2b713c3032">[email protected]</span></a> .

High costs, falling demand, growing competition—the list goes on. “The roof is on fire,” he warned, echoing one of the most noted alarm calls in recent business history—from Stephen Elop, who in 2011 compared his company to a “burning platform” shortly after taking the helm at Nokia, then the world&#39;s largest maker of mobile phones.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the case of Nokia, the wake-up call did not help. A few years later the firm was dismantled and its mobile-phone business sold to Microsoft, which has since closed it down. Could mighty <small>VW</small> , its mightier parent group, which owns nine other brands, or even Germany&#39;s mightiest industry as a whole really suffer a similar fate? And if it did, what would that mean for Europe&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/06/08/german-bosses-are-depressed">biggest economy</a> ? </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> An imminent implosion of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-04-22">car industry</a> seems unlikely. In 2022 Volkswagen was the world&#39;s largest carmaker by revenue, giving it plenty of cash to support its biggest brand. On July 27th it reported that sales rose by a healthy 18% in the first half of 2023, year on year, to €156bn ($174bn). <small>BMW</small> and Mercedes-Benz, Germany&#39;s two other big automotive concerns, are in decent nick.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet disaster is no longer inconceivable. German industrialists are feeling real angst about the future. In July an index of business confidence from Ifo Institute, a think-tank, fell for the third consecutive month. German bosses echo Mr Schäfer&#39;s list of concerns and add other gripes, from bunged-up bureaucracy to the delicate geopolitics of trade with China.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Carmakers are more exposed to these challenges than most industries, as they are having to negotiate several transformations at once. They must electrify their fleet, for instance, and learn to develop software. As these trends play out, more of the value added is likely to come from elsewhere. Industry insiders admit that factories will have to shrink or even close down, as will many suppliers, especially those which make parts for internal combustion engines and gearboxes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Germany&#39;s car industry must also tackle its growing China problem. Having benefited from the Asian giant&#39;s rapid growth in recent decades—in the second half of 2022 Germany&#39;s three big car companies made around 40% of their revenue there—they are now suffering from a reversal of fortunes. Volkswagen has just cut its global delivery forecast owing chiefly to slowing Chinese sales. Geopolitics are liable to make things worse. And Chinese rivals have started expanding abroad, particularly in Europe. Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany: around 3m and 2.6m vehicles, respectively.</p><h2> Driven to extinction?</h2><p class="article__body-text"> All these problems are coming together in Wolfsburg, home to Volkswagen&#39;s headquarters—and thus the roof in Mr Schäfer&#39;s metaphor. According to press reports, orders for the group&#39;s <small>EV</small> s are between 30% and 70% below plans, depending on the marque. The firm still has to sort out its software problems: in May it again shook up the management team of Cariad, its digital unit. In China&#39;s fast-growing market for <small>EV</small> s, the <small>VW</small> brand is an also-ran, with a market share of 2%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The consequences of carmakers&#39; potential demise depend on how big you think the industry is. Carmaking directly employs fewer than 900,000 people in Germany, two-thirds of them at the car firms and the rest at their suppliers. That is just 2% or so of Germany&#39;s total workforce. Nearly three-quarters of passenger cars sold under a German brand are now made abroad. Last year a mere 3.5m vehicles left local factories—about as many as in the mid-1970s. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Worried industry insiders point to alternative measures. More than half of the <small>EU</small> ’s carmaking gross value added is produced in Germany, miles ahead of France, which is second with 9%. Cars account for 16% of German exports of goods. And although the economic importance of Germany&#39;s car industry peaked at 4.7% of the country&#39;s gross value added in 2017, the share was still at 3.8% in 2020, the last year for which data are available, calculates Nils Jannsen of the Kiel Institute, a think-tank. According to other estimates, this is about a percentage point more than other carmaking powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Moreover, zeroing in on narrow industry numbers misses the sector&#39;s true importance for Deutschland <small>AG</small> . “It&#39;s an operating system of sorts,” explains Oliver Falck, who runs the Ifo Centre for Industrial Organisation and New Technologies. “Important parts of the German economy and its institutions rely on it,” he says.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For starters, direct suppliers are not the only ones to depend on Volkswagen and its peers. More recent numbers are hard to come by, but according to a study in 2020 by Thomas Puls of <small>IW</small> , another think-tank, and others, global demand for German cars accounted for more than 16% of the value added of Germany&#39;s metal bashers and plastics makers. They also estimated that such global demand indirectly paid for another 1.6m jobs, bringing the total number of people supported by the car industry to 2.5m, more than 5% of the German workforce.</p><p class="article__body-text"> German investment and innovation are tied to the country&#39;s carmakers. The car industry accounted for 35% of gross fixed capital formation in manufacturing in 2020, according to <small>IW</small> . In 2021 the sector was the source of more than 42% of manufacturing research and development and paid for 64% of all <small>R</small> &amp; <small>D</small> conducted by other firms and research institutions, based on numbers from the Stifterverband, an association mostly of research foundations. According to <small>IW</small> , carmakers accounted for nearly half of corporate patent filings in 2017, up from a third in 2005.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The car industry is also central to Germany&#39;s much-vaunted social model. One important element is regional equality. Car factories were often built in otherwise economically weak areas, of which Wolfsburg is the prime example. The sector shores up many of these regions. According to one recent study, 48 of Germany&#39;s 400 cities and counties are heavily dependent on jobs in the car industry. Wolfsburg leads the pack: 47% of the city&#39;s workers toil in the sector. Should carmaking fade, Germany would face “many local crises”, says Wolfgang Schroeder, one of the authors of the study and a fellow at the <small>WZB</small> , a research outfit.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Without a strong car industry, Germany&#39;s generally placid industrial relations would become much rougher. Union leaders such as Roman Zitzelsberger, who heads <small>IG</small> Metall in Baden-Württemberg, the state that is home to Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Bosch, a giant car-parts supplier, freely admit that it is the organisation&#39;s “backbone”. <small>IG</small> Metall&#39;s some 2m members make it the world&#39;s single biggest trade union. About a third of them work in the car industry. Union membership at some companies in the sector reaches 90%. This strength, in turn, helps <small>IG</small> Metall negotiate good wage deals which then radiate out to other firms and industries where it is less entrenched. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The car industry also undergirds Germany&#39;s model of co-determination, where workers are guaranteed representation on corporate boards. Volkswagen is again the prime example. The sector&#39;s powerful works councils provide <small>IG</small> Metall with access to important resources, from money to information. Employee representatives make up half the firm&#39;s 20-member supervisory board, giving them access to regular updates about the company&#39;s condition and the ability to veto strategic decisions. (Another two members are political appointees from the state of Lower Saxony, which owns 12% of the group.)</p><p class="article__body-text"> If this arrangement were to fall apart, it would alter the balance of Germany&#39;s labour market, reckons Sebastian Dullien, an economist at the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, a trade-union think-tank. “To exaggerate only a bit, it will make a big difference whether Volkswagen manages its transformation or whether it is replaced by Tesla,” he says, referring to the American <small>EV</small> pioneer, which has just announced that it intends to expand its plant near Berlin to what will be Europe&#39;s biggest car factory. Over time, says Mr Dullien, manufacturing jobs in Germany would no longer be exceptionally well paid relative to service ones and manufacturing jobs in other European countries.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Harder to measure, but no less profound, would be the psychological effects of a diminished German car industry. The reputation of German industry and its engineering prowess, already knocked by Volkswagen&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2015/09/26/a-mucky-business">Dieselgate</a> ” emissions-cheating scandal of 2015, would take another hit. In a paper published last year, Rüdiger Bachmann of the University of Notre Dame and others calculated that because the company was found fiddling with emissions readings, sales of other German brands in America fell by 166,000 cars, costing them $7.7bn in forgone revenues, or nearly a quarter of their total in 2014.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If Germany&#39;s car industry were to evaporate, in other words, this would “leave a huge economic crater in the midst of Europe”, says Mr Schroeder of <small>WZB</small> . Germany&#39;s politicians are, of course, desperate not to let that happen. After Dieselgate, their support for the sector is less wholehearted. But subsidies such as tax breaks for company cars, which make it worthwhile for employees to forgo a part of their salary in exchange for a high-end vehicle, are not going away. More than two in three new cars in Germany are bought by companies; many end up being driven mostly on personal trips.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In Lower Saxony the car industry may well be too big to let fail. Volkswagen operates factories in five places besides Wolfsburg. Altogether, the firm employs about 130,000 people there. The state&#39;s politicians need only look next-door at Thuringia to see what might happen if its economy floundered—which it inevitably would were Volkswagen to crumble. The far-right Alternative for Germany party now leads Thuringian polls with 34%.</p><h2> Riding into the sunset</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Such considerations are drowning out voices pointing out that extending life support for carmakers could be counterproductive in the long term. Mr Bachmann thinks German politicians need to put a bit more faith in market forces to fill the economic space that might open up as German carmaking wanes. Germany&#39;s oversized car industry, once a strength, increasingly holds the country back, argues Christoph Bornschein of <small>TLGG</small> , a consultancy. “Cars are the biggest manifestation of Germany&#39;s total focus on mechanical engineering,” he says. As Volkswagen&#39;s ongoing problems with its software unit show, an economic system that is optimised to churn out expensive mechanical wonders that run like clockwork will struggle to reinvent itself in an increasingly digitised world.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Once the car industry is no longer that dominant, there would be more space for alternatives. Fewer subsidies would flow into the sector, and more capital into startups. Fewer young Germans would study mechanical engineering and more opt for computer science instead. And researchers would put more effort into, say, developing mobility services instead of filing one more car-related patent.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The freewheeling approach has worked for Eindhoven. The Dutch city, once as dominated by Philips, a one-time electronics giant, as Wolfsburg is by Volkswagen, now hosts thousands of small companies. Most of these supply <small>ASML</small> , a manufacturer of advanced chipmaking equipment that has emerged as one of Europe&#39;s most valuable companies. Espoo, still home to the rump Nokia, which today makes telecoms networking gear, also now boasts a thriving startup ecosystem.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Admittedly, carmaking is much more deeply rooted than the ephemeral production of electronics such as mobile phones. As such, especially if the decline is gradual, the sector will adapt. Big suppliers such as Bosch or Continental will work more for foreign carmakers such as Tesla (in the Californian firm&#39;s early days, Bosch is said to have provided 80% of its value added). Smaller suppliers will specialise and provide services, as many Mittelstand firms have done before. And Germany is likely to stop producing cheaper cars and focusing even more on making smaller numbers of higher-margin luxury ones. Volkswagen may even turn itself into a contract manufacturer, assembling <small>EV</small> s for other brands, much as Foxconn puts together iPhones for Apple.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some in and around the industry are already imagining a future without Volkswagen, at least as it exists today. The business “needs to stop building its strategies only around the car”, says Andreas Boes of <small>ISF</small> Munich, another research outfit. Mr Boes leads a group of youngish car-industry executives and experts which recently published a “Mobilistic Manifesto”. Instead of making cars ever more comfortable, so people spend more time in them and can be sold additional services, firms should aim to organise society&#39;s ability to go from <small>A</small> to <small>B</small> as a whole, he suggests. Volkswagen and its fellow German carmakers have always helped people move around. There is no reason why they shouldn&#39;t keep doing it in clever new ways. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line">Bottom Line</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 31 Jul 2023 20:12:03 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/nmuvrjfmfkqnp4h6sdibpl5u65q0rbq1</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/31/what-if-germany-stopped-making-cars</item><item><title><![CDATA[Is there more to Alphabet than Google search?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Google searching a wardrobe filled with magnifying glasses on hangers." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_WBD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style><span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">图片：文森特·基尔布赖德</span></figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">L</span> <small>AST NOVEMBER</small> something strange happened in Mountain View. A thick fog enveloped the headquarters of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Not the meteorological sort—this stretch of Silicon Valley is reliably sunny. It was a fog of confusion. Its cause was <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/15/how-chatgpt-could-help-teachers-and-lower-the-cost-of-college">Chat <small>GPT</small></a> , an artificially intelligent conversationalist created by <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/science-and-technology/2023/04/22/large-creative-ai-models-will-transform-how-we-live-and-work">Open <small>AI</small></a> , a startup backed by Microsoft. The effect was, by all accounts, panic. Chat <small>GPT</small> was giving uncannily humanlike answers to questions put to it by users. And answering questions is the bread and butter of Google&#39;s lucrative search business. Were Open <small>AI</small> and Microsoft, which in February launched an enhanced version of its Bing search engine, about to eat Google&#39;s lunch?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Eight months on the mist has mostly cleared. On July 25th the company reported another set of solid quarterly results. Revenues rose by 7% year on year, to $75bn. It continues to create piles of cash: in the 12 months to June it raked in $75bn of operating profit. Bing has taken no discernible bite out of Google&#39;s share of global monthly search queries, which remains above 90%. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/776/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/255/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/383/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/511/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/766/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/817/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1021/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1276/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1634/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC928.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Most important, Google has put to rest any notion that it has fallen behind technologically. In May Sundar Pichai, chief executive of both Google and its corporate parent, unveiled more than a dozen <small>AI</small> -powered products at <small>I</small> / <small>O</small> , an annual event for software developers. These included <small>AI</small> tools for Gmail, Google Maps and Google Cloud. Investors found it reassuring—not least after a rushed launch in February of Bard, Google&#39;s chatbot, during which the <small>AI</small> helper made a factual error. Alphabet&#39;s share price leapt by a tenth after Mr Pichai&#39;s presentation (see chart 1).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Since then the firm has launched <small>AI</small> products and features left and right. On July 12th it brought out Notebook <small>LM</small> , an <small>AI</small> -assisted note-taking tool trained on a user&#39;s documents. On the same day <i>Nature</i> , a scientific journal, published a paper by Google researchers describing an <small>AI</small> model that matched human doctors&#39; responses to questions about the right treatment for patients. A day later it expanded a now less error-prone Bard, proficient in more than 40 human languages and over 20 computer ones, to the <small>EU</small> . Work on an <small>AI</small> model to eclipse Chat <small>GPT</small> , codenamed Gemini, is proceeding apace. Having nearly fallen below $1trn in November, Alphabet&#39;s market value is back up to $1.7trn. Crisis over?</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the short run, probably. Like all heart-in-mouth moments, though, the chatbot panic invites broader questions: about the current state of one of the world&#39;s biggest firms, its future and—as Google turns 25 in September—about the demands of different stages of corporate life.</p></div><h2> The view from the top</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Alphabet is, without a doubt, one of the greatest business successes of all time. Six of its products—Google search, the Android mobile operating system, the Chrome browser, Google Play Store for apps, Workspace productivity tools and YouTube—boast more than 2bn monthly users each. Add those with hundreds of millions of users, such as Google Maps or Google Translate, and, by one reckoning, humans collectively spend 22bn hours a day on Alphabet&#39;s platforms.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The ability to command so much attention is worth a lot of money to the people who want a slice of it, namely advertisers. Since going public in 2004 Google&#39;s revenue, 80% of which comes from online ads, has grown at an average annual rate of 28%. In that period it has generated a total of $460bn in cash after operating expenses, virtually all of it from advertising. Its share price has risen 50-fold, making it the world&#39;s fourth-most-valuable company. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Given these eye-popping numbers, it may seem churlish to ask why Alphabet isn&#39;t doing better. In fact, the question is warranted, and is being asked by Mr Pichai, his underlings and investors alike. The company finds itself at a delicate juncture—not only, or even primarily, because of <small>AI</small> . The core digital-ads business is maturing, with sales growth no longer consistently in double digits and increasingly tied to economic cycles. At the same time, finding new sources of material growth is difficult for a company that brings in $300bn in annual revenues. This quest is further complicated by investors calling for greater cost efficiency and capital discipline, which in turn requires a shake-up of its free-wheeling corporate culture.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Consider the cash cow. Throughout the 2010s digital advertising seemed invulnerable to the business cycle. In good times advertisers spent like there was no tomorrow. In worse ones they diverted some of their non-digital marketing budgets online, where Google and other giants like Facebook (now Meta) offered to target adverts more precisely than a <small>TV</small> commercial or a page in a glossy magazine could.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC929.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Now, as the online share of total ad spending touches two-thirds, businesses have smaller non-digital ad budgets to eat into. Insider Intelligence, a data firm, expects global sales of digital ads to increase by 10% or less annually in the next few years, down from a rate of 20% or so in the past decade (see chart 2). A slowdown last year offered a glimpse of the future, spooking investors.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Nor can Google easily capture a bigger slice of the slower-growing pie. Trustbusters already believe its share is too high and have sued Google in America for abusing its search monopoly. Google&#39;s arrangement with Apple, whereby it pays a reported $15bn a year to be the default search engine on the 2bn or so iDevices, has also come under scrutiny.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Although search remains immensely lucrative, with operating margins of nearly 50%, according to Bernstein, a broker, how people look for things on the internet is changing. Most product searches these days start not on Google but on Amazon, the e-commerce giant. According to Google&#39;s own executives, 40% of teenagers and young adults seek recommendations for things like restaurants or hotels on TikTok, a short-video app, or Instagram, a similar app from Meta.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Google may entice some of these “search-nevers”, as Mark Shmulik of Bernstein calls them, to its platform, as YouTube is doing already with a TikTok lookalike called Shorts. Yet videos are unlikely to monetise as nicely as the search box.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Then there are the chatbots and other “generative” <small>AI</small> s that, having been trained on a web&#39;s worth of texts, images and sounds, can serve up simulacra of human-generated content. Mr Pichai&#39;s insistence that Alphabet is an “ <small>AI</small> -native” company rings true. Most observers believe that deep pockets and ample talent will allow Google to solve the technology&#39;s teething problems, such as the bots&#39; tendency to “hallucinate” (make stuff up) or the high cost of serving up responses (which egg-headed Googlers are busy tackling). </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> That still leaves open the question of how much money bot-assisted products, for all their expected ingenuity, will actually make. Set aside search, and Google&#39;s knack for creating extraordinary products is matched by its inability to monetise them. There is no reason to think that its <small>AI</small> s<!-- --> will be any different.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As for search, generative <small>AI</small> does not necessarily herald a financial bonanza. Today Google gets paid when users click on the links to merchants&#39; websites that appear next to the responses to search queries. Once the technological niggles with generative <small>ai</small> are solved—in two or three years, experts reckon—Google will have a choice to make, reminiscent of the “innovator&#39;s dilemma”, a theory put forward by Clayton Christiansen that argues that incumbents are reluctant to innovate if it jeopardises their existing markets. If a chat with an <small>AI</small> is to feel natural, it cannot be peppered with ads and links. Google could show fewer ads and charge clients more for each. But advertisers may balk—or, worse, defect.</p><h2> New bets</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Google&#39;s founders and, thanks to Alphabet&#39;s dual-class ownership structure, its overlords, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have long been aware that its primary revenue engine was going to slow at some point. They have sought to supplement it and, one day, perhaps replace it altogether. That was the main reason for the creation in 2015 of Alphabet. The holding company would house Google alongside various other ventures, including out-there “moonshots”, from self-driving cars to life-extending medicine.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC070.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Most of the moonshots look as commercially questionable as the Apollo programme. Other Bets, the bit of Alphabet where most of them sit, haemorrhages money. Between 2018 and 2022 it notched up a cumulative operating loss of $24bn, more than six times bigger than its total revenues in that period (see chart 3). Other Bets consumes at least some of its parent&#39;s capital spending, which ate up $31bn last year, and a material slug of its $40bn annual research-and-development budget.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A deeper problem is that it is hard for any new venture to move the needle. Only a handful of industries—think finance, government, health care—are large and undisrupted enough to make a material mark on Alphabet&#39;s top line. Conquering these markets requires huge investments for an uncertain return, and none offers the sort of capital-light quasi-monopoly that Google has enjoyed with search advertising.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Alphabet has two health subsidiaries (Calico for life extension and Verily for less ambitious medical goals) and has invested around $15bn in the past six years in health-related startups. So far it has little to show for it. And although in December Google became one of four cloud providers to be awarded a $9bn multi-year contract with America&#39;s Department of Defence, past attempts to enter procurement have run into opposition from the company&#39;s mostly progressive-leaning workers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In finance, Google offers a digital wallet, has invested in Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lender, and owned price-comparison sites for insurance and mortgages, which it shut down in 2016. These efforts are unambitious compared with those of Apple, which offers a credit card and has launched a buy-now-pay-later scheme. A bank boss with knowledge of Google&#39;s efforts says they are ultimately in the service of its ads business, the better to track users&#39; purchases, rather than a real attempt to become a financial player.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Alphabet&#39;s biggest wager is in a way less ambitious. It wants to become a force in cloud-based, <small>AI</small> -boosted business software. Perhaps three-quarters of Alphabet&#39;s capital spending goes on building and equipping new data centres. To catch up with Amazon Web Services ( <small>AWS</small> ) and Microsoft Azure, the two industry leaders, Google Cloud has in the past few years offered customers cut-price deals. Sales have been growing at an annual rate of 40%. The unit made its first profits in the past two quarters (albeit partly thanks to accounting changes). In a few years Google could become the world&#39;s second- or third-biggest provider of business software, says Thomas Kurian, who runs Google Cloud. “Enterprises want to solve many of the same problems that consumers want to solve,” he explains, so things that Google has been working on for years in its consumer business, from voice recognition to <small>AI</small> -assisted search, offer it a leg up.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Possibly. And the enterprise business is certainly large. Firms are projected to spend more than $3trn this year on information technology. But it is a cyclical business, and intensely competitive. Microsoft does not break out its Azure results but operating margins at <small>AWS</small> , which are disclosed, have been steadily falling, from 30% or more a few years ago to 24% today.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Moreover, Amazon and, especially, Microsoft are formidable rivals. They have longstanding relationships with corporate clients. Microsoft is already beginning to monetise generative AI in its office software. Google, by contrast, does not have a business-to-business bone in its body. Ten years ago Google Sheets may have been the best in the world, says a former executive. But it “failed to wine and dine” enough chief information officers to promote the spreadsheet software.</p><h2> Froogle living</h2><p class="article__body-text"> With revenue growth tougher to come by, some investors think Alphabet should focus on boosting returns by improving its overall margins. Many grumble that Alphabet shares trade at a lower price relative to earnings than Apple or Microsoft, and not much higher than the <small>S</small> &amp; <small>P</small> 500 index of big American firms as a whole—a letdown for a tech pioneer (see chart 4).</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC080.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In November <small>TCI</small> , a hedge fund with a stake in the company worth $6bn at the time, wrote a letter to Mr Pichai demanding more discipline. It also noted that Alphabet had too many employees—nearly 190,000, more than twice as many as in 2017 (see chart 5)—who were paid too much. The typical Googler takes home nearly $300,000 a year, two-thirds more than a counterpart at Microsoft and more than twice as much as employees of America&#39;s 20 biggest tech firms. Its scattershot approach to capital allocation, <small>TCI</small> seemed to imply, was tolerable only so long as it was concealed by strong returns from the core business.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Since then two other big hedge funds with an activist streak, Pershing Square and Third Point, have disclosed large investments in Alphabet. As the company has grown, it has added layers of management. “You are negotiating with <small>VP</small> s and <small>SVP</small> s all day,” recalls one prominent ex-Googler. Many teams turn into mini-fiefdoms; some managers tell employees not to take their goals too seriously. Entry-level engineers report that it is easy to “rest and vest”—coast while waiting to cash in your stock options. And you get fed chocolate-covered strawberries. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230805_WBC071.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Some of this looseness is by design. Messrs Brin and Page wanted to nurture a startup culture that allowed brilliant ideas to bubble up. And they do: one of those presented at the developers&#39; conference came directly from a five-person team. But clever products often get tied up in compliance reviews. Insiders joke that the best way not to have your product launch is to present it at <small>I</small> / <small>O</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> The upshot is that many enterprising types leave, skewing the workforce ever more towards engineers working for internal customers, their managers, rather than seeking commercial success. Notably, all eight of the researchers behind Google&#39;s seminal paper on “transformers”, the computer science that gives chatbots their wits (and the <small>T</small> in <small>GPT</small> ), have since left the company. Startups need “a tinge of desperation” to succeed, says Aswath Damodaran of <small>NYU</small> Stern School of Business. By contrast, Alphabet is a “startup business with a sugar daddy”, in the form of the deep-pocketed search operation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One way to tackle these problems would be to reinvent Alphabet from top to bottom. Hiving off the disparate businesses—search, YouTube, Google Cloud<!-- --> and so on—would, for instance, permit each to focus resources on what it does best. Another approach would be to settle on a new direction, rather as Apple transformed itself from a purveyor of pricey desktops to a mobile-phone behemoth and Microsoft went from peddling software on <small>CD</small> - <small>ROM</small> s to cloud-computing might.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet a move as radical as breakup would require the blessing of Messrs Brin and Page, which is unlikely to be forthcoming. And reinvention comes with big risks. Investors and analysts remain deeply sceptical of Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s bet on the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft spent years in the wilderness before finding a second life.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> And radicalism is not Mr Pichai&#39;s style. He is clever, in an understated way, and, as befits a former McKinsey consultant, shrewd. He has played a significant role in building the core business, which he ran even before taking over as Alphabet&#39;s <small>CEO</small> in 2019. But he is no visionary.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Pichai and his lieutenants are therefore opting for incrementalism instead. He has talked about “trying to do more with constraints”. This seems to involve gradually introducing <small>AI</small> features to existing products and taking a more serious look at Alphabet&#39;s expenses. The management astutely used the cloud cover of the chatbot crisis to force through some needed changes. It has pulled the plug on some Other Bets. Earlier this year Alphabet laid off 12,000 workers and merged its <small>AI</small> labs, DeepMind and Google Brain, which should enable more efficient use of its <small>AI</small> computing power and, if their distinct cultures don&#39;t get in the way, its human brainpower, too. On July 25th it promoted Ruth Porat, its veteran finance chief, to president, as well as a new role of chief investment officer, to steer the group&#39;s capital allocation.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As the firm nears its quarter-century, then, it is, like a middle-aged person told to watch what they eat more carefully, determined to get rid of the flab, eschew risky behaviour and stay disciplined. If those efforts succeed, thinks one shareholder, Alphabet can keep increasing its bottom line even if overall sales slow, ensuring it stays enviably profitable.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The incrementalist approach will, however, be put to the test, particularly as <small>ai</small> , generative and otherwise, progresses. Engineering chops, which Alphabet clearly still possesses in spades, will not be enough to harness the technology&#39;s potential. That is going to require commercial ingenuity, too. Google displayed this early on, when it developed the search-ad business model. Since then Alphabet has, in business terms at least, mostly been able to coast on that innovation&#39;s spectacular success, allowing some of its commercial sinews to atrophy. If it doesn&#39;t flex them as the age of <small>AI</small> dawns, there are plenty of hungry rivals eager to muscle in. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line">Bottom Line</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 30 Jul 2023 18:08:19 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/dbbm5n07nkmtr8pqdner102tfb9i1smp</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/30/is-there-more-to-alphabet-than-google-search </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why your new EV is making funny noises]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Abarth 500e in sound room with recording equipment." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_WBP501.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">image: Stellantis</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">M</span> <small>OTORING&#39;S SOUNDTRACK</small> used to be generated by the petrol engine and car radio.

Artificial-noise generation offers a flavour of the past in the cars of the future. Many <small>ev</small> s can blast passengers with fake engine noises just as the engine sound of cars has long been tweaked and tuned in sportier models to sound more raucous in the cabin than on the road. Some new models can now inflict that cacophony on the outside world.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The Abarth 500e, Fiat&#39;s souped-up electric version of its popular small car, was launched last year with a speaker in its bumper to mimic the petrol version. Hyundai&#39;s hot-hatch <small>ev</small> , the Ioniq 5 <small>N</small> , likely to go on sale this year, goes one better. As well as broadcasting car noises it can also screech like a fighter jet and, for added driver feedback, will jolt slightly between fake gear changes. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The future is as important as the past when it comes to filling the empty stave of electric motoring. <small>ev</small> s usually come with an array of large screens filled with whizzy graphics that demand tuneful accompaniment and an array of new functions that gives an opportunity for a fresh chorus of bleeps, trills and bongs. Meanwhile, regulators in America and Europe insist that <small>ev</small> s emit noises to let pedestrians know they are approaching (the 500e&#39;s warning is a strumming guitar).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some companies, like Mercedes-Benz, leave these acoustic signals to in-house technicians. Others, like Renault, reckon that their sounds will “underline its singular identity”, and enlist noted musicians. Videos recently posted on the French firm&#39;s website highlight its collaboration with Jean-Michel Jarre, a pioneer of electronic music. It follows a trail blazed by <small>bmw</small> , which in 2019 engaged Hans Zimmer, better known for his Oscar-winning film scores, as its resident composer. Fortunately for motorists pining for the peace and quiet of the <small>EV</small> age, all these options come with an “off” switch. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line">Bottom Line</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 15:12:47 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/7vi3ebln6gr7inr9g1q3o7d2rhnoo048</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/27/why-your-new-ev-is-making-funny-noises</item></channel></rss>
