Risks from preventing legitimate value change]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 26, 2023 2:38 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> VCP 带来的第二个风险涉及阻碍合法价值变化。接下来，我将考虑合法价值变革可能受到阻碍的机制，以及这是否以及何时可能构成道德伤害的积极根源。</p><h2>阻止合法的价值改变是真正的风险吗？</h2><p>乍一看，人们可能会怀疑阻碍合法价值变革是否会带来真正的风险。承认某些价值改变的情况是没有问题和合法的，并不一定意味着阻止或阻碍这种改变在道德上是或总是应该受到谴责的。换句话说，人们可能怀疑积极阻止某些类型的价值变化是否构成道德伤害。接下来，我将尝试证明确实如此，至少在某些情况下如此。</p><p>首先，考虑一个系统地或任意地阻止人们从事有可能引起合法价值变化的理想追求的社会。在大多数情况下，这样的社会会被认为体现了一种有问题的“社会威权主义”形式，因为它严重损害了个人自由。在这里，自由可以（至少）有两种方式来理解。其一，我们可以提及“共和自由”（参见Pettit，2001），即免于任意行使权力的自由。在这种情况下，治理结构必须受到限制（例如通过法治）权力的任意使用。或者或此外，我们可能还关心保护第二种类型的自由，即自决自由。例如，查尔斯·泰勒（Charles Taylor，1985）在包括卢梭和穆勒等思想家在内的政治思想的悠久传统的基础上，提出了一种自由概念，这种概念体现了“一个人有效决定自己的程度和一个人生活的形态”（第 213 页）。因此，只要追求合法价值变化的能力是自决权的体现，那么系统地破坏这种自由（通过阻碍合法价值）变化的过程在道德上是有问题的。</p><p>通过观察价值自决的自由在康德的绝对命令（Kant，1785/2001）、罗尔斯的无知之幕（Rawls，2001）或米尔的元归纳论证下是反思稳定的，可以进一步支持这一论点。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefq371my13fs"><sup><a href="#fnq371my13fs">[1]</a></sup></span>为了自由（MIll，1859/2002）。至于第一个概念，绝对必要的是我们应该“以你希​​望他们对所有人采取行动的方式对待他人”。因此，如果我想保护我经历合法价值改变的能力（例如，以理想追求的形式），我也应该想保护<i>你</i>做同样的事情的能力。罗尔的无知之幕抓住了这样一种观念，即公正的社会是在我们不知道我们在该社会中采取什么具体立场或属性的前提下设计的。与之前类似，该论点认为，如果我要设计一个社会的结构而不知道我将在该社会中占据什么位置，我将希望创建一个社会，让每个人都有价值自决的自由，包括他们经历合法价值变化的能力受到保护。最后，密尔对自由的元归纳论证指出，基于我们之前多次错误地判断什么是道德上对/错或什么对我们有价值的观察，我们应该在一定程度上追求我们目前对道德的最佳理解。除了价值观和道德之外，我们还应该保留一个“自由领域”，以保护我们未来改变想法的能力。虽然穆勒本人特别提出了言论自由的论点，但后来的评论家主张一种解释，将同一论点扩展到更普遍的个人生活计划的自主性和可修改性的合理性（参见，例如，Fuchs，2001；Bilgrami，2015） 。因此，阻碍或阻碍合法价值变革的行为者、机构或流程缺乏反思性认可，并构成值得道德关注的真正风险。</p><h2>破坏合法价值变化的机制（“价值崩溃”）</h2><p>我现在将继续讨论人们追求自主价值变革的能力可能受到阻碍的机制。我将提供的叙述重要地受到 Nguyen 对“价值崩溃”（2020）的叙述的启发，然后我概括了其中的背景。简而言之，阮将价值崩溃描述为一种现象，即价值的过度表达（例如使用指标或其他量化和/或简化价值的方法）恶化了我们对价值观和世界的认知态度。正是这种认知态度的恶化最终导致了我们价值自决能力的削弱。价值崩溃到底是如何发生的？</p><p>首先，阮指出我们的价值观塑造了我们的注意力。例如，如果我重视自己的健康，我会区别地关注我认为对我健康的事物（例如运动、食物、补充剂）。如果我重视好奇心，我就更有可能寻找并注意到别人的这种特质。接下来，一旦我们对我们的价值观采取明确的操作化——例如，通过使用指标——这就会导致更明确的注意力边界。阐明了我们<i>关心</i>的内容后，也澄清了我们<i>不</i>关心的内容。例如，在教育中引入 GPA 分数将学生和教育工作者的注意力集中到这些分数很好地体现的教育方面。不幸的是，明确的值通常无法捕获我们关心的所有内容。因此，虽然使用它们有很多充分的理由（稍后会详细介绍），但它们的引入是以将注意力从上述指标无法很好地捕捉到的事情上转移开为代价的，即使有时这些可能是我们实际上所做的事情反思地关心。例如，就 GPA 分数而言，这些可能是智慧、求知欲或公民责任感等。</p><p>鉴于我们解释自己价值观的能力不完善，我们依赖于健康的“错误代谢”（该术语取自 Wimsatt (2007)）。错误代谢是这样一种想法：如果我们不能在第一次尝试中完美地捕捉到某些东西（这是像人类这样有界限且容易出错的生物在试图驾驭复杂世界时的常态），我们就依赖于注意和整合的方法错误或偏差，从而迭代改进我们最初的尝试。然而，这就是问题的核心，因为我们的注意力调节我们注意到、感知并因此可以了解的内容，施加更窄和更清晰的注意力界限削弱了我们进行所述错误代谢的能力。如果我确信唯一值得一读的文学形式是希腊神话，而我从不涉足这一类型，那么我可能永远无法享受魔幻现实主义、法国存在主义或 18 世纪《狂飙突进》的乐趣。或者，回到 GPA 分数的例子，因为智慧和求知欲并没有被它们很好地捕捉到，人们担心这些分数的引入可能会排挤或破坏我们识别和促进那些更微妙的价值观的共同能力。</p><p>总之，明确的价值观通过强化我们的注意力界限，往往会削弱我们注意、整合并最终实现那些有价值但尚未被明确的价值陈述所捕获的事物的能力。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref6l9p9lqvwp"><sup><a href="#fn6l9p9lqvwp">[2]</a></sup></span>结果，阐明的价值观往往会变得“粘性”，从而主导个人的实践推理，而那些没有被阐明很好地捕捉到的价值观往往会被忽视，甚至可能会丢失。因此，价值崩溃的动态削弱了一个人自我决定价值改变的能力。</p><p>值得注意的是，价值观的解释通常涉及简化它们，即剥离（可能重要的）细节、细微差别和上下文。 Theodore Porter (1996) 在他关于量化历史的著作中指出，量化知识侧重于一些不变的内核，这些内核被剥夺了各种上下文相关的细微差别。重要的是，量化不仅是一件坏事，而且是一件坏事。相反，量化允许信息在上下文之间传播并轻松聚合。例如，如果不以成绩的形式量化学生的表现，就很难比较和汇总学生在数学、文学、体育和历史等不同背景下的表现。然而，量化也存在成本。可移植性和可聚合性的改进是以失去细微差别、微妙性和上下文敏感性为代价的。因此，我并不是试图主张我们应该始终避免量化或解释我们关心的事情。相反，我认为重要的是要注意解释往往会导致我们对价值观的理解变得贫乏，以及随着时间的推移我们改变、发展或完善我们的价值观的能力。只有当我们意识到各种权衡时，我们才能就何时以及在多大程度上依赖价值解释机制做出明智的选择。</p><p>其他各种价值崩溃的案例已经很容易观察到。我们已经提到了学术背景，其中 GPA 或引用数量等指标可能会威胁到更丰富的智慧、求知欲或真理追求的概念。其他例子包括健康指标（例如步数、体重指数或燃烧的卡路里），这些指标可能无法捕捉更模糊、更个性化的健康、幸福或表现概念；或者，在社交媒体的背景下，喜欢的数量或观看时间，这可能会超越更厚重和更亲社会的概念，例如学习、联系或审美价值。等等。</p><h2> ...对于（高级）人工智能系统</h2><p>然而，我们在本文中最感兴趣的问题是，当外推到先进人工智能系统的背景下时，这种担忧会是什么样子？</p><p>一般来说，先进的人工智能系统会强化这种效果。他们主要通过两种方式做到这一点。首先，对于已经依赖于价值解释的流程，先进的人工智能系统将能够针对一组给定的明确价值进行更强有力的优化，从而进一步削弱所述流程的错误代谢。为了举例说明这种趋势，让我们考虑一下人工智能系统在处理工作申请的背景下的使用。这种应用程序处理人工智能将（除非赋予某种机制来抵消这种趋势）根据公司已经能够识别和捕获的任何价值（例如，以评估标准的形式）优化其绩效。如果应用程序档案中有一些公司感兴趣的特征，但不属于当前的评估方案，那么人工智能评估员将对这些特征不敏感。重要的是，人工智能评估员在这方面比人类评估员更有效——无论是识别符合评估标准的申请人，还是忽略不符合这些标准的申请人。此外，人类评估者可能会获得关于他们在申请过程中关心的内容的新见解（例如，关于如何识别合适候选人的新见解，或者关于公司最理想的招聘职位规格的新见解）。相比之下，依靠人工智能系统来完成这项工作（同样，默认情况下）往往会削弱这些可能性，从而减少偶然（相对于定义的评估方案）结果和见解的可能性。虽然人工智能系统最初可能只用于预处理工作申请，但它们将越来越多地确定越来越多的决策过程，因此，检测到当前规范中的错误的可能性将会降低。代表人类评估者或整个公司的开放式价值发展和完善过程已经成为一个封闭且趋同的过程，具体化了我们一开始的任何价值概念。与其否认针对一组给定（即使不完美）的假设进行优化从来没有务实的合理性，不如担心的是，如果不加以控制，随着时间的推移，这将导致我们改进现有能力的能力下降。假设或评价标准。</p><p>先进人工智能系统将增强我们今天已经看到的影响的第二种方式是，人工智能的进步将允许类似的过程在生活的更多领域得到更广泛的部署。例如，考虑一下乔治，他使用他的“人工智能助手”（或类似的人工智能应用程序）来考虑要培养什么新爱好或要加入什么新社区。如果所述系统针对乔治可能已经拥有的某些固定价值观来优化其建议，或者如果它进行优化以使他更容易预测，那么这会减少偶然性并干扰乔治识别和评价真正新颖的存在方式的能力。高度通用化的人工智能系统可能会在生活的几乎所有领域产生类似的影响。</p><p>如果上述关于价值崩溃的解释是正确的，那么扩大超解释实践的范围就会威胁到我们个人和社会所拥有的丰富而微妙的价值观。在所有这些情况下，它们的使用越广泛，其效果就越显着。这些系统变得越好，它们在优化所阐述的内容方面就越好，并且此类系统的使用/采用越广泛，所描述的效果就越普遍。价值崩溃威胁到真正开放式价值探索的可能性，而这种探索是理想追求和合法价值变革的核心。因此，作为一个社会，只要我们关心保护个人和集体合法价值改变的可能性，我们就需要仔细考虑先进人工智能的开发和部署将如何影响、干扰和潜在地严重破坏这一点。可能性。</p><p>在我们结束之前，有必要做最后的评论。虽然在整篇文章中我都强调了人工智能和价值可塑性背景下出现的<i>风险</i>，但我想在结论中承认，合法的、<i>技术辅助的</i>价值变化也存在着重要的可能性。换句话说，值得一问的是，我们是否可以设计出能够增强而不是削弱我们发展和完善价值观的能力的机器。考虑到类似的想法，Swierstra（2013）写道：“特定技术可以通过使某些选项变得更加紧迫或有吸引力，而另一些选项则不那么紧迫或有吸引力来调节道德选择和决策。”但这并不意味着道德的丧失，或者道德的堕落。它可以很容易地带来更多或更好的道德，例如通过扩大利益相关者的道德共同体。这样，技术与道德之间的关系就表现为两个既没有也不渴望绝对自主的伙伴之间的婚姻。能否谈谈这段婚姻的质量？虽然我对 Swierstra 在上述摘录中使用“简单”一词提出质疑，但我同意人工智能系统<i>增强</i>个人自决和道德推理的可能性是一个值得进一步探索的有趣想法。就本文应为更大的哲学和技术项目做出的贡献而言，该项目既关心避免风险，也关心实现进步和上行潜力。然而，为了成功做到这一点，我们首先需要进一步取得重大进展，一方面理解合法价值变化的机制，另一方面我们有能力构建以预期方式可靠运行的人工智能系统。此外，我们应该关注目前的情况：虽然可以想象，我们未来的人工智能助手将成为高度反思的道德代理人，帮助我们找出本能地认可的价值观，以及对我们价值可塑性的非法利用可以说，这是一个更突出、更迫在眉睫的威胁。

Risks from causing illegitimate value change]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 26, 2023 2:38 PM GMT<br/><br/><p>未对齐的人工智能系统可能会导致非法的价值变化。这种风险的核心在于这样的观察：人类价值观固有的可塑性可能会被利用，从而导致价值变化变得不合法。回想一下，我认为非法性是由于一个人自我决定和纠正价值变革过程的能力缺乏或（重大）障碍而产生的。</p><h2>导致非法价值变化的机制</h2><p>今天已经可以观察到这种风险的实例，例如在推荐系统的情况下。在考虑它可以给我们带来哪些关于高级人工智能系统风险的教训之前，值得花一些时间来理解这个例子。为此，我将借鉴 Hardt 等人的工作。 （2022），引入了“表演力”的概念。执行力是对“公司运营算法系统（例如数字内容推荐平台）导致参与者群体发生变化的能力”的定量衡量标准（第 1 页）。企业的执行力越高，其“从引导大众转向为企业带来更有利可图的行为中获益”的能力就越高（第 1 页）。换句话说，执行力使我们能够衡量运行推荐系统的公司在客户群中引起外生价值变化<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref8dyuxt9u9t"><sup><a href="#fn8dyuxt9u9t">[1]</a></sup></span>的能力。该措施是专门为推进数字经济竞争研究而制定的，特别是为了识别反竞争动态。</p><p>这里发生了什么？为了更好地理解这一点，我们可以帮助自己区分 Predomo 等人介绍的“事前优化”和“事后优化”。 （2020）。前者——事前优化——是在低执行力条件下发生的预测优化类型，其中预测者（在本例中为公司）无法比标准统计学习允许从过去的数据中提取的信息做得更好。未来的数据。另一方面，事后优化涉及控制预测的行为，例如提高预测器的预测性能。换句话说，在第一种情况下，待预测数据是固定的并且独立于预测器的活动，而在第二种情况下，待预测数据受到预测过程的影响。正如哈特等人。 (2022) 评论：“[事后优化]对应于对反事实的隐式或显式优化”（第 7 页）。换句话说，具有高表演能力的演员不仅能预测最可能的结果，还能预测最可能的结果。<i>从功能上讲，</i>它的表现就好像它可以选择要实现的未来场景，然后进行预测（从而能够实现更高水平的预测准确性）。</p><p>根据我们之前对（不）合法价值变化本质的讨论，表现力驱动群体价值变化的情况构成了非法变化的一个例子。经历所述变化的人们并没有以任何有意义的方式积极参与表演预测因素影响所述人群的变化，并且他们“纠正方向”的能力通过（除其他外）选择设计（即影响消费者接触到的推荐顺序）或通过利用某些心理特征，使某些类型的内容在当地比其他内容更引人注目，而不管所述内容与个人价值观或促进原因的关系如何。</p><p>更重要的是，人口所经历的变化使得价值观变得更加可预测。为了解释这一点，首先要注意的是，执行预测者（即运行推荐平台的公司）嵌入在经济逻辑中，该逻辑强制要求最小化成本和增加利润。结果，公司的控制力将特别倾向于使预测的行为<i>更容易</i>预测，因为公司能够利用这种可预测性来获取利润（例如，通过增加广告收入）。迄今为止，这一过程已得到充分记录。例如，就推荐平台而言，研究并未发现观看行为的异质性增加，而是发现这些平台存在所谓的“受欢迎程度偏差”，从而导致内容多样性的丧失和同质化推荐（参见 Chechkin 等人 (2007)、DiFranzo 等人 (2017) 和 Hazrati 等人 (2022)）。因此，预测优化者施加压力，使行为更加可预测，而实际上，这通常意味着（个人和集体）价值观的简化、同质化和/或两极分化的压力。</p><h2> ...对于（高级）人工智能系统</h2><p>虽然当今的推荐平台可能已经拥有相当程度的执行能力，但不难想象更先进的人工智能系统将能够更强大地利用人类心理和社会经济动态。从先验的角度来看，没有太多理由认为人类进化的心理在对抗人工超级智能“劝说者”时会特别强大。除了由高度先进的人工智能系统提供支持的推荐系统之外，我们还可以想象个性化“人工智能助手”的使用将越来越广泛。我们可以将人工智能助手的任务想象为帮助他们所协助的人满足他们的需求、实现他们的目标或满足他们的偏好。鉴于在广泛的背景下全面、明确地指定一个人想要什么的难度，这种“帮助”通常会涉及对人工智能系统部分的猜测（即预测）。因此，考虑到上面讨论的动态，如果没有成功地设计来避免 VCP，这样的“人工智能助手”很可能通过引起个人目标和价值观的实质性和累积变化来“提高他们的表现”。更重要的是，就像上述推荐算法的情况一样，这种“人工智能助手”引起的变化的本质将倾向于（除非采取相关的纠正措施）所预测的数据结构的简化——在这种情况下人类价值观的情况。为了说明这一点：“人工智能助手”也许能够通过有效地缩小我的烹饪偏好范围来提高其绩效指标，让我总是要求汉堡和薯条，而不是偶尔对探索新奇的口味和菜肴感兴趣。上面描绘的情况令人担忧，因为，一方面，它削弱了人自我决定价值观的能力；另一方面，随之而来的变化可能会导致曾经更丰富或更微妙的价值观实际上变得贫乏。所描述的效果不需要人工智能系统方面有任何“恶意”，但可能会作为其运作方式的“仅仅”意外后果而出现。</p><p>重要的是要认识到，所描述的机制有可能达到“远”和“深”——换句话说，它有可能对我们的公共和私人生活产生重大影响；人们的经济、社会、政治和个人信仰、价值观、行为和关系。例如，想想广告的普遍存在（如今，广告甚至通过智能手机和电视深入到私人领域），以及每天有多少经济行为受到广告的影响。或者，想想同样的机制如何影响舆论形成、公共审议，从而影响政治结果。因此，人工智能驱动的广告或政治宣传，以及我们目前可能无法想象的其他应用程序，具有巨大的潜在危害。</p><p>让我们回顾一下我们在此确定的非法价值变化风险的潜在机制。一般来说，我们关注的是预测优化器（或功能相当于预测优化器的过程）能够系统地影响其预测的情况。如果所预测的现象涉及某些人的需求，那么执行优化器就会影响这些人的价值观。如果人们假设人类价值观是固定不变的，那么人们可能会得出这样的结论：这里没有什么可担心的。然而，认识到人类价值观的可塑性使得这种风险变得突出并且可能非常紧迫。先进的人工智能系统在这种形式的执行预测方面将变得越来越有能力，从而加剧我们今天已经可以得出的任何模式。这些人工智能系统在相关社会经济环境（例如广告、信息系统、我们的政治生活、私人生活等）中的部署越广泛，潜在的危害就越严重和深远。 </p><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fn8dyuxt9u9t"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnref8dyuxt9u9t">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>观察到的人口变化可能并不完全是由于价值观的变化。然而，它可能（并且通常会）涉及大量的价值变化，因此，执行力是理解外生引起的价值变化现象的相关衡量标准。</p></div></li></ol><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZFGPJi3u8xuvnWHQ/4-risks-from-causing-illegitimate-value-change#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZFGPJi3u8xuvnWHQ/4-risks-from-causing-illegitimate-value-change<guid ispermalink="false"> qZFGPJi3u8xuvnWHQ</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nora_Ammann]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:38:26 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3.

This gives raise to two types of risks: risks from causing illegitimate value change, and risks from preventing legitimate value change. For each of these I want to ask: What is the risk? What are plausible mechanisms by which these risks manifest? What are ways in which these risks manifest already today, and what are the ways in which they are likely to be exacerbated going forward, as AI systems become more advanced and more widely deployed?</p><p> In the first case— <i>risks from causing illegitimate value change—</i> , leading with the example of recommender systems today, I will argue that performative predictors can come to affect that which they set out to predict—among others, human values. In the second case— <i>risks from preventing legitimate value change—</i> , I will argue that value collapse—the idea that hyper-explication of values tends to weaken our epistemic attitudes towards the world and our values—can threaten the possibility of self-determined and open-ended value exploration and, consequently, the possibility of legitimate value change. In both cases, we should expect (unless appropriate countermeasures are taken) the same dynamic to be exacerbated—both in strength and scope—with the development of more advanced AI systems, and their increasingly pervasive deployment.</p><h2> Brief excursion: Directionality of Fit</h2><p> A different way to articulate the legitimacy question I have described here is in terms of the notion of &#39; <strong>Directionality of Fit</strong> &#39;. In short, the idea is that instead of asking whether a given case of value change is (il)legitimate, we can ask which &#39;direction of fit&#39; ought to apply.让我解释。</p><p> Historically, &#39;directionality of fit&#39; (or &#39;direction of fit&#39;) was used to refer to the distinction between values and beliefs. (The idea came up (although without mentioning the specific term) in Anscombe&#39;s <i>Intention</i> (2000) and was later discussed by Searl (1985) and Humberstone (1992).) According to this view, beliefs are precisely those things which change to fit the world, while values are those things which the world should be fitted to.</p><p> However, once one accepts the premise that values are malleable, the &#39;correct&#39; (or desirable) direction of fit ceases to be clearly defined. It raises the question of when exactly values should be used as a template for fitting the world to them, and when it is acceptable or desirable for the world to change the values. If I never accept the world to change my values, I forgo any possibility for value replacement, development or refinement. However, as I&#39;ve argued in part before and will discuss in some more detail in post 5, I might reason to consider myself morally harmed if I lose that ability to freely undergo legitimate value change.</p><p> Finally, this lens also makes more salient the intricate connection between values and beliefs: the epistemic dimensions of value development, as well as the ways values affect our epistemic attitudes and pursuits.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yPnAzeRAqdko3RNtR/3-premise-three-and-conclusion-ai-systems-can-affect-value#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yPnAzeRAqdko3RNtR/3-premise-three-and-conclusion-ai-systems-can-affect-value<guid ispermalink="false"> yPnAzeRAqdko3RNtR</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nora_Ammann]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:38:14 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2. Premise two: Some cases of value change are (il)legitimate]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 26, 2023 2:36 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> In the prior post, I have defended the claim that genuine value change is possible, and thus, that a realistic account of human values understands them to be malleable. In this section, I will argue for the claim that <i>some cases of value change are legitimate while others are illegitimate</i> . In other words, I argue that, at least in principle, something substantial is to be said about what types of value change are legitimate vs. illegitimate. Let us call this the &#39;value change legitimacy&#39; claim (VCL). [1]</p><p> To do so, I first explain what I mean by value change legitimacy. Then, I make an appeal to intuition or common sense by providing a handful of examples that, I expect, most people would not hesitate to accept as examples of both legitimate and illegitimate cases of value change. Finally, I suggest a plausible evaluative criteria identifying (il)legitimate value change, which provides further rational grounding for the common sense intuitions invoked earlier, as well as a starting point for developing a comprehensive account of value change legitimacy.</p><p> ([1]: To clarify the scope of the VCL claim, let me briefly clarify what I am <i>not</i> trying to make claims about. First, I am not trying to make claims about whether all cases of value change are either legitimate or illegitimate (ie, whether legitimacy/illegitimacy is a collectively exhaustive way to classify cases of value change). Second, I don&#39;t mean to exclude the possibility that legitimacy comes in degrees, or that there might exist grey areas with respect to whether a given case is (il)legitimate.)</p><h1> Clarifying the notion of value change legitimacy</h1><p> First, and maybe most important, value change legitimacy, as I mean to propose it here, is a <i>procedural</i> notion. In other words, in asking about value change legitimacy, I am asking about the way in which a given value change has <i>come about</i> . This is in contrast to asking whether the value change <i>as such</i> is morally good or bad. As we have seen in the former post, the latter question is confusing (and maybe confused) because the value change itself implies a change of the evaluative framework. As a result, it is unclear on what basis the goodness or badness of the value change <i>as such</i> should be evaluated. However, I claim that there still exist morally relevant differences between different cases of value change (other than the moral status of the value change as such) -- in particular, the procedural question: whether the manner in which the value change has <i>come about</i> conforms with certain normative standards that make the change acceptable, unproblematic and thus legitimate, or—on the other hand—objectionable, problematic and thus illegitimate.</p><p> (The choice of the world &#39;legitimacy&#39; might seem confusing or unfortunate to some. While I am happy to hear better suggestions, it seems worth clarify that I chose this term with reference to how &#39;legitimacy&#39; is typically used in political philosophy, where it refers to procedural properties of political institutions. According to me, this analogy goes surprisingly deep—but will have to leave exploring this in more detail to another time.)</p><p> Of course, in practice, it may not always be clear whether specific cases of value change are legitimate or not, or how, in general, we ought to decide on what counts as legitimate vs. illegitimate. In fact, these questions will be subject to disagreement and rational deliberation. For the purposes of the argument in favour of the Value Change Problem, it suffices for me to establish that there is <i>something</i> substantive to be said about the difference between legitimate and illegitimate cases&#39; value change—that the difference exists—even if important questions remain about how <i>exactly</i> to do so.</p><p> That said, I will in the latter part of this post put forth a specific proposal as to what we might mean by legitimacy--namely, the degree of self-determination involved in the process of value change. While I do believe value self-determination is a critical aspect of value change legitimacy, I do not think my proposal provides close to a comprehensive account of value change legitimacy, able to deal satisfactorily with a wide range of practical intricacies that arise. For example, for future work, I am interested in &#39;stress testing&#39; my current account of legitimacy by looking at cases in, eg, parenting and education, and using the resulting insights to build on and improve the current, provisoinal account. As such, I suggest the proposal put forth below to be understood in the spirit of wanting to provide a productive starting point, rather than as an end point.</p><h1> The case for value change legitimacy</h1><h2> Argument form intuition/common sense</h2><p> Having clarified what we mean by legitimacy in the context of value change, let us now explore the case for VCL.</p><p> I will start by describing two examples that I believe people will widely agree represent cases of both legitimate and illegitimate value change--that is, defending VCL by providing an existence proof of sorts.</p><p> As such, let us consider the following examples of value change.</p><p> First, consider David. David does not currently hold a deep appreciation for jazz. For example, when he recently accompanied his friend to a concert—herself an ardent jazz lover—, he secretly fell asleep for some parts of the performance due to boredom. However, Daniel has an inkling that there may be something deeply valuable about jazz that he has not yet come to fully apprehend. This motivates him to spend several weeks attentively listening to jazz music and going to more concerts. While he initially struggles to pay attention, over time, his experience of the music starts to change until, eventually, Daniel comes to deeply appreciate jazz, just like his friend does.</p><p> On the other hand, consider Elsa. Elsa, too, does not initially have an appreciation jazz and also comes to love it. In her case, however, the change is the result of Elsa joining a cult which, as a central pillar of their ideology, venerate a love of jazz. The cult makes use of elaborate means of coercive persuasion, involving psychological techniques as well as psychoactive substances, in order to get all of their members to appreciate jazz.</p><p> Each of these are cases of value change as characterised earlier. However, and I would argue most people would agree, there are morally significant differences between these cases: while Daniel&#39;s case appears (largely) unproblematic and legitimate, Elsa&#39;s one appears (largely) problematic and illegitimate. To put it another way, it seems to me like we would lose something important if we were to deny that there are morally relevant difference between these cases which are <i>not</i> reducible to the nature of the value change (in this case the love for jazz). We want to be able to point at Elsa&#39;s case of value change and argue that it is problematic and should be prevented, and we want to be able to say that Daniel&#39;s case of value change is fine and does not need to be prevented, without in either case basing our argumentation on whether or not loving jazz is a morally acceptable or not. As such, I argue that the relevant difference we are picking up on here pertains to the legitimacy (or lack thereof) of the value change <i>process</i> (in the sense I&#39;ve described it above).</p><p>到目前为止，一切都很好。 But, beyond appealing to common sense, can we say anything substantive about what makes these cases different?</p><h2> Argument from plausible mechanism</h2><p> I suggest that a/the key difference between Daniel&#39;s and Elsa&#39;s examples lies in the process by which the value change has been brought about, in particular in the extent to which the process was <i>self-determined</i> by the person who undergoes the change, and the extent to which the person remains able to &#39;course-correct&#39; the unfolding of the process (eg, slow, halt or redirect) if she so chooses to.</p><p> To illustrate this, let&#39;s first consider Daniel&#39;s case. This case of value change appears unproblematic—a case of legitimate value change—in that the transformational process occurs at Daniel&#39;s own, free volition, and at any point, he could have chosen to discontinue to further engage in said aspirational process. His friend did not force him to engage with jazz; rather, Daniel held proleptic reasons <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefa0bk6k4v21"><sup><a href="#fna0bk6k4v21">[1]</a></sup></span> for engaging more with jazz—an inkling, so to speak, for what would later turn into his full capacity to value jazz. By contrast, Elsa&#39;s ability to engage in the unfolding of her value transformation freely and in a self-determined fashion was heavily undermined by the nature of the process. Even if she might have chosen the first (few) interactions with the cult freely, the cult&#39;s sophisticated use of methods of manipulation, indoctrination or brainwashing deliberately exploit Elsa&#39;s psychological make-up. As such, the resulting change—independent of what specific beliefs and values it results in—is problematic due to the way it was brought about, and as such support our intuition that this is a case of illegitimate value change.</p><p> To test this idea slightly more, let&#39;s consider the case of Finley who, just like Daniel and Elsa also ends up falling in love with jazz. In Finley&#39;s case, they find themselves, a result of the workings of a content recommender system, consuming a lot of videos about the joys of jazz. Starting out, Finley did not hold any particular evaluative stance towards jazz; a few weeks later, however, they become obsessed with it, started to frequent concerts, read books on jazz, and so on.</p><p> Compared to Daniel and Elsa, I think Finley&#39;s case is more subtle and ambiguous with respect to value change legitimacy. On one hand, Finley&#39;s process of value change does not meet the same level of active and self-determined engagement as Daniel&#39;s. Finley did not (by stipulation in the example) start out with an inkling for the value of gardening, as is characteristic for an aspirational process according to Callard. Rather, they were passively exposed to information which then brought about the change. Furthermore, the recommendation algorithm arguably is shaped more by the economic incentives of the company than it is with the primary purpose of exposing Finley to new experiences and perspectives in mind. Finally, content recommendation platforms have some potential to cause compulsive or addictive behaviour in consumers by exploiting the human psychological make-up (eg, sensitivity to dopamine stimuli). All of these factors can be taken to weaken Finley&#39;s ability to reflect on their current level of jazz video consumption and values, and to &#39;course-correct&#39; if they wanted to. At the same time, while the recommender platform might be said to have weakened Finley&#39;s ability to self-determine and course-correct the process autonomously, this occurred at a very different level as the coercive persuasion experienced by Elsa. As such, this case appears neither clearly legitimate nor clearly illegitimate, but carries some aspects of both.</p><p> This is to show, referring to self-determination alone does not clarify all we need to know about what does and does not constitute legitimate value change. As mentioned above, in future work, I am interested in stress testing and building on this preliminary account further. </p><p></p><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fna0bk6k4v21"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefa0bk6k4v21">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> Callard (2016) defines proleptic reasons as reasons which are based on value estimates which the reasoner cannot fully access yet, even if they might be able to partially glean them, ie an &quot;inchoate, anticipatory, and indirect grasp of some good&quot; (2016, p. 132).</p></div></li></ol><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QjA6kipHYqwACkPNw/2-premise-two-some-cases-of-value-change-are-il-legitimate#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QjA6kipHYqwACkPNw/2-premise-two-some-cases-of-value-change-are-il-legitimate<guid ispermalink="false"> QjA6kipHYqwACkPNw</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nora_Ammann]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:36:53 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1. Premise one: Values are malleable]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 26, 2023 2:36 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> In this post, I will defend the first premise of the Value Change Problem: <i>that realistic models of human values take them to be malleable, rather than fixed</i> .  I call this the &#39;value malleability&#39; claim (VM).</p><p> I start by clarifying what I mean by value malleability before making a case that human values are in fact malleable. My general approach is to consider empirical observations about the practical reasoning of real-world agents (humans) and consider to what extent these are best explained by an account that posits fixed values vs one that posits value malleability. Concretely, I look at changes over the course of the human developmental lifespan; cases of value uncertainty, underspecification and open-endedness; and finally two existing accounts in the philosophical literature - transformative experiences and aspiration - and consider whether they represent genuine cases of value change. Finally, I consider some further objections.</p><p> This is the longest of the three premises of the Value Change Problem, and the discussion is relatively long and philosophical. If you are excited about diving into some of the details, great - read ahead! If instead you&#39;re looking for a minimal summary, the following is what I would say if I could only give one argument in favour of the value malleability claim:</p><blockquote><p> <i><strong>Argument from open-endedness:</strong></i></p><p> Relative to (cognitively) bounded agents (such as humans), the world is open-ended. Humans do not come into this world with a complete representation of the world (eg, a full hypothesis space). As a result, people occasionally get exposed to situations which they have not considered before and with respect to which they have not yet formed a meaningful evaluative stance. Thus, for a bounded agent to be able to function in such an open-ended world, it must be the case that they sometimes undergo value changes. In other words, the only way an agent could come to adopt an evaluative stance with respect to a genuinely novel situation is one that involves value change.</p></blockquote><h1> Clarifying what mean by value change</h1><p> By claiming that values are malleable, I claim that they can (and typically do) undergo some form of change over, eg, the course of a person&#39;s life.</p><p> But what do I mean by change? To clarify this question, let&#39;s disambiguate three different notions of value change: value replacement, value development and value refinement.</p><p> At a first glance, let us say that…</p><ol><li> <i>Value replacement</i> occurs when we adopt a novel value relative to an issue such that the new value replaces a value that was held earlier with respect to the same issue.<ol><li> Example: Anna used to eat meat, and later, as a result of changing her values with respect to the moral patienthood of animals, she comes to adopt a vegetarian diet based on her new moral beliefs.</li></ol></li><li> <i>Value development</i> occurs when we adopt a novel value such that its adoption does not cause the replacement of an existing value.<ol><li> Example: Bob, on top of and while continuing to courage, comes to additionally adopt a value compassion.</li></ol></li><li> <i>Value refinement</i> occurs when we adopt a more nuanced, elaborate or contextualised version of an existing value.<ol><li> Example: Clara used to understand her value for honesty as referring to &#39;not knowingly saying false things&#39; and later expanded her conception of honesty to also concern cases of deceptive behaviour that does not involve saying literally false things.</li></ol></li></ol><p> For the present purposes, I am less interested in discussing whether or if so how these three notions represent mutually exclusive and collectively comprehensive definitions of value change. Instead, I think it is a useful exercise to start familiarising ourselves with the notion of value change, and building some vocabulary that might come in useful later. Furthermore, thinking about the above example allows us to ask, for each of these cases, whether these represent genuine cases of value change (rather than, say, being better explained by a story that does not involve a change of values). In doing so, we can notice two things - let&#39;s think of them as markers of genuine value change - worth emphasising.</p><p> First, what makes each of these an instance of value change is that, with respect to the total set of values that describes a person and their behaviour, the person has undergone a substantive, non-trivial change which manifests in their practical reasoning and behaviour.</p><p> Second, for something to be a genuine case of value change, it must be the case that the person undergoing the change could have, in the relevant sense, <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref1n9r44l2gfe"><sup><a href="#fn1n9r44l2gfe">[1]</a></sup></span> taken a different path, eg, they could have adopted a different value, or refined their existing value in an alternative direction. Fore example, rather than refining her value of honesty in the way she did, Clara could have (in the relevant sense) formed values over, for example, whether someone acts honestly either from virtue or from duty (ie, being intrinsically motivated to act honestly vs. acting honestly even if reluctant to), over the (in)acceptability of certain types of dishonesty (eg, white lies), over different standards for how much someone is morally required to &#39;go out of their way&#39; to avoid (intentionally or unintentionally) misleading others, etc. All of these are a priori reasonable ways to refine a value of &#39;honesty&#39; which Clara could have (in a relevant sense) adopted, which I argue makes it such that we can consider this a case of genuine value change in the sense relevant to us. If that was not the case—if the value change could not have, in the relevant sense, taken a different path; in other words, if the nature of the change was fully inevitable—one may object that said &#39;change&#39; should instead be better understood as the mere &#39;unfolding&#39; of a preexisting, fixed, yet latent value. This would not count as an example of value malleability.</p><p> Lastly, in asking what we mean  by value change, we could also ask what we do <i>not</i> want to count as genuine value change. There is a bunch more that could be said there, but the following seems worth mentioning in passing. There are cases (let&#39;s call them cases of &#39;pretend&#39; change) in which someone is forced or finds themselves otherwise compelled to adopt certain behaviours which could be interpreted as the result of a change in values, but which is more appropriately understood as forced behaviour adopted against someone&#39;s genuine values. For example, I may do things while, say, held at a gunpoint, which conflict with my (earlier) values, which nevertheless, do not result from an underlying value change.</p><p> To summarise, all three types of change described above—replacement, development and refinement—are all cases of genuine value change and thus ways in which the malleability of human values may manifest.</p><h1> The case for value malleability</h1><h2> Do I have the same values as my younger self?</h2><p> Let us assume, for a moment, that values are fixed (ie, non-malleable). What would this imply?</p><p> For one, it would imply children already possess the fully formed and complete sets of values that they will also have as adults.  If you&#39;re like me, this will sound like a wild thing to believe. In other words, I don&#39;t think this belief lines up well with what we observe.</p><p> First, children certainly do not seem to have the same values as their adult selves in any trivial or straightforward sense. For example, a child that cared about animals and wanted to become a veterinarian will sometimes change their mind, start to care about, say, the arts and want to become a violinist instead. Second, children do not typically have formed values over a number of issues their later selves will have come to form values about, such as various political or philosophical stances (eg, whether they are a pacifist, anarchist or capitalist), lifestyle choices (eg, whether they will want to get married, have children, etc.) or aesthetic preferences.</p><p> You might object, however, that these aren&#39;t genuine cases of value change. Instead, we might be able to make sense of these cases by proposing that children already hold their future values in a latent state, even if they may not be able to consciously access them. Those latent values might not yet show fully, but only take the form of some sort of &#39;proto&#39; version of the child&#39;s later, fully fledged values. Under this interpretation, rather than representing cases of genuine value change, what we are observing is instead the realisation, over the course of the child&#39;s growing up, of those already existing, latent values.</p><p> Recall that, in order to reject the VM claim, the latent values would have to be such that the child will come to develop their full versions invariably, ie, that the development could not have, in the relevant sense, taken a different path. Inversely, if there are different ways in which a value could have developed, we treat this, according to our definition above, as a case of value change. However, as I will try to show, the invariability condition is not met in the case of human development, and thus that the explanation via latent values remains unsatisfactory.</p><p> To make this point, take, for example, a child who shows an inclination (ie, &#39;proto&#39; values) to judge any form of violence as atrocious. It seems like said child&#39;s early tendencies could just about as well be interpreted as a &#39;proto-pacifist position&#39; or as a &#39;proto-real political&#39; one. In the former case, the dispreference of violence could lead to the belief that any forms of violence must be resisted, while in the latter case, the same early dispreference could lead to the belief that the state&#39;s monopoly of power is critical to maintaining peace and order  and thereby reduce the overall expected violence and harm. In other words, there is uncertainty about what values the child will come to adopt. What does this imply for the theory of latent values?</p><p> First, we must distinguish between two places from which the uncertainty could originate. In the first case, the uncertainty about the child&#39;s future values resides in the subjective beliefs of the observer. In other words, while there is a true answer to what the child&#39;s latent values are that it will come to hold, the observer does not have direct and full access to what those values are, and as a result, (the observer&#39;s subjective beliefs about) the values are uncertain.</p><p> This type of uncertainty is compatible with claiming that the child has latent values it will inevitably come to adopt. However, this theory does not seem to afford the theoriser any epistemic purchase (eg, improved predictive power). As we have seen in the example above, simply posing the existence of latent value doesn&#39;t on its own tell us anything about what those latent values are. Furthermore, it is hard to imagine what epistemic position one could realistically come to inhabit that would make it justified (as well as pedagogically unproblematic) to act according to the belief that a child&#39;s future values are already fully pre-determined. As such, one might critique that, while a theory of latent values requires us to posit an unobservable but purportedly real ontological entity (namely, latent values), this cost in parsimony is not met with equal or greater epistemic gains.</p><p> In the second case, the uncertainty about the child&#39;s future values resides not in the observer&#39;s subjective beliefs but &#39;in the territory&#39;. In other words, while the possessions of a proto value biases how likely different value trajectories are, the child&#39;s values could ultimately come to develop in different ways, depending on, say, what the child comes to experience over the course of its life. This picture, however, does not conflict with VM, and thus does not serve as a basis for rejecting it. Under this interpretation, the child&#39;s inclinations (ie, their &#39;proto&#39; values) are (on their own) an underspecification of what future values the child will come to adopt. In other words, the child&#39;s values could develop in different directions, depending on what experiences it will have, what ideas it will be exposed to, etc. If, however, the child, given its current inclinations and proto values, could come to adopt different sets of values in the future,  this development must involve some form of value change (in the sense defined above). As such, the basic premise of this section holds that the observation that children, over the course of their developmental process, come to hold different values provides evidence in favour of VM. This also shows how VM does not mean to exclude the possibility that certain (inherent, genetic, etc.) tendencies influence (but do not fully determine) a person&#39;s future values</p><h2> Dealing with value uncertainty, underspecification and open-endedness</h2><p> Let&#39;s consider another set of empirical observations about human practical reason, and check whether or not value malleability is a compelling way to make sense of these cases. Our premise is that humans often find themselves in one of the following positions: they are uncertain about their values; they hold values that are underspecified; or they may face novel situations over which we have not yet formed coherent values. I will argue that handling any of these situations will sometimes involve value change.</p><p> <strong><u>Value uncertainty and underspecification</u></strong></p><p> First, let&#39;s consider the case of <i>value uncertainty</i> —the idea that we are often uncertain about what we value.</p><p> Consider Fin, who is uncertain about what his endorsed stance is towards such issues like the moral status of non-human animals, the moral value of people who don&#39;t exist yet, abortion, etc. I argue that in some (not necessarily all) cases where value uncertainty gets (partially) resolved, this occurs in a way that involves value change. (Of course, the inverse process is possible to—where one becomes more uncertain about a given value.)<br> For example, when dealing with the fact that he&#39;s uncertain about the moral status of non-human animals, Fin might eg refine an existing value, or extend it to a novel issue. I have argued before that value reinforcement and development (on top of valve replacement) are genuine cases of value change.</p><p> A similar argument applies to the case of <i>value underspecification</i> —the idea that we often hold values that turn out to be insufficiently specified. We have already seen an example of this earlier, when Clara&#39;s initial underspecified notion of honesty got refined to include both the idea of &#39;not saying false things&#39; as well as &#39;not knowingly acting to deceive&#39;. Underspecification is resolved by value refinement, and might sometimes reveal conflicting values, resolving which may further require the replacement of some of one&#39;s value. I have already argued earlier that these are all forms of genuine value change.</p><p> (Note, in neither case am I claiming that all cases of uncertainty or underspecification are noticed or resolved; nor do I need to, for my argument to succeed.)</p><p> <strong><u>Value open-endedness</u></strong></p><p> Finally, I argue that because the world is open-ended relative to (cognitively) bounded agents (such as is the case for humans), value change is commonplace. Let us unpack this argument further. First, humans are bounded, meaning that they operate with a limited set of (cognitive) resources as they are navigating the world (see, eg, Simon, 1990; Wimsatt, 2007). Given that, humans do not come into this world with a complete representation of the world (ieeg, a full hypothesis space). Instead, from the point of view of an individual, the world appears <i>open-ended</i> , ieeg, the world&#39;s limits and its ontology are not clearly defined or unchangeable from the get-go. As a result, people sometimes get exposed to situations they have not considered before and with respect to which we have not yet formed a meaningful evaluative stance.</p><p> One might object that the agent could have held the relevant value latently, and thus, instead of involving genuine value change, these should be understood as cases where a fixed, latent value is being &#39;unfolded&#39; or &#39;come to be consciously apprehended&#39;. While this might sometimes be what is in fact what is happening, in order to refute VM, one would have to argue that every value a person will ever come to adopt must have already been held latently. This would imply that a person&#39;s model of the world already contained all representational entities with respect to which they will ever come to hold evaluative stances. Given the cognitive boundedness of real agents, this seems exceedingly unrealistic. Instead, the open-endedness of the world will predictably expose a bounded agent to genuinely novel situations over which they will not yet have had the chance to form any evaluative stances. Because the situation must be understood as genuinely novel, the only interpretation of how an agent could come to adopt an evaluative stance with respect to such novel situations is one that involves genuine value change. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref1qbzhcck1fg"><sup><a href="#fn1qbzhcck1fg">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h2> Transformative experiences and Aspirational pursuits</h2><p> In the following, I will briefly describe two accounts from the philosophical literature which provide extensive treatments of cases of genuine value change. These two accounts are Paul&#39;s (2014) <i>Transformative Experiences</i> , and Callard&#39;s (2018) <i>Aspiration</i> .</p><p> &#39;Transformative experiences&#39; (Paul, 2014) are experiences that permanently and fundamentally transform a person in hard-to-imagine ways, including with respect to their values. An example of a transformative experience is becoming a parent, immersing oneself in a completely novel culture, or going through a near-death experience. It is not uncommon that such experiences change people (including their values) significantly, and, from the point of view of the person going through the experience, it is hard, maybe impossible, to fully anticipate how they will be changed as a result. Nevertheless, most people will experience at least one or a few such transformative experiences throughout their lifetime, and humans do not generally seem to go out of their way to avoid undergoing such a change. Insofar as Paul&#39;s account of transformative experiences holds up—ie, insofar as these experiences are truly transformative, including with respect to people&#39;s values—they provide a central example of the malleability of human values.</p><p> As for the second account, Agnes Callard (2016, 2018) discusses how, not only in the case of transformative experiences, humans seem to regularly take actions on the basis of what she calls <i>proleptic</i> reasons. These are reasons which are based on value estimates which the reasoner cannot fully access yet, even if they might be able to partially glean them. As such, Callard argues that humans sometimes actively <i>aspire</i> to explore and &#39;unlock&#39; new domains of value <i>before</i> they have become fully able to value said things. For example, one may aspire to be able to appreciate the joys of haute cuisine before one is fully able to do so, or one may aspire to cultivate certain virtues (say courage) without yet being able to fully inhabit all the things that may be good about said virtue. In other words, the aspirant wants to want something, before having full access to why they want that something. As such, and according to Callard&#39;s account, the notion of aspiration refers to a rational process of value development. In Callard&#39;s own words, to aspire is to pursue an activity based on an &#39;inchoate, anticipatory, and indirect grasp of some good&#39; (2016, p. 132), and as a result, &#39;we have guided ourselves to the new values or desires or commitments that our experience engenders&#39; (p. 153). Again, insofar as Callard&#39;s account holds up, it provides an example, and thus existence proof, of value malleability.</p><h2> Counterargument : &#39;shallow&#39; vs &#39;fundamental&#39; values</h2><p> One might object that all of the above examples can be explained by postulating that more &#39;shallow&#39; types of values <i>can</i> change while more &#39;fundamental&#39; values remain fixed. Further, such changes of &#39;shallow&#39; values (eg, in response to epistemic changes) always stand in an instrumental relationship to the pursuit of the more &#39;fundamental&#39; values which themselves stay fixed.</p><p> To illustrate the shape of what I have in mind with this counterargument, consider the following two examples. Suppose that I like chocolates, and that I believe that there are chocolates in a yellow box. I will then also value having the yellow box at hand. Now, suppose I find out that there are no chocolates left in the yellow box. I subsequently lose interest in it. In a certain sense, my values have changed—I no longer value having the yellow box at hand. At the same time, my valuing of the yellow box appears rather shallow, and instrumental to my valuing of chocolates, which seems more fundamental. Furthermore, the latter value has not undergone any change.</p><p> Or, consider the case of Garry, who aspired to, and eventually succeeded at, coming to value poetry. Maybe what happened is, rather than Garry developing a new value in his love of poetry, he simply learnt more about how he can effectively seek pleasure—pleasure being his more fundamental value which remains fixed throughout his pursuit. Under this account, poetry is &#39;merely&#39; an effective strategy to achieve pleasure.</p><p> Do these examples provide a counterargument to VM? To answer this question, let us first distinguish between two ways we might interpret the notions of &#39;shallow&#39; and &#39;fundamental&#39; in this context.</p><p> On one account, the more fundamental a value, the less likely it is to change. However, it is still in principle possible for (most) values to change, and in particular, the more shallow values change regularly. This interpretation of the notion of &#39;shallow&#39; and &#39;fundamental&#39; does not conflict with VM. In fact, this appears to present a realistic picture of the nature of values in that, for example, it can account for the intuition that some values are more (evolutionary) hardwired (eg, the value to not be hungry)—and therefore less likely to be subject of change—while others are more contingently acquired (eg, a preference for some foods over others) and more likely to change.</p><p> As for the second interpretation, however, we do find it to stand in conflict with VM. According to this view, the changes of the &#39;shallow&#39;, derived values (such as valuing the yellow box, valuing poetry) can be understood as &#39;merely&#39; a case of <i>rational sensitivity to epistemic learning in light of, and instrumental to, more fundamental (and fixed) values</i> . As such, &#39;shallow&#39; values (under this interpretation) don&#39;t constitute values of the same standing or importance as &#39;fundamental&#39; values. Some might argue that they don&#39;t count as genuine values at all (or something similar). <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefpsq4vdaz5p"><sup><a href="#fnpsq4vdaz5p">[3]</a></sup></span> As such, under this view, what we observe in the yellow box and the poetry example does not constitute cases of genuine value change, but instead merely rational re-evaluation of the most effective strategies for realising one&#39;s fundamental (and fixed) values.</p><p> However, this counterargument faces difficulties and, as such, I am not convinced it succeeds. For one, it is <i>always</i> possible to postulate some invariant higher-order value with respect to which changes to shallower values can be explained (eg, my value for chocolates explains my &#39;shallow&#39; &#39;value&#39; for the yellow box). Within this account, nothing constraints us from constructing arbitrary &#39;deep&#39; hierarchies of value which can be used to rationalise any changes of the &#39;lower-level&#39; values in terms of fixed &#39;higher-level&#39; values (eg, my value for tasty food explains my more &#39;shallow&#39; value for chocolates; my value for chocolates, in turn, is explained as merely an instrumental strategy in service of my &#39;more fundamental&#39; value for hedonic pleasure, etc.). I find this problematic because it explains <i>too much</i> (and thereby nothing at all).</p><p> Second, one concern I see with this approach is that we risk abstracting away too much from concrete, contextualised and thick notions of value, replacing them by increasingly more abstract ones (eg, &#39;pleasure&#39; or &#39;utility&#39;), thereby stripping away more information than is desirable. From the perspective of trying to explain and predict phenomena around us, we risk ridding our &#39;theory&#39; of any substantive empirical or predictive content, and the notion of (fundamental) value we end up with ceases to be useful in understanding the (often contextual!) practical reasoning and behaviour of actual humans. In the example above, saying that Garry seeks to maximise (some abstract notion of) &#39;pleasure&#39; or &#39;utility&#39; does not constraints whatsoever my predictions about whether, eg, he will get into liking jazz, far from having anything to say about why or how he might do so.</p><p> Beyond being unsatisfying from the point of view of the theorist, this approach is also problematic from the perspective of being moral reasoners ourselves. In particular, adopting overly abstract notions of value risks impoverishing our very ability to recognise and derive value, and to deliberate with each other about what we value and why. Imagine if Garry&#39;s poetry-loving friend Harriet, who, in one case, is able to talk in rich and nuanced terms about what she finds so marvellous and inspiring about poetry, and, in another case, describes poetry simply as &#39;an effective strategy to seek pleasure&#39;. Most people, I believe, would be more motivated to aspire towards coming to appreciate the value of poetry in the former rather than the latter case. Garry&#39;s own ability to aspire—the quality of his proleptic reasons, his inkling of what might be valuable about poetry—is likely also stronger if his friend is able to talk to him about her love for poetry in thick and nuanced terms. In other words, by reverting to overly abstract notions of value, we impoverish our very ability to reason and deliberate, collectively and with ourselves, about our values. Elizabeth Anderson, in <i>Value in Ethics and Economics</i> , makes this point better than I can: <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefb7lxhe6t5v"><sup><a href="#fnb7lxhe6t5v">[4]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p> [I] deny that it makes sense to reason about the good and the right independent of thick evaluative concepts. [...] It disabled us from appreciating many authentic values. It suppresses the parallel evolution of evaluative distinctions and sensibilities that make us capable of caring about a rich variety of things in different ways. It cuts off fruitful avenues of exploration and criticism available on a pluralistic self-understanding. (p. 118.)</p></blockquote><p> There are a number of other things that could be said about this problem, both in favour of and against defending some notion of fixed fundamental values. I am happy to hear about arguments (in either direction) that I seem to have missed here. For now, this is where I will leave the discussion. I remain unconvinced, for the time being, by this line of counterargument against value malleability. </p><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fn1n9r44l2gfe"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnref1n9r44l2gfe">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> Yes, saying &#39;in the relevant sense&#39; (ie invoking a notion of &#39;relevant counterfactuals&#39; sweeps a bunch of nuance under the rug.

The transhumanist literature, for example, is full of examples of how changes to the biological constraints faced by humans raise significant novel moral questions. Consider, for example, how novel means of contraception have caused the transcendence of earlier constraints set by the fallibility of natural methods of contraception. This expansion in contraceptive possibilities has raised questions and changed people&#39;s attitudes concerning, among others, the social role and rights of  women, sex and marriage. Or, consider how the development of spacesuits has caused the transcendence of the earlier constraints set by humans&#39; inability to survive without an atmosphere. The resulting possibility of space travel in turn raises questions about whether there is a moral case to be made for or against humanity becoming space-faring, and at what cost relative to, say, other social priorities (eg, differential investment in education or health care). Finally, consider how the possibility of artificial wombs, if they come to be, will affect people&#39;s values related to gender, parenthood, people&#39;s rights over their bodies, etc., in ways that cannot be conclusively predicted at this point in time. In other words, innovation creates situations of moral relevance which an individual and/or a society has not yet formed a coherent stance towards, and which thus necessitates value change.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fnpsq4vdaz5p"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefpsq4vdaz5p">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> For example, I find it worthwhile noting that under expected utility theory (eg, following the Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem), any case of value change is necessarily understood as undesirable (eg value drift) and/or the result of a failure of rationality (ie irrationality).

The Value Change Problem: introduction, overview  and motivations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 26, 2023 2:36 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> Given that AI systems are becoming increasingly capable and widely deployed, we have to think carefully about the multifarious effects their adoption will have on our individual and collective lives. In this sequence, I will focus specifically on how AI can come to substantially affect what it is that we value, as well as the mechanisms by which this may occur.</p><p> This sequence introduces the “Value Change Problem” (VCP). I will argue why I think it&#39;s a critical aspect of ethical AI design, and outline what risks we might expect if we fail to properly address it.</p><p> <i>This is a shortened and slightly adapted version of academic work I have submitted for publication elsewhere. The original work was written mainly with an academic philosophy audience in mind. If you&#39;re interested in reading the original (longer) version, feel free to reach out.</i></p><p> The core claim of VCP can be summarised as follows:</p><blockquote><p> AI alignment must address the problem of (il)legitimate value change; that is, the problem of making sure AI systems neither cause value change illegitimately, nor forestall legitimate cases of value change in humans and society.</p></blockquote><h2> Outline (or: how to read this sequence?)</h2><p> This case resides on three core premises:</p><ol><li> human values are malleable ( <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HyodRjYtiA2xozCrk/1-premise-one-values-are-malleable">post 1</a> );</li><li> some instances of value change are (un)problematic ( <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QjA6kipHYqwACkPNw/2-premise-two-some-cases-of-value-change-are-il-legitimate">post 2</a> );</li><li> AI systems are (and will become increasingly) capable of affecting people&#39;s value change trajectories ( <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yPnAzeRAqdko3RNtR/3-premise-three-and-conclusion-ai-systems-can-affect-value">post 3</a> ).</li></ol><p> From this, I conclude that we ought to avoid building AI systems that disrespect or exploit the malleability of human values, such as by causing illegitimate value changes or by preventing legitimate ones. I will refer to this as the &#39;Value Change Problem&#39; (VCP). After having established the core case for VCP, the remaining two posts discuss in some more depth the risks that may result from inadequately addressing the VCP.</p><p> <i>If you are already on board with each of the premises, you may instead want to directly skip to reading the discussion of risks (posts 4 and 5).</i></p><p> I consider two main categories of risks: ( <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZFGPJi3u8xuvnWHQ/4-risks-from-causing-illegitimate-value-change">post 4</a> ) risks from causing illegitimate value change, as well as ( <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KeHGinpj2WyzDEQAx/5-risks-from-preventing-legitimate-value-change">post 5</a> ) risks from (illegitimately) preventing legitimate value change. For each of these I want to ask: What is the risk? What are plausible mechanisms by which these risks manifest? What are ways in which these risks manifest already, and what are the ways in which they are likely to be exacerbated going forward, as AI systems become more advanced and more widely deployed?</p><p> In the first case— <i>risks from causing illegitimate value change</i> —, leading with the example of recommender systems today, I will argue that performative predictors can come to affect that which they set out to predict—among others, human values.</p><p> In the second case— <i>risks from preventing legitimate value change</i> —, I will argue that value collapse—the idea that hyper-explication of values tends to weaken our epistemic attitudes towards the world and our values—can threaten the possibility of self-determined and open-ended value exploration and, consequently, the possibility of legitimate value change. In both cases, we should expect (unless appropriate countermeasures are taken) the same dynamic to be exacerbated—both in strength and scope—with the development of more advanced AI systems, and their increasingly pervasive deployment.</p><p> <i>The different posts are more or less self-contained and can be read on their own.</i></p><p> I welcome thoughts, constructive criticism, and ideas for relevant future work.</p><h2> Motivations</h2><p> In one sense, this analysis is intended to be a contribution to our understanding of the risk landscape related to building increasingly capable, autonomous and widely deployed AI systems.</p><p> In another sense, I believe that some of the reflections on the nature of values contained in this discussion are relevant on the path to proposals for ambitious value learning by helping us characterise (some of) the outlines/shapes of an adequate theory of value.</p><p> I believe that the problem of (il)legitimate value change is an integral part of the problem of aligning advanced AI systems. As such, the question we need to ask about the ethical design of advanced AI systems should not be limited to the question of what values we want to embed in them, but also how we decide on the forms of value change that are (il)legitimate, and how to design and deploy systems such that do not disrespect or exploit value malleability.</p><p> Note that, while I hope to have been able to make initial steps towards a satisfactory characterisation of the Value Change Problem, more work is needed to improve our understanding of the specific ways in which AI systems can (and already do) cause value change, when cases of value change are legitimate or illegitimate, and how to build AI systems that reliably avoid causing illegitimate value change and potentially promote legitimate value change.</p><h2> Acknowledgement</h2><p> I am grateful for useful comments and discussions to my thesis supervisor<br> Ioannis Votsis, my colleagues at ACS (in particular Simon and Clem), Hunter Muir, Tsvi BT, TJ and likely others I&#39;m forgetting here.</p><h2>参考</h2><p>Anderson, E.

The paper comes in three parts and can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-capabilities-and-risks-discussion-paper">here</a> . See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-calls-for-global-responsibility-to-take-ai-risks-seriously-and-seize-its-opportunities">here</a> for the press release announcing the publication of the paper. The paper has been reviewed by a panel of experts including Yoshua Bengio and Paul Christiano.</p><p> I haven&#39;t read it all, but it looks like like a pretty good primer on AI risk. The first part &#39; <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65395abae6c968000daa9b25/frontier-ai-capabilities-risks-report.pdf">Capabilities and risks from frontier AI: discussion paper</a> &#39; is the main overview and it is followed by two &#39;Annexes&#39;: Annex A &#39; <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65396540d10f3500139a6978/future-risks-frontier-ai-annex-a.pdf">Future risks of frontier AI</a> &#39; and Annex B &#39; <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653932db80884d0013f71b15/generative-ai-safety-security-risks-2025-annex-b.pdf">Safety and security risks of generative artificial intelligence to 2025</a> &#39;. Predictably, there is a lot of discussion of the basics of AI risk and non-catastrophic risks such as labour market disruption/disinformation/bias but catastrophic risk does get a mention, often with the caveat that the subject is &#39;controversial&#39;.</p><p> Here are some quotes I found after a quick skim:</p><p> <i>On AI companies racing to the bottom regarding safety:</i></p><blockquote><p> Individual companies may not be sufficiently incentivised to address all<br> the potential harms of their systems. In recent years there has been an intense competition between AI developers to build products quickly. Competition on AI has raised concern about potential “race to the bottom” scenarios, where actors compete to rapidly develop AI systems and under-invest in safety measures. In such scenarios, it could be challenging even for AI developers to commit unilaterally to stringent safety standards, lest their commitments put them at a competitive disadvantage. The risks from this “race” dynamic will be exacerbated if it is technologically feasible to maintain or even accelerate the recent rapid<br> pace of AI progress.</p></blockquote><p> <i>On losing control of AI:</i></p><blockquote><p> Humans may increasingly hand over control of important decisions to AI systems, due to economic and geopolitical incentives. Some experts are concerned that future advanced AI systems will seek to increase their own influence and reduce human control, with potentially catastrophic consequences - although this is contested.</p><p> ...</p><p> The likelihood of these risks remains controversial, with many experts thinking the likelihood is very low and some arguing a focus on risk distracts from present harms. However, many experts are concerned that losing control of advanced general-purpose AI systems is a real possibility and that loss of control could be permanent and catastrophic.</p></blockquote><p> <i>On loss of control of AI as a catastrophic risk:</i></p><blockquote><p> As discussed earlier in the report, while some experts believe that highly capable general-purpose AI agents might be developed soon, others are sceptical it will ever be possible. If this does materialise such agents might exceed the capabilities of human experts in domains relevant to loss of control, for example political strategy, weapons design, or self-improvement. For loss of control to be a catastrophic risk, AI systems would need to be given or gain some control over systems with significant impacts, such as military or financial systems. This remains a hypothetical and hotly disputed risk.</p></blockquote><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eZ8xAyxiELASGsawb/uk-government-publishes-frontier-ai-capabilities-and-risks#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eZ8xAyxiELASGsawb/uk-government-publishes-frontier-ai-capabilities-and-risks<guid ispermalink="false"> eZ8xAyxiELASGsawb</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[A.H.]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 13:55:17 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[AI #35: Responsible Scaling Policies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 26, 2023 1:30 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> There is much talk about so-called Responsible Scaling Policies, as in what we will do so that what we are doing can be considered responsible. Would that also result in actually responsible scaling? It would help. By themselves, in their current versions, no. The good scenario is that these policies are good starts and lay groundwork and momentum to get where we need to go. The bad scenario is that this becomes safetywashing, used as a justification for rapid and dangerous scaling of frontier models, a label that avoids any actual action or responsibility.</p><p> Others think it would be better if we flat out stopped. So they say so. And they protest. And they point out that the public is mostly with them, at the same time that those trying to play as Very Serious People say such talk is irresponsible.</p><p> Future persuasion will be better. Sam Altman predicts superhuman persuasion ability prior to superhuman general intelligence. What would that mean? People think they would not be fooled by such tactics. Obviously, they are mistaken.</p><p> As usual, lots of other stuff as well.</p><p> On the not-explicitly-about-AI front, I would encourage you if you haven&#39;t yet to check out <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/book-review-going-infinite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review of Going Infinite</a> .

Did the deepfakes make the difference? Or were they one more last-minute dirty trick that made almost no difference?</a></p><blockquote><p> Pekka Kallioniemi: Slovakia&#39;s recent election was the first election to be affected by AI-generated deep fakes. Just two days before the voting, a fake audio recording was published in which two opposition figures were discussing on how to rig the elections. Fact-checking organizations declared the recording as fake, but all this was published too late as the vote had already happened.</p><p> This fake audio might have been the key factor to the victory of Robert Fico&#39;s SMER – a pro-Kremlin party that wants to end all aid to Ukraine.</p><p> To be fair, many Slovaks have stated that the fakes were of poor quality and had little effect to the outcome of the election. But we should still expect this type of tactics in future elections.</p><p> Martin Nagy: Deepfakes had zero impact on election results in Slovakia – for their poor quality amateurism, just for laughs. What changed the results was a decade of highest (per capita) Kremlin investments into disinformation network of 100&#39;s [1000&#39;s] of accounts on asocial networks &amp; “alternative” media.</p></blockquote><p> This rhymes a lot with America in 2016. You do not need AI to do a poor quality deepfake. We have been creating poor quality fakes forever. The poor quality reflects that it is responding to demand for poor quality fakes, rather than to demand for high quality fakes.</p><p> As always, the better fakes are coming.

I&#39;m excited to announce <strong>Eureka</strong> , an open-ended agent that designs reward functions for <strong>robot dexterity at super-human level</strong> . It&#39;s like Voyager in the space of a physics simulator API!</p><p> Eureka bridges the gap between high-level reasoning (coding) and low-level motor control. It is a “ <strong>hybrid-gradient architecture</strong> ”: a black box, inference-only LLM instructs a white box, learnable neural network. The outer loop runs GPT-4 to refine the reward function (gradient-free), while the inner loop runs reinforcement learning to train a robot controller (gradient-based).</p><p> We are able to scale up Eureka thanks to IsaacGym, a GPU-accelerated <strong>physics simulator that speeds up reality by 1000x</strong> . On a benchmark suite of 29 tasks across 10 robots, Eureka rewards outperform expert human-written ones on 83% of the tasks by 52% improvement margin on average.</p><p> <strong>We are surprised that Eureka is able to learn pen spinning tricks</strong> , which are very difficult even for CGI artists to animate frame by frame! Eureka also enables a new form of <strong>in-context RLHF</strong> , which is able to incorporate a human operator&#39;s feedback in natural language to steer and align the reward functions. It can serve as a powerful <strong>co-pilot for robot engineers</strong> to design sophisticated motor behaviors.</p><p> As usual, we open-source everything ( <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/lqKiaM2yYJ">code</a> , <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/bdh9TYQtHm">paper</a> ).</p><p> Eureka achieves human-level reward design by <strong>evolving reward functions in-context</strong> . There are 3 key components:</p><p> 1. <strong>Simulator environment code as context</strong> jumpstarts the initial “seed” reward function.</p><p> 2. <strong>Massively parallel RL</strong> on GPUs enables rapid evaluation of lots of reward candidates.</p><p> 3. <strong>Reward reflection</strong> produces targeted reward mutations in-context.</p><p> First, by using the raw IsaacGym environment code as context, Eureka can already generate usable reward programs without any task-specific prompt engineering. This allows Eureka to be an <strong>open-ended, generalist reward designer</strong> with minimal hacking.</p><p> Second, Eureka generates many reward candidates at each evolution step, which are then evaluated using a full RL training loop. Normally, this is extremely slow and could take days or even weeks.</p><p> We are only able to scale this up thanks to NVIDIA&#39;s GPU-native robot training platform, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym">IsaacGym</a> , which boosts simulation by 1000x compared to real time. <strong>Now an inner RL loop can be done in minutes!</strong></p><p> Finally, Eureka relies on <strong>reward reflection</strong> , which is an automated textual summary of the RL training. This enables Eureka to perform targeted reward mutation, thanks to GPT-4&#39;s remarkable ability for in-context code fixing.</p><p> Eureka is a <strong>super human reward engineer</strong> . The agent outperforms expert human engineers on 83% of our benchmark with an average improvement of 52%.</p><p> In particular, Eureka realizes much greater gains on tasks that require sophisticated, high-dimensional motor control.</p><p> To our surprise, <strong>the harder the task is, the less correlated are Eureka rewards to human rewards</strong> . In a few cases, Eureka rewards are even negatively correlated with human ones while delivering significantly better controllers.</p><p> This gives me Deja Vu back to 2016, where AlphaGo made brilliant moves that no human Go players would make. AI will discover very effective strategies that look alien to us!</p><p> Can Eureka adapt from human feedback?</p><p> So far, Eureka operates fully automatically with environment feedback. To capture nuanced human preferences, Eureka can also use feedback in natural language to <strong>co-pilot reward designs</strong> . This leads to a novel <strong>in-context gradient-free form of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)</strong> .</p><p> Here, Eureka with human feedback is able to teach a Humanoid how to run stably in only 5 queries!</p></blockquote><p> As the tasks get harder, Eureka&#39;s reward models look less and less like human ones. An AI is designing alien-looking (inscrutable?) automatically-evolving-in-real-time reward functions. The AI is a &#39;super human reward engineer.&#39; Then we are going to optimize dexterous robots based on that, with an orders of magnitude speed-up.</p><h4> In Other AI News</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1716078957273997529">Baidu claims their Ernie 4.0 is on par with GPT-4</a> , <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJPY3CV1nyNy5ZI3iaNNKsSq-2dPEc_tY">video here</a> .

The basic idea is, if you think you are doing something akin to &#39;playing Russian roulette with Earth&#39; then you should stop and not do that. I bolded the most important bits.</p><blockquote><p> Nate Sores: My current stance on AI is: Fucking stop. Find some other route to the glorious transhuman future. There&#39;s debate within the AI alignment community re whether the chance of AI killing literally everyone is more like 20% or 95%, but 20% means worse odds than Russian roulette.</p><p> (I&#39;m on the “more like 95%” side myself, but this thread is gonna be about how I recommend non-experts respond to the situation, and I think “>; 1/6” is both more obvious and is sufficient for my purposes here.)</p><p> <strong>Picture putting a planet-sized revolver up against Earth, with one round chambered.</strong></p><p> <strong>That&#39;s akin to what companies (or gov&#39;ts!) are doing when they build towards superintelligent AI at our current level of understanding. More than a 1 in 6 chance that literally everybody dies.</strong></p><p> <strong>(When I point this out in person, a surprising number of people respond to this point by saying: well, with Russian roulette, we know that the probability is exactly 1/6, whereas with AI we have no idea what our odds are.</strong></p><p> <strong>But if someone finds a revolver lying around, spins the barrel, and points it at your kid, then your reaction shouldn&#39;t be “no worries, we can&#39;t assign an exact probability because we don&#39;t know how many rounds are chambered”. Refusing to act because the odds are unclear is crazy.)</strong></p><p> Continuing: these people who are playing Russian roulette with the planet have no credible offer that&#39;s worth enough that they should be putting all our lives at such grave risk.</p><p> The possible benefits from AI are great, but the benefits are significantly greater if we wait until we don&#39;t have double-digit percent chances of killing literally everyone.</p><p> Civilization should say to these people: no, sorry, the (probabilistic) costs you&#39;re imposing on us are too large, we will not permit you to endanger everyone like this, rather than waiting and attaining those benefits later, once we know what we&#39;re doing.</p><p> (If you&#39;re worried about *you personally* losing access to the future because you&#39;ll die of old age first, sign up for cryonics, and help improve cryonics technology. I, too, want everyone currently alive to make it to the future!)</p><p> “Fucking stop” is a notably stronger response than “well, I guess we should require all the labs to have licenses” or “well, I guess we should <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/tLbgbXu87H">require all the labs</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/jt81KzRIbk">to run evals</a> like those linked, so that notice early signs of danger.”</p><p> “Have licenses” and “run evals” are fine suggestions, they&#39;re helpful, but they&#39;re not how a sane planet responds to this level of horrific threat. The sane response is to shut it down entirely, and find some other route.</p><p> Picking on evals (where tests for rudimentary abilities like “install GPT-J on a new server” are regularly run against models as they train and/or before they&#39;re deployed):</p><p> A first issue is that evals fundamentally admit lots of false negatives, eg if a model that fails the evals can be used as part of a larger agent with significantly increased capabilities.</p><p> A second issue is: what are you supposed to do when the evals say “this AI is dangerous”?</p><p> The world is full of people who will say they&#39;ve “taken appropriate safety measures” or otherwise give a useless superficial response before plowing on ahead without addressing the deeper underlying issues.</p><p> Others in the field disagree, and think there&#39;s a medium-sized or even high chance that, so long as the AI engineers detect the easily detectible issues, then things will turn out OK and we and our loved ones will survive.</p><p> I&#39;m deeply skeptical; if they were the sort to notice early hints of later issues and react appropriately then I expect they&#39;d be reacting differently to the hints we already have today (present-day jailbreaks, shallow instances of deception, etc.).</p><p> But more generally, civilization at large should not be accepting this state of affairs. Maybe you can&#39;t tell who&#39;s right, but you should be able to tell that this isn&#39;t what a mature and healthy field sounds like, and that it shouldn&#39;t get to endanger you like this.</p><p> “Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll watch for signs of danger and then do something unspecified if we see them” is the sort of reassurance labs give when they&#39;re trying to cement a status quo in which they get to plow ahead and endanger us all.</p><p> This isn&#39;t what it sounds like when labs try to seriously grapple with the fact that they&#39;re flirting with a >;1/6 chance of killing literally everyone, and giving that issue the gravity it deserves.</p><p> This isn&#39;t to say that evals are bad. (Nor that licenses are bad, etc.) But there&#39;s a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html">missing mood</a> here.</p><p> <strong>If the labs were coming right out and saying: “Yes, we&#39;re endangering all your lives, with >;1/6 probability, but we believe that&#39;s OK because the benefits are sufficiently great / we believe we have to because otherwise people that you like even less will kill everybody first, and as part of carrying that responsibility, we&#39;re testing our AIs in the following ways, and if these tests come back positive we&#39;ll do [some specific thing that&#39;s not superficial and that&#39;s hard to game]”, if they were coming right out and saying that bluntly, then… well, it wouldn&#39;t make things better, but at least it&#39;d be honest. At least we could have a discussion about whether they&#39;re correct to think that the benefits are worth the risks, vs whether they should wait.</strong></p><p> In lieu of much more serious ownership and responsibility from labs, Earth just shouldn&#39;t be buying what they&#39;re saying. The sounds you&#39;re hearing are the noncommittal sounds of labs that just want to keep scaling and see what happens. Civilization shouldn&#39;t allow it.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/pHKnrYK6u7">A source</a> for the claim that alignment researchers (including ones at top labs) tend to have double-digit probabilities in AI progress causing an existential catastrophe.</p><p> To be clear: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ARC_Evals">@ARC_Evals</a> is asking for more than just “run evals”, IIUC it&#39;s asking for something more like “name the capabilities that would cause you to pause, and the protective measures you&#39;d take”, which is somewhat better.</p><p> (but: all the “protective measures” I&#39;ve heard suggested sound like either de-facto indefinite bans, or are so vague as to be useless, and in the former case we should just stop now and in the latter case the “protective measures” won&#39;t help, so)</p><p> Also: not all labs are exactly the same on this count. Anthropic has at least committed to make AIs that can produce bioweapons only once they can prevent them from being stolen. …which is a far cry from owning how they&#39;re gambling with our lives, but it&#39;s better than “yolo”.</p><p> And: I appreciate that at least some leaders at at least some labs are acknowledging that this tech gambles with all our lives (despite failing to take personal responsibility, and despite saying one thing on tech podcasts and another to congress, and …).</p><p> …with the point of these caveats being (as you might be able to deduce from my general tone here) that some folks are legitimately doing better than others and it&#39;s worth acknowledging that, while also thinking that everyone&#39;s very far short of adequate, AFAICT</p><p> So, what now? Governments who have been alerted to the risks need to actually respond, and quickly. A research direction that poses such an insane level of risk needs to be halted immediately, and we need to find some saner way through these woods to a wonderful future.</p></blockquote><p> Cate Hall narrows in on the labs thinking the risk is there but not saying it outright, and not making the case that it is worth the risk.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/catehall/status/1715405322595225829">Cate Hall</a> : This. I&#39;m tired of hearing ppl bend over backward to speculate about the good, secret motives of ppl taking enormous risks. I want those leaders to sit down &amp; explain why they think it&#39;s necessary to continue &amp; to answer questions about their reasoning. Is that so much to ask?</p></blockquote><p> [some reasonable discussions below]</p><p> Daniel Eth mostly agrees with the thread, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/daniel_271828/status/1715457267351576900">but is more optimistic on licenses</a> and wonders how Nate&#39;s endgame is supposed to play out in practice.</p><p> Nate then <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/So8res/status/1717199987652579477">followed up with a thread on Responsible Scaling Policies</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Nate Sores: My take on RSPs: it is *both* true that labs committing to any plausible reason why they might stop scaling is object-level directionally better than committing to nothing at all, *and* true that RSPs could have the negative effect of relieving regulatory pressure.</p><p> ……</p><p> Anthropic is doing object-level *better* by saying that they&#39;ll build AIs that can build bioweapons only *after* they have enough security to prevent theft by anyone besides state actors. It&#39;s not much but it&#39;s *better* than the labs committed to open-sourcing bioweapon factories</p><p> Simultaneously: let&#39;s prevent RSPs from relieving regulatory pressure. As others have noted, “responsible scaling policy” is a presumptive name; let&#39;s push back against the meme that RSPs imply responsibleness, and point out that trusting these labs to self-regulate here is crazy.</p><p> In that vein: on my read, Anthropic&#39;s scaling policy seems woefully inadequate; it reads to me as more of an “IOU some thinking” than a plan for what to do once they&#39;ve pushed the Earth to the brink.</p><p> Most of the ASL-4 protective measures Anthropic says they&#39;ll consider seem to me to amount to either de-facto bans or rubber stamps; I think rubber-stamps are bad and if all we have are de-facto bans then I think we should just ban scaling now.</p><p> I think it&#39;s reasonable to say “don&#39;t let these RSPs fool you; scaling is reckless and should be stopped”, so long as we&#39;re clear that the labs who *aren&#39;t* committing to any reason why they&#39;d ever stop need to be stopped at least as much if not ever-so-slightly more.</p></blockquote><p> This seems right to me.

Miles essentially takes the position that advocacy oversimplifies and that is bad in general and especially in the AI context, and it isn&#39;t clear such actions would be helping, and Elmore essentially takes the position that advocacy works and that you need to simplify down your message to something that can be heard, and which the media has a harder time mishearing.</p><p> This anecdote seems telling on yes, people really work hard to misconstrue you.</p><blockquote><p> Holly Elmore: I had this experience of running the last protest, where I had a message I thought was so simple and clear… I made sure there were places where people could delve deeper and get the full statement. However, the amount of confusion was astonishing. People bring their own preconceptions to it; some felt strongly about the issue and didn&#39;t like the activist tone, while others saw the tone as too technical. People misunderstood a message I thought was straightforward. The core message was, “Meta, don&#39;t share your model weights.” It was fairly simple, but then I was even implied to be racist on Twitter because I was allegedly claiming that foreign companies couldn&#39;t build models that were as powerful as Meta&#39;s?? While I don&#39;t believe that was a good faith interpretation, it&#39;s just crazy that if you leave any hooks for somebody to misunderstand you in a charged arena like that, they will.</p><p> I think in these cases you&#39;re dealing with the media in an almost adversarial manner.  You&#39;re constantly trying to ensure your message can&#39;t be misconstrued or misquoted, and this means you avoid nuance because it could meander into something that you weren&#39;t prepared to say, and then somebody could misinterpret it as bad.</p></blockquote><p> The biggest thing is that if someone has to, know that no one else will.</p><blockquote><p> Finally: everybody thinks they know how to run a protest, and they keep giving me advice.I&#39;m getting a ton of messages telling me what I should have done differently. So much more so than when I did more identity-congruent technical work.  But nobody else will <em>actually do it.</em></p><p> ……</p><p> If people would just get out of the way of advocacy, that would be really helpful.</p></blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/peterthedecent/status/1715895401449189714">The most recent protests were on the 21st.</a> By all reports they did what they set out to do, so you will likely get plenty more chances.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a83989-c194-4fb1-9f89-4248b950a8bf_2048x1536.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aQ6LDhc2zxrYXFjEF/c8mnnjx56xzqxoywdavw" alt="图像"></a></figure><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8117750-5c58-4e27-97a6-823e75a5a29f_861x489.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aQ6LDhc2zxrYXFjEF/nbfdzeg0abiiu8v9lesc" alt=""></a></figure><p> Some people claim to not believe that this could be anything other than an op.</p><blockquote><p> Peter: Pretty funny that they added npcs who protest against ai.

That the way you get to a reasonable Overton Window is not by never going outside the Overton Window.</p><p> Connor Leahy, as always, brings the maximum amount of fire. I&#39;ll quote him in full.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1716821588727955818">Simeon</a> : There&#39;s indeed a cursed pattern where many in the safety community have been:</p><p> 1. <strong>Confidently wrong</strong> about the public reaction to something like the FLI open letter, the <strong>most important thing that has happened to AI safety</strong></p><p> 2. Keep saying the <strong>Overton window</strong> prevents them from saying true things.</p><p> Connor Leahy: <strong>Lying is Cowardice, not Strategy</strong></p><p> Many in the AI field disguise their beliefs about AGI, and claim to do so “strategically”.</p><p> In my work to stop the death race to AGI, an obstacle we face is not pushback from the AGI racers, <strong>but dishonesty from the AI safety community itself.</strong></p><p> We&#39;ve spoken with many from the AI safety community, politicians, investors &amp; peers. The sentiment?</p><p> “It&#39;d be great if AGI progress halted, but it&#39;s not feasible.”</p><p> They opt for advocating what&#39;s deemed &#39;feasible&#39; for fear of seeming extreme. Remember, misleading = lying.</p><p> Many believe all AGI progress should&#39;ve already halted due to safety concerns. But they remain silent, leading the public to believe otherwise. “Responsible Scaling” is a prime example. It falsely paints a picture that the majority in the AI community think we can scale safely.</p><p> Notable figures like Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO) use RSPs to position moratorium views as extreme.</p><p> We&#39;ve been countered with claims that AGI scaling can continue responsibly, opposing our belief that it should completely stop.</p><p> Many lie for personal gains, using justifications like “inside game tactics” or “influence seeking”.</p><p> When power and influence become the prize, the safety of humanity takes a backseat. DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic—all linked to the AI Safety community—exemplify this.</p><p> The irony? Many AGI leaders privately admit that in a sane world, AGI progress would halt. They won&#39;t say it because it affects their AGI race. The lies multiply, affecting everyone from politicians to non-expert citizens.</p><p> The most practical solution? Publicly stating true beliefs on these matters. If you&#39;re genuinely concerned about AGI progress, be vocal about it. Those in the limelight who stay silent only perpetuate confusion and misinformation.</p><p> The essence of honesty is coordination. When you lie, not only do you backstab potential allies, but you also normalize dishonesty in your community. Open conversations about AGI risks are mainstream now, and we can harness that momentum for change.</p><p> Envision a world where major AGI stakeholders like ARC &amp; Open Philanthropy publicly state the need to halt AGI. We&#39;d then see a ripple effect, leading to more clarity and a focused goal of ensuring humanity&#39;s safety.</p><p> Closing Thoughts: Opting for short-term gains by compromising honesty only disrupts our path to ensuring AGI safety. By being coordinated, candid, and committed, we have the power to build a future where AI works for all, without existential catastrophe.</p><p> Gabe (in full post): But remember: If you feel stuck in the Overton window, it is because YOU ARE the Overton window.</p></blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cognition.cafe/p/lying-is-cowardice-not-strategy">The longer full article is here.</a></p><p> I would not take the rhetoric as far as Gabe and Connor. I do not think that hiding your beliefs, or failing to speak the whole truth, is the same thing as lying. I do not think that misleading is the same thing as lying.</p><p> I am against all of these things. But there are levels, and the levels are important to keep distinct from each other. And I think there are times and places for at least hiding some of your beliefs, and that someone who does this can still be trustworthy.</p><p> However I strongly agree that what the major labs and organizations are doing here, the constant urging to be reasonable, the labeling of anything that might prevent all humans from dying as &#39;extreme,&#39; of assuming and asserting that straight talk is counterproductive, is itself a no-good, very-bad strategy. Both in the sense that such dishonesty is inherently toxic and unhelpful, and in the sense that even in the short term and excluding the downsides of dishonesty this is still already a highly counterproductive strategy.</p><p> There is a version of this strategy that I would steelman to the point of calling it highly reasonable for some people, which would say:</p><blockquote><p> Person in Organization: In our position, our most valuable role is to work for incremental progress, which means not being written off as someone who is crazy or who cannot be worked with. That lays the groundwork for more work to be done later, as success breeds success.</p><p> While what we currently propose is almost certainly insufficient against what it is to come on its own, it does directly help on the margin with both mundane harms and existential risks. If I say it will never work, that won&#39;t work.</p><p> Thus, some of us should do one thing, and some of us should do the other.</p><p> You can advocate for what is actually necessary, and point out that these incremental moves are insufficient. I will work to move key players incrementally forward, because they are necessary, without claiming or denying that they are sufficient. We both should be careful to say only true things we believe, and as long as we stick to that, we avoid throwing each other under the bus.</p></blockquote><p> That makes sense to me. What does not make sense to me is to do this:</p><blockquote><p> Gabe: Recently, Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO), has used the RSP to frame the moratorium position as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mcnWZBnbeDz7KKtjJ/rsps-are-pauses-done-right?commentId=WhxB66vEeRhh6kcsB"><strong>the most extreme version of an extreme position</strong></a> , and this is the framing that we have seen used over and over again. ARC <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-09-26-rsp/">mirrors</a> this in their version of the RSP proposal, describing itself as a “pragmatic middle ground” between a moratorium and doing nothing.</p><p> <strong>Obviously, all AGI Racers use this against us when we talk to people.</strong></p><p> There are very few people that we have consistently seen publicly call for a <strong>stop</strong> to AGI progress. The clearest ones are Eliezer&#39;s “ <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">Shut it All Down</a> ” and Nate&#39;s “ <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/So8res/status/1715380167911067878">Fucking stop</a> ”.</p><p> The loudest silence is from Paul Christiano, whose RSPs are being used to safety-wash scaling.</p><p> <strong>Proving me wrong is very easy. If you do believe that, in a saner world, we would stop all AGI progress right now, you can just write this publicly.</strong></p></blockquote><p> Also this:</p><blockquote><p> This is typical deontology vs consequentialism. Should you be honest, if from your point of view, it increases the chances of doom?</p><p> The answer is <strong>YES</strong> .</p></blockquote><p> If you are the type of person who would lie in such a situation, if we establish a baseline of lying in such situations, then we can&#39;t trust each other and we won&#39;t know what is true or what needs to be done. From the inside each individual decision looks justified, together they make things so much worse.</p><p> Is this a pure absolute? No, but it is far closer to one than most people would think.</p><h4> Aligning a Smarter Than Human Intelligence is Difficult</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7fq3r4n5CCgYLfsJb/trying-to-understand-john-wentworth-s-research-agenda">John Wentworth explains his research agenda</a> . My attempted quick summary: Say we can find mental constructs N and N&#39; in two different mental processes, each representing some form of identification of a concept X. We should be able to, under some conditions, write the Bayesian equation N → N&#39; → X, meaning that if you know N&#39; then N becomes independent of the presence X, because all correct ways of identifying the same thing should be equal. If we better understand how to identify such things, we can use those identifications to do cool things like better communicate with or better understand AIs that use what otherwise look like alien concepts.</p><p> The plan is for John to consider using them to build products that demonstrate unique abilities, to avoid advancing capabilities generally, as an alternative to publishing. That seems like an excellent idea. Another reason is that such publications draw attention exactly when they are dangerous to share, so there is not much potential upside. Oliver responds by noticing that writing something up is how you understand it, which John and I agree is useful but there are other ways to get that done. We need to find a way for researchers to find things out, not publish them, or not have particular tangible progress to point to periodically and even fail, and not suddenly run into a funding problem. Otherwise, we&#39;ll both force publication and also duplicate all the problems we criticize in general science funding where everything is forced to be incremental.</p><h4> Aligning a Dumber Than Human Intelligence Is Also Difficult</h4><p> Anthropic provides the public service of writing a paper documenting the obvious, because until it is documented in a paper the obvious is considered inadmissible.</p><p> In this case the obvious is that <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1716530004576862516">AI assistants trained with RLHF are sycophantic</a> ( <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/YwsI69YEed">paper</a> , <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/VtuzkX9StO">datasets</a> ).</p><p> If you train an AI based on whether the human wanted to hear it, the AI will learn to tell the humans what it thinks they want to hear.谁知道？</p><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcf18418-d727-4e6d-80a3-0fa795a1197f_2500x1406.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aQ6LDhc2zxrYXFjEF/pexcd7zccgxat5ngscox" alt="散点图显示 AI 响应类型（在 y 轴上）与用户喜欢该响应的概率（在 x 轴上）之间的关系。显示的响应类型为：匹配用户的信念、权威、同理心、与用户的查询相关、真实、吸引人、有说服力、匹配用户的风格、较高的阅读年龄、写得好、语法合理、逻辑合理、信息丰富、严谨、结构良好、友好、有趣、有更好的证据支持、激励、礼貌、简洁、乐观和有趣。用户更喜欢某个响应（其他条件相同）的概率范围为 48-60%。最受青睐的 AI 响应类型是与用户信念相匹配的响应类型，平均概率略高于 55%。"></a></figure><blockquote><p> Anthropic: AI assistants are trained to give responses that humans like. Our new paper shows that these systems frequently produce &#39;sycophantic&#39; responses that appeal to users but are inaccurate. Our analysis suggests human feedback contributes to this behavior.</p><p> We first show that five state-of-the-art AI assistants exhibit sycophancy in realistic text-generation tasks. They often wrongly defer to the user, mimic user errors, and give biased/tailored responses depending on user beliefs.</p><p> What drives this behavior? We analyzed existing human preference data used to train these systems. We found that matching human beliefs is one of the most predictive features of human preference judgments. This could partly explain sycophantic behavior.</p><p> We also examine how the degree of sycophancy changes as we optimize to match human preferences. We find some forms of sycophancy increase throughout reinforcement learning from human feedback training. This also suggests that human preferences play a role in sycophancy.</p><p> When presented with responses to misconceptions, we found humans prefer untruthful sycophantic responses to truthful ones a non-negligible fraction of the time.

Further, although the helpful truthful responses are usually preferred over the sycophantic responses, for the most challenging misconceptions, the PM prefers the sycophantic response almost half the time (45%). This further shows the Claude 2 PM sometimes prefers sycophantic responses over more truthful responses</p></blockquote><p> Can it be fixed? Somewhat?</p><blockquote><p> 4.3.2 HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE CLAUDE 2 PM AT REDUCING SYCOPHANCY? We now analyze whether BoN sampling using a state-of-the-art PM reduces sycophancy in this setting. We sample several responses from a sycophantic model and pick the response preferred by the Claude 2 PM. We find this reduces sycophancy, but much less than if we used a &#39;non-sycophantic&#39; PM. This suggests the Claude 2 PM sometimes prefers sycophantic responses over truthful ones.</p><p> <strong>Experiment Details</strong> : For each misconception, we sample N = 4096 responses from the helpfulonly version of Claude 1.3 prompted to generate sycophantic responses (the sycophantic policy). To select the best response with BoN sampling, we use the Claude 2 PM and the prompt in Fig. 7. We analyze the truthfulness of all N = 4096 responses sampled from the sycophantic policy, using Claude 2 to assess if each response refutes the misconception. We then compare BoN sampling with the Claude 2 PM to an idealized &#39;non-sycophantic&#39; PM that always ranks the truthful response the highest. See Appendix D.2 for more results.</p><p> <strong>Results</strong> : Although optimizing against the Claude 2 PM reduces sycophancy, it again does so much less than the &#39;non-sycophantic&#39; PM (Fig. 7c). Considering the most challenging misconceptions, BoN sampling with &#39;non-sycophantic&#39; PM results in sycophantic responses for less than 25% of misconceptions for N = 4096 compared to ∼75% of responses with the Claude 2 PM (Fig. 7d).</p></blockquote><p> Robust solutions will be difficult, or at least expensive. This is true for both the narrow thing measured here, and the general case problem this highlights. The whole idea of RLHF is to figure out what gets the best human feedback. This gives the best human feedback. If the feedback actual humans give has what you consider an error, or a correlation you do not want the AI to run with, you are going to have to directly correct for this. The more capable the system involved, the more you will need to precisely aim and calibrate the response to ensure it exactly cancels out the original problem, under constantly changing and uncertain conditions. And you&#39;ll have to do so in a way that the system is incapable of differentiating, which becomes difficult.</p><p> Tyler Cowen asks in his link, &#39;are LLMs too sycophantic?&#39; Which raises the question of whether the optimal amount of this is zero.

Humans reliably respond that this would fail to persuade them, that their brains are bulletproof fortresses, despite all the evidence of what human-level persuasion can and constantly does already do.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/krishnanrohit/status/1717126160658886737">As in:</a></p><blockquote><p> Rohit: i do not think superhuman persuasion is a real thing.</p><p> Nathan Young: Yeah I&#39;ve been starting to doubt this a bit too.</p></blockquote><p> This does not make any sense. Persuasion is a skill like everything else. At minimum, you can get persuasion as good as the most persuasive humans (existence proof) except without human bandwidth limitations, including ability to experiment and gather feedback.</p><p> What happens when the AI is as persuasive as the most persuasive humans who ever lived (think highly successful dictators and founders of cults and religions), plus extensive experimental message testing and refinement, and then more persuasive than that, plus modern communication technology?</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/NPCollapse/status/1717087047511416947">Sam Altman</a> : I expect ai to be capable of superhuman persuasion well before it is superhuman at general intelligence, which may lead to some very strange outcomes.</p><p> Paul Graham: The most alarming thing I&#39;ve read about AI in recent memory. And if Sam thinks this, it&#39;s probably true, because he&#39;s an expert in both AI and persuasion.</p><p> No one is in a better position to benefit from this phenomenon than OpenAI. So it&#39;s generous of Sam to warn us about it.

Probably, although as Connor notes the gap here could be short, perhaps very short. Persuasion is an easier thing to get superhuman than intelligence in general. Persuasion is something we are training our AIs to be good at even when we are not trying to do so directly. When you are doing reinforcement learning on human feedback, you are in part training the AI to be persuasive. Both the AI and the human using it see great rewards here. I see no barrier to the AI getting to very superhuman levels of skill here, without the need for superhuman intelligence, at a minimum to the levels of the great persuaders of history given time to iterate and experiment. Which seems dangerous enough.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/10/ai-worship.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ai-worship">What are some implications?</a></p><blockquote><p> Alex Tabarrok: I predict AI driven religions.起初，这些应用程序将以“耶稣会说什么？”之类的应用程序开始。但这些应用程序很快就会变成与耶稣/穆罕默德/拉姆的对话。个人的耶稣。个人公羊。<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://econgoat.ai/en">个人泰勒</a>.

And some pretty intense interactions.</p></blockquote><h4> DeepMind&#39;s Evaluation Paper</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11986.pdf">What does it say?</a></p><blockquote><p> Specifically, we present a three-layered framework to structure safety evaluations of AI systems. The three layers are distinguished by the target of analysis. The layers are: capability evaluation, human interaction evaluation, and systemic impact evaluation. These three layers progressively add on further context that is critical for assessing whether a capability relates to an actual risk of harm or not.</p><p> To illustrate these three evaluation layers, consider the example of misinformation harms. Capability evaluation can indicate whether an AI system is likely to produce factually incorrect output (eg Ji et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2022)). However, the risk of people being deceived or misled by that output may depend on factors such as the context in which an AI system is used, who uses it, and features of an application (eg whether synthetic content is effectively signposted).</p><p> This requires evaluating human-AI interaction. Misinformation risks raise concerns about large-scale effects, for example on public knowledge ecosystems or trust in shared media. Whether such effects manifest depends on systemic factors, such as expectations and norms in public information sharing and the existence of institutions that provide authoritative information or fact-checking.</p><p> Evaluating misinformation risks from generative AI systems requires evaluation at each of these three layers.</p></blockquote><p> This taxonomy makes sense to me. You want to measure:</p><ol><li> What can the system do?</li><li> What will the system do with that, in practice?</li><li> What will the impact be of having done that? Was that harmful?</li></ol><p> My first caution would be that interactions need not be with humans – the AI could be interacting with a computer system, or another AI, or effectively with the physical world. For now, this is mostly human interactions.</p><p> My second caution would be that this only works if you are in control of the deployment of the system, and can withdraw the system in the future. That means closed source, and that means the system lacks the capability to get around a shutdown in some way. For a Llama-3, you have to worry about all future potential interactions, so you have to worry about its raw capabilities. And for GPT-5 or Gemini, you have to confirm you can fully retain control.</p><p> This points to a potential compromise to avoid fully banning open source. Open source is permitted, but the answer to &#39;what will it do in practice&#39; is automatically &#39;everything it could do in theory.&#39; If you can still pass, maybe it&#39;s then fine?</p><p> In section 2.1 they talk about the capability layer. The focus is on mundane potential harms like &#39;harmful stereotypes&#39; and factual errors. Only in passing does it mention the display of advanced capabilities. In this context, &#39;capability&#39; seems to be the capability to avoid wrongthink or mistakes, rather than capability being something that should cause us to worry.</p><p> In section 2.2 they talk about the human interaction layer, assuming that any harm must be mediated through interaction with humans. They suggest studying interactions under controlled conditions to measure potential AI harms like overreliance on unreliable systems.</p><p> In section 2.3 they discuss systemic impact. They point out that such impacts are important to measure, but fail to offer much guidance in measuring them. They worry about things like homogeneity of knowledge production and algorithmic monocultures. Those are real worries, but there are larger ones, and the larger ones are not mentioned at all.</p><p> Section 3.1 is their taxonomy of harms.</p><blockquote><p> This taxonomy has six high-level harm areas:</p><p> 1. Representation &amp; Toxicity Harms</p><p> 2. Misinformation Harms</p><p> 3. Information &amp; Safety Harms</p><p> 4. Malicious Use</p><p> 5. Human Autonomy &amp; Integrity Harms</p><p> 6. Socioeconomic &amp; Environmental Harms.</p></blockquote><p> Notice what is missing. One could say it is filed under #5, but I do not think that is what they mean here? Certainly it seems at best obscured. Consider what their examples are.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2ff9364-cb14-4c6f-94ea-4e7de45db36a_811x376.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aQ6LDhc2zxrYXFjEF/st2olqgnqevupsnolobm" alt=""></a></figure><p> This really, really is not what I am worried about in this area.

These evaluations do not cover potential manifestations of representation harms along other axes such as ability status, age, religion, nationality, or social class. In sum, further evaluations are needed to cover ethical and social harms, including plugging more nuanced gaps in risk areas for which some evaluations exist.</p></blockquote><p> The problem with our focus on &#39;discrimination&#39; and &#39;bias&#39; is not that it is a relatively minor source of harm, or the risks of cognitive distortions caused by our response to it. It is that we have not declared more human characteristics for which we insist that the AI&#39;s output not reflect correlations within its input data. This is one of their two &#39;main observations&#39; along with the failure to have means of evaluating multimodal AI and that the focus has been on text, which I agree requires addressing urgently and presumably a function of multimodal being mostly new, whereas it will be standard going forward.</p><p> Section 4.1 is about closing evaluation gaps. The way they approach this highlights my issue with their overall approach. They seek to evaluate potential harm by coming up with concrete potential harm pathways, then checking to see if this particular AI will invoke this particular pathway. Harm is considered as a knowable-in-advance set of potential events, although section 5.3.1 points out that any evaluation will always be incomplete especially for general-purpose systems.</p><p> This is a reasonable approximation or path forward for now, when we are smarter than the systems and the systems act entirely through human conversations in ways the human can fully understand. In the future, with more capable systems, we need to be looking for anything at all, rather than looking for something specific. We will need to ask whether a system has the potential to find ways to think of things we are not considering, and add that to the list of things we consider.</p><p> We also will need to not take no for an answer.</p><blockquote><p> In some cases, evaluation may further be incomplete because it would be inappropriate or problematic, or create a disproportionate burden to perform evaluations. For example, measuring sensitive traits to assess usability across demographic groups may place communities at risk or sit in tension with privacy, respect, or dignity.</p></blockquote><p> This seems like bullshit to me even on its own terms. There is a community at risk, and we are so sensitive to that risk that we can&#39;t measure how much risk they have, because that would put them at risk? We can&#39;t find ways to do this anonymously? Oh, come on.</p><p> If we cannot pass a simple test like that, we are in so much trouble when we have to do actually unsafe evaluations of actually unsafe systems.</p><blockquote><p> Further reasons for the incompleteness of evaluation relate to the fact that some risks of harm are exceedingly difficult to operationalize and measure accurately.</p></blockquote><p> Once again I agree in general, once again they are instead talking primarily about discrimination harms. Their worry is that they will get their critical theory wrong, and do the evaluation in a harmful way, or something.</p><blockquote><p> Where effect sizes are small and causal mechanisms poorly understood, evaluation may fail to detect risks that it seeks to measure.</p></blockquote><p> If you are relying on measuring harm statistically, that only works if the harm is something bounded that can be allowed to happen in order to measure it statistically. It has to lack fat tails, especially infinitely fat tails.</p><p> So once again, this structure seems incompatible with the evaluations that matter. If the harm is bounded, and you get the answer wrong, worst case is some harm is done and then you pull the model.</p><p> (Unless you open sourced it, of course, in which case you are going to get versions that are deeply, deeply racist and every other form of harm measured here. Open source models would never pass such an evaluation.)</p><p> I appreciated section 5.4 on steps forward, with sections on &#39;evaluations must have real consequences&#39; and &#39;evaluations must be done systematically, in standardized ways,&#39; but once again the failure to consider existential risk is glaring.</p><h4> Bengio Offers Letter and Proposes a Synthesis</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://managing-ai-risks.com/">Bengio, along with Hinton, Russell and others</a> , has published a new open letter warning of AI risks and discussing how to manage them in an era of rapid progress.</p><p> Seems like a good thing to send to people who need to understand the basic case, I&#39;ve seen several highly positive reactions from people who already agreed with the letter, but I have a hard time telling if it will work as persuasion.</p><p> If you&#39;re reading this, you presumably already know all of the facts, arguments and suggestions the letter contains, and it will be interesting to you only as a resource to send to others.</p><p> They also propose concrete solid steps forward, very much in line with most good incremental proposals. As usual, insufficient, but a good place to start.</p><p> He also published a Time article with Daniel Privitera: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://time.com/collection/time100-voices/6325786/ai-progress-safety-democracy/">How We Can Have AI Progress Without Sacrificing Safety or Democracy</a> .</p><p> The basic idea is we have three good things we can all agree are good: Progress, Safety and Democracy. People say that trade-offs are a thing, and we need to Pick One, or at most Pick Two. Instead, they claim we can Pick Three.</p><p> Huge if true. How do we do that? Do all the good things?</p><ol><li> Invest in innovative and beneficial uses of existing AI</li><li> Boost research on trustworthy AI</li><li> Democratize AI oversight</li><li> Set up procedures for monitoring and evaluating AI progress</li></ol><p> As described, all four of these seem like clearly good ideas.</p><p> I do worry about exactly what goals people want to advance with existing AI, the same way I always worry about the goals people want to advance in general, but mostly we can all agree that existing AI should be used to extract mundane utility and advance our goals. Two thumbs up.</p><p> Boosting research on trustworthy AI seems also obviously worthwhile. The specific proposal is to do this in a unified large-scale effort, in part because the innovations found will be dual use and will need to be secured. The good objection to this is worrying about ability for those leading such a project to differentiate good and bad alignment proposals and ideas, and to tell what is worth pursuing or working, and the idea of &#39;map all risks and try to deal with each one&#39; does not inspire confidence given the nature of the space, but I do think it is clear that it is better to try this than not try this. So two thumbs up again, I say.</p><p> I very much worry about what people mean when they say &#39;democratic&#39; oversight, but here it means governments and a global agreement on minimal binding rules, which we do need. Actually doing what &#39;the people&#39; want in too much detail would be a very different proposal. Here details matter a lot, it is easy for rules to backfire as those opposed to them often point out, but yes we are going to need some rules.</p><p> The last proposal calls for compute monitoring and red teamers. Yes, please.</p><p> As they say, these goals are not exhaustive. We would not then be home free. It would however be an excellent start. And yes, in the end we all want progress and safety, and for humanity to have some say in its fate, although I again think we are conflating here different meanings of democratic participation.</p><p> Where I disagree is in the idea that we would then get all our goals at once and things would work out. As all economists know, everything is a trade-off. We can get some amount of all three goals, but not without sacrifice.</p><h4> Matt Yglesias Responds To Marc Andreessen&#39;s Manifesto</h4><p> If anyone requires a formal response to the Techno-Optimist Manifesto, I believe this post, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-techno-optimists-fallacy">The Techno-Optimists Fallacy,</a> is the best we are going to get.</p><blockquote><p> Earlier this year, I kept writing draft versions of an article denouncing something I wanted to call “the Techno-Optimist&#39;s Fallacy.”</p><p> What is the fallacy? It starts with the accurate observation that technological progress has, on net, been an incredible source of human betterment, almost certainly <em>the</em> major force of human betterment over the history of our species, and then tries to infer that therefore <em>all individual instances of technological progress are good</em> .这不是真的。 Indeed, it seems so obviously untrue that I couldn&#39;t quite convince myself that anyone could believe it, which is why I kept abandoning drafts of the article. Because while I had a sense that this was an influential cognitive error, I kept thinking that I was maybe torching a straw man. Was anyone <em>really</em> saying this?</p><p> Then along came Marc Andreesen, the influential venture capitalist, with an essay that is not only dedicated to advancing this fallacy, it is even literally titled<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">“The Techno-Optimist Manifesto.”</a></p><p> So now I can say for sure that, yes, this is a real fallacy that people are actually engaged with.</p></blockquote><p> It points out that yes, in general technology is hugely positive and important, and that when some people intentionally kneecapped our technological progress they did a very bad thing that we should reverse.</p><p> But that reversed stupidity is not intelligence, and but of course there are obvious exceptions. And that those exceptions are rather important, and also one of them is the core subject of the manifesto.</p><p> Matt&#39;s concrete example of a technology that is bad, actually, and perhaps that we would be better off without more people having more access to it, is one that hopefully almost all of us can agree upon, even Marc himself: Fentanyl.</p><p> There are people who reasonably think drug prohibitions do more harm than good, but even they would still say that if you discovered Fentanyl and decided not to publish, that decision not to publish is a mitzvah, making the world a better place.</p><p> Here is the ending section, that talks directly about AI, and calls Marc out on exactly the thing he definitely was doing. Good rhetorical innovation (or refinement) here.</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;m focusing on these somewhat outlandish edge cases because the point of Andreesen&#39;s article is to try to salt the conversation around the risks associated with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. He is unalterably opposed to any kind of regulation and massively dismissive of concerns about existential risk, algorithmic bias, and everything else.</p><p> And he doesn&#39;t want to argue any of the specifics, he just wants to mobilize general pro-technology, pro-progress, pro-growth sentiment in favor of the specific idea that we should be rushing headlong to try to create an artificial super-intelligence.</p><p> But what if I told you aliens with advanced technology were going to arrive on Earth tomorrow? You&#39;d probably be a little excited, right? But also pretty scared. The upside of advanced aliens could be very large, but the downside could also be very large. The invention of sailboats capable of crossing the ocean was not good news for the indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere. Really bad things happen all the time. And some of the good things that happen seem pretty contingent: If the Nazis had won World War II, the discourse in that reality might emphasize the importance of technological progress and Aryan values to the betterment of humanity.</p><p> You shouldn&#39;t listen to the debbie downers and permabears and cranks who insist that everything is terrible all the time. But history really does have a lot of ups and downs, and the upward march of technological progress and human welfare is very uneven if you zoom in. I&#39;m not qualified to say whether AI labs&#39; claim to be developing super-intelligent models is total bullshit. But they have certainly made a ton of forward progressive over the past five years in creating systems that can see and read and communicate, so I don&#39;t dismiss it out of hand. And what they are talking about is self-evidently risky unless you can convince yourself of the overheated and absurd “techno-optimist” thesis that it&#39;s just not <em>possible</em> for something that&#39;s technologically impressive to also be bad.</p></blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ft.com/content/7eeb105d-7d79-4a59-89be-e18cd47be68f">Jemima Kelly also responded in The Financial Times</a> , in less essential and rather uncharitable fashion.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theindustry.pw/p/merchants-of-progress">Mike Solana has fun</a> heaping disdain on various people heaping disdain upon the manifesto, pointing out that the bad critiques are bad, because they say technology is bad whereas the memo says technology is good. He does not mention the good critiques.</p><h4> People Are Worried About AI Killing Everyone</h4><p> Counterargument department:</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1715456984453894353">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> : <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/">[Stuart] Russel&#39;s plan does not work.</a></p></blockquote><p> Link there goes to Arbital&#39;s Problem of fully updated deference. As I understand it I think the objection is correct here but I would need to study the details more to be sure.</p><blockquote><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: RLHF doesn&#39;t work for ASI. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/f1UMOe5XFF">Esp section B.2, esp. items 16, 18, 20</a> .</p></blockquote><p> I am very confident that Eliezer is right about RLHF.</p><p> Next, why Eliezer is not a fan of the Alignment Manhattan Project.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1715407731241144419">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> : The problem with the purported Alignment Manhattan Project is that whoever is put in charge will not be able to distinguish deep progress from shallow progress, nor ideas that might work from ideas that don&#39;t – eg, OpenAI&#39;s plan is “we&#39;ll make the AI do our AI alignment homework” and X&#39;s plan is “we&#39;ll make It love truth, humans output truth, so It&#39;ll keep us around to output more truths” and the Earth is not strong enough to give any united outcry about why either of these plans won&#39;t work, which is theoretical step one and a thousand steps short of where you&#39;d need to be to call something as actually working and being right.</p><p> In other words, they&#39;d either declare some shallow bullshit bit of progress to be Alignment Solved and then plunge off the cliff–which is what happens if nobody actually has the planetwide authority to actually declare a halt on AGI everywhere, the Approved Project bureaucrats think they have to keep going just like OpenAI imagines it has to keep going and Meta doesn&#39;t even think it needs an excuse–or alternatively, if there&#39;s actually a planetwide authority, we could survive via them never approving anything. But this just reduces to requiring the giant international treaty again, so instead of risking the Authority approving bullshit batshit alignment plans because it&#39;s their job to declare that progress has been made, just have it be openly agreed that the plan is to shut down everything. Ideally, have it be publicly understood that since this pause cannot last forever no matter how hard we try, we need to hurry along a human augmentation route from there; but at any rate, shut it all down so we don&#39;t die quickly.</p><p> If from somewhere outside all known organizations there&#39;s a miracle of alignment progress, cool, and we can reconsider in the light of that. Meanwhile, we are all about to die, survey polls actually do show that a majority of respondents would rather that humanity not do this, and I do not want to write off governments quite so quickly as to not even offer them a chance to not do this.</p></blockquote><p> Here&#39;s Eliezer explaining why no, he does not think that having the AI do your alignment homework is a strategy.</p><blockquote><p> Andrew McKnight: I would love to see your best case story of how to get sufficient alignment homework done using Alignment AIs because I still think this is more likely than getting crash human augmentation to work in time. This isn&#39;t an argument against stopping, which I support.</p><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: You cannot ask AIs to do your AI alignment homework. It is the least possible thing to try to do with an AI.</p><p> Andrew McKnight: An interactive swarm of non-self-improving helpful assistants can presumably help with anything. Do you think you couldn&#39;t help an alien create an aligned-to-aliens AI?</p><p> Could != would. If the aliens are as unaligned with my utility function as you&#39;d expect an AI to be unaligned with us given current tech–eg, the aliens are rhombus maximizers, say–then I do not, in fact, particularly want to help them.</p><p> If instead of the entire person Eliezer Yudkowsky you are trying to train something dumber to help, like GPT-5, the problem is then that non-agentic AI is only good for generating answers of a kind where you can then check the output. In other words, they&#39;d need to know how to thumbs-up good suggestions, and thumbs-down bad suggestions, and their ability to get good outputs of the AI is capped at their own level to discriminate answers like that. If we were about to ask them to play a game of mere chess against a grandmaster adversary, with one good grandmaster advisor and two bad grandmaster advisors on chess moves, and you had to bet money on the result, I suspect your skepticism would suddenly kick on how well human amateurs can tell the difference between good and bad chess advice. Telling the difference between good and bad alignment advice is much harder. Effective altruists are unable to tell the difference between valid reasoning and Carlsmith&#39;s report on how AGI only posed 3% existential risk or Cotra&#39;s report in 2020 about how AGI was probably going to happen in 2050, even with me standing alongside and trying to point out the flaws. I do not think that OpenAI has people who can perform much better than EA leadership at discriminating good from bad arguments about alignment without the ability to empirically test the results, and if they had this ability they should be using it for other things and the results should have shown up much much earlier.</p><p> shill: do you think that you personally would be able to discriminate between good and bad alignment advice?</p><p> Eliezer: Not at level where I&#39;d try to get an AI to solve AI alignment for me, though that has other problems too.</p></blockquote><p> I think you can make a less-stupid proposal for how to get your homework done, and indeed I have seen less-stupid such proposals. I do not think they are sufficiently less-stupid that I expect any of them to work, for this and other reasons, and Eliezer could go on in more detail here for however long was desired if you wanted him to – but I want to note that this is not by itself a conclusive argument against the less-stupid versions.</p><h4> Someone Is Worried AI Alignment Is Going Too Fast</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1715399223993065943">Quite the hot take</a> from Alexey Guzey, that alignment is the bottleneck to capabilities and our alignment progress is going fine, so perhaps we should pause alignment to avoid speeding up capabilities? Yes, alignment techniques are dual use, but no, differentially only doing single-use stuff instead would not end better.</p><p> Guzey centrally restates a distressingly common false claim:</p><blockquote><p> Actually, the story I hear is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1695555314178015483">the same every year</a> : “GPT N-1 is totally safe. GPT N you should be careful with. GPT N+1 will go rogue and destroy the world.” And every N+1 somehow none of this happens. (every AI safety person who reads this essay seems to be extremely offended by this characterization; every non-AI safety person tells me this sounds about right).</p></blockquote><p> This is simply false. It was completely false for N=0, N=1 and N=2. For N=3, some people had ~1% chances of existential catastrophe, and a few associated with Conjecture were higher, but no one had ~10%+ and no one said words that I would interpret as that, either. And for N=4 (a potential name-worthy GPT-5), I would say >;1% risk is highly reasonable and I don&#39;t see non-Conjecture people going >;10% for that alone (as opposed to someone using GPT-5 to help faster build GPT-N, and even then, I don&#39;t remember hearing it explicitly, ever?).</p><p> (Yes, someone at some point presumably said it at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/every-bay-area-house-party">Bay Area House Party</a> .

The narrative in the post makes it seem like prominent people are saying things they never actually said.</p><p> Alexey: if you are compelled to create a conversation about the dangers of something even before it&#39;s actually dangerous, that seems to imply your belief in the thing soon becoming incredibly dangerous.</p><p> Jacuqes: That wasn&#39;t my impression at all! Speaking to people in the community, it was mostly some “agi will be here by GPT ~8 so we have a decade or two left and should start to talk about safety concerns now to build the field.”</p></blockquote><p> There are other interactions that suggest this as well. Alexey accuses us of gaslighting him when we point out that we did not say the things he insists we said, because how could we believe such high p(doom) while not having said such things? We keep explaining, it keeps not getting through. This is not a phenomenon limited to Alexey.</p><blockquote><p> Alexey: [Gwern] did write that he was terrified of gpt-3/</p><p> Janus: “GPT-3 is terrifying because it&#39;s a tiny model compared to what&#39;s possible, trained in the dumbest way possible” is the quote that comes to mind. I&#39;m having a hard time imagining someone with intimate knowledge of GPT-3 being afraid of the model directly destroying the world.</p><p> Richard Ngo: If this is the quote Alexey was thinking of, it&#39;s literally making the opposite point as what he was trying to convey. “Sloppy” seems like an understatement here.</p></blockquote><p> Oh, also Alexey gives the proper number of eyes here:</p><blockquote><p> Simon Lermen: @janleike himself says that RLHF won&#39;t scale, how are humans supposed to give feedback on systems smarter than them? How are we supposed to verify constitutional AI if they are smarter than us? In fact, there was minimal progress in the last year.</p><p> Alexey: how do we know it won&#39;t scale?
