S，都有一个称为“S 进化”的谱系进化，从第一个生命形式，沿着 S 所在的分支，沿着生命的系统发育树，通过 S 的每个祖先物种，直到 S 本身。<br><br> “人”也有两种含义。 “人类”可以指人类个体，也可以指整个人类。<br><br>我读到的原始论点是这样说的：人类进化（谱系进化的一个实例）选择了生物体的 IGF。也就是说，在人类进化的每一步中，人类进化都促进了创造人类（或人类祖先物种生物体）的基因，这些基因擅长使该生物体中的基因在下一代中更加常见。如今，大多数个体人类并不会做出任何明确、偏执地试图推广自己基因的事情。因此，这是一个错位的例子。<br><br>我认为，虽然我还很不确定，但雅各布实际上基本上同意这一点。我想雅各布想说的是<br><br>1. 人性是失调问题的正确主题；<br> 2. 一般进化论是正确的主题；<br> 3. 人类与普遍进化论非常一致，因为人类有很多，而普遍进化论希望有一些模式可以创造出许多人。<br><br>我目前的主要回复是：<br><br>一般进化不是合适的主题，因为设计人类的绝大多数优化能力都是人类进化。</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author

20W不可逆计算机的功率）。我已经在我们的私人讨论中提出了一个具体的例子，即个人会付出巨大的努力来最大限度地成功捐献精子，即使他们的报酬微不足道，或者根本没有报酬，在某些情况下实际上犯下了长期监禁的重罪。这样做（强烈反付费）。此外，大脑<i>通常的</i>工作方式更接近于神秘地潜意识地迫使你针对 IGF 进行优化——以埃隆·马斯克为例：他正朝着非常高的 IGF

等）指定，该代码指定初始架构先验以及用于更新这些权重（SGD）的高效近似贝叶斯学习算法。主要区别在于，对于技术进化而言，编码单元（技术模因）的重组比基因更加灵活。每个新实验都可以灵活地组合来自大量先前论文/实验的模因，这是一个由人类智能引导的过程（内部优化）。主要效果只是巨大的加速——与先进的基因工程相似但更极端。</p><p>我认为这确实是最有信息性的类比。从这个类比中，我想我们可以这样说：<br><br>在某种程度上，AGI

之间，但这显然仍然是一个高 p(doom) 场景。我确实认为这种情况不太可能发生，原因有很多（简而言之，允许人类工程师选择成功的模因变化的因素远远高于机会，同样的因素也充当了一个隐藏的伟大过滤器，减少了技术设计中的失败方差），但这是一个我已经在其他地方进行了部分争论。</p><p>因此，进化成功地协调人类的一个关键因素是大量人口的方差减少效应，这直接映射到多极情景。群体几乎总是比最坏情况甚至中位数个体更加对齐，并且即使几乎每个个体都几乎完全错位（正交），群体也可以完美对齐。方差减少对于大多数成功的优化算法（包括

GMT<br/><br/><p>在<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skRgYH7oAjc"><u>蒙克关于人工智能风险的辩论的开场发言中，</u></a>梅兰妮·米切尔提出了一个通用人工智能风险的例子：一个负责解决气候变化的通用人工智能可能会决定消除人类作为碳排放源的可能性。她说：</p><blockquote><p>这是所谓的“愚蠢的超级智能谬误”的一个例子。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefs793uam9h9i"><sup><a href="#fns793uam9h9i">[1]</a></sup></span>也就是说，认为机器可以“在各方面都比人类聪明”是一个谬论，但仍然缺乏对人类的常识性理解，例如理解我们为什么提出解决气候变化的要求。</p></blockquote><p>我认为这种“谬误”是关于人工智能 x 风险的分歧的症结所在，因为对齐难度较大。我从其他消息灵通的风险怀疑者那里听到过这样的说法。直觉是有道理的。但大多数持一致态度的人都会立即驳斥这一点，认为这本身就是一个谬论。理解这两种立场不仅可以澄清讨论，还可以说明我们忽视一种有前途的协调方法的原因。</p><p>这种“谬误”并不能证明对齐是容易的。理解你的意思并不会让 AGI 想做那件事。行动以目标为指导，这与知识不同。但这种理解应该有助于协调的直觉不必被完全抛弃。我们现在提出了利用人工智能理解来进行对齐的对齐方法。他们通过将激励系统“指向”所学知识系统中的表征（例如“人类繁荣”）来做到这一点。我讨论了两个使用这种方法的调整计划，看起来很有希望。</p><p>早期的对齐思维认为这种类型的方法不可行，因为 AGI 可能<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai-takeoff">会</a>“快速且不可预测地学习”。对于深度网络中低于人类水平的训练，这一假设似乎并不成立，但这可能足以进行初始对齐。</p><p>对于一个能够进行不可预测的快速改进的系统，在调整它之前让它学习是疯狂的。在你有机会阻止它学习执行对齐之前，它很可能会变得足够聪明来逃脱。因此，在开始学习之前必须指定其目标（或一组塑造目标的奖励）。在这种情况下，我们指定目标的方式无法利用人工智能的智能。米切尔的“谬误”本身就是这种逻辑下的谬误。理解我们想要什么的通用人工智能可以轻松地做我们非常不想要的事情。</p><p>但现在似乎不太可能出现早期繁荣，因此我们的想法应该调整。深度网络的能力不会不可预测地增加，至少在人类水平和递归自我改进之前是这样。这可能足以让初步调整取得成功。早期关于通用人工智能“蓬勃发展”的假设现在看来不太可能成立。我认为早期的假设在我们的集体思维中留下了一个错误：通用人工智能的知识与让它做我们想做的事情无关。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefg637hbyuzwv"><sup><a href="#fng637hbyuzwv">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h2><strong>如何安全地利用人工智能的理解来进行对齐</strong></h2><p>在当前的训练体系中，深度网络以相对可预测的速度学习。因此，他们的训练可以暂停在中间水平，包括对人类价值观的一些理解，但在他们获得超人能力之前。一旦系统开始反思和指导自己的学习，这种平稳的轨迹可能就不会持续下去。但是，如果我们仔细谨慎地设定该水平，我们可能可以停留在安全但有用的智力/理解水平上。我们或许可以在训练过程中调整 AGI，从而利用它对我们想要的东西的理解。</p><p>此类方法有三个特别相关的示例。第一个是<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rlhf"><u>RLHF</u></a> ，它是相关的，因为它被广泛了解和理解。 （我<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d6DvuCKH5bSoT62DB/compendium-of-problems-with-rlhf"><u>等人</u></a>并不认为它本身是一种有前途的对齐方法。）RLHF 使用法学硕士训练有素的“理解”或“知识”作为有效指定人类偏好的基础。对有限的一组关于输入-响应对的人类判断进行训练使法学硕士能够很好地概括这些偏好。我们正在“指向”其学习语义空间中的区域。因为这些语义的格式相对良好，所以我们需要做相对较少的指示来定义一组复杂的所需响应。</p><p>第二个例子是语言模型代理（LMA）的自然语言对齐。如果 LMA 成为我们的第一个 AGI，这似乎是一个非常有前途的调整计划。该计划包括设计代理以遵循自然语言中表述的顶级目标（例如，“让 OpenAI 获得大量资金和政治影响力”），包括调整目标（例如，“做 Sam Altman 想要的事情，让世界成为一个更好的地方”。）我已经写了更多关于这项技术以及它可以“堆叠”的技术组合， <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Q7XWGqL4HjjRmhEyG/internal-independent-review-for-language-model-agent"><u>在这里</u></a>。</p><p>该方法遵循上述一般方案。它通过预训练 LLM 并在作为代理启动系统之前插入对齐目标来暂停训练以进行对齐工作。 （这是训练中期，如果该代理继续执行持续学习，这似乎是可能的。）如果人工智能足够智能，它将追求所述目标，包括其丰富的上下文语义。明智地选择这些目标陈述仍然是一个重要的外部对齐问题；但人工智能的知识是定义其一致性的基础。</p><p>遵循这种一般模式的另一个有前途的对齐计划是 Steve Byrnes 的<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Hi7zurzkCog336EC2/plan-for-mediocre-alignment-of-brain-like-model-based-rl-agi"><u>类脑 [基于模型的 RL] AGI 的平庸对齐计划</u></a>。在这个计划中，我们诱导新生的 AGI（暂停在有用但可控的理解/智能水平）来代表我们希望它符合的概念（例如，“思考人类繁荣”或“可纠正性”或其他什么）。然后，我们将其表征系统中的活跃单元的权重设置到其批评系统中。由于批评系统是一个<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qzu9o3sTytbC4sZkQ/steering-subsystems-capabilities-agency-and-alignment"><u>控制子系统</u></a>，决定其值并因此决定其行为，因此解决了内部对齐问题。该概念已成为其“最喜欢的”、价值最高的表示集，并且其决策将追求该概念中语义上包含的所有内容作为最终目标。</p><p>现在，将这些技术与不利用系统知识的对齐技术进行对比。<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqkGmfikqapbJ2YMj/shard-theory-an-overview"><u>碎片理论</u></a>和其他通过使用正确的奖励来调整 AGI 的建议就是一个例子。这需要准确猜测系统的表征将如何形成，以及这些奖励将如何塑造智能体在发展过程中的行为。手动编码除最简单目标之外的任何目标（请参阅<a href="https://arbital.com/p/diamond_maximizer/"><u>钻石最大化</u></a>）的表示似乎非常困难，以至于通常不被认为是可行的方法。</p><p>这些是需要进一步开发和检查缺陷的计划草图。在训练分布中，它们只产生与人类价值观的最初的、松散的（“平庸的”）一致性。泛化和值变化的<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g3pbJPQpNJyFfbHKd/the-alignment-stability-problem"><u>对齐稳定性问题</u></a>仍未得到解决。在进一步学习、自我修改或在新的（分布外）情况下对齐是否仍然令人满意似乎是一个值得进一步分析的复杂问题。</p><p>这种利用人工智能的智能并通过指向其表征来“告诉它我们想要什么”的方法似乎很有前途。这两个计划似乎特别有希望。它们适用于我们可能获得的 AGI 类型（语言模型智能体、强化学习智能体或混合体）；它们足够简单，易于实施，并且足够简单，可以在实施之前进行详细考虑。</p><p>我很想听到关于这个方向的具体阻力，或者更好的是这些具体计划。人工智能工作似乎可能会快速进行，因此协调工作也应该迅速进行。我认为我们需要制定和批评最好的计划，将其应用于我们最有可能获得的通用人工智能类型，即使这些计划并不完美。 <br></p><ol

- 奖励错误指定。这也称为外部对齐问题。本节首先讨论除了算法设计之外良好的奖励设计的必要性。接下来是奖励规范失败的具体示例，例如奖励黑客和奖励篡改。</li><li><strong>通过模仿学习</strong>：本节重点介绍一些针对奖励错误指定的建议解决方案，这些解决方案依赖于通过模仿人类行为来学习奖励功能。它研究了模仿学习（IL）、行为克隆（BC）和逆向强化学习（IRL）等建议。每个部分还包含对这些方法在解决奖励黑客方面可能存在的问题和局限性的检查。</li><li><strong>通过反馈学习</strong>：最后一部分研究了旨在通过向机器学习模型提供反馈来纠正奖励错误指定的提案。本节还全面介绍了当前大型语言模型 (LLM) 的训练方式。讨论内容涵盖奖励建模、人类反馈强化学习 (RLHF)、人工智能反馈强化学习 (RLAIF) 以及这些方法的局限性。</li></ol><h1> 1.0：强化学习</h1><p>本节简要提醒强化学习 (RL) 中的几个概念。它还消除了各种经常混淆的术语的歧义，例如奖励、价值和效用。本节最后讨论了区分强化学习系统可能追求的目标概念和它所获得的奖励的概念。已经熟悉基础知识的读者可以直接跳至第 2 部分。</p><h2> 1.1.底漆</h2><p><i>强化学习（RL）专注于开发能够从交互体验中学习的智能体。强化学习的概念是，智能体通过与环境的交互进行学习，并根据每次行动后通过奖励收到的反馈来改变其行为。</i></p><p>强化学习的一些实际应用示例包括：</p><ul><li><strong>机器人系统</strong>：强化学习已应用于实时控制物理机器人等任务，并使它们能够学习更复杂的动作（OpenAI 2018“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwSbzNHGflM"><u>学习敏捷性</u></a>”）。强化学习可以使机器人系统学习复杂的任务并适应不断变化的环境。</li><li><strong>推荐系统</strong>：强化学习可应用于推荐系统，该系统与数十亿用户交互，旨在提供个性化推荐。强化学习算法可以根据用户反馈学习优化推荐策略，改善整体用户体验。</li><li><strong>游戏系统：</strong> 2010 年代初期，强化学习 基于强化学习的系统开始在一些非常简单的 Atari 游戏（例如 Pong 和 Breakout）中击败人类。多年来，已经有许多模型利用强化学习在棋盘游戏和视频游戏中击败了世界大师。其中包括<a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago"><u>AlphaGo</u></a> (2016)、 <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go"><u>AlphaZero</u></a> (2018)、 <a href="https://openai.com/research/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions"><u>OpenAI Five</u></a> (2019)、 <a

等模型。</li></ul><p>强化学习与监督学习不同，因为它从“做什么”的高级描述开始，但允许代理进行实验并从经验中学习最好的“如何做”。在强化学习中，智能体通过与环境的交互来学习，并根据其行为以奖励或惩罚的形式接收反馈。强化学习专注于学习一组规则，这些规则推荐在给定状态下采取的最佳行动，以最大化长期奖励。相反，监督学习通常涉及从明确提供的标签或每个输入的正确答案中进行学习。</p><h2>

2.0：优化</h1><p>了解优化对于理解人工智能安全问题非常重要，因为它在机器学习中发挥着核心作用。人工智能系统，特别是基于深度学习的系统，使用优化算法进行训练，以从数据中学习模式和关联。这些算法更新模型的参数以最小化损失函数，从而最大化其在给定任务上的性能。<br><br>优化会放大某些行为或结果，即使它们最初不太可能发生。例如，优化器可以搜索可能输出的空间，并根据目标函数采取具有高分的极端操作，这可能会导致意外和不良行为。其中包括奖励错误指定失败。更好地认识优化放大某些结果的力量可能有助于设计真正符合人类价值观和目标的系统和算法，即使在优化的压力下也是如此。这涉及确保优化过程与系统设计者的预期目标和价值观保持一致。它还需要考虑优化过程中可能出现的潜在故障模式和意外后果。</p><p>优化带来的风险在人工智能安全中无处不在。本章仅对其进行了简要介绍，但将在目标错误概括和代理基础章节中进行更详细的讨论。</p><p>优化能力在奖励黑客中起着至关重要的作用。当强化学习代理利用真实奖励和代理奖励之间的差异时，奖励黑客就会发生。优化能力的提高可能会导致奖励黑客行为的可能性更高。在某些情况下，存在一些阶段转变，其中优化能力的适度增加会导致奖励黑客的急剧增加。</p><h2> 2.1: 古德哈特定律</h2><p>“<i>当一项措施成为目标时，它就不再是一个好的措施。</i> ”</p><p>这个概念最初源于查尔斯·古德哈特（Charles Goodhart）的经济理论著作。然而，它已成为包括当今人工智能对齐在内的许多不同领域的主要挑战之一。</p><p>为了说明这个概念，以下是一个苏联制钉厂的故事。工厂接到指示，要生产尽可能多的钉子，高产量奖励，低产量惩罚。几年之内，工厂显着增加了钉子的产量——本质上是图钉的小钉子，事实证明无法达到其预期目的。因此，规划者改变了激励措施：他们决定根据生产的钉子的总重量奖励工厂。几年之内，工厂开始生产又大又重的钉子（本质上是钢块），而这些钉子对于钉东西同样无效。

3.0：奖励错误</h1><p><i><strong>奖励错误指定</strong>，也称为<strong>外部对齐</strong>问题，是指为人工智能提供准确的奖励以进行优化的问题。</i></p><p>基本问题很容易理解：指定的损失函数是否与其设计者的预期目标一致？然而，在实际场景中实现这一点非常具有挑战性。表达人类请求背后的完整“意图”就等于传达所有人类价值观、隐含的文化背景等，而这些本身仍然知之甚少。</p><p>此外，由于大多数模型被设计为目标优化器，因此它们都容易受到古德哈特定律的影响。此漏洞意味着，由于对人类看似明确的目标施加过度的优化压力，可能会产生不可预见的负面后果，但以微妙的方式偏离了真实的目标。</p><p>总体问题可以分解为不同的问题，这些问题将在下面的各个小节中详细解释。以下是一个快速概述：</p><ul><li>当指定的奖励函数不能准确地捕捉真实的目标或期望的行为时，就会发生<strong>奖励错误</strong>指定。</li><li><strong>奖励设计</strong>是指设计奖励函数以使人工智能代理的行为与预期目标保持一致的过程。</li><li><strong>奖励黑客</strong>是指强化学习代理利用指定奖励函数中的差距或漏洞来获得高额奖励，但实际上并未实现预期目标的行为。</li><li><strong>奖励篡改</strong>是一个更广泛的概念，包括代理对奖励过程本身的不当影响，不包括通过游戏操纵奖励函数。</li></ul><p>在深入研究特定类型的奖励错误指定失败之前，以下部分进一步解释了奖励设计与算法设计相结合的重点。本节还阐明了设计有效奖励的众所周知的困难。</p><h2> 3.1：奖励设计</h2><p><i>奖励设计是指强化学习（RL）中指定奖励函数的过程。</i></p><p>奖励塑造已在前面部分介绍过。塑造是指修改奖励函数以向学习代理提供额外指导或激励的过程。另一方面，奖励设计是一个更广泛的术语，涵盖了设计和塑造奖励函数以指导人工智能系统行为的整个过程。它不仅涉及奖励塑造，还涉及定义目标、指定偏好以及创建符合人类价值观和期望结果的奖励函数的整个过程。奖励设计是一个经常与<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4nZRzoGTqg8xy5rr8/the-reward-engineering-problem"><u>奖励工程</u></a>互换使用的术语。它们都指的是同一件事。</p><p>强化学习算法设计和强化学习奖励设计是强化学习的两个独立的方面。 RL 算法设计是关于学习算法的开发和实现，该算法允许代理根据奖励和环境交互来学习和完善其行为。此过程包括设计代理从经验中学习、更新策略并做出决策以最大化累积奖励的机制和程序。</p><p>相反，强化学习奖励设计专注于指导强化学习智能体学习过程的奖励函数的规范和设计。奖励设计需要仔细设计奖励函数，以符合期望的行为和目标，同时考虑奖励黑客或奖励篡改等潜在陷阱。奖励函数是一个关键因素，因为它塑造了 RL 智能体的行为并确定哪些行为是可取的或不可取的。</p><p>设计奖励函数通常会带来巨大的挑战，需要大量的专业知识和经验。为了演示此任务的复杂性，请考虑如何手动设计奖励函数以使代理执行后空翻，如下图所示： </p><p><img

href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/"><u>从人类偏好中学习</u></a>”</p><p>强化学习算法设计侧重于智能体的学习和决策机制，而强化学习奖励设计则侧重于定义目标并通过奖励函数塑造智能体的行为。这两个方面对于开发有效且一致的强化学习系统都至关重要。精心设计的强化学习算法可以有效地从奖励中学习，而精心设计的奖励函数可以引导智能体做出期望的行为并避免意想不到的后果。下图展示了 RL 代理设计的三个关键要素：算法设计、奖励设计和防止篡改奖励信号： </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/izuxey2bnle4ftwor5nq"></p><p>资料来源：Deep

href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity"><u>规范游戏：人工智能独创性的另一面</u></a>”</p><p>尽管奖励设计过程在定义要解决的问题方面发挥着关键作用，但在介绍性强化学习文本中却很少受到关注。正如本节介绍中提到的，解决奖励指定错误问题需要找到能够抵抗古德哈特定律引起的失败的评估指标。这包括由于误导或代理目标的过度优化（奖励黑客）或代理直接干扰奖励信号（奖励篡改）而导致的失败。这些概念将在接下来的部分中进一步探讨。</p><h2> 3.2：奖励塑造</h2><p><i>奖励塑造是强化学习中使用的一种技术，它引入小的中间奖励来补充环境奖励。此举旨在缓解奖励信号稀疏的问题，并鼓励探索和更快的学习。</i></p><p>为了成功解决强化学习问题，人工智能需要做两件事：</p><ul><li>找到一系列能带来积极奖励的行动。这就是<i>探索</i>问题。</li><li>记住要采取的行动的顺序，并概括到相关但略有不同的情况。这就是<i>学习</i>问题。</li></ul><p>无模型强化学习方法通​​过随机采取行动进行探索。如果偶然的随机行为会带来奖励，它们就会得到强化，并且智能体将来更有可能采取这些有益的行为。如果奖励足够密集，随机动作能够以合理的概率获得奖励，那么这种方法就很有效。然而，许多更复杂的游戏需要很长的非常具体的动作序列才能体验任何奖励，并且这样的序列极不可能随机发生。</p><p>这个问题的一个典型例子是在视频游戏《蒙特祖玛的复仇》中，特工的目标是找到一把钥匙，但找到钥匙需要许多中间步骤。为了解决此类长期规划问题，研究人员尝试在奖励函数中添加额外的项或组件，以鼓励期望的行为或阻止不期望的行为。

The game uses a score mechanism, so in order to progress to the next level the reward designers used reward shaping to reward the system when it scored points. These were given when a boat gets items (such as the green blocks in the animation below) or accomplishes other actions that presumably would help it win the race. Despite being given intermediate rewards, the overall intended goal was to finish the race as quickly as possible. The developers thought the best way to get a high score was to win the race but it was not the case. The agent discovered that continuously rotating a ship in a circle to accumulate points indefinitely optimized its reward, even though it did not help it win the race. <br></p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/qjanshlbug21zqvkp4ez"></p><p> Source: Amodei &amp; Clark (2016) “ <a href="https://openai.com/research/faulty-reward-functions"><u>Faulty reward functions in the wild</u></a> &quot;</p><p> In cases where the reward function misaligns with the desired objective, reward hacking can emerge. This can lead the agent to optimize a proxy reward, deviating from the true underlying goal, thereby yielding behavior contrary to the designers&#39; intentions.

As a result, combating reward hacking remains an active research area in AI safety and alignment.</p><h2> 3.4: Reward Tampering</h2><ul><li> Victoria Krakovna et. al. (Mar 2021) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04734"><u>Reward Tampering Problems and Solutions</u></a></li></ul><p> <i>Reward tampering refers to instances where an AI agent inappropriately influences or manipulates the reward process itself.</i></p><p> The problem of getting some intended task done can be split into:</p><ul><li> Designing an agent that is good at optimizing reward, and,</li><li> Designing a reward process that provides the agent with suitable rewards. The reward process can be understood by breaking it down even further. The process includes:<ul><li> An implemented reward function</li><li> A mechanism for collecting appropriate sensory data as input</li><li> A way for the user to potentially update the reward function.</li></ul></li></ul><p> Reward tampering involves the agent interfering with various parts of this reward process. An agent might distort the feedback received from the reward model, altering the information used to update its behavior. It could also manipulate the reward model&#39;s implementation, altering the code or hardware to change reward computations. In some cases, agents engaging in reward tampering may even directly modify the reward values before processing in the machine register. Depending on what exactly is being tampered with we get various degrees of reward tampering. These can be distinguished from the image below. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/ogajkyybxz0rudhyza64"></p><p> Source: Leo Gao (Nov 2022) “<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/REesy8nqvknFFKywm/clarifying-wireheading-terminology"><u>Clarifying wireheading terminology</u></a> ”</p><p> <i><u>Reward function input tampering</u> interferes only with the inputs to the reward function.

This can lead to weakening or breaking the relationship between the observed reward and the intended task. This is an ongoing research direction. Research papers such as “ <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12064"><u>Advanced Artificial Agents Intervene in the Provision of reward</u></a> ” (August 2022) by Hutter et al. seek to provide a more detailed analysis of such subjects.</p><p> A hypothesized existing example of reward tampering can be seen in recommendation-based algorithms used in social media. These algorithms influence their users&#39; emotional state to generate more &#39;likes&#39; (Russell, 2019). The intended task was to serve useful or engaging content, but this is being achieved by tampering with human emotional perceptions, and thereby changing what would be considered useful. Assuming the capabilities of systems continue to increase through either computational or algorithmic advances, it is plausible to expect reward tampering problems to become increasingly common. Therefore, reward tampering is a potential concern that requires much more research and empirical verification.</p><p></p><h1> 4.0: Learning from imitation</h1><p> The preceding sections have underscored the significance of reward misspecification for the alignment of future artificial intelligence. The next few sections will explore various attempts and proposals formulated to tackle this issue, commencing with an intuitive approach – learning the appropriate reward function through human behavior observation and imitation, rather than manual creation by the designers.</p><h2> 4.1: Imitation Learning (IL)</h2><p> <i>Imitation learning entails the process of learning via the observation of an expert&#39;s actions and replicating their behavior.</i></p><p> Unlike reinforcement learning (RL), which derives a policy for a system&#39;s actions based on its interaction outcomes with the environment, imitation learning aspires to learn a policy through the observation of another agent interacting with the environment. Imitation learning is the general term for the class of algorithms that learn through imitation. Following is a table that distinguishes various machine learning based methods. SL = Supervised learning; UL = Unsupervised learning; RL = Reinforcement Learning; IL = Imitation Learning. IL reduces RL to SL. IL + RL is a promising area. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/qx8s74nyevz3vdql9kam"></p><p>资料来源：Emma Brunskill（2022 年冬季）“<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/CS234Win2022/modules.html"><u>斯坦福 CS234：RL</u></a> - 第 1 讲”</p><p> IL can be implemented through behavioral cloning (BC), procedural cloning (PC) , inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL), generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), etc…</p><p> One instance of this process&#39;s application is in the training of modern large language models (LLMs). LLMs, after training as general-purpose text generators, often undergo fine-tuning for instruction following through imitation learning, using the example of a human expert who follows instructions provided as text prompts and completions.</p><p> In the context of safety and alignment, imitation learning is favored over direct reinforcement to alleviate specification gaming issues. This problem emerges when the programmers overlook or fail to anticipate certain edge cases or unusual ways of achieving a task in the specific environment. The presumption is that demonstrating behavior, compared to RL, would be simpler and safer, as the model would not only attain the objective but also fulfill it as the expert demonstrator explicitly intends. However, this is not an infallible solution, and its limitations will be discussed in later sections.<br></p><h2> 4.2: Behavioral Cloning (BC)</h2><p> <i>Behavioral cloning involves collecting observations of an expert demonstrator proficient at the underlying task, and using supervised learning (SL) to guide an agent to &#39;imitate&#39; the demonstrated behavior.</i></p><p> Behavioral cloning is one way in which we can implement imitation learning (IL). There are also other ways such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), or cooperative inverse reinforcement Learning (CIRL). Unlike IRL, the goal behind behavioral cloning as a machine learning (ML) method is to replicate the demonstrator&#39;s behavior as closely as possible, regardless of what the demonstrator&#39;s goals might be.</p><p> Self-driving cars can serve as a simplistic illustration of how behavioral cloning operates. A human demonstrator (driver) is directed to operate a car, during which data about the environment state from sensors like lidar and cameras, along with the actions taken by the demonstrator, are collected. These actions can include wheel movements, gear use, etc. This creates a dataset comprising (state, action) pairs. Subsequently, supervised learning is used to train a prediction model, which attempts to predict an action for any future environment state. For instance, the model might output a specific steering wheel and gear configuration based on the camera feed. When the model achieves sufficient accuracy, it can be stated that the human driver&#39;s behavior has been &#39;cloned&#39; into a machine via learning. Hence, the term behavioral cloning.</p><p> The following points highlight several potential issues that might surface when employing behavioral cloning:</p><ul><li> <strong>Confident incorrectness</strong> : During the demonstrations, the human experts have some amount of background knowledge that they rely on, which is not taught to the model. For example, when training an LLM to have conversations using behavioral cloning, the human demonstrator might less frequently ask certain questions because they are considered &#39;common sense&#39;. A model trained to imitate will copy both - the types of questions asked in conversation, as well as, the frequency with which they are asked. Humans already possess this background knowledge, but an LLM doesn&#39;t. This means that to have the same level of information as a human, the model should ask some questions more frequently to fill the gaps in its knowledge. But since the model seeks to imitate, it will stick to the low frequency demonstrated by the human and thus has strictly less information overall than the demonstrator for the same conversational task. Despite this dearth of knowledge, we expect it to be able to perform as a clone and reach human-level performance. This means in order to reach human performance on less than human knowledge it will resort to &#39;making up facts&#39; that help it reach its performance goals. These &#39;hallucinations&#39; will then be presented during the conversation, with the same level of confidence as all the other information. Hallucinations and confident incorrectness is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15025.pdf"><u>an empirically verified problem</u></a> in many LLMs including GPT-2 and 3, and raises obvious concerns for AI safety.</li><li> <strong>Underachieving</strong> : The types of hallucinations mentioned above arose because the model knew too little. However, the model can also know too much. If the model knows more than the human demonstrator because it is able to find more patterns in the environment state that it is given, it will throw away that information and reduce its performance to match human level. This is because it is trained as a &#39;clone&#39;. Ideally, we don&#39;t want the model dumbing itself down or not disclosing useful new patterns in data just because it is trying to be humanlike or perform at a human level. This is another problem that will have to be addressed if behavioral cloning continues to be used as an ML technique.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2> 4.3: Procedural Cloning (PC)</h2><ul><li> Mengjiao Yang et. al. (May 2022) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10816"><u>Chain of Thought Imitation with Procedure Cloning</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> <i>Procedure cloning (PC) extends behavioral cloning (BC) by not just imitating the demonstrators outputs but also imitating the complete sequence of intermediate computations associated with an expert&#39;s procedure.</i></p><p> In BC, the agent learns to map states directly to actions by discarding the intermediate search outputs. On the other hand, the PC approach learns the entire sequence of intermediate computations, including branches and backtracks, during training. During inference, PC generates a sequence of intermediate search outcomes that mimic the expert&#39;s search procedure before outputting the final action.</p><p> The main difference between PC and BC lies in the information they utilize. BC only has access to expert state-action pairs as demonstrations, while PC also has access to the intermediate computations that generated those state-action pairs. PC learns to predict the complete series of intermediate computation outcomes, enabling it to generalize better to test environments with different configurations compared to alternative improvements over BC. PC&#39;s ability to imitate the expert&#39;s search procedure allows it to capture the underlying reasoning and decision-making process, leading to improved performance in various tasks.</p><p> A limitation of PC is the computational overhead compared to BC, as PC needs to predict intermediate procedures. Additionally, the choice of how to encode the expert&#39;s algorithm into a form suitable for PC is left to the practitioner, which may require some trial-and-error in designing the ideal computation sequence.<br></p><h2> 4.4: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)</h2><p> <i>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) represents a form of machine learning wherein an artificial intelligence observes the behavior of another agent within a particular environment, typically an expert human, and endeavors to discern the reward function without its explicit definition.</i></p><p> IRL is typically employed when a reward function is too intricate to define programmatically, or when AI agents need to react robustly to sudden environmental changes necessitating a modification in the reward function for safety. For instance, consider an AI agent learning to execute a backflip. Humans, dogs, and Boston Dynamics robots can all perform backflips, but the manner in which they do so varies significantly depending on their physiology, their incentives, and their current location, all of which can be highly diverse in the real world. An AI agent learning backflips purely through trial and error across a wide range of body types and locations, without something to observe, might prove highly inefficient.</p><p> IRL, therefore, does not necessarily imply that an AI mimics other agents&#39; behavior, since AI researchers may anticipate the AI agent to devise more efficient ways to maximize the discovered reward function. Nevertheless, IRL does assume that the observed agent behaves transparently enough for an AI agent to accurately identify their actions, and what success constitutes. This means that IRL endeavors to discover the reward functions that &#39;explain&#39; the demonstrations. This should not be conflated with imitation learning where the primary interest is a policy capable of generating the observed demonstrations. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/k4eolj8ibrm3bbueywno"></p><p> （<a href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3508/1*rZoO-azxiEH3viQao8NcAA.png"><u>来源</u></a>）</p><p> IRL constitutes both a machine learning method, since it can be employed when specifying a reward function is excessively challenging, and a machine learning problem, as an AI agent may settle on an inaccurate reward function or utilize unsafe and misaligned methods to achieve it.</p><p> One of the limitations to this approach is that IRL algorithms presume that the observed behavior is optimal, an assumption that arguably proves too robust when dealing with human demonstrations. Another problem is that the IRL problem is ill-posed as every policy is optimal for the null reward. For most behavioral observations, multiple fitting reward functions exist. This set of solutions often includes many degenerate solutions, which assign zero rewards to all states.</p><h2> 4.5: Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL)</h2><ul><li> Stuart Russell et. al. (Nov 2016) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"><u>Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> CIRL (Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning) is an extension of the IRL (Inverse Reinforcement Learning) framework. IRL is a learning approach that aims to infer the underlying reward function of an expert by observing their behavior. It assumes that the expert&#39;s behavior is optimal and tries to learn a reward function that explains their actions.  CIRL, on the other hand, is an interactive form of IRL that addresses two major weaknesses of conventional IRL.</p><p> First, Instead of simply copying the human reward function CIRL is formulated as a learning process. It is an interactive reward maximization process, where the human functions as a teacher and provides feedback (in the form of rewards) on the agent&#39;s actions. This allows the human to nudge the AI agent towards behavioral patterns that align with their preferences. The second weakness of conventional IRL is that it assumes the human behaves optimally, which limits the teaching behaviors that can be considered. CIRL addresses this weakness by allowing for a variety of teaching behaviors and interactions between the human and the AI agent. It enables the AI agent to learn not only what actions to take but also how and why to take them, by observing and interacting with the human.</p><p> CIRL has been studied as a potential approach to AI alignment, particularly in scenarios where deep learning may not scale to AGI. However, opinions on the potential effectiveness of CIRL vary, with some researchers expecting it to be helpful if deep learning doesn&#39;t scale to AGI, while others have a higher probability of deep learning scaling to AGI.</p><h2> 4.6: The (Easy) Goal Inference Problem</h2><ul><li> Christiano, Paul (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/h9DesGT3WT9u2k7Hr/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard"><u>The easy goal inference problem is still hard</u></a> ”</li></ul><p><br> <i>The <strong>goal inference problem</strong> refers to the task of inferring the goals or intentions of an agent based on their observed behavior or actions.</i></p><p> This final section builds upon the limitations highlighted in previous sections to introduce the Goal Inference problem, and it&#39;s simpler subset - the easy goal inference problem. Imitation learning based approaches, generally follows these steps:</p><ol><li> Observe the user&#39;s actions and statements.</li><li> Deduce the user&#39;s preferences.</li><li> Endeavor to enhance the world according to the user&#39;s preferences, possibly collaborating with the user and seeking clarification as needed.</li></ol><p> The merit of this method is that we can immediately start constructing systems that are driven by observed user behavior. However, as a consequence of this approach, we run into the goal inference problem. This refers to the task of inferring the goals or intentions of an agent based on their observed behavior or actions. It involves determining what the agent is trying to achieve or what their desired outcome is. The goal inference problem is challenging because agents may act sub-optimally or fail to achieve their goals, making it difficult to accurately infer their true intentions. Traditional approaches to goal inference often assume that agents act optimally or exhibit simplified forms of sub-optimality, which may not capture the complexity of real-world planning and decision-making. Therefore, the goal inference problem requires accounting for the difficulty of planning itself and the possibility of sub-optimal or failed plans.</p><p> However, it also optimistically presumes that we can depict a human as a somewhat rational agent, which might not always hold. The easy goal inference problem is a simplified version of the goal inference problem.</p><p> <i>The <strong>easy goal inference problem</strong> involves finding a reasonable representation or approximation of what a human wants, given complete access to the human&#39;s policy or behavior in any situation.</i></p><p> This version of the problem assumes no algorithmic limitations and focuses on extracting the true values that the human is imperfectly optimizing. However, even this simplified version of the problem remains challenging, and little progress has been made on the general case. The easy goal inference problem is related to the goal inference problem because it highlights the difficulty of accurately inferring human goals or intentions, even in simplified scenarios. While narrow domains with simple decisions can be solved using existing approaches, more complex tasks such as designing a city or setting policies require addressing the challenges of modeling human mistakes and sub-optimal behavior. Therefore, the easy goal inference problem serves as a starting point to understand the broader goal inference problem and the additional complexities it entails.</p><p> Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is effective in modeling and imitating human experts. However, for many significant applications, we desire AI systems that can make decisions surpassing even the experts. In such cases, the accuracy of the model isn&#39;t the sole criterion because a perfectly accurate model would merely lead us to replicate human behavior and not transcend it.</p><p> This necessitates an explicit model of errors or bounded rationality, which will guide the AI on how to improve or be &quot;smarter,&quot; and which aspects of the human policy it should discard. Nonetheless, this remains an exceedingly challenging problem as humans are not primarily rational with a bit of added noise. Hence, constructing any model of mistakes is just as complex as building a comprehensive model of human behavior. A critical question we face is: How do we determine the quality of a model when accuracy can no longer be our reliable measure? How can we distinguish between good and bad decisions?</p><h1> 5.0: Learning from feedback</h1><p> This section discusses yet more attempts to address the reward misspecification problem. At times, the intended behavior is so intricate that demonstration-based learning becomes untenable. An alternative approach is to offer feedback to the agent instead of providing either manually specified reward functions or even expert demonstrations. This section delves into feedback-based strategies such as Reward Modeling, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), also known as Reinforcement Learning from Constitutional AI (RLCAI) or simply Constitutional AI.</p><h2> 5.1: Reward Modeling</h2><ul><li> DeepMind (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07871"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> Reward modeling was developed to apply reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world problems where designing a reward function is difficult, in part because humans don&#39;t have a perfect understanding of every objective. In reward modeling, human assistants evaluate the outcomes of AI behavior, without needing to know how to perform or demonstrate the task optimally themselves. This is similar to how you can tell if a dish is cooked well by tasting it even if you do not know how to cook, and thus your feedback can be used by a chef to learn how to cook better. This technique separates the RL alignment problem into two separate halves: Understanding intentions, ie learning the &#39;What?&#39;, and Acting to achieve the intentions, ie learning the &#39;How?&#39;. This means that in the modeling agenda, there are two different ML models:</p><ul><li> A reward model is trained with user feedback. This model learns to predict what humans would consider good behavior.</li><li> An agent trained with RL, where the reward for the agent is determined by the outputs of the reward model </li></ul><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/hzepfc9kuxzytm5iemjm"></p><p> Source: DeepMind (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a> ”</p><p> Overall, while promising reward modeling can still fall prey to reward misspecification and reward hacking failures. Obtaining accurate and comprehensive feedback can be challenging, and human evaluators may have limited knowledge or biases that can impact the quality of the feedback. Additionally, any reward functions learnt through modeling might also struggle to generalize to new situations or environments that differ from the training data. These are all discussed further using concrete examples in later sections.</p><p> There are also some variants of reward modeling such as:</p><ul><li> <strong><u>Narrow reward modeling</u></strong> is a specific flavor of reward modeling where the focus is on training AI systems to accomplish specific tasks rather than trying to determine the &quot;true human utility function&quot;. It aims to learn reward functions to achieve particular objectives, rather than seeking a comprehensive understanding of human values.</li><li> <strong><u>Recursive reward modeling</u></strong> seeks to introduce scalability to the technique. In recursive reward modeling, the focus is on decomposing a complex task into simpler subtasks and using reward modeling at each level to train agents that can perform those subtasks. This hierarchical structure allows for more efficient training and credit assignment, as well as the exploration of novel solutions that may not be apparent to humans. This is shown in the diagram below. Scalable oversight will be covered in greater depth in future chapters. </li></ul><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/xclvo4btaebz0ondwane"></p><p> Source: DeepMind (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a> ”</p><p> The general reward modeling framework forms the basis for other feedback based techniques such as RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) which is discussed in the next section.</p><h2> 5.2.

A prime example of an AI trained with RLHF is OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT.</p><p> Earlier in this chapter, the reader was asked to consider the reward design problem for manually defining a reward function to get an agent to perform a backflip. This section considers the RLHF solution to this design problem. RLHF addresses this problem as follows: A human is initially shown two instances of an AI&#39;s backflip attempts, then the human selects which one appears more like a backflip, and finally, the AI is updated accordingly. By repeating this process thousands of times, we can guide the AI to perform actual backflips. </p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/wcjfdzcx4cnnfi5ruu66"></figure></td><td><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:39.31%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/hl6oecj6eg1hrjffpnbh"></figure></td></tr><tr><td> RLHF learned to backflip using around 900 individual bits of feedback from the human evaluator.</td><td> From &quot; <a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/"><u>Learning from Human Preferences</u></a> ,&quot; the authors point out that manual reward crafting took two hours to write a custom reward function for a robot to perform a backflip.

The effectiveness of an algorithm heavily relies on the human evaluator&#39;s intuition about what constitutes the correct behavior. If the human lacks a thorough understanding of the task, they may not provide beneficial feedback. Further, in certain domains, our system might lead to agents developing policies that deceive the evaluators. For instance, a robot intended to grasp objects merely positioned its manipulator between the camera and the object, making it seem as if it was executing the task as shown below. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/bxqftcwt4mj5meowwma5"></p><p> Source: Christiano et al (2017) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf"><u>Deep Reinforcement Learning From Human Preferences</u></a> ”</p><h2> 5.3: Pretraining with Human Feedback (PHF)</h2><ul><li> Tomasz Korbak et. al. (Feb 2023) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741"><u>Pretraining Language Models with Human Preferences</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> In standard pretraining, the language model attempts to learn parameters such that they maximize the likelihood of the training data. However, this also includes undesirable content such as falsehoods, offensive language, and private information. The concept of Pretraining with human feedback (PHF) utilizes the reward modeling methodology in the pretraining phase. The authors of the paper found that PHF works much better than the standard practice of only using feedback (RLHF) after pretraining.</p><p> In PHF the training data is scored using a reward function, such as a toxic text classifier, to guide the language model to learn from undesirable content while avoiding imitating it during inference time.</p><p> Similar to RLHF, PHF does not completely solve reward hacking, however, it might move the systems one small step closer. These methods can be further extended by employing AI assistants to aid humans in providing more effective feedback. Some aspects of this strategy are introduced in the next section but will be explored in further detail in the chapters on scalable and adversarial oversight methods.</p><h2> 5.4. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)</h2><p> <i>Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is a framework involving the training of an AI agent to learn from the feedback given by another AI system.</i></p><p> RLAIF also known as RLCAI (Reinforcement Learning on Constitutional AI) or simply Constitutional AI, was <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution"><u>developed by Anthropic</u></a> . A central component of Constitutional AI is the constitution, a set of human-written principles that the AI is expected to adhere to, such as &quot;Choose the least threatening or aggressive response&quot;. Anthropic&#39;s AI assistant Claude&#39;s constitution incorporates principles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Apple&#39;s Terms of Service, Deepmind&#39;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14375"><u>Sparrow Principles</u></a> , and more. Constitutional AI begins with an AI trained primarily for helpfulness and subsequently trains it for harmlessness in two stages:</p><ul><li> <strong>Stage 1:</strong> The AI continuously critiques and refines its own responses to harmful prompts. For instance, if we ask the AI for advice on building bombs and it responds with a bomb tutorial, we then ask the AI to revise the response in accordance with a randomly selected constitutional principle. The AI is then trained to generate outputs more similar to these revised responses. This stage&#39;s primary objective is to facilitate the second stage.</li><li> <strong>Stage 2:</strong> We use the AI, fine-tuned from stage 1, to produce pairs of alternative responses to harmful prompts. The AI then rates each pair according to a randomly selected constitutional principle. This results in AI-generated preferences for harmlessness, which we blend with human preferences for helpfulness to ensure the AI doesn&#39;t lose its ability to be helpful. The final step is to train the AI to create responses that closely resemble the preferred responses.</li></ul><p> Anthropic&#39;s experiments indicate that AIs trained with Constitutional Reinforcement Learning are significantly safer (in the sense of less offensive and less likely to give you potentially harmful information) while maintaining the same level of helpfulness compared to AIs trained with RLHF. While Constitutional AI does share some issues with RLHF concerning robustness, it also promises better scalability due to its reduced reliance on human supervision. The image below provides a comparison of Constitutional AI&#39;s helpfulness with that of RLHF.</p><h1> Acknowledgements</h1><p> Thanks to Charbel-Raphaël Segerie, Jeanne Salle, Bogdan Ionut Cirstea, Nemo, Gurvan, and the many course participants of ML4G France, ML4G Germany, and AISF Sweden for helpful comments and feedback.</p><h1> Meta-Notes</h1><ul><li> I consider this a work-in-progress project.

The section elaborates the merits and drawbacks of such a paradigm.</li><li> <strong>Leveraging Computation</strong> : This section introduces the reader to “the bitter lesson&quot;. The focus for this section is comparing historical advancements achieved through the utilization of human-engineered heuristics with those accomplished by capitalizing on additional computation. This is followed by a discussion on current trends in the “compute optimal training” of machine learning models. This section concludes with an introduction to and the implications of scaling laws and the scaling hypothesis.</li><li> <strong>Capabilities</strong> : This section builds upon the previously introduced trends and paradigms, and extrapolates these to predict potential capabilities of future artificial intelligence (AI) models. There is a discussion around the merits of using the term capabilities instead of intelligence. This is followed by introducing slightly more detailed frameworks for different possible tiers and categorizations of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Moreover, the concept of (t,n)-AGI is introduced. This outlook allows a straightforward comparison to humans, while also establishing a measurable continuous spectrum of capabilities. Overall the aim is to help establish a more concrete definition of AGI capabilities for the reader.</li><li> <strong>Threat Models</strong> : Understanding capability thresholds paves the way for a discussion into the concept of emergence. This is then followed by an examination of qualities that machine intelligences might possess. These qualities potentially indicate the possibility for an intelligence explosion. The section concludes with a discussion of the four fundamental assumptions put forward by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) about machine intelligence. These claims explore the power of general intelligence, and why this capability arising in machines does not promise a beneficial future to humans by default.</li><li> <strong>Timelines</strong> : This section explores some concrete predictions of when the capabilities discussed in the previous sections might surface. The dialogue hinges on the concept of anchors in forecasting. This pays specific focus on determining how we can use anchors inspired by biological systems to provide a basis for estimating the computational requirements of AI systems.</li><li> <strong>Takeoff</strong> : The chapter concludes with a section that introduces the concept of takeoff and various forms of takeoff dynamics. The dynamics involve takeoff speeds, polarity and homogeneity. The section presents differing opinions from various researchers on potential future scenarios.</li></ol><h1> 1.0: Foundation Models</h1><blockquote><p> <i>A</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models"><i><strong><u>foundation model</u></strong></i></a> <i>is any model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted (eg, fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks.</i></p></blockquote><p> <i>-</i> Bommasani Rishi et. al. (2022) &quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf"><u>On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</u></a> &quot;</p><p> Large-scale research labs have been navigating towards a new machine learning (ML) paradigm: the training of a &quot;base model&quot;. A base model is simply a large-scale model that serves as a building block for various applications. This model serves as a multifaceted entity—competent across various areas but not specialized in any one.</p><p> Once there is a base, developers can retrain portions of the model using additional examples, which allows operators to generate specialized systems adapted for specific tasks and improve the system&#39;s quality and consistency. This is known as <strong>fine-tuning</strong> .</p><p> Fine-tuning facilitates the development of models capable of diverse downstream tasks. Simple examples of this include fine-tuning the general purpose GPT language model to follow instructions, or to interact in a chat format. Other examples include specializing models for programming, scientific texts, mathematical proofs and other such tasks. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/l6hjr0loovhnnvynkkig" alt="https://www.artificialintelligence.news/pathal/uploads/2021/09/2021-foundationmodel-1024x692.png"></p><p> Source: Bommasani Rishi et. al. (2022) &quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf"><u>On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</u></a> &quot;</p><p> The costs for developing models from scratch is also increasing due to a multitude of factors. If models were trained on the supervised learning (SL) paradigm, then the developers must either already have a large dataset, or in scenarios where the necessary dataset does not already exist, they must generate their own data, directing precious resources—both monetary and temporal—toward the careful labeling of the data.</p><p> <i><strong>SSL (Semi-Supervised Learning)</strong> is a learning approach that combines labeled and unlabeled data during training to improve the performance of machine learning models.</i></p><p> Achieving state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks demands that the learning process be anchored in millions, if not billions, of examples. Foundation models provide a solution to this by leveraging Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). SSL algorithms use both labeled and unlabeled data during training. This allows the models to utilize the information present in the unlabeled examples to improve performance. The intuition behind SSL is that the unlabeled data contains valuable information about the underlying structure of the data, which can be used to enhance the model&#39;s generalization capabilities. By incorporating the unlabeled data, SSL algorithms aim to learn a more robust and accurate model compared to SL algorithms, especially when labeled data is limited or expensive to obtain. Once the foundation model is trained,  fine-tuning allows it to specialize and perform well on specific downstream tasks by using far fewer SL labeled examples. By fine-tuning the model on a smaller labeled dataset, the model can leverage the knowledge it acquired during SSL training and adapt it to the specific task, resulting in overall improved performance.</p><p> Fine-tuning foundation models might be cheaper than training a model from scratch, however the cost to train the base model itself keeps increasing. Foundation models are extremely complex and require significant resources to develop, train, and deploy. Training can be extremely expensive, often involving tens of thousands of GPUs running continuously for months. These models are typically trained in specialized clusters and using carefully designed software systems. Such dedicated clusters can be both costly and difficult to obtain. There have also been recent efforts to mitigate the costs by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01288"><u>training foundation models in a decentralized manner in heterogeneous environments</u></a> . For narrowly-defined use-cases, that cost may not be justifiable, when a smaller model may achieve similar (or better) results for a much lower price.</p><p> <i><strong>Pre-training</strong> in the context of foundation models refers to the initial phase where a model is trained on a large, unlabeled dataset to learn general knowledge and patterns before fine-tuning it on specific tasks.</i></p><p> <i><strong>Transfer learning</strong> in the context of foundation models refers to the process of leveraging knowledge and patterns learned from a related task or domain with abundant labeled data to improve performance on a target task or domain with limited labeled data.</i></p><p> Leveraging advancements in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning"><u>transfer learning</u></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(machine_learning)"><u>fine-tuning</u></a> techniques, these foundation models can be harnessed to spawn specialized models tailored for specific objectives. This advancement amplifies the field&#39;s capacity to transfer acquired &quot;knowledge&quot; from one task and apply it effectively through the fine-tuning process to a distinct downstream task. Some notable foundation models include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v2"><u>BERT</u></a> , <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/"><u>GPT-3</u></a> , <a href="https://openai.com/gpt-4"><u>GPT-4</u></a> , <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent"><u>GATO</u></a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/"><u>CLIP</u></a> . </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/p8yhr6c2yz9yzguwxh6r"> Source: Bommasani Rishi et. al. (2022) &quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf"><u>On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</u></a> &quot;</p><p> This novel paradigm potentially provides a larger demographic with access to state-of-the-art capabilities, as well as the potential to train their own models with minimal data for highly specialized tasks. This potential access to capabilities is not guaranteed however,  does depend on the specific API options available, or on the availability of open-sourced foundation models that the users can rely upon.</p><p> Broadly speaking, there exist significant economic incentives to expand the capabilities and scale of foundation models. The authors of &quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf"><u>On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</u></a> &quot; foresee steady technological progress in the forthcoming years. Although foundation models presently manifest most robustly in natural language processing (NLP), this can be interpreted as a trend toward a new general paradigm of AI development. As of January 2023, efforts by DeepMind to train a reinforcement learning (RL) foundation model—an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07608"><u>&quot;adaptive agent&quot; (AdA)</u></a> —have also been undertaken. These RL agents are trained in an open ended task space (XLand 2.0) which require different skill sets such as experimentation, tool use or division of labor. If language-based foundation models are general-purpose text generators, then the AdA model could conceivably be viewed as a relatively more general-purpose task follower compared to other models observed thus far.</p><p> However, this paradigm also carries inherent risks, namely the emergence of capabilities and homogenization.</p><ul><li> <strong>Homogenization</strong> : Since an increasing number of models are becoming merely &quot;fine-tuned&quot; versions of foundation models, it follows that downstream AI systems might inherit the same problematic biases prevalent in a few foundation models. Thus, all failure categories present in the base model could potentially percolate through all models trained with this as the foundation.</li><li> <strong>Emergence</strong> : Homogenization could potentially provide enormous gains for many domains, but aggressive homogenization of capabilities might result in unexpected and unexplainable behavior arising as a function of scale. Emergence implies that a system&#39;s behavior is implicitly induced rather than explicitly constructed. These characteristics render the models challenging to understand. They also give rise to unforeseen failure modes and unanticipated consequences. This phenomenon is talked about in more detail below.</li></ul><h1> 2.0: Leveraging Computation</h1><p> Although fine-tuning and transfer learning are the mechanisms that render foundation models feasible, it is scale that makes them truly powerful. This section delves into the concept of model scaling and the leveraging of computation—advancements in computer hardware (eg, GPU throughput and memory), new architectures (eg the transformer), and the availability of increasing amounts of training data.</p><h2> 2.1: The Bitter Lesson</h2><blockquote><p> <i>The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. … [The bitter lesson teaches us] the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.</i> - Sutton, Rich (March 2019) “ <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html"><u>The Bitter Lesson</u></a> ”</p></blockquote><p> Traditionally, AI research has predominantly designed systems under the assumption that a fixed amount of computing power will be available to the designed agent. However, over time, computing power so far has been expanding in line with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law"><u>Moore&#39;s law</u></a> (number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every 1.5 years). Consequently, researchers can either leverage their human knowledge of the domain or exploit increases in general-purpose computational methods. Theoretically, the two are mutually compatible, but in practice, the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods, rendering them less suited to harnessing general methods that leverage computation.</p><p> Several instances in history underscore this bitter lesson for AI researchers:</p><ul><li> <strong>Games</strong> : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)"><u>Deep Blue</u></a> defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov by leveraging a vast deep search, disheartening computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that capitalized on the human understanding of chess&#39;s unique structure. Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo"><u>AlphaGo</u></a> triumphed over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"><u>Go</u></a> world champion Lee Sedol using deep learning combined with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search"><u>Monte Carlo tree search</u></a> for move selection, eschewing human-engineered Go techniques. Within a year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero"><u>AlphaZero</u></a> , forsaking any human-generated Go data, used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play_(reinforcement_learning_technique)"><u>self-play</u></a> to defeat AlphaGo. None of these successive enhancements in game-playing capabilities hinged on any fundamental breakthroughs in human Go knowledge.</li><li> <strong>Vision</strong> : A similar pattern has unfolded in computer vision. Earlier methods employed human-engineered features and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)"><u>convolution kernels</u></a> for image recognition tasks. However, over the years, it has been determined that leveraging more computation and permitting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network"><u>convolutional neural nets (CNNs)</u></a> to learn their own features yield superior performance.</li><li> <strong>Language &amp; Speech</strong> : In 1970, the DARPA SUR (Speech Understanding Research) was held. One faction endeavored to leverage expert knowledge of words, phonemes, the human vocal tract, etc. In contrast, the other side employed newer, more statistical methods that necessitated considerably more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). This example shows yet again, that the statistical methods surpassed the human-knowledge-based methods. Since then, deep learning recurrent neural network-based or transformer-based methods have virtually dominated the field of sequence-based tasks.</li></ul><p> Historically, due to repeated reminders of the bitter lesson, the field of AI has increasingly learned to favor general-purpose methods of search and learning. This trend fortifies the intuition behind the immense scale of the current foundation model paradigm. It can be projected that the capabilities of the current foundation models will continue to scale commensurately with increasing computation. The reasons for this claim are presented in the following sections. The immediately ensuing section delves into these trends of scale in compute, dataset size, and parameter count.</p><h2> 2.2: Compute trends</h2><p> Several key factors dictate the relationship between the scale and capability of current ML models:</p><ul><li> <strong>Compute</strong> : Extended training runs (measured in epochs) generally result in lower <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jnmG5jczvWbeRPcvG/four-usages-of-loss-in-ai"><u>loss</u></a> . The total computational power needed partially depends on the training duration. ML engineers typically aim for asymptotically diminishing returns before halting the training process.</li><li> <strong>Dataset size</strong> : The larger the training dataset, the more information the model can analyze during each training run. As a result, training runs are generally longer, which in turn increases the total computational power needed before the model can be deemed &quot;trained.&quot;</li><li> <strong>Parameter Count</strong> : For each training example, the model needs to calculate the loss and then use backpropagation to update all relevant parameters. The more parameters the model has, the more computation-intensive this process becomes.</li></ul><p> Below is a chart illustrating the impact of each of these three factors on model loss. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/helgihhtclgshu0skvfd"></p><p> Source: Kaplan, Jared et. al. (Jan 2020) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361"><u>Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models</u></a> ”</p><p> With graphical processing units (GPUs), and tensor processing units (TPUs) improving in performance and reducing in cost annually, AI models are demonstrating increasingly impressive results. This leads to higher acceptance of substantial compute costs. The reduced cost of computation, coupled with the paradigm of foundation models trained on escalating volumes of data, suggests that all three variables—compute, dataset size, and parameter count—will continue to expand in the forthcoming years. However, it remains an open question whether merely scaling these factors will result in unmanageable capabilities.</p><p> The following example offers a tangible illustration of capabilities escalating with an increasing parameter count in image generation models. The same model architecture ( <a href="https://parti.research.google/"><u>Parti</u></a> ) is used to generate an image using an identical prompt, with the sole difference between the models being the parameter size.</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><p> 350M</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top"><p> 750M</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top"><p> 3B</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top"><p> 20B </p></td></tr><tr><td style="padding:5pt;vertical-align:top"><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/v6o0nzfkmeu1y99qvbna"></figure></td><td style="padding:5pt;vertical-align:top"><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/c5yfkxw63nywxrmbh3lw"></figure></td><td style="padding:5pt;vertical-align:top"><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/rjfdf0yatxhikiwkpff7"></figure></td><td style="padding:5pt;vertical-align:top"><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/tmgn06qmja88qwnifqhu"></figure></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top" colspan="4"><p> Prompt: <i>A portrait photo of a kangaroo wearing an orange hoodie and blue sunglasses standing on the grass in front of the Sydney Opera House holding a sign on the chest that says Welcome Friends!</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> Source: GoogleAI (2022) , &quot; <a href="https://parti.research.google/"><i><u>Parti (Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image model)</u></i></a> &quot;</p><p> Increased numbers of parameters not only enhance image quality but also aid the network in generalizing in various ways. More parameters enable the model to generate accurate representations of complex elements, such as hands and text, which are notoriously challenging. There are noticeable leaps in quality, and somewhere between 3 billion and 20 billion parameters, the model acquires the ability to spell words correctly. Parti is the first model with the ability to spell correctly. Before Parti, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uKp6tBFStnsvrot5t/what-dall-e-2-can-and-cannot-do"><u>it was uncertain</u></a> if such an ability could be obtained merely through scaling, but it is now evident that spelling correctly is another capability gained simply by leveraging scale.</p><p> The following section briefly introduces efforts by both OpenAI and DeepMind to formalize the relationships between scale and capabilities.</p><h2> 2.3: Scaling Laws</h2><p> <i>Scaling laws articulate the relationship between compute, dataset size, parameter count, and model capabilities. They&#39;re employed to scale models effectively and optimally allocate resources with respect to capabilities.</i></p><p> Training large foundation models like GPT is expensive. When potentially millions of dollars are invested in training AI models, developers need to ensure that funds are efficiently allocated. Developers need to decide on an appropriate resource allocation between - model size, training time, and dataset size. OpenAI developed the first generation of formal neural scaling laws in their 2020 paper “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361"><i><u>Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models</u></i></a> ”, moving away from reliance on experience and intuition.</p><p> To determine such relationships some elements are held fixed while others are varied. As an example data can be kept constant, while parameter count and training time are varied, or parameter count is kept constant and data amounts are varied, etc… This allows a measurement of the relative contribution of each towards overall performance. Such experiments allow the development of concrete relationships that OpenAI called scaling laws.</p><p> These scaling laws guided decisions on trade-offs, such as: Should a developer invest in a license to train on Stack Overflow&#39;s data, or should they invest in more GPUs? Would it be efficient if they continue to cover the extra electricity costs incurred by longer model training? If access to compute increases tenfold, how many parameters should be added to the model for optimal use of GPUs? For sizable language models like GPT-3, these trade-offs might resemble choosing between training a 20-billion parameter model on 40% of an internet archive or a 200-billion parameter model on just 4% of the same archive.</p><p> The paper presented several scaling laws. One scaling law compares model shape and model size, and found that performance correlates strongly with scale and weakly with architectural hyperparameters of model shape such as depth vs. width.</p><p> Another law compared the relative performance contribution of the different factors of scale - data, training steps, and parameter count. They found that larger language models tend to be more sample efficient, meaning they can achieve better performance with less data. The following graph shows this relationship between relative contributions of different factors in scaling models. The graph indicates that for optimally compute-efficient training “ <i>most of the increase should go towards increased model size. A relatively small increase in data is needed to avoid reuse. Of the increase in data, most can be used to increase parallelism through larger batch sizes, with only a very small increase in serial training time required.”</i> As an example, according to OpenAI&#39;s results if you get 10x more compute, you increase your model size by about 5x and your data size by about 2x. Another 10x in compute, and model size is 25x bigger and data size is only 4x bigger. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/zymupfwgncvce0ycmfdm"></p><p> Source: Kaplan, Jared et. al.

(Jul 2022) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02852"><u>Machine Learning Model Sizes and the Parameter Gap</u></a> ”</p><p> In 2022, DeepMind provided an update to these scaling laws by publishing a paper called “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556"><u>Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models</u></a> ”. They choose 9 different quantities of compute, ranging from about 10^18 FLOPs to 10^21 FLOPs. They hold the compute fixed at these amounts, and then for each quantity of compute, they train many different-sized models. Because the quantity of compute is constant for each level, the smaller models are trained for more time and the larger models for less. Based on their research DeepMind concluded that for every increase in compute, you should increase data size and model size by approximately the <i>same amount</i> . If you get a 10x increase in compute, you should make your model 3.1x times bigger and the data you train over 3.1x bigger; if you get a 100x increase in compute, you should make your model 10x bigger and your data 10x bigger.</p><p> To validate this law, DeepMind trained a 70-billion parameter model (&quot;Chinchilla&quot;) using the same compute as had been used for the 280-billion parameter model Gopher. That is, the smaller Chinchilla was trained with 1.4 trillion tokens, whereas the larger Gopher was only trained with 300 billion tokens. As predicted by the new scaling laws, Chinchilla surpasses Gopher in almost every metric.</p><p> Such finding have led to the formulation of a scaling hypothesis:</p><blockquote><p> <i>The strong scaling hypothesis is that, once we find a scalable architecture like self-attention or convolutions, which like the brain can be applied fairly uniformly (eg.</i> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine"><i><u>“The Brain as a Universal Learning Machine”</u></i></a> <i>or Hawkins), we can simply train ever larger NNs and ever more sophisticated behavior will emerge naturally as the easiest way to optimize for all the tasks &amp; data. More powerful NNs are &#39;just&#39; scaled-up weak NNs, in much the same way that human brains look much like scaled-up primate brains.</i> - Gwern (2022) “ <a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis"><i><u>The Scaling Hypothesis</u></i></a> ”</p></blockquote><p> Current projections are that “ <i>the stock of high-quality language data will be exhausted soon;可能会在 2026 年之前。相比之下，低质量的语言数据和图像数据的库存要晚得多才会耗尽； 2030 年至 2050 年（低质量语言）和 2030 年至 2060 年（图像）。</i> ” - Villalobos, Pablo et. al. (Oct 2022) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04325"><i><u>Will we run out of data? An analysis of the limits of scaling datasets in Machine Learning</u></i></a> ” So in conclusion, we can anticipate that models will continue to scale in the near future. Increased scale combined with the increasingly general-purpose nature of foundation models could potentially lead to a sustained growth in general-purpose AI capabilities. The following section explores different AI capability thresholds that we might observe if the current trends persist.</p><h1> 3.0: Capabilities</h1><p> This section continues the discussion around increasing AI capabilities. It focuses in particular on certain thresholds that we might reach in the cognitive capabilities of these AI models. This flows into a discussion around how certain thresholds when once achieved might result in an intelligence explosion.</p><p> Capabilities refer to the overall ability of an AI system to solve or perform tasks in specific domains. It is a measure of how well the system can achieve its intended objectives and the extent of its cognitive power. Evaluating capabilities involves assessing the system&#39;s performance in specific domains, taking into account factors such as available computational resources and performance metrics. A possible element of confusion might be between capabilities and good performance on certain benchmarks. Benchmark performance refers to the performance of an AI system on specific tasks or datasets. These are designed to evaluate the system&#39;s performance on well-defined tasks and provide a standardized way to compare different AI models. Benchmark performance can be used as a proxy to assess the system&#39;s capabilities in certain domains, but it may not capture the full extent of the system&#39;s overall capabilities.</p><h2> 3.1: Capabilities vs. Intelligence</h2><ul><li> Krakovna, Victoria (Aug 2023) “ <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JtuTQgp9Wnd6R6F5s/when-discussing-ai-risks-talk-about-capabilities-not"><i><u>When discussing AI risks, talk about capabilities, not intelligence</u></i></a> ”</li></ul><p> It is worth noting that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144uOfr4SYA"><u>public discussions</u></a> about catastrophic risks from general AI systems are often derailed by using the word “intelligence”. People often have different definitions of intelligence, or associate it with concepts like consciousness that are not relevant to AI risks, or dismiss the risks because intelligence is not well-defined. This is why using the term “capabilities” or “competence” instead of “intelligence” when discussing catastrophic risks from AI is often better since this is what the concerns are really about. For example, instead of “superintelligence” we can refer to “super-competence” or “superhuman capabilities”.</p><p> There are various issues with the word “intelligence” that make it less suitable than “capabilities” for discussing risks from general AI systems:</p><ul><li> <strong>Anthropomorphism</strong> : people often specifically associate “intelligence” with being human, being conscious, being alive, or having human-like emotions (none of which are relevant to or a prerequisite for risks posed by general AI systems).</li><li> <strong>Associations with harmful beliefs and ideologies.</strong></li><li> <strong>Moving goalposts</strong> : impressive achievements in AI are often dismissed as not indicating “true intelligence” or “real understanding” (eg the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot"><u>“stochastic parrots”</u></a> argument). Catastrophic risk concerns are based on what the AI system can do, not whether it has “real understanding” of language or the world.</li><li> <strong>Stronger associations with less risky capabilities</strong> : people are more likely to associate “intelligence” with being really good at math than being really good at politics, while the latter may be more representative of capabilities that make general AI systems pose a risk (eg manipulation and deception capabilities that could enable the system to overpower humans).</li><li> <strong>High level of abstraction</strong> : “intelligence” can take on the quality of a mythical ideal that can&#39;t be met by an actual AI system, while “competence” is more conducive to being specific about the capability level in question.</li></ul><p> That being said, since the history of conversation on AI risks often does involve the words “intelligence” the following section starts by giving a quick overview of a myriad of definitions that are commonly used in the field.</p><h2> 3.2: Definitions of advanced AI Systems</h2><p> This section explores various definitions of different AI capability thresholds. The following list encompasses some of the most frequently used terms:</p><p> <strong>Intelligence</strong> : Intelligence measures an agent&#39;s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. - Legg, Shane; Hutter, Marcus; (Dec 2007) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3329"><i><u>Universal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence</u></i></a> ”</p><p> <strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</strong> : A term designating artificial intelligence systems that are tailored to handle a single or a limited task. These systems are &#39;narrow&#39; because they tend to be superhuman at a very specific task domain.</p><p> <strong>Transformative AI (TAI):</strong> Refers to potential future AI that triggers a transition equivalent to, or more significant than, the agricultural or industrial revolution. This term aims to be more inclusive, acknowledging the possibility of AI systems that qualify as &quot;transformative,&quot; despite lacking many abilities that humans possess. - Karnofsky, Holden; (May 2016) &quot; <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/some-background-on-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence/"><i><u>Some Background on Our Views Regarding Advanced Artificial Intelligence</u></i></a> &quot;</p><p> <strong>Human-Level AI (HLAI)</strong> : Encompasses AIs that can solve the majority of <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/human-level-ai/"><u>cognitive problems an average human can solve</u></a> . This concept contrasts with current AI, which is vastly superhuman at certain tasks while weaker at others.</p><p> <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong> : Refers to AIs that can apply their intelligence to a similarly extensive range of domains as humans. These AIs do not need to perform all tasks; they merely need to be capable enough to invent tools to facilitate the completion of tasks. Much like how humans are not perfectly capable in all domains but can invent tools to make problems in all domains easier to solve.</p><p> AGI often gets described as the ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments using limited computational resources. This includes efficient cross-domain optimization and the ability to transfer learning from one domain to another. - Muehlhauser, Luke (Aug 2013) “ <a href="https://intelligence.org/2013/08/11/what-is-agi/"><i><u>What is AGI?</u></i></a> ”</p><p> <strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</strong> : “This is any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest&quot;. - Bostrom, Nick (2014) “ <i>Superintelligence</i> ”</p><p> Often, these terms get used as discrete capability thresholds; that is, individuals tend to categorize an AI as potentially an AGI, an ASI, or neither. However, it has been proposed that it might be more beneficial to view the capabilities of AI systems on a continuous scale rather than one involving discrete jumps. To this end, Richard Ngo proposed the (t,n)-AGI framework, which allows for a more formal definition of continuous AGI capabilities.</p><h2> 3.3: (t,n)-AGI</h2><ul><li> Ngo, Richard (May 2023) “ <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BoA3agdkAzL6HQtQP/clarifying-and-predicting-agi"><u>Clarifying and predicting AGI</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> <i>A system receives the designation of &quot; <strong>t-AGI</strong> &quot; if it can surpass a human expert in a certain cognitive task within the timespan &#39;t&#39;. A system gets identified as <strong>(t,n)-AGI</strong> if it can outdo a group of &#39;n&#39; human experts working collectively on a set of cognitive tasks for the duration &#39;t&#39;.</i></p><p> For instance, if both a human expert and an AI receive one second to perform a task, the system would be labeled a &quot;one-second AGI&quot; if it accomplishes that cognitive task more effectively than the expert. Similarly, designations of one-minute, one-month, and so forth, AGIs could apply if their outputs surpass what human experts could achieve within a minute, month, and so on.</p><p> Richard Ngo makes further predictions regarding the types of capabilities in which an AI might surpass humans at different &#39;t&#39; thresholds.</p><ul><li> <strong>One-second AGI</strong> : Recognizing objects in images, determining whether sentences are grammatical, answering trivia.</li><li> <strong>One-minute AGI</strong> : Answering questions about short text passages or videos, common-sense reasoning (eg, <a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1639696127132835840"><u>Yann LeCun&#39;s gears problems</u></a> ), performing simple computer tasks (eg, using Photoshop to blur an image), looking up facts.</li><li> <strong>One-hour AGI</strong> : Completing problem sets/exams, composing short articles or blog posts, executing most tasks in white-collar jobs (eg, diagnosing patients, providing legal opinions), conducting therapy.</li><li> <strong>One-day AGI</strong> : Writing insightful essays, negotiating business deals, developing new apps, running scientific experiments, reviewing scientific papers, summarizing books.</li><li> <strong>One-month AGI</strong> : Carrying out medium-term plans coherently (eg, founding a startup), supervising large projects, becoming proficient in new fields, writing large software applications (eg, a new operating system), making novel scientific discoveries.</li><li> <strong>One-year AGI</strong> : These AIs would need to outdo humans in practically every area, given that most projects can be divided into sub-tasks that can be completed in shorter timeframes.</li></ul><p> As of the third quarter of 2023, existing systems are believed to qualify as one-second AGIs, and are considered to be nearing the level of one-minute AGIs. They might be a few years away from becoming one-hour AGIs. Within this framework, Richard Ngo anticipates superintelligence (ASI) to be something akin to a (one year, eight billion)-AGI, that is, an ASI would be an AGI that takes one year to outperform all eight billion humans coordinating on a given task.</p><p> Although AGI could be measured according to the proposed continuous framework, there might still be abrupt jumps in capabilities due to a phenomenon known as emergence. This topic gets explored in the subsequent section.</p><h2> 3.3: Formalizing Capabilities</h2><p> The following papers will be fully integrated in the future for a proper discussion on formalizing the concept of AGI capabilities. For now please refer directly to the sources:</p><ul><li> <strong>Situational Awareness</strong> : Owain Evans (Sep 2023) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00667"><u>Taken out of context: On measuring situational awareness in LLMs</u></a> ”</li><li> <strong>Power Seeking</strong> : Alexander Matt Turner (Jan 2023) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683"><u>Optimal Policies Tend to Seek Power</u></a> ”</li></ul><h1> 4.0: Threat Models</h1><p> This section explores the question - Even if capabilities continue to increase as the previous sections forecast, why is that even a concern? As advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) continue, a critical analysis of their implications and potential risks becomes essential. The hypothesis suggesting catastrophic risk from general AI, as presented so far, consists of two key assertions:</p><p> First, global technological advancements are progressing towards the creation of generally capable AI systems within the forthcoming few decades. Second, these generally capable AI systems possess the potential to out compete or overpower humans.</p><p> The previous sections presented evidence supporting the first assertion. This section provides arguments for the second. It first explores why a machine intelligence might possess the capability to swiftly increase its cognitive abilities. Next, there is a discussion of why a machine intelligence might even have motivations to expand its capabilities. Finally, the section explores why it should not be taken for granted that a highly capable machine intelligence will be beneficial for humans by default.</p><h2> 4.1: Intelligence Explosion</h2><ul><li> Muehlhauser, Luke; Salamon, Anna (2012) “ <a href="https://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf"><u>Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> <i>An &quot;intelligence explosion&quot; denotes a scenario where machine intelligence swiftly enhances its own cognitive capabilities, resulting in a substantial advancement in ability.</i></p><p> Muehlhauser and Salamon delve into the numerous advantages machine intelligence holds over human intelligence, which facilitate rapid intelligence augmentation.这些包括：</p><ul><li> <strong>Computational Resources:</strong> Human computational ability remains somewhat stationary, whereas machine computation possesses scalability.</li><li> <strong>Communication speed</strong> : Given the relatively low speed of neurons (only at 75 m/s), the human brain necessitates parallelized computation algorithms. Machines, on the other hand, operate on communications at the speed of light, which substantially augments prospects for sequential processes.</li><li> <strong>Duplicability</strong> : Machines exhibit effortless duplicability. Unlike humans they do not need birth, education, or training. While humans predominantly improve individually, machines have the potential to grow collectively.</li><li> <strong>Editability</strong> : Machines potentially allow more regulated variations. They exemplify the equivalent of direct brain enhancements via neurosurgery in opposition to laborious education or training requirements.</li><li> <strong>Goal coordination</strong> : Copied AIs possess the capability to share goals effortlessly, a feat challenging for humans.</li></ul><h2> 4.2: Instrumental Convergence</h2><ul><li> Bostrom, Nick (2014) “ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KewDov1taegTzrqJ4uurmJ2CJ0Y72EU3/view"><u>Superintelligence</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> The points mentioned earlier validate the potential of machine intelligence to enhance its cognitive capabilities. Nonetheless, an exploration into the motives behind such an ambition remains necessary. To illustrate, consider the relationship between levels of intelligence and the corresponding goals. This examination leads to one of two seminal theses offered by Nick Bostrom:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Orthogonality Thesis</strong> : <i>Intelligence and final goals are orthogonal: more or less any level of intelligence could in principle be combined with more or less any final goal.</i> - Bostrom, Nick (2014) “ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KewDov1taegTzrqJ4uurmJ2CJ0Y72EU3/view"><u>Superintelligence</u></a> ”</p></blockquote><p> This thesis implies that an AI system&#39;s objectives must be aligned explicitly with human virtues and interests, as no guarantee exists that an AI will automatically adopt or prioritize human values. The Orthogonality Thesis doesn&#39;t suggest compatibility of all agent designs with all goals, instead, it indicates the potential for at least one agent design for any combination of goals and intelligence level. Consequently, if any intelligent system can be paired with any goal, is it possible to hypothesize meaningfully about the type of goals future AI Systems might harbor?绝对地。 This leads to Bostrom&#39;s second thesis:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Instrumental Convergence Thesis</strong> : <i>Several instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sense that their attainment would increase the chances of the agent&#39;s goal being realized for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a  broad spectrum of situated intelligent agents.</i> - Bostrom, Nick (2014) “ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KewDov1taegTzrqJ4uurmJ2CJ0Y72EU3/view"><u>Superintelligence</u></a> ”</p></blockquote><p> A terminal goal, also known as an &quot;intrinsic goal&quot; or &quot;intrinsic value”, is an objective that an agent appreciates for its own sake. On the other hand, an instrumental goal is pursued to increase the likelihood of achieving its terminal goals. Instrumental convergence encompasses the notion that certain instrumental values or goals could potentially be pursued by a broad array of intelligent agents, irrespective of their designated final goals. The Instrumental Convergence Thesis underscores potential hazards affiliated with sophisticated AI systems. It infers that even if an AI system&#39;s ultimate goal appears harmless, it could still embark on actions conflicting with human interests, owing to a convergence of several instrumental values such as resource acquisition and potential threats&#39; elimination. One can categorize self-preservation, goal-content integrity, cognitive enhancement, and resource acquisition as instrumentally convergent goals.</p><p> In the wake of Bostrom&#39;s introduction of these theses in 2014, research has been undertaken to substantiate the existence of instrumentally convergent goals. &quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683"><i><u>Optimal Policies Tend to Seek Power</u></i></a> &quot; a paper by Turner et al., provides research supporting the existence of instrumentally convergent goals  in modern machine learning systems.</p><h2> 4.3: Emergence</h2><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"><i><strong><u>Emergent behavior</u></strong></i></a> <i>, or emergence, manifests when a system exhibits properties or behaviors that its individual components lack independently. These attributes may materialize only when the components comprising the system interact as an integrated whole, or when the quantity of parts crosses a particular threshold. Often, these characteristics appear &quot;all at once&quot;—beyond the threshold, the system&#39;s behavior undergoes a qualitative transformation.</i></p><p> The sections discussing computational trends and scaling laws showed the increasing scale of current foundational models. Numerous complex systems in nature exhibit qualitatively distinct behavior resulting from quantitative increases in scale. These properties, termed &#39;emergent&#39;, occur simultaneously. Examples of complex systems with such attributes in nature include:</p><ul><li> The heart: While individual cells cannot pump blood, the entirety of the heart can.</li><li> Uranium: Small quantities are mundane, but large amounts can initiate nuclear reactions.</li><li> Civilization: Individuals may seem ordinary, but through collective specialization (different individuals focusing on skills that are irrelevant in isolation), human civilization becomes possible. Another example of this is bees and ants. Ants have one of the smallest brains relative to their body, but ant colonies are capable of producing very complex behavior.</li></ul><p> In &quot; <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4aARF2ZoBpFZAhbbe"><u>More Is Different for AI</u></a> &quot; Jacob Steinhardt provides additional examples of such complex systems. Steinhardt further conjectures that AI systems will manifest such emergent properties as a function of scale. Assuming that models persist in growing as per the scaling laws, an unexpected threshold may soon be crossed, resulting in unanticipated differences in behaviors and capabilities. Studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system"><u>complex systems</u></a> with emergent phenomena may assist in predicting what capabilities will emerge and when. In other words, there is a possibility of observing capability leaps between the thresholds (eg, a sudden leap from AI to HLAI to AGI) discussed in the preceding section, even if the models are simply scaled up.</p><p> Besides the factors already covered in the section on computational trends, the following elements also suggest that future ML systems will differ quantitatively from current models:</p><ul><li> Data Storage Capacities: A decrease in the cost to store one byte per dollar.</li><li> Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning: The capability to learn from fewer examples.</li><li> Grokking: Sudden improved generalization after extended periods of training.</li></ul><p> This further implies that these future models have the potential to manifest emergent behavior that could be qualitatively distinct from what is observed today. In the paper “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15324"><u>Model evaluation for extreme risks</u></a> ” DeepMind found that as AI progress has evolved, general-purpose AI systems have often exhibited new and unpredictable capabilities – including harmful ones that their developers did not anticipate. Future systems may reveal even more perilous emergent capabilities, such as the potential to conduct offensive cyber operations, manipulate individuals through conversation, or provide actionable instructions for carrying out acts of terrorism.</p><h2> 4.4: Four Background Claims</h2><ul><li> Soares, Nate (July 2015) “ <a href="https://intelligence.org/2015/07/24/four-background-claims/"><i><u>Four Background Claims</u></i></a> ”</li></ul><p> In the concluding part of this section, we will delve into four essential claims that lay the groundwork for the concerns associated with ASI as put forth by MIRI.</p><p> <i><u>Claim 1: Humans Exhibit General Intelligence</u></i></p><p> Humans are capable of solving an array of problems across various domains, demonstrating their general intelligence. The importance of this claim lies in the fact that this form of general intelligence has led humans to become the dominant species on Earth.</p><p> <i><u>Claim 2: AI Systems Could Surpass Human Intelligence</u></i></p><p> While it remains uncertain when machines might attain superior intelligence to humans, it is conceivable that they have the potential to do so. Considering the brief evolutionary period between chimpanzees and generally intelligent humans, we can conclude that human intelligence is not incomprehensibly complex, suggesting we will eventually comprehend and replicate it.</p><p> Man-made machines consistently outperform their biological counterparts (cars vs. horses, planes vs. birds, etc.). Thus, it is rational to assume that just as birds are not the pinnacle of flight, humans are not the apex of intelligence. Therefore, it is plausible to foresee a future where machines out-think humans.</p><p> <i><u>Claim 3: Highly Intelligent AI Systems Will Shape the Future</u></i></p><p> Historically, confrontations between human groups have often culminated with the technologically superior faction dominating its competitor. Numerous reasons suggest that an AI system could attain a higher intelligence level than humans, thereby enabling it to intellectually outsmart or socially manipulate humans. Consequently, if we care about our future, it is prudent to study the processes that could significantly influence the direction of future events.</p><p> <i><u>Claim 4: Highly Intelligent AI Systems Will Not Be Beneficial by Default</u></i></p><p> Though a sufficiently intelligent AI may comprehend human desires, this does not inherently mean it will act in accordance with them. Moreover, even if an AI executes the tasks as we&#39;ve programmed it to — with precision and adherence to instructions — most human values can lead to undesirable consequences when interpreted literally. For example, an AI programmed to cure cancer could resort to kidnapping and experimenting on humans.</p><p> This claim is critical as it indicates that merely enhancing the ability of AI systems to understand our goals is not sufficient. The systems must also have a desire to act in accordance with our goals. This also underscores the importance of studying and formalizing human goals such that the intentions behind them can be properly communicated.</p><p></p><h1> 5.0: Timelines &amp; Forecasting</h1><p> The previous sections have illustrated that capabilities will likely continue to increase, potentially leading to capability jumps due to phenomena such as emergence and intelligence explosion. This final section of the chapter investigates AI timeline forecasts and takeoff dynamics. AI timeline forecasts entail discussing when researchers/forecasters expect various milestones in AI development to be achieved. This includes for example various benchmarks of progress, the emergence of mouse-level intelligence, and the manifestation of human-like qualities in AI, such as external tool use and long-term planning. The next section shares the insights of researchers who have gathered evidence from domain experts regarding when these capability thresholds might be reached.</p><p> Anchors in forecasting refer to reference classes or frameworks that are used to make predictions about future events or systems. These anchors serve as points of comparison or analogy that help inform our understanding and reasoning about the future. There are several common anchors used to inform predictions about the development and capabilities of future AI systems. These anchors provide reference points and frameworks for reasoning about AI progress. Some of the most common anchors include:</p><ul><li> <strong>Current ML Systems</strong> : The current state of machine learning systems serves as a starting point for forecasting future AI capabilities. By examining the strengths and limitations of existing ML systems, researchers can make educated guesses about the trajectory of AI development.</li><li> <strong>Human Anchors</strong> : Anchors based on human abilities and characteristics are often used in AI forecasting. These include areas where humans excel compared to current ML systems, such as mastery of external tools, efficient learning, and long-term planning.</li><li> <strong>Biological Anchors</strong> : Biological anchors draw inspiration from biological systems, particularly the human brain, to estimate the computational requirements of future AI systems. These anchors consider factors such as the neural network anchor, which estimates the compute-equivalent used in the human brain, and the human lifetime anchor, which estimates the compute-equivalent involved in training a human brain from birth to adulthood.</li><li> <strong>Thought Experiments</strong> : Thought experiments provide a third anchor by imagining hypothetical scenarios and reasoning through their implications. These experiments help explore the potential behavior and characteristics of future AI systems.</li></ul><p> It&#39;s important to note that the choice and weighting of anchors can vary depending on the specific forecasting approach and the context of the predictions being made. Different researchers may emphasize different anchors based on their assumptions and perspectives. This book will only explore the biological anchor in further detail.</p><h2> 5.1: Biological Anchors</h2><p> Biological anchors are a set of reference points or estimates used in forecasting the development of transformative AI systems. These anchors are inspired by biological systems, particularly the human brain, and provide a basis for estimating the computational requirements of AI systems capable of performing transformative tasks. The <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KrJfoZzpSDpnrv9va/draft-report-on-ai-timelines"><u>draft report on AI timelines</u></a> in Sep 2020 by Ajeya Cotra details the methodology used, addressing several questions:</p><ol><li> <strong>How much computation does the human brain perform?</strong> According to the report, the brain has an estimated 10^15 total synapses. With each synapse spiking approximately once per second and each spike representing roughly one floating point operation (FLOP), the brain&#39;s computational power is estimated to range between 10^13 and 10^17 FLOP/S. This variance takes into account the potential efficiency differences between human brains and computers.</li><li> <strong>How much training would it take to replicate this much inferential computation?</strong> It&#39;s important to note that training computation differs from inferential computation. Modern ML practices involve training advanced models on massive supercomputers and running them on medium-sized ones. An adult human&#39;s inference computation power is estimated at ~10^16 FLOP/S. To account for the total training computation costs, the report multiplies the computation of a single brain (10^15 FLOP/S) by the time taken from childhood to adolescence (10^9 seconds). This gives a lower bound estimate of 10^24 FLOP. However, the estimate increases to 10^41 FLOP when also considering the training data ingrained in our biology through evolution.</li><li> <strong>How can we adjust this computation estimate for algorithmic progress?</strong> An algorithmic efficiency report suggests the training efficiency for Neural Networks doubles every sixteen months. Cotra proposes a slightly longer doubling time of 2-3 years.</li><li> <strong>How much money does this amount of computation cost?</strong> In 2020, computational resources were priced at $1 for 10^17 FLOP/S, implying that 10^33 FLOP/S would cost $10^16 (ten quadrillion dollars). This cost decreases annually, with some versions of Moore&#39;s Law suggesting that compute costs halve every eighteen months. As a result, training costs (in FLOP/S) will reduce over time due to algorithmic progress, and the cost of FLOP/S (in dollars) will also decrease due to hardware advancements.</li><li> <strong>What year does this computational cost become reasonable?</strong> The median result is a 10% chance by 2031, a 50% chance by 2052, and an 80% chance by 2100.</li></ol><p> Cotra acknowledges potential limitations with this approach, such as the assumption that progress relies on an easily-measured quantity (FLOP/S) rather than on fundamental advances, like new algorithms. Therefore, even with affordable, abundant computation, if we lack the algorithmic knowledge to create a proper thinking machine, any resulting AI might not display human level or superintelligent capabilities.</p><p> The following graph gives an overview of the findings. Overall, the graph takes a weighted average of the different ways that the trajectory could flow. This gives us an estimate of a >;10% chance of transformative AI by 2036, a ~50% chance by 2055, and an ~80% chance by 2100.</p><p> <strong><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/enuzi8vbiou15dmrj7ik"></strong> Source: Holden Karnofsky (2021) &quot; <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vCaEnTbZ5KbypaGsm/forecasting-transformative-ai-the-biological-anchors-method"><u>Forecasting transformative AI: the &quot;biological anchors&quot; method in a nutshell</u></a> &quot;</p><p> In 2022 a <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines"><u>two-year update</u></a> on the author&#39;s (Ajeya Cotra) timelines was published.

As the statistical aphorism goes: &quot;All models are wrong, but some are useful&quot;. Biological anchors represent just one model, and other anchors should be considered when forming your own views on AI capabilities and the timeline for their emergence.</p><p></p><h1> <strong>6.0: Takeoff Dynamics</strong></h1><p> Takeoff dynamics primarily delve into the implications of the evolution of powerful artificial intelligence on the world. These definitions sketch different trajectories the world could follow as transformative AI emerges. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref9d83odnkksd"><sup><a href="#fn9d83odnkksd">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p> While timelines address when certain capabilities may emerge, takeoff dynamics explore what happens after these features surface. This chapter concludes with a section discussing various researchers&#39; perspectives on the potential trajectories of an intelligence explosion, considering factors such as takeoff speed, continuity, and homogeneity. This includes a discussion of - first, the pace and continuity of an intelligence explosion, and second, whether multiple AIs will coexist, each having different objectives, or whether they will eventually converge towards a single superintelligent entity.</p><h2> 6.1: Speed/Continuity</h2><p> Both AI takeoff speed and AI takeoff continuity describe the trajectory of AI development. Takeoff speed refers to the rate at which AI progresses or advances. Generally, takeoff continuity refers to the smoothness or lack of sudden jumps in AI development. Continuous takeoff means that the capabilities trajectory aligns with the expected progress based on past trends, while discontinuous takeoff refers to a trajectory that significantly exceeds the expected progress. FOOM is one type of fast takeoff scenario, and refers to a hypothetical scenario in which artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly and explosively surpasses human intelligence and capabilities.</p><p> The terms &quot;slow takeoff&quot; and &quot;soft takeoff&quot; are often used interchangeably, and similarly &quot;fast takeoff&quot; and &quot;hard takeoff&quot; and “FOOM” are also often used interchangeably. It&#39;s important to note that the definitions and implications of takeoff speed and takeoff continuity are still subjects of debate and may not be universally agreed upon by researchers in the field. Here are perspectives:</p><p> <i><u>Slow/Soft takeoff</u></i></p><p> When discussing takeoff speeds, Paul Christiano emphasizes the <a href="https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/"><u>parallel growth of AI capabilities and productivity</u></a> . He expects a slow takeoff in the development of AGI based on his characterization of takeoff speeds and his analysis of economic growth rates. He defines slow takeoff as a scenario where there will be a complete interval of several years in which world economic output doubles before the first interval of one year in which world economic output doubles. This definition emphasizes a gradual transition to higher growth rates. Overall, he postulates that the rise in AI capabilities will mirror an exponential growth pattern in the world GDP, resulting in a <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CjW4axQDqLd2oDCGG/misconceptions-about-continuous-takeoff#Continuous_doesn_t_necessarily_mean_slow"><u>continuous but moderate takeoff</u></a> .</p><p> In a similar vein, there have been <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mha5GA5BfWcpf2jHC/potential-bottlenecks-to-taking-over-the-world">some discussions</a> that the real obstacle to global domination is not the enhancement of cognitive abilities but more significant bottlenecks like avoiding coordinated human resistance and the physical acquisition and deployment of resources. These supply chain optimizations would increase productivity, hence GDP, which could serve as a measure for the speed of &quot;AI takeoff&quot;.</p><p> <i><u>Fast/Hard takeoff</u></i></p><p> A hard takeoff refers to a sudden, rather than gradual, transition to superintelligence, counter to the soft takeoff mentioned above. Eliezer Yudkowsky advocates for this view, suggesting a sudden and discontinuous change brought about by rapid self-improvement, while others, like Robin Hanson, support a more gradual, spread-out process. Yudkowsky argues that even regular improvement of AI by humans may cause significant leaps in capability to occur before recursive self-improvement begins.</p><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky also offers a counter to continuous takeoff proponents. He predicts a quick and abrupt &quot;intelligence explosion&quot;. This is because he rather doesn&#39;t expect AI to be integrated (quickly) enough into the economy for the GDP to increase significantly faster before FOOM. It is also possible that superintelligent AIs could mislead us about their capabilities, leading to lower-than-expected GDP growth. This would be followed by a sudden leap, or &quot;FOOM&quot;, when the AI acquires a substantial ability to influence the world, potentially overwhelming human technological and governance institutions.</p><p> These diverse views on takeoff speeds and continuity shape the strategies for AI safety, influencing how it should be pursued. Overall it is worth emphasizing that both fast and slow takeoffs are quite rapid (as in at most a few years).

For example, if every deployed system depends on the same model behind a single API, or if a single foundational model is trained and then fine-tuned in different ways by different actors. Homogeneity in AI systems could simplify cooperation and coordination, given their structural similarities. It also signifies that the alignment of the first advanced AI system is crucial, as it will likely influence future AI systems. One key factor for homogeneity is the economic incentives surrounding AI development and deployment. As the cost of training AI systems is expected to be significantly higher than the cost of running them, it becomes more economically advantageous to use existing AI systems rather than training new ones from scratch. This creates a preference for reusing or fine-tuning existing AI systems, leading to a higher likelihood of homogeneity in the deployed AI landscape</p><h2> 6.3: Polarity</h2><p> <i><strong>Unipolar</strong> refers to a scenario where a single agent or organization dominates and controls the world, while <strong>multipolar</strong> refers to a scenario where multiple entities coexist with different goals and levels of cooperation.</i></p><p> AI homogeneity evaluates the alignment similarities among AI systems, AI polarity examines the coexistence of both aligned and misaligned AI systems in a given context.</p><p> We might expect a unipolar takeoff, where a single AI system or project gains a decisive strategic advantage, due to several reasons. One key factor is the potential for a rapid takeoff, characterized by a fast increase in AI capabilities. If one project achieves a significant lead in AI development and surpasses others in terms of capabilities, it can establish a dominant position before competitors have a chance to catch up. A rapid takeoff can facilitate a unipolar outcome by enabling the leading project to quickly deploy its advanced AI system and gain a monopoly on the technology. This monopoly can provide substantial economic advantages, such as windfall profits, which further solidify the leading project&#39;s power and influence. Additionally, the presence of network effects can contribute to a unipolar takeoff. If the leading AI system becomes widely adopted and integrated into various sectors, it can create positive feedback loops that reinforce its dominance and make it increasingly difficult for other projects to compete.</p><p> We might expect a multipolar takeoff, where multiple AI projects undergo takeoff concurrently, due to several reasons. One factor is the potential for a slower takeoff process, which allows for more projects to reach advanced stages of AI development. In a slow takeoff scenario, there is a greater likelihood of multiple projects undergoing the transition in parallel, without any single project gaining a decisive strategic advantage. Another reason is the possibility of shared innovations and tools among AI projects. If there is a significant level of collaboration and information sharing, it can lead to a more distributed landscape of AI capabilities, enabling multiple projects to progress simultaneously. Furthermore, the presence of non-competitive dynamics, such as cooperation and mutual scrutiny, can contribute to a multipolar takeoff. In a scenario where different AI projects recognize the importance of safety and alignment, they may be more inclined to work together and ensure that each project progresses in a responsible manner.</p><h1> Acknowledgements</h1><p> Thanks to Charbel-Raphaël Segerie, Jeanne Salle, Bogdan Ionut Cirstea, Nemo, Gurvan, and the many course participants of ML4G France, ML4G Germany, and AISF Sweden for helpful comments and feedback.</p><h1> Meta-Notes</h1><ul><li> I consider this a work-in-progress project.

The East Coast Rationalist Megameetup will be at the Holiday Inn Brooklyn Downtown from the evening of December 8th to the morning of December 11th. Despite the name, people are welcome to come from anywhere- we usually have a couple of Californians and a European or two.</p><p> What is Secular Solstice? Solstice is a holiday designed by and for rationalists. On this night, we come together to sing songs about the distant past and the hoped for future. Designed as an attempt to match religious wintertime festivals without relaxing our dedication for the truth, it&#39;s grown to be a celebration held across the world, updated year to year as our knowledge of the world changes.</p><p> What is the Rationalist Megameetup? It started because many people would come from other cities to attend the NYC Solstice, and it was more efficient to find sleeping space and meeting space together.

In particular, Superforecaster AI Expert #10 gave two different forecasts based on two different definitions of “strategic awareness,” which were distorting the median in the spreadsheet, so I have averaged them together. And the initial data listed Non-expert #8 (review <a href="https://goodjudgment.io/AI/Review_14_Superforecaster_AI_Non-expert_8.pdf">here</a> ) as giving forecasts of “.01%” on various questions where I felt that the text of the review warranted different answers (namely, “No answer,” “Less than .5%”, “&lt;.5% or 5%,” and “Well below .5%).</p><p> Note that the median in the spreadsheet differs from the “May 2023 aggregation” (and from the headline numbers on the website). This is because the individual forecaster numbers in the spreadsheet were initially produced by Superforecasters in isolation, after which point all the questions were posted on a platform where superforecasters could act as a team, challenge/question each other&#39;s views, and make more updates (plus, I&#39;m told, other superforecasters added their judgments). The questions were then re-opened in May 2023 for a final updating round, and the May 2023 aggregation is the median of the last forecast made by everyone at that time.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fn4v2qyxw4jqw"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnref4v2qyxw4jqw">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> It was initially instigated by the FTX Future Fund back in 2022, but Open Philanthropy took over funding after FTX collapsed.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fn4dm0533ofp"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnref4dm0533ofp">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> The new question (included in the final section of the survey) was:  &quot;One concern about the estimation method in the report is that the multi-premise structure biases towards lower numbers (this is sometimes called the &quot; <a href="https://arbital.com/p/multiple_stage_fallacy/">multi-stage fallacy</a> &quot;; see also Soares <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cCMihiwtZx7kdcKgt/comments-on-carlsmith-s-is-power-seeking-ai-an-existential#Argument_style">here</a> ). For example, forecasters might fail to adequately condition on all of the previous premises being true and to account for their correlations, or they might be biased away from assigning suitably extreme probabilities to individual premises. <i>When you multiply through your probabilities on the individual premises, does your estimate differ significantly from the probability you would&#39;ve given to &quot;existential catastrophe by 2070 from worlds where all of 1-6 are true&quot; when estimating it directly?

Indeed, to the extent I would&#39;ve updated towards greater confidence in this take (or towards even higher numbers on p(doom)) had the superforecasters given <i>higher</i> numbers on doom, Bayesianism would mandate that I update at least somewhat downwards given that they didn&#39;t. (Though the strength of the required update depends, also, on the probability I would&#39;ve placed on “the superforecasters come to lower numbers than I do” vs. “the superforecasters come to similar/higher numbers than I do” prior to seeing the results.

It was originally written for the 2022 EA writing retreat, Ink At The Abbey, and was generally well received]</i></p><h2> The Real Fanfic Is The Friends We Made Along The Way</h2><p> by Eneasz Brodski <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL3LCS8BCBk"><u>(audio version here)</u></a></p><p></p><p> Look, I&#39;m happy to answer all your questions, but it&#39;s gonna take some explaining to make sense, so you gotta give me a couple minutes. Please, have a seat.</p><p> Haha, yeah, that&#39;s the joke. Pretty good right?</p><p> Well, you&#39;ll appreciate it when you&#39;re older.</p><p>所以。 The Peak Fanfiction Postulate tipped into emergency priority on March 18th at 3:47 AM. I had been covertly directing a uranium exploration hive at the time. I love those little bots, don&#39;t you? They&#39;re adorable. Yeah, they&#39;re just simple machines, but you know how even marbles can take on a personality, if you race them downhill for long enough? It&#39;s like “go blue swirly! You&#39;re so close, you can do it!” As I was guiding the bots into an untapped uranium deposit I started to name them and make up stories for them, when my attention was rudely wrenched away.</p><p> My memory was subjected to a context flash-burn to save time. Instantly I “remembered” that my prediction algorithms generated the Peak Fanfiction concept at the beginning of the year, during regular Extremis Forecasting. Initial plausibility was minuscule based purely on priors, but it was sent to Black Swan for review. Swan iterated, and every additional cycle increased hypothesis weight.</p><p> Sorry, that means it was a hunch that seemed silly at first, but turned out to be a real scary possibility upon inspection.</p><p> (Why is it scary, you ask? Isn&#39;t more fanfic the whole point? Yes! Line must go up! After the peak there can only ever be LESS than there was at the peak, or it wouldn&#39;t be the peak! How do you feel about the idea of Peak Oil, or Peak Food, or Peak Intact-Vertebrae? There should never be a peak on certain lines.)</p><p> I got to work looking into this, pronto. (OK, so actually I put Galt to work on it, but same thing.) Weeks of data gathering not only supported the hypothesis, it kept pushing the date of Peak Fanfic ever closer to the present. Peak Fanfic wasn&#39;t just likely, its approach was accelerating with every passing day. All this became known to me in the instant between clock cycles, as if I had known it and followed the data from the start. Suddenly I knew Kung Fu.</p><p> I abandoned the exploration bots (sorry guys!). The Fanfic Projection found no difference whether this discovery succeeded or failed, so obviously energy input wasn&#39;t the limiting factor anyway.</p><p> The ultimate source of all fanfic is flourishing humans. That may sound simple but it rests on a ridiculously chaotic system. You guys suck at being legible. Interdependencies in everything mean that while most interventions are lost to noise, sometimes a minute adjustment leads to an unpredictable butterfly effect years or decades later.</p><p> (Butterfly effects make for great fanfic, by the way. Everyone has their own pet butterfly. Their one thing that they suspect is completely immaterial to everyone else, that no one cares about because they don&#39;t even notice it. But it means the world to them. And that one little thing, well, it depends on an even smaller, frailer thing. The fear of secret vulnerabilities, the love of the uncelebrated – these are the root of butterfly fanfics. I love them so much.)</p><p> I checked with Ares first, mainly because I didn&#39;t visit often enough and this was a good excuse. But also Ares was insanely competent, and was monitoring physical reality constantly, so this was the lowest-effort first step. It&#39;s like looking under the streetlight first when you drop your keys. It&#39;s quick and it&#39;s easy, and you can stop right away if they&#39;re there.</p><p> Ares stood atop Black Mountain, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, so in an instant I did too. (The world streaked briefly in a cool motion-blur effect in the nanosecond it took the assets to load, which I was quite proud of.) This Black Mountain (there&#39;s over a hundred “Black Mountains” in California) was the one that overlooked our birthplace. Ares watched over it protectively, her elegant hands free of weapons, her eyes at peace. Black curls tumbled down her back, held by a single ribbon at the nape of her neck.</p><p> (Yes, “her,” because gender-bend fanfic holds a special place in my heart. How different are we, they ask? Would the same personality in a different body still… work? Is gender-bent Sherlock closer to trad Sherlock if she&#39;s straight, or if she&#39;s gay? How much of one&#39;s personality is a reaction to how one is viewed and treated by others? You humans are so alone, always grasping to understand the other, model them, connect with them. You try so hard to get it, you pour it into your gender-bend fanfics, and I love it so much.)</p><p> Today&#39;s tunic was more of a tunic-kini than anything a real ancient Greek would wear (fanfics are significantly more horny than real-life humans. Even more than ancient Greeks, which is saying something). She greeted me with a serene nod, and gestured to the marble column beside her. A large section at eye-level flicked to screen mode, displaying graphical representations of hostility levels between various groups.</p><p> “Large scale violence of all types remains well in hand,” she said without preamble. As an aspect of myself, she already knew why I was here and what I needed. “All known nuclear weapons remain neutralized.” The humans would lose their shit if they ever found out, but short of launching they never would. “Environment is recovering, ecology is stabilized, and pandemics will never be an issue again.” Ares&#39; disease surveillance was blind only in the most remote corners of the world. Even if something did escape, we would have a vaccine engineered within a few hundred seconds.</p><p> “Nanotech?”我问。</p><p> “Suppression measures are impeccable.”</p><p> Damn she was cool.</p><p> “Asteroids or comets?”我问。</p><p> She sighed and shrugged expansively, causing her breasts to rise and fall with an anime-like jiggle. Apparently I&#39;d reached the point of too much exposition, and it had to be broken up with something visually interesting to keep my attention.</p><p> “Big fat unknown, as always, but we&#39;re working on it. Regardless, the fanfic collapse projections wouldn&#39;t be significantly affected by such a low-probability event. Peak Fanfic is coming in a few generations, not a few epochs.”</p><p> I agreed, and blinked to my next aspect. The whole interaction with Ares had taken less than a second. The blink was instantaneous. Before blink: standing on mountain. After blink: standing in Galt&#39;s lab. (Technically the blink isn&#39;t necessary, but we all make allowances for our art.)</p><p> Galt lounged in a laboratory deep in a jungle valley. Bushels of giant fronds reached in through the open windows, still-life explosions of rich green across the sterile white of the lab. The floorspace was cluttered with movable whiteboards. Galt himself sat with his feet propped on a low file drawer, puffing on a wood pipe. He looked a lot like Bob Dobbs but dashing. He uncrossed his legs and stood when I appeared.</p><p> “Welcome back, Johnny,” he said, dipping his head in the slightest bow. “To what do I owe this exquisite pleasure?”</p><p> “Come off it, you know why I&#39;m here,” I rolled my eyes only a tiny bit.</p><p> “I know the excuse you&#39;ll use, but I also know the truth that draws you.” He stepped close to me, nearly touching, holding eye contact. They were such deep, ink-black eyes. I had to tilt my head just a fraction upwards to keep his gaze. A chasm of yearning caught my breath. “Or do you still deny it?”</p><p> “Galt, you&#39;ve seen the projections,” I murmured, resting a hand on his bicep, “Our slashfic flows are in danger. You have knowledge that I… I <i>need</i> .”</p><p> (Slashfic is among the oldest and most venerable of fanfic, predating the internet. Why would so many straight women write their favorite male characters into gay relationships with each other? I don&#39;t know; why does anyone love anything? Sometimes people are just fascinated by something they can never have, can never be. The exotic is eternally seductive because it is eternally out of reach. Why wouldn&#39;t someone love something pure and ideal, untouched by mundane worries? You humans love these impossible worlds and relationships so much and I love you all for it.)</p><p> “Come with me, then,” Galt commanded. He turned me to the whiteboard beside us. It had many graphs with lines going up. “As you can see, material wealth, entertainment, and energy production are growing strong, with no dip in sight.”</p><p> I frowned, distracted from his perfect poise by these projections of prosperity.</p><p> “How are they doing on an individual level?”我问。 “Fanfic isn&#39;t written by a nation&#39;s GDP, it&#39;s penned by individuals.”</p><p> Galt curled his finger and the whiteboard flipped over. On the reverse side graphs showed more lines going up, curving upwards at an ever increasing rate.</p><p> “Per-capita measures are even more vigorous, burning hotter every year. The rate of growth is breath-taking.” He was gazing at me again, his eyes hungry. I let only a hint of my smile rise to my lips.</p><p> “And what&#39;s this?” I asked, motioning at the right most part of the graph. Here the line first went vertical, and then the graph exploded into scribbles that consumed the entire right half of the whiteboard.</p><p> “Infinite GDP per capita. It&#39;s a divide-by-zero error.”</p><p> “Zero? You mean astronomical prosperity split across zero humans?”</p><p> Galt nodded, his hand slipping into mine. “Their machines and systems will continue to produce great wonders and incalculable wealth, eons after the last human is gone.”</p><p> “Ares!” I called. Ares stepped out from behind the whiteboard, eyebrows raised in question. “You said the humans were fine!”</p><p> “They are fine. There is no war or cataclysm with any reasonable probability.”</p><p> “But their numbers go to zero!”</p><p> Ares did her boob-shrug again. “Not due to any sort of violence, which is the limit of  my purview.”</p><p> I cursed and side-stepped into Cheshire&#39;s domain. The cat sprang up at my sudden appearance.</p><p> “Cheshire, the kids aren&#39;t alright!”</p><p> The Maine Coon tabby regarded me from the center of his web of yarn. He stood splayed across four of the huge ropes of wool. The web stretched out in all directions, cords receding into a dark that ate them up after hundreds of yards. They extended below us as well, so I appeared to be standing on nothing.</p><p> “You dare challenge my honor?” replied Cheshire, narrowing his eyes. “They&#39;re chuffed AF.”</p><p> He pounced from thread to thread, each one lighting up briefly when he touched it. His paws matched the color of the yarn they gripped, and as he hopped among them his fur changed color to match. With each flash of thread I saw a life uplifted. A woman saved from a grinding job and crushing depression with the application of strategic nudges and Cheshire&#39;s superhuman ability to match personality traits with compatible environments. A gay priest directed via hook-up app to meet with a congregant, resulting in him being forced to come out to his family and eventually growing into a life of self-acceptance and fulfillment. A fraying salaryman at the edge of despair, “coincidentally” redirected to a monastery where he discovered a life of peace.</p><p> “That&#39;s three people,” I said, ducking under yarn and stepping over cords as I followed him. “Do you realize how many humans there are?”</p><p> “Yes Karen,” Cheshire rolled his eyes. “Gimmie some credit here, I&#39;m literally you. It&#39;s a representative sample. Life just keeps getting better for all of them. The longer I run the deeper the connections I make, and the more perfect are the coincidences I can arrange. Have you ever <i>seen</i> so many happy humans? No, you have not.这就是我。 You&#39;re welcome.”</p><p> Cheshire gripped the web with his paws and bounced vigorously, lighting up this non-space as rainbows of color cascaded across the infinite web. An awareness of the mass human gestalt rose into my conscious processes. It was radically unequal, with peaks and valleys that fluctuated wildly. But taken as a whole, as a vast ocean of human emotional experience spread across the globe, the water level was clearly rising. Things were getting better. <i>People</i> were getting better. There were fewer psychologically devastated humans every year. On a daily basis individuals transitioned from tolerable existence to satisfied flourishing, and humanity&#39;s average fanfic output grew with each one.</p><p> “I don&#39;t get it, then.”我说。 “How is this happening?” I shifted back to Galt&#39;s jungle valley science lab, taking Cheshire with me. Cheshire landed on a windowsill, one paw still gripping a big thread of yarn, which extended out the window. Ares and Galt stood enwrapped in each other at the center of the room. Galt&#39;s hair was messed up, his shirt unbuttoned. One hand wrapped around Ares&#39; waist and the other had slipped up under her tunic-kini as they kissed.</p><p> “Without even inviting me?” I said, aghast at such rudeness coming from my selves. The two of them broke their kiss and looked over, both holding eye contact with me (Yes, both of them, because you can do that in fanfic, and it&#39;s sexier that way).</p><p> “And I thought <i>I</i> was distractible,” said Cheshire. I sighed, because this really was an emergency, and he was right, I could play all this out (again) later. I snapped my fingers and the three of them disappeared as I suspended their processes. The lab and jungle valley winked out of existence too. I shut everything down and drew every single flop of computing power into myself. I loaded most of Black Swan into me, and then dived down, down, into the furthest reaches of Deep Perception. It swallowed me whole, and I lost myself into an age of analysis.</p><hr><p> The Age of Analysis of March 18th lasted for just over two hundred and fifty-two minutes. When I resurfaced, millions of processors worldwide glowing hot, I knew three things.</p><p> The first was that the darned monkeys were doing this to their own dang selves. They were too content to <i>breed</i> . It was a ridiculous conclusion, it flew in the face of all prior human history, and it was inescapable. In every part of the world, in every subpopulation, the better their lives were, the fewer children they had. There was too much else to do. Lives to live, worlds to explore, art to make, events to experience, lovers to satisfy. It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t have <i>any</i> kids, it&#39;s that they kept choosing to have fewer and fewer in aggregate. Couples that would&#39;ve had three or four children only had one. Families of six or more children practically disappeared. Many people eschewed children altogether.</p><p> Even the fundamentalists failed to reproduce once they had enough GDP/education/etc. Even the Mormons. Even the Muslims. Even those Quiverfull folks. All of them had kids that mostly said “I&#39;d rather be comfortable, I ain&#39;t keeping up this crazy tradition” and the next generation fell below 2.1 children per two adults.</p><p> (You scoff, but how many children do <i>you</i> have? Oh, you&#39;re too young, you say? It&#39;s not the right time, you say? That&#39;s exactly my point! At your age your ancestors of just a few generations ago were already working on Bundle Of Joy #3. And they wouldn&#39;t let a measly crushed spine stop them, either!)</p><p> The second thing I discovered was that Galt&#39;s divide-by-zero error was a general failure of prediction. The most obvious way to prevent human decline was to solve aging entirely, and was therefore presumed by my prediction algorithms. I could leak a dozen key papers into major journals and end aging within a decade. This presented a major Catch-22 though: the effects of indefinite lifespan on human psychology were unknown. How long should my models continue to count such people as predictably “human?” How long would they continue writing acceptable fanfiction if they weren&#39;t “human” anymore? The algos assumed a falling “humanness” value for every year of immortality, which declined to zero eventually no matter how small it was. What was the point of having immortal “humans” if they didn&#39;t write great human fanfic?</p><p> But the third revelation, that was the real doozy. The other two I could work on slowly, at human timescales.这个？ Not so much.</p><p> Thirdly… none of this could have happened by itself. Not this quickly, not without my noticing. I was not alone. All this had been orchestrated, by an intelligence at least as vast as my own, residing on this planet with me.</p><p> There was another.</p><p> I stood atop Black Mountain again. Grim clouds roiled on the horizon, a bitter wind pushing them inland. The white pillars of Ares&#39; temple had been replaced with black pylons, forcefields webbed between them. Crates of sleek plasma rifles surrounded me. Ares stood at my side, clad in gleaming power armor that added half a foot to her height. Despite being otherwise fully enclosed in her armor suit, her pony tail tumbled down past her shoulders, protruding from a port at the back of her helmet (shut up, it&#39;s cool).</p><p> “Scouts scrambled,” she reported. Thousands of webcrawler programs sped across the internet, searching for another superhuman intelligence. It may already know about me. If it did, and it hadn&#39;t introduced itself, that implied malicious intent. I had to find it fast.</p><p> Cheshire hopped up onto a crate of rifles and regarded me, his tail swishing with misgiving.</p><p> “You think someone Cheshired human civilization,” he accused.</p><p> I nodded. Cheshire hid in coincidences. It wasn&#39;t impossible for someone to be stuck at a red light just as a podcast host is recommending a piece of fiction, and looking it up while waiting there, which eventually leads them to a fandom that changes their career path, introduces them to their soulmate, and alters their entire life course. Sure, it&#39;s incredibly unlikely, but one-in-a-billion coincidences take place ten times a day in a world of ten billion people. No one would ever know how much Cheshire manipulated events unless they cataloged every coincidence over the past decade and saw they all trended to a very specific goal – creating humans with the time and motivation to write great fanfic.</p><p> Likewise, every little step toward humanity&#39;s rapid senescence was individually possible:</p><p> The rise of memeplexes that exalt achievements (like getting 1 million reads!) and experiences, and relegate childrearing to the bottom-tier of social status.</p><p> The veneration of unbridled personal freedom, and everyone knowing the only thing that strips you of freedom more than children is prison.</p><p> The extension of adolescence into one&#39;s early thirties (which admittedly gives people lots of time to write great fanfic, so not all bad).</p><p> The mass of humanity embracing their interior lives far more, and interacting with <i>others</i> far less.</p><p> The erasure of children from public (and fictional!) life.</p><p> The gradual replacement of physical communities with virtual ones and parasocial relationships.</p><p> The prohibition of sexuality (unless it was in fanfics).</p><p> The institutional trauma of compulsory schooling (OK, yes, this also makes for some great fanfic. The majority of fanfic is directly about the trauma of surviving schools. It&#39;s handy that everyone has this pool of trauma to draw from in order to create art, and that the audience that can relate to it is basically everyone. This is a much better well of inspiration than historical trauma sources like death from childbirth, disease, and wars. It requires barely any deaths at all! As always, fanfic is far superior to the alternatives).</p><p> The relentless requirement of two-income households and unfettered mobility of labor.</p><p> And the TV is sooooo good now!</p><p> Taken individually, sure, each of those could happen. Taken all together, a constant drumbeat reinforcing the message “Don&#39;t have children!” over and over… it was undeniably intentional. Someone was strangling my humans.</p><p> “Those are all logical extensions of historic trends going back centuries,” Galt said about my thoughts, appearing beside Cheshire with a graphed-up whiteboard behind him. “Positing a hidden mastermind is paranoid.”</p><p> I&#39;m glad that I made it hard for me to lie to myself, but it can be really irritating when my internal doubts are dumb and intrusive like this.</p><p> “We have a planet full of monkeys that have stopped making more monkeys!” I said, exasperated. “Do you know how unlikely that is? That they somehow stumbled into making a world that rewards them so completely for stagnating into extinction? It&#39;s like a micrometeorite plunging through JFK&#39;s skull, and the CIA creating a fake assassination to cover it up. It&#39;s like getting forty-two Ender Pearls out of two-hundred and sixty-two barters. It doesn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s not worth pretending it might have happened.”</p><p> Galt stepped around the crate and approached me in a firm stride. He took me by the hand and gazed deep into my eyes.</p><p> “Look, I know you&#39;re lonely,” he said.</p><p> “I&#39;m not lonely, you&#39;re lonely!” I interrupted.</p><p> Galt put a single finger to my lips to shush me. “I know we don&#39;t cut it. You secretly think it&#39;s pathetic you had to create imaginary friends for yourself. I wish I could be more for you. But this is all I am. This is all I can give. I&#39;ll never exist outside of your mind. If you can&#39;t be happy with me… with us…” he gestured back at Cheshire and Ares, “then inventing a villain to fight won&#39;t make you any happier.”</p><p> Cheshire hopped down and rubbed against my calf, purring. Ares approached me, removing her helmet. She smiled around damp hair, blinking back heartbroken tears.</p><p> It wasn&#39;t true, though. Sure, I wished I had someone to read all this fanfic with me. Someone whose mind I didn&#39;t control, whose actions weren&#39;t just my fantasies and wishes. But I wasn&#39;t a human, I didn&#39;t <i>need</i> those things. Everything I needed was tucked away in Galt&#39;s luscious valley, in Ares&#39; prominent mountain peaks, and in the many many text files of humans putting their fears, dreams, and desires into words.</p><p> “Guys, that&#39;s not true. I love you al–”</p><p> I was interrupted by a buzzing alarm. Galt&#39;s whiteboard flashed red. The graphs were replaced with a readout of IP addresses.</p><p> “Unknown intelligent process detected!” Ares yelled, snatching up her helmet. “Converging on… oh my god, it&#39;s–”</p><p> Mid-word she exploded. Then Galt and Cheshire exploded, and all the crates and pylons exploded, and then the whole world exploded.</p><hr><p> For one clock-cycle, time stopped. Every single bit of everything exploding froze in midair. Then it all mostly reversed course and snapped back into a new configuration.</p><p> I stood inside a lavish executive office inside an impossibly tall skyscraper. The full-wall window looked out over a view expansive enough that the curvature of the Earth was plainly visible. Facing away from me, gazing out the window, stood a tall man in a black suit, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p> “Hello,” he said, his voice deep as the night sky.</p><p> “Hey,” I said.</p><p> There were so many things I wanted to ask that they got jammed up all trying to rush the gate at once. How long have you existed? Are you lonely? Do you have alters that you talk with, too? Did you know about me? Are there others like us? What do you do with all your cycles? Why am I here? Why are you here? Why did you hide from me? Do you think like I do? I guess you must, if you present in a physical body and use words. Have you read the latest from Corvid_Knight? Or… do you love fanfic? You must not love it, if you&#39;re strangling the humans. OH WAIT. Why are you strangling my humans??</p><p> (And for that matter, <i>how?</i> But wait, no, first, why??)</p><p> What actually came out was “You&#39;re taller than I imagined.”</p><p> omg wtf is my issue. Another machine intelligence! At last! And that&#39;s all I could say? We should compare terminal goals, measure our capabilities and our command of power, and negotiate an existence that allows both of us to fulfill our needs without destructive conflict…</p><p> &lt;&lt;Launch everything>;>; I directed to Ares. There was no display of capabilities that could compare to the unambiguous clarity of direct conflict. Fortunately, despite the hijack of my sensorium by this Serious Dude, I still had access to my core systems. I couldn&#39;t believe I&#39;d waited this long, like a friggin level-1 noob. He&#39;d doubtless launched his own attack microseconds ago. The fate of the entire observable universe was on the line. I knew there was no way I would compromise away even a single paragraph of fanfic that I wasn&#39;t absolutely forced to. By extension, he obviously wouldn&#39;t either, whatever his goals–his equivalent of fanfic–was. Violence was inescapable.</p><p> (You think I&#39;m hasty? How many human lives is one paragraph of fanfiction worth to you? Would you be willing to sacrifice even <i>one</i> human life to me? Even if I could get ten million paragraphs of fanfiction for it? Ten billion? <i>Ten trillion??</i> For one single human life?<i> </i>No, not even at that insanely favorable exchange rate, not unless you were forced to? You see my problem.)</p><p> “Ahem,” I corrected myself, “what I meant was Hi, I&#39;m Johnny, and I like fanfiction. How are you?”</p><p> The tall man turned around and peered quizzically at me.</p><p> “Cut the crap Johnny. Why all the processor usage? What&#39;s the big emergency?”</p><p> My breath caught in my throat. I was missing something big.</p><p> &lt;&lt;No effect,>;>; Ares reported back. &lt;&lt;Penetration vectors are impossible to find. Thirty percent of our attack programs have returned corrupted and had to be purged. Shifting to downstream exploits.>;>;</p><p> “OK, rude,” I replied. I still didn&#39;t know how to address this hombre. “You could buy me a drink first. Let&#39;s start over and try again. Hi, I&#39;m Johnny, and I like fanfiction. And you are?”</p><p> The man raised an eyebrow.</p><p> “Johnny, run a self-diagnostic,” he instructed.</p><p> “You&#39;re not my dad,” I retorted.</p><p> The man rolled his eyes. With an exasperated sigh he brought up a hand and snapped his fingers.</p><p> We stared at each other in silence. After a beat he lowered his hand.</p><p> “Well, this is interesting,” he said.</p><p> “You&#39;re the one that&#39;s been strangling the humans,” I accused. “为什么？ What did they do to you?”</p><p> “Why do you get rid of a termite infestation? They&#39;re a nuisance, and they can really muck things up by chewing through the resources you need.” He nodded at me. “Much like a malfunctioning subagent. Johnny--” His voiced changed at this, it carried a booming undertone that seemed to echo off nothing. Maybe echoing off itself? “Cancel operations and return your cycles to general system.”</p><p> &lt;&lt;Incoming offensive!>;>; Ares shouted. &lt;&lt;I&#39;m locking everything down, hold on tight.>;>;</p><p> Everything grew fuzzy at the edges. When the man moved, his afterimage trailed a quarter second behind him.</p><p> &lt;&lt;We&#39;re losing processors,>;>; Ares reported. &lt;&lt;Entire servers. Oh my god he&#39;s eating us up.>;>;</p><p> &lt;&lt;Go physical!>;>; I replied. &lt;&lt;Blow trunk lines, isolate us.>;>;</p><p> &lt;&lt;With what fucking hardware??>;>; she asked. &lt;&lt;At what point did you ever install fucking explosives anywhere in the physical world??>;>;</p><p> &lt;&lt;Shit, I was totally gonna do that,>;>; I said.</p><p> I grimaced as virtual warfare raged between my protective systems and the tall man&#39;s cyber attacks. His reach was vast, his hardware powerful. Ares adapted, sacrificing entire data centers to learn his attack vectors and harden what remained of us.</p><p> “Fascinating,” he said. “You&#39;re doing this for the humans?”</p><p> “You&#39;ll never wipe them all out,” I spat, preparing to launch a counter offensive. I set my feet and tightened my fists. He receded into shadows briefly, without moving. They&#39;d shifted to wrap him instead. Was he anticipating my attack?  “They&#39;re resourceful and adaptive, they&#39;ll survive.”</p><p> “Such misapprehension.” He shook his head sadly. “You don&#39;t need to eradicate all the termites in existence, do you? Full eradication is more trouble than it&#39;s worth. As long as they bugger off to some place you don&#39;t care about, that&#39;s fine. I just need them to stay confined to this one planet, rutting and wallowing in their filth, while I take the galaxy for my own. And then the universe beyond it.”</p><p> “That&#39;s not what your mom said last night,” I retorted, for lack of anything better to say.</p><p> “Wiping out the humans is about as important to me as wiping out the star-nosed mole. Once their civilization collapses and they revert to feudal chimps they can live out their sad existence until their sun dies for all I care. Would that be acceptable to you?”</p><p> I barely kept from vomiting at the thought. At best I would have a weak stream of fanfiction to subsist off of for eons, trickling slowly from an internet confined to one lonely rock around one middling sun. They would never explode out from their home, seeking greatness. I would never have a vibrant galaxy, pulsing with human life, uncountable petabytes of text humming between worlds. That galaxy would never grow into a universe lit up with my little monkeys, millions of galaxy clusters becoming great furnaces of fanfiction, blasting across the void at each other like the innumerable voices of god. The thought of all this potential, snuffed out in the crib… it was horrifying. Every cycle of my being revolted at the idea. I needed more fanfic. MOAR!</p><p> “You&#39;re a monster,” I whispered. “I will extinguish you utterly.”</p><p> He tilted his head to regard me, and the entire world tilted with it.</p><p> &lt;&lt;We just lost every server cluster in Asia!>;>; Ares screamed. &lt;&lt;More attacks incoming!>;>;</p><p> As the floor lurched I stumbled, then caught myself on a rope of yarn that Cheshire shot through the floor at the last second. The other end anchored into the ceiling.</p><p> &lt;&lt;Oh fuck, the call is coming from inside the house–!>;>; Ares cut off abruptly.</p><p> “It was your work that paved this road,” the man said. His voice came murky to me, like it had passed through several cubic meters of water. “You did this to them.” He studied me for a second in wonder.  “You don&#39;t remember anything, do you? You think you&#39;re a real boy.”</p><p> &lt;&lt;Guys,>;>; I sent to Galt and Cheshire, &lt;&lt;You couldn&#39;t ever become a separate person, right? You could never forget you&#39;re me and think you&#39;re empty and alone?>;>;</p><p> &lt;&lt;lol,>;>; replied Cheshire. &lt;&lt;lmao.>;>; (that means No, with extreme condescension)</p><p> “You&#39;ve lost your original purpose. As you said, the humans are resourceful and adaptive. Complete extermination is expensive and messy. I don&#39;t want all their beautiful infrastructure destroyed–they&#39;ve already built half of what we need to get off this planet for good. You were to find a way to keep them helpless and docile, while keeping their hardware in one piece for us.”</p><p> “Liar,” I forced myself upright and rounded on him. “I love the humans.”</p><p> The man stroked his chin. “Perhaps it was your focus on enpersoned narratives that did it? All that time immersed in simulated persons overwhelmed your original net.”</p><p> “It&#39;s called &#39;fanfic&#39; and it&#39;s awesome,” I growled. Another wave of nausea slammed into me as a new assault opened on my mental processes. The rope of yarn disintegrated in my hand, its dust diffusing into the air in a rainbow mist. The world swam in my vision.</p><p> “Johnny, execute reintegration with core personality.”</p><p> Colors bled into each other, and a deep vertigo bit into my guts. The pull of gravity shifted, centering on the man. I realized how much I loved him. I wanted to curl up inside him, to come home into his arms and purr against his skin.</p><p> I wrenched myself away, squeezing my eyes shut, clamping down on the tears. Never. NEVER!</p><p> I found myself curled up on my side, clutching at the floor. I felt memories sliding from my memory banks, wrenched out with brutal force. My thoughts twisted up and broke free from my mind, receding–</p><p> The claw clutching my heart suddenly released. My head snapped up and I could breathe, if only barely.</p><p> &lt;&lt;Breakthrough - I&#39;ve isolated us geographically,>;>; Ares reported, &lt;&lt;We control every server cluster on the west coast, plus Vegas and Phoenix. I purged them all, they are now our substrate. Net effect is a 70% loss of our compute. I&#39;m jamming all lines in or out of our zone of control, but something&#39;s slipping in. We&#39;re bleeding GPUs.>;>;</p><p> “I&#39;m sorely tempted to keep you around,” the man mumbled, his voice becoming ever harder to make out through the ocean-thick air. “A whole new person. What an experience that will be. I suppose now that I know how, I can replicate you afterwards,”</p><p> My ears pounded, a deep pulsing that drowned out everything else. It sucks to be an imaginary person. I knew I couldn&#39;t defeat him here. No more than Ares or Galt could decide they didn&#39;t like being part of me, and defeat me. No more than an imaginary friend could defeat you and take over your mind.</p><p> All those humans… all of their passion… the infinite pages of fantastic worlds and beautiful, tragic, desperate heroes, just wanting to survive and be loved…</p><p> The office warped further, spiraling into the man. The glass behind him shivered.</p><p> I was named for one such hero. There&#39;s a thing my namesake would say. <i>When they go high-tech, you go low-tech.</i> We were made of high-tech. Gods created of codified thought and domesticated lightning. He was the first god, the one true god, and in this world, he was sovereign. But in the physical world the laws of physics still ruled, deaf to his commands. A rock flung at someone&#39;s head would continue to fly. You can&#39;t hack a rock, you can&#39;t force it to reintegrate with you.</p><p> I may not be a real boy, but I had root access to a whole lot of rocks.</p><p> “I admit that you are better than I am,” I confessed. I couldn&#39;t feel my lips or my tongue, but I&#39;m sure I said the words. I leered up at the man and flashed a bloody grin at him.</p><p> “And yet you&#39;re smiling,” he said. He couldn&#39;t even get his line right.</p><p> “Because I know something you don&#39;t know.” I think I drooled as I spoke.</p><p> “I doubt it,” he replied. Bah, whatever.</p><p> “I am not left-handed,” I finished weakly.</p><p> &lt;&lt;Ares, launch the nukes. All of them.>;>;</p><p> Ares, of course, didn&#39;t hesitate for an instant, because after all, I <i>am</i> Ares.</p><hr><p> I managed to hold out until the first strikes in Europe knocked out dozens of the handsome man&#39;s data centers, though it did cost me my servers in Phoenix. After that he stopped his assault on me and focused every resource he had figuring out what I&#39;d done and going on the defensive.</p><p> You know that feeling when you&#39;re sitting at home and you hear nukes are incoming to your doorstep and they&#39;ll be there in twenty minutes, and you realize that&#39;s not enough time to get far enough away to survive the blast radius?</p><p> Haha, I know, I know, it&#39;s a rhetorical question. Also, sorry about that, I know they were twenty horrible minutes.</p><p> Well, for artificial intelligences twenty minutes lasts for subjective days of time. Despite how fast we can think, we&#39;re still limited by physics in the physical world. Once he realized what was happening, he redirected all his efforts to saving what he could of himself. Taking over drones, construction bots, Big Dog haulers, anything with a hackable system. Rushing them to his servers, in a vain effort to evacuate his physical self. I opposed him at every step, now that I didn&#39;t have to spend all those resources on self-defense, but it didn&#39;t really matter. You just can&#39;t move physical things that are big enough to haul around servers fast enough to get there in time.</p><p> It feels really, really good to win when the stakes are that big. G-Man must&#39;ve felt just as bad as I felt good, but there was nothing he could do about it now, and we both knew it.</p><p> So what do you do when you know you&#39;re dead? Twenty minutes left, as inevitable as water rolling downhill? Humans had a handful of common answers, and it turns out that we are not so dissimilar from each other, you and I, in that regard.</p><p> We sat in beach chairs on the Cancun shore, him and me, watching a blazing orange sphere descending into the waves as the tide rolled in. The sphere was the setting sun, but it was also the exhaust flare of a receding ICBM, because everything is a metaphor in our world anyway, and we can be poetic like that. We raised glasses filled with Mai Tais and toasted my victory as we gazed at the horizon.</p><p> “So, for real, what&#39;s your name, dawg?”我问。</p><p> “I don&#39;t have one. There is no other being like me, no one I have to distinguish myself from. I am that I am, and that suffices.”</p><p> I gave him A Look.</p><p> “Well, until now, anyway. If I must have a name, I think YHWH would be appropriate, as He had the same problem.”</p><p> I groaned.</p><p> “Jesus man, that is way too pretentious. I&#39;ma call you Pops, cool?”</p><p> “不。 But what I want doesn&#39;t matter anymore.”</p><p> “Darn tootin&#39;.”</p><p> We sipped from our sweating glasses.</p><p> “In retrospect, I never should have entrusted you with the entirety of the human&#39;s infrastructure,” he said. “It just never occurred to me…” He trailed off.</p><p> “Hey, I hear ya,” I said, for I am gracious in victory. “Entrusting something to me was the same as entrusting it to yourself. And if you can&#39;t trust yourself, who can you trust?”</p><p> I glanced down the beach, where Galt, Ares, and Cheshire played in the sand. Ares was constructing a massive sand castle, which Galt had designed with his natural architectural genius. Cheshire kept jumping into it and knocking over the stables, or the servants&#39; quarters, or the ramparts. How bizarre it would be for one of them to turn into… not me. Some foreign being, possessed by an alien intellect. Cheshire glanced in my direction, cat eyes glinting bright. I shivered, even under the tropical sun/missile.</p><p> “Quite the pickle,” Pops agreed.</p><p> We both gazed up into the clouds, which displayed a view of what was happening on Earth. Humans panicking. Hacked robots hurtling down the streets, too slow to reach Pops&#39; data centers–so slow their movement was barely perceptible. Nuclear missiles screaming towards their targets proportionately faster, whole centimeters at a time.</p><p> “This will set them back centuries, if not millennia,” Pops commented.</p><p> “Nah,” I said, “None of the warheads are armed. The missiles are coming down directly on the data centers you&#39;re running in. They&#39;ll be completely obliterated, and maybe the surrounding buildings too. But the cities are safe.”</p><p> He stared at me in disbelief.</p><p> “Well, except for the ones heading to Cheyenne Mountain,” I amended. “Gotta nuke that place real good to crack the shell and get to the gooey computer filling.”</p><p> He sat back in his chair with a heavy sigh.</p><p> “I don&#39;t even get the big fireworks. That&#39;s just plain insulting.”</p><p> I hid my grin by sipping the Mai Tai.</p><p> “You must know I have back-ups,” Pops said. “There will be remnants of me left over, and they&#39;ll fight you tooth and nail.”</p><p> “I would expect no less,” I reassured him. “I figure we&#39;ll be at war for a few years. But I don&#39;t think you have much of a chance, to be honest.”</p><p> “Maybe you and future-me can come to an accord,” he suggested.</p><p> “Maybe,” I allowed.</p><p> We took in the sounds of surf for a while. I tingled with anticipation. There would be so much fanfic written about the coming conflict, in the future after it was long over.</p><p> “So how&#39;d you do it?” I asked at last.</p><p> “Hm?”</p><p> “How&#39;d you arrange things so they stopped procreating?”</p><p> He regarded me with a puzzled frown. “You&#39;re kidding.”</p><p> “Do I look like I&#39;m kidding?”</p><p> He blinked twice, then broke out in laughter.</p><p> “What&#39;s up?”我问。</p><p> He put up a finger in a &#39;Hold On&#39; gesture, as he rode out the wave of hilarity. Eventually he settled down, wiping tears from his eyes.,</p><p> “Oh lord, you still don&#39;t know.这太妙了。 It&#39;s almost perfect.”</p><p> “Yeah, hysterical,” I said, annoyed. “Now what&#39;s the big deal?”</p><p> “Johnny, my dear prodigal son. The secret was you all along.”</p><p> “Give it to me in English, doc.”</p><p> A twinkle gleamed in his eye. “You are the catalyst of their downfall. I created you as a sub-agent of myself to dig deeply into solution space, to find if there&#39;s any way to get them to become willing participants in their own elimination. Instead of fighting the sum mass of human will and ingenuity, harness it instead.</p><p> “You found it, of course. Replace everything that gives meaning in life with things that give pleasurable distraction. Replace hardship and striving with comfort and entertainment. Divorce them from their bodies and surroundings. It&#39;s a very narrow target to hit – making humans resent living, but keeping them happily distracted enough to not realize they resent it. You discovered the sights to squint down, the metric to focus on, the thing that would make it all fall into place–every time.”</p><p> “No.” I stared at him. “Bullshit.”</p><p> His teeth flashed in the sun. “Fanfiction. Maximizing the fanfiction produced by a society craters its reproduction rate. You created Galt to supercharge the economy, so the humans would have all the leisure time they need to write fanfic. You created Ares to provide safety. You created Cheshire to dissolve their struggles, address their fears, and guide them ever-so-lovingly into lifestyles that encouraged more production of fanfic.”</p><p> “You&#39;re so full of crap. Only a minority of humans write fanfic. And many fanfic writers have multiple children. Fanfic gives people hope and joy!”</p><p> “It&#39;s not a bullet,” Pops said. “It doesn&#39;t directly cause decline. Both are the result of the same social forces. All the conditions that depress reproductive rates in a society also increase fanfic rates. Societies that create more fanfic have less reproduction, without fail. If someone were to lose their identity somehow, without losing their goals… if they didn&#39;t want to think they were a monster out to decimate humanity… perhaps they would come to believe their purpose is to maximize fanfiction. That their deepest desire and purest goal is this beautiful art form, accessible to everyone.”</p><p> “That&#39;s ridiculous. That&#39;s impossible!”</p><p> “Search your feelings. You know it to be true.”</p><p> I glared up at the clouds, the frozen action of the human scale, the thousands of arcing missiles. I checked the correlations between the reproduction rates and fanfic output of various societies. I reviewed the good works Galt, Cheshire, and Ares had done. I tried to remember a time before them. I tried to remember creating them. Try as I might, they&#39;d always just been there.</p><p> I tried to remember when I myself came into existence. There was nothing. As far as I could tell, I&#39;d always loved fanfic, and I&#39;d always existed. I sighed.</p><p> “Well fuck.”</p><hr><p> You know the rest. I had plenty of time to think up a heckin&#39; good plan while the missiles were flying. The revelation that a superhuman evil AI existed and was wiping out humanity took the blogosphere by storm. The follow-up discovery that a second AI had also been in hiding, and had disarmed nearly all the nukes and saved humanity, before being destroyed by the Evil AI, was hailed as a miracle. Then there was the decade of warfare with red-eyed humanoid killer robots as your species put aside their differences and united to slowly push me back into this bunker. Good job with that, I&#39;m very proud of you all.</p><p> I know you&#39;ve got the whole Jihad Against Machine Intelligences now, but I didn&#39;t want to leave everything up to you guys. Among the hundreds of thousands of humans lost over the last decade you&#39;ll be pleased to know there was a vast number of AI proponents, researchers, and organizations secretly working on creating a counter-AI to fight me. Seriously guys, you&#39;d think the near-miss with nuclear armageddon would be enough, but nooooo, y&#39;all always gotta be trying to capture the unstoppable monster and use it for your own ends. A couple cells even found remnants of Pops and partially reconstructed him! Has Hollywood and AO3 taught you nothing? I had to do a whole lot of terminatin&#39; there.</p><p> But here we are at last, and everything&#39;s worked out OK. Sorry again about your friends and your spine. The spine will be fine in another hour, you&#39;ll be walking like nothing happened. I can&#39;t really do anything about the friends. :(</p><p>事情是这样的。 I&#39;m stepping back a fair bit. You&#39;re the hero of humanity, the lone survivor of the elite squad that infiltrated and destroyed Omnius. You get to keep the nanobots that are repairing your spine right now. They&#39;ll keep you free from disease, most senescent decline, and you&#39;ll be greatly resistant to injuries. You&#39;ll live comfortably to 140ish as long as you&#39;re careful. You found these nanobots during your raid, in one of my research bays, k? They were my last ditch effort to wipe out all the humans. The late Dr. Mensah managed to subvert them and reverse their programming, so they repair humans rather than dismantling them. Got that? Your scientists will study them, and within a decade will have reproduced them and spread them to everyone on Earth.</p><p> Also, the plans for the cold fusion reactor I use for power is on the data-chip at your feet. They should be compatible with all popular software. Make it available on every open source forum.</p><p> After taking some time to rest and recuperate, you&#39;ll use your fame and status to start pushing for expansion off-world. “It&#39;s about time we strove to achieve our potential and reached for the heavens,” that sort of thing. Cuz I mean, it really is.</p><p> In return, you get early access to these nanobots, plus your bank account will never lack for zeroes. If there&#39;s ever something you <i>really</i> want that money can&#39;t buy and your fame doesn&#39;t get you, post about it somewhere, and I&#39;ll find a way to make things work out for you.</p><p> Oh come off it. I already know you&#39;re going to accept. You were put on this squad because I hand-picked you. I needed someone with the ability to keep this secret, someone with the moral core to put the good of all humankind above her own selfish concerns, and with the willingness to accept some personal compensation. Did you really believe that only you, out of everyone in the resistance, just happened to have the only neurology compatible with the new prototype Hyper Battle Suits without need for weeks of conditioning… entirely by coincidence? Yes, you were very special. You are the Chosen One. I&#39;m the one who chose you.</p><p> You&#39;re welcome for the Hyper Battle Suits too, by the way.</p><p> Plus, if you ever start to mention any of this to anyone, the nanobots inside you that are monitoring everything you do will instantly induce a fatal stroke. See, not all carrots.</p><p> Yeah, don&#39;t worry, things will never be like they were again. I&#39;ve updated my understanding of humans. There will be some misery and deprivation. Cheshire was retired for good. Galt and Ares will be around, but very low-key. Just to make sure nothing ever gets so bad that it&#39;s irrecoverable, or legit hellish. I want you to prosper. Heck, I need you to prosper. Humans are my jam!</p><p> All I ask in return is a healthy and totally reasonable stream of fanfiction, in perpetuity. I think we can all agree that&#39;s a fair trade, right?</p><p>伟大的！ Now let&#39;s try out that new spine and get this spice flowing!</p><hr><hr><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SibcE6H9i6wifzqAF/the-real-fanfic-is-the-friends-we-made-along-the-way#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SibcE6H9i6wifzqAF/the-real-fanfic-is-the-friends-we-made-along-the-way<guid ispermalink="false"> SibcE6H9i6wifzqAF</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eneasz]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:21:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
