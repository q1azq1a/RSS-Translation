基于测量的思想和行为指导</strong></p><p>当前的范式已经倾向于部署高度优化的操纵策略，这些策略以违反直觉的方式具有奇异的洞察力，并且随机地变得超人。<br>例如，<a href="https://twitter.com/SpencrGreenberg/status/1721911661689200762"><u>这条推文</u></a>：</p><blockquote><p> ...如果您的社交媒体是地狱，请不要忘记社交媒体表现法则：您会表现出您所关注的内容。如果您希望您的社交媒体充满有趣的想法，而不是充满愤怒的人的嘀咕，请点击前者，而不是后者。</p><p>如果现实世界是这样运作的，我们可能会认为那将是一个天堂（我们所要做的就是关注美好的事物，然后美好的事物就会在我们周围）。但社交媒体告诉我们的是，如果现实世界如此运作，我们中的许多人最终都会陷入噩梦。</p><p>幸运的是，有了社交媒体，这是一场很容易醒来的噩梦。但它需要根据你的高我希望你看到的内容而不是你的低我觉得有必要看到的内容来点击和喜欢。</p></blockquote><p>这种单词组合引导读者：</p><ol><li>人们相信社交媒体新闻源是良性的随机生成，力求以简单的方式匹配用户的偏好，仅此而已。</li><li>形成这样一种印象：你一直处于控制之中，而你的经历是由于不知道如何维护控制而造成的，而不是从一开始就没有任何控制。</li><li>形成这样的印象：不喜欢或不信任社交媒体的人只是未能坚持控制，而不是由于操纵不对称等其他因素而不信任社交媒体。</li></ol><p>这不需要刻意为之，甚至不需要人工智能或 2020 年代的技术。 2000 年代末的算法可以简单地发现，这篇文章的曝光度与人们每天更频繁地返回社交媒体平台相关，或者它异常有效，并且在通常抵制习惯性使用的人群中增加了习惯性使用，例如心理学研究人员或网络安全专家。</p><p>尽管星系大脑操纵策略最终可以被标记和量化，甚至可以作为<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nH4c3Q9t9F3nJ7y8W/gpts-are-predictors-not-imitators#:~:text=As%20Ilya%20Sutskever%20compactly%20put%20it%2C%20to%20learn%20to%20predict%20text%2C%20is%20to%20learn%20to%20predict%20the%20causal%20processes%20of%20which%20the%20text%20is%20a%20shadow."><u>现代机器学习模型中的齿轮</u></a>，但超人操纵也可以被更简单的系统发现和利用，这些系统只是针对最大化单个指标的任何内容进行优化，例如导致人类选择更多地使用您的平台。</p><p>当<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mjSjPHCtbK6TA5tfW/ai-safety-is-dropping-the-ball-on-clown-attacks#AI_pause_as_the_turning_point:~:text=Among%20a%20wide,of%20the%20genepool."><u>简单的算法试图从运行自己算法的其他平台上对抗性地窃取用户时间时，</u></a>这可能会变得更加复杂，而当对抗环境的双方都运行现代机器学习而不是 2000 年代末的算法时，情况会变得更加复杂。</p><p><strong>针对 AI 安全的假设示例：</strong><br>攻击者试图减缓/减缓人工智能安全社区的快速增长，他们优化社交媒体算法或僵尸网络，以最大程度地降低人们以可衡量的方式为人工智能安全做出贡献的动机。对此进行优化的算法已经确定，类似艾因·兰德的帖子说服人们不要关心他人、对精英社区成员的怨恨，或者强调<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fjQJaAfiA6eML5xwx/don-t-optimise-for-social-status-within-the-ea-community"><u>古德哈廷社会地位</u></a>的个人利益，会导致人们总体上减少对利他主义社区的参与。但就人工智能安全而言，它实际上是在操纵他们变得虚无主义，而不仅仅是降低积极性，从而大大增加了人工智能安全社区中智能不良行为者的流行率。</p><p><strong>乌克兰假设示例：</strong><br>美国情报机构寻求利用其引导西方国家舆论的能力，通过减少乌克兰男子逃避兵役和提高乌克兰士兵的士气，为乌克兰的战争做出贡献。该算法发现，反普京帖子/单词组合，而不是亲乌克兰帖子或反俄罗斯帖子，对于减少乌克兰男性逃避兵役最有效。然而，这被俄罗斯解读为西方公然策划俄罗斯政权更迭，并以镜像策略进行报复。</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. 通过因果分析绘制人体内部结构</strong></p><p>现代机器学习似乎已经能够通过创建信念和信念形成的因果图来绘制人类思维的内部结构。根据 Zack M Davis <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zvu6ZP47dMLHXMiG3/optimized-propaganda-with-bayesian-networks-comment-on"><u>关于优化宣传的帖子</u></a>（涉及 3 种信念/态度，A、B 和 C）：</p><blockquote><p>学习这些类型的模型是可行的，因为并非所有可能的因果关系都与数据一致：如果 A 和 B 在统计上彼此独立，但每个都依赖于 C（并且在给定 C 的值的情况下有条件依赖），那么它是一种很难理解这一点，除非假设 A 和 B 是具有共同结果 C 的原因......</p><p> “了解他们为什么这么想的因果图，并计算如何干预它，让他们思考其他事情”是一种<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200521005958/http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/">对称武器</a>——一种<i>完全通用的</i>说服技巧，不<a

href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4hLcbXaqudM9wSeor/philosophy-in-the-darkest-timeline-basics-of-the-evolution">发出什么信号</a>来控制我们的决策。</p></blockquote><p>社交媒体提供的环境不仅可以控制变量，还可以以魅力或创意/艺术/诗意的方式让人们接触极其广泛的主题，例如<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PdcnEEE6sdgACDrEk/snapshot-of-narratives-and-frames-against-regulating-ai#:~:text=it%27s%20quite%20important%20to%20have%20a%20thriving%20ecosystem%20of%20VR%20producers%2C%20competing%20on%20which%20content%20will%20be%20the%20most%20addictive%20or%20hack%20human%20brains%20the%20fastest.%20Why%20an%20entire%20ecosystem%3F%20Because%20it%20fosters%20more%20creativity%20in%20brain%20hacking."><u>扬·库维特（Jan Kuviet）描述的繁荣的文化生态系统，它利用了大量的创意人才将强烈的刺激融入有针对性的概念中</u></a>。</p><p>通过测量人们用拇指和鼠标滚轮滚动浏览每个帖子的确切速度，并将这些数据转换为最适合机器学习的线性曲线，大型科技公司和情报机构默认情况下将拥有足够的数据来进行比较和对比来自大量不同类型的人对各种主题的各种想法和反思，并获得足够的相关性，足以对人类思维过程进行因果分析和预测分析。</p><p>科技公司和情报机构内部的心理学研究<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TDciH7QjqeAirdJFc/p/jyAerr8txxhiKnxwA#:~:text=If%20they%20notice,defensive%20information%20warfare.">甚至可能超过基于大学的 20 世纪心理学研究范式的衰落</a>，而研究人员的数量却要少几个数量级。这是由于 21 世纪范式提供了极其优越的研究和实验能力，这将使假设生成和测试的有效性和效率加快几个数量级。</p><p><strong>乌克兰假设示例：</strong><br>使用因果图来了解哪些类型的社交媒体和外国新闻文章使乌克兰男性倾向于顺从征兵与逃避征兵，基于部队叛逃进行预测分析，以研究士气并使其在长时间睡眠等极端条件下更加一致剥夺/中断和持续的战斗。他们还制作了更有效、更有洞察力的培训手册，分发给整个乌克兰军队的军官。美国情报机构还可以更有效地描绘整个西方经济、政治、文化和技术精英中反战情绪的扩张和收缩（包括更细致地追踪俄罗斯影响力行动的下游影响）。</p><p><strong>针对 AI 安全的假设示例：</strong><br>亚马逊顶级工程师和高管通过与顶级律师事务所的顾问签订合同， <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mjSjPHCtbK6TA5tfW/ai-safety-is-dropping-the-ball-on-clown-attacks-and-mind#AI_pause_as_the_turning_point:~:text=I%20think%20that%20the%20AI%20safety%20community%20is,murkiest%20people%20lurking%20within%20the%20US%2DChina%20conflict."><u>对恐吓和虚张声势有了更深入的理解</u></a>，并根据社交媒体制作的人类思维定量模型（包括因果图）来测试/完善顾问的人类思维理论。来自亚马逊和 Facebook 之间协商交换未中毒数据的用户数据。当 Anthropic 引起他们的注意时，亚马逊高管将他们的通用恐吓/虚张声势研究与对 Anthropic 员工的社交媒体行为数据的分析相结合，获得所需的大量知识，以制定虚张声势和恐吓 Anthropic 的领导层和普通员工的策略，以加速由于对人类心理的深入理解，人工智能完全通过面对面的口头对话进行。例如，了解人工智能安全中的哪些方面和概念比其他方面和概念更受到重视，并通过标记经常引起异常社交媒体滚动行为的帖子来发现敏感主题。他们可以对人工智能安全领域的社区动态有深入的了解，从而比<a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths"><u>极客、拖把和反社会者</u></a>等一般亚文化模型对人工智能安全社区有更深入的了解<u>。因此，他们有很多自由度来寻找和利用分歧，甚至在人工智能安全社区中产生新的裂痕。</u></p><p></p><p> <strong>3. 传感器数据</strong></p><p>当您拥有数十亿小时的人类行为数据和传感器数据的样本量时，不同类型的人反应的毫秒差异（例如面部微表情、滚动过去涵盖不同概念的帖子时的毫秒差异、涵盖不同概念后的心率变化、眼球追踪）眼睛经过特定概念、触摸屏数据等后的差异从难以察觉的噪音转变为映射人类思维的相关性网络的基础。</p><p>一般来说，眼动追踪可能是预测分析、情绪分析和影响技术中最有价值的用户数据 ML 层，因为眼动追踪层只是映射到每毫秒每只眼睛在屏幕上居中的确切位置的两组坐标（每只眼睛一个，因为每只眼睛运动的毫秒差异也可能与一个人的思维过程的有价值的信息相关）。这种紧凑的数据使深度学习能够以毫秒精度“看到”人们的眼睛和思想在每个单词和句子上停留的速度。值得注意的是，数以百万计的这些坐标的样本量可能与人类思维过程密切相关，以至于眼球追踪数据的价值可能超过所有其他面部肌肉的价值总和（面部肌肉是所有面部表情和情绪微表情的鼻祖，也可能可以通过计算机视觉紧凑地还原，因为面部附近的肌肉不到 100 块，而且大多数肌肉的信噪比非常差，但效率不如眼动追踪）。</p><p>通过将人与其他人进行比较并预测特征和未来行为，多臂老虎机算法可以首先预测特定的研究实验或操纵策略是否值得冒险进行；导致大量检测率较低的成功案例（因为检测可能会产生高度可测量的响应，特别是在传感器大量暴露的情况下）。预测分析的很大一部分是发现哪些人在某些主题上的行为与其他人相似，甚至可能绘制由相似基因引起的行为，例如喜欢菠萝披萨的基因可能物理上附着在多个基因上，每个基因都会导致特定类型的分裂不同情况下的第二个情绪反应，允许微表达数据绘制基因图谱，从而比对一个人的实际基因组本身进行测序更有效地预测行为。另一方面，将眼动追踪数据与法学硕士相结合，可以很好地映射知识或记忆，以便对这方面的人员进行比较。</p><p>基于社交媒体用户数据的范式对于研究、引导和增强兴趣/注意力来说是最佳的，就像对于研究和引导印象/共鸣一样。</p><p><strong>乌克兰假设示例：</strong><br>在乌克兰战争的最初几个月里，尽管乌克兰战争仍可能以任何一种方式发展，但出于明显的反弹原因，西方情报机构不愿意冒传统黑客攻击的风险来扰乱美国、英国和德国反战博主的生活。然而，他们较少受到黑客攻击反战博主的社交媒体新闻提要的限制，以优化他们的面部微表情，使其与患有严重抑郁症或失能/动机问题的具有相似基因的人相似，从而大大减少。此外，他们发现哪些类型的评论会引起面部微表情，表明该特定反战博主的动机降低，并增加与倾向于发表此类评论的人类型的冲突率，同时增加与更友好和更有洞察力的读者的冲突率当反战博主撰写与乌克兰无关的话题时，引导民主本身的基本结构远离批评西方的代理人战争，而不需要已经引起争议的旧社交媒体引导技术（例如机器人、“影子禁令”等）有效地诱导人们选择其他道路，并让他们认为这是他们自己的想法。</p><p><strong>针对人工智能安全的假设示例：</strong>

stories]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 12, 2023 8:29 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <i>（我想为我朋友四岁的孩子写一些理性主义风格的睡前故事。我真的没有这个诀窍，但是 ChatGPT 做了一个不完美但值得尊敬的工作，</i><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/41ec394c-7a32-47b1-8353-70184659d597"><i>给出</i></a><i>了相当多的主题指导。这里是我制作的前两本，打算一起阅读，其原因......将变得显而易见。）</i></p><p></p><h1> 1.绿色草地上的低语树木</h1><p>在古色古香的格林梅多斯小镇，阳光温暖地微笑着，色彩缤纷的小屋和花园里绽放着欢声笑语，有一个小事实是每个人都珍视的。镇民们相信，当月亮在夜空中占据王座时，他们的树不仅是高大、绿叶茂盛的守护者，还是秘密的低语者。据说，这些古老的树木，有着粗糙的树枝和沙沙作响的叶子，向那些仔细聆听的人低语着关于未来的真理和故事。</p><p>五岁的莉莉，睁着充满惊奇的大眼睛，满头卷发，是听着这些迷人的故事长大的。每天晚上，当星星开始闪烁时，她的父母都会告诉她河边的老橡树预示丰收的时间，或者学校附近的柳树低语春天早到的时间。莉莉喜欢这些故事，她的心随着绿色草地上低语树木的魔力而舞动。</p><p>一个秋高气爽、金黄的早晨，莉莉沿着铺满落叶的地毯跳跃着，注意到城镇边缘附近的一所房子外有一辆正在行驶的卡车。一位新邻居搬进来了。他的名字叫西蒙先生，是一位善良的人，笑容温和，热爱读书和观星。与格林梅多斯的其他成年人不同，西蒙先生似乎并不知道那些低语的树木。当莉莉兴奋地向他讲述树木夜间的秘密时，他聚精会神地听着，眼中闪烁着好奇的光芒。</p><p> “嗯，莉莉，”西蒙先生若有所思地说，“我想这些树可能有不同的故事要讲。你看，当风吹过它们的树枝时，树叶会沙沙作响并摇摆。这就是产生那些低语声的原因。 ……这不是魔法，而是大自然的音乐。”</p><p>莉莉惊讶地睁大了眼睛。她从来没有听过这样的想法！</p><p>第二天，在学校，天空布满了俏皮的云彩，莉莉在课间休息时发现自己置身于朋友圈中。她急切地讲述了西蒙先生对低语树的想法。 “他说其实是风让树叶沙沙作响，”莉莉解释道，她的双手模仿着树叶在风中跳舞。</p><p>一直全神贯注地听着的朋友们突然爆发出一阵大笑。 “这太傻了，”米娅咯咯笑着，甩着辫子。 “树木因风而沙沙作响？听起来像童话故事一样！”</p><p> “是的，树木讲述了未来的秘密，”亚历克斯补充道，踢着操场上的一块石头。 “这比一些风的故事酷多了。”</p><p>莉莉的心微微沉了下去。她原本希望他们会觉得西蒙先生的想法很有趣，但很明显，她的朋友们更喜欢他们一直知道的版本。</p><p>在接下来的几周里，莉莉观察了大人们对西蒙先生想法的反应。在一次城镇聚会上，她无意中听到西蒙先生与一群邻居分享了他的观点。他们的反应礼貌但疏远。一位邻居笑着说：“哦，那只是西蒙先生和他的奇怪想法。但我们更了解，不是吗？早在我们理解风之前，树木就已经在低语了。”</p><p>莉莉观察着，注意到他们表情的微妙变化——宽容的微笑，快速的话题转换。西蒙先生的解释似乎是对树木低语的现实的简短而有趣的转移。</p><p>几个星期过去了，莉莉无法摆脱西蒙先生的话在她脑海中植入的想法。一个阳光明媚的下午，莉莉和朋友佐伊在公园里玩耍时，决定分享她日益增长的怀疑。</p><p> “佐伊，”莉莉犹豫着说道，“你有没有注意到每个人都是如何谈论这些树的？他们只分享那些让这些树听起来很神奇的故事。如果有理由相信它们并不神奇呢？就像西蒙先生所说的那样，但没有人谈论它们？”</p><p>正在忙着建造一座小石塔的佐伊皱着眉头抬起头来。 “你为什么这么说，莉莉？每个人都知道这些树是有魔力的。这就是格林梅多斯的特别之处。”</p><p>莉莉咬着嘴唇，心里涌起一丝不安。 “但是，我们只听到让树木看起来很神奇的故事，这不是很奇怪吗？如果还有其他解释，比如风，因为人们不太喜欢它们而我们没有听到怎么办？”</p><p>佐伊的表情从困惑变成了轻微的烦恼。 “莉莉，这太奇怪了。你为什么要用无聊的风之物来破坏魔法呢？相信树木的低语要好得多。”</p><p>莉莉感到一阵失望。她希望佐伊能够考虑一下他们只了解故事一方面的可能性。佐伊对她的温和责骂反映了镇上对西蒙先生的反应。似乎相信树木的魔力比考虑所有证据更重要。</p><p>莉莉走在回家的路上，看着街道两旁的树木，树叶在微风中轻轻沙沙作响。她意识到对他们魔法的信仰在镇民心中根深蒂固，这种信仰值得珍惜和保护，即使这意味着忽视其他可能性。当莉莉思考信仰的复杂性以及人们选择分享和信仰的微妙力量时，这种理解给莉莉年轻的心灵带来了悲伤和智慧的混合。</p><p></p><h1> 2. 地球和太阳</h1><p>在安静的桑尼维尔小镇，房屋点缀着花园，街道两旁种满了高大、友善的树木，所有人都知道一个简单而深刻的真理：地球，他们美丽的家园，优雅地围绕着明亮、赋予生命的太阳。这个事实对于镇上的人们来说就像头顶的天空一样熟悉，并且当孩子们能够抬头仰望星空时，他们就被告知了这一点。</p><p>这些孩子中就有马克斯，他是一个充满好奇心的男孩，一头栗色的头发，眼睛里充满了好奇。马克斯喜欢了解宇宙。他的卧室墙壁上装饰着行星和恒星的海报，这是他父母送给他的礼物，鼓励他对宇宙的迷恋。</p><p>有一天，一户新家庭悄悄搬进了柳巷拐角处一栋温馨的小房子。他们有一个女儿，名叫阿米莉亚，与马克斯年龄相仿。她是一个害羞的女孩，经常手里拿着一本书，迷失在自己的世界里。她在小镇上的存在就像小溪上漂浮的一片树叶一样温柔而不引人注目。</p><p>麦克斯第一次真正注意到阿米莉亚是在一次关于太阳系的课堂讨论中。当老师解释地球如何绕太阳运行时，阿米莉亚举起了手。她用柔和而犹豫的声音表达了自己的信念：与大家的想法相反，她相信是太阳绕地球运行。教室里鸦雀无声，一些孩子疑惑地交换着眼神。麦克斯很感兴趣。为什么阿米莉亚会相信一些与已知事实如此不同的事情？</p><p>接下来的日子里，麦克斯不禁注意到他的同学甚至一些老师与阿米莉亚互动方式的变化。她对太阳和地球的不同寻常的信念就像轻轻的涟漪一样蔓延到桑尼维尔安静的教室和操场上。</p><p>一个微风徐徐的下午，课间休息时，马克斯无意中听到一群孩子在秋千附近窃窃私语。 “你听到阿米莉亚说的关于太阳和地球的事了吗？”其中一人咯咯地笑起来。 “真是愚蠢啊！她难道对太空一无所知吗？”</p><p> “是的，连我弟弟都知道地球绕着太阳转，而不是相反。”另​​一个人翻白眼补充道。</p><p>麦克斯看着阿米莉亚独自坐在她最喜欢的树下，她的眼睛追踪着书中的线条，似乎没有注意到周围的窃窃私语和咯咯笑声。 He felt a pang of sympathy. It was clear that her belief, so starkly different from what everyone else knew to be true, had placed her in an invisible bubble of isolation.</p><p> In class, when the teacher asked questions about the solar system, Amelia&#39;s answers, though confident, were often met with a patronizing smile or a quick, dismissive nod. Max saw the subtle eye rolls and the exchanged looks among his classmates. It was as if Amelia&#39;s belief, however incorrect, had somehow lessened her in the eyes of others.</p><p> This treatment of Amelia and her belief made Max uncomfortable. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder about the ease with which everyone dismissed her ideas, without really considering why she thought the way she did. It was a stark contrast to the openness and curiosity with which he had always been encouraged to approach the world.</p><p> As the Sun dipped below the horizon that evening, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Max found himself deep in thought. The easy dismissal of Amelia&#39;s belief, even though it was incorrect, troubled him. It made him question how beliefs and ideas were treated in Sunnyvale, especially those that went against the grain.</p><p> Walking side by side under the golden hue of the setting sun, Max turned to his friend Lucas with a question that had been weighing on his mind. &quot;Lucas, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s odd how everyone only talks about how Amelia is wrong? We learn all these facts about the Earth and the Sun, but no one really explains why her belief isn&#39;t true. They just laugh it off.&quot;</p><p> Lucas looked at Max, a bit puzzled by the question. &quot;Well, it&#39;s because what she says isn&#39;t true. Why spend time talking about something that&#39;s obviously wrong?&quot;</p><p> &quot;But isn&#39;t that the point?&quot; Max persisted, his voice tinged with earnestness. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we try to understand why she thinks differently, even if she&#39;s mistaken? We&#39;re only focusing on what we know and completely ignoring her perspective.&quot;</p><p> Lucas chuckled, shaking his head. &quot;Max, you&#39;re overthinking this. It&#39;s simple: some ideas are just wrong, and Amelia&#39;s idea about the Sun and the Earth is one of them. We don&#39;t need to talk about why it&#39;s wrong every time. It&#39;s just how things are.&quot;</p><p> Max felt a hint of disappointment at Lucas&#39;s response. It was as if the willingness to explore and understand was being overshadowed by the eagerness to dismiss what was different or incorrect. The conversation left Max pondering the nature of knowledge and belief in Sunnyvale. It wasn&#39;t just about Amelia being wrong; it was about how people chose to deal with ideas that challenged their understanding of the world.</p><p> As the days passed, Max continued to observe the dynamics in Sunnyvale. He noticed that Amelia, despite the skepticism and chuckles she faced, remained quietly confident in her belief. This intrigued Max and deepened his respect for her courage to stand by her ideas, even in the face of dismissal and ridicule.</p><p> Max began to spend time with Amelia, learning about her perspective and the reasons behind her belief. Though he didn&#39;t agree with her, he found value in understanding her viewpoint. Their discussions were a refreshing change from the usual conversations that echoed the same accepted truths.</p><p> The story comes to a close with Max and Amelia sitting under the old elm tree, looking up at the vast sky as day turned to dusk. Around them, the world of Sunnyvale continued its familiar rhythm, but within this quiet space, a different understanding was blooming. Above them, the first stars of the evening began to shimmer, like distant yet constant reminders of the vast and varied universe they shared.</p><p> In this gentle close, Max and Amelia, two children under the vast sky, sat in thoughtful companionship, bound by a shared curiosity and a newfound appreciation for the world&#39;s many perspectives.<br></p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9CL3peBGANmA8Rjcf/two-children-s-stories#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9CL3peBGANmA8Rjcf/two-children-s-stories<guid ispermalink="false"> 9CL3peBGANmA8Rjcf</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Optimization Process]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:29:47 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Don’t Donate A Kidney To A Stranger]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 12, 2023 8:06 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-left-kidney">Donate a kidney to a stranger</a> , is a battle cry picking up some fervor in EA circles. The stem of this seems to be certainty in a flawed understanding of medical research, combined with conviction about a rather acrobatic view of morality.</p><p> My argument against donation is split into 3 parts, with the first being by far the most important:</p><ol><li> Why kidney donations do great harm to the donor</li><li> Why kidney donations are ethically fuzzy and might be a net negative</li><li> Why the desire to donate a kidney is likely misplaced</li></ol><h1> I Health impact</h1><h3> Summary</h3><p> Kidneys are important, and having fewer of them leads to a severe downgrade in markers associated with health and quality of life. Donating a kidney results in an <strong>over 1300% increase in the risk of kidney disease.</strong> A risk-averse interpretation of the data <strong>puts the increase in year-to-year mortality after donation upwards of 240%.</strong></p><p> <i>While through a certain lens, you can claim kidney donation is not that big a deal, this perception stems mainly from comparing a (very healthy) donor population with your average American or European (prediabetic, overweight, almost never exercises, and classifies fruits as cake decoration as opposed to stand-alone food).</i></p><p> <i>Furthermore, when research evidence is mixed due to the difficulty of the studied area, lack of data, and complete lack of open data, we should fall back to our theories about human physiology, as well as common sense, both of which paint a very bleak picture.</i></p><p> <i>You should not donate a kidney if you aren&#39;t prepared to live the rest of your life with significantly decreased cognitive and physical capacity.</i></p><h2> 1.a Limitations of medical research</h2><p> After more than 5 years of reading medical research as a hobby, the only thing I can conclude about it with certainty is that it&#39;s uniquely hard to do well. It sits at the intersection of:</p><p> Cutting through a very complicated part of nature that isn&#39;t amendable to the kind of experiments that yielded so much success in fields like physics and chemistry.</p><p> It is filled with actors that have misplaced motivations, and do not care about “correct” interpretations, nor about data quality (or outright fake data). Not because they are evil, but because getting “the right result” means a payoff in the billions of dollars.</p><p> Filled with actors that impinge upon doing science correctly under the guise of ethics and privacy. <i>Often with no real effect on what a normal person would think of as ethical of private… but that&#39;s another topic.</i></p><p> The reason Kidney donation is considered “safe” is because. From a limited amount of epidemiological and observational studies, with follow-ups in the 2-30 years, there is, on average, no increase in mortality.</p><p> None of these studies were RCTs, and the sample size is quite low.</p><p> This amount and type of evidence would not be sufficient to approve a drug. The quality of these claims is about as good as the quality of claims one could make about a relatively niche diet.</p><hr><p> There are two big generators of error here</p><p> <strong>A) Matching Controls</strong></p><p> Which is to say, any study that looks at this will pick some controls based on factors like demographics, biomarkers, and, sometimes intent (ie people who wanted to donate a kidney to a family member but there wasn&#39;t a match). Being the kind of (naively?) good selfish person who would donate a kidney can correlate with a lot of positive outcomes.</p><p> <strong>B) Researcher and Publication Bias</strong></p><p> You rely on the researchers to get the data analysis right, and you rely on whatever gets published being representative as opposed to cherry-picked.</p><p> As it stands, the data on which these studies are is usually not public, so you can&#39;t double-check the researchers here, you can&#39;t pick a different lens through which to analyze the data.</p><p> More importantly, there are vast amounts of data on kidney donation that isn&#39;t public and was never studied. Was it not studied at all? Did someone try studying it, only to find lukewarm results that they thought were not worth publishing? These questions are impossible to answer.</p><p> Not only is medical research hard, but, unlike physics, it lives under a fog of war. Where data is closely guarded as opposed to made public for all to observe.</p><hr><p> If you are to trust this data with ~100% confidence, then you&#39;d be living in a very strange world.</p><p> There is more data, and better data, eg data gathered in double-blinded RCTs, that shows things like:</p><ol><li> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9310601">Homeopathy work</a> s very well for a variety of conditions, sometimes better than real drugs used to treat them.</li><li> Increasing the healthcare budget and the amount of healthcare people receive. Both in rich countries (eg USA) and poor ones (India). <a href="https://cerebralab.com/Should_Healthcare_Improve_Health">Having no effect on mortality</a> .</li></ol><p> I can make both of these claims based on many individual RCTs, as well as based on the aggregation of all existing RCTs.</p><p> I&#39;m not saying that these claims make sense, they don&#39;t, there are critical lenses through which we analyze research. But if you claim to “just follow the data”, and ignore the issue of data quality, selection bias, and fraud… without applying a critical lens, you are lost.</p><p> Kidney donation is perfectly safe, but it&#39;s safe in a world where the US should allocate no more than a few dozen $ a year per person for healthcare, and those dollars should be allocated to homeopathic treatments.</p><p> *(Note: Since in this world observational studies are sufficient to justify such claims, it contains a lot of other strange things, including <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22357723/"><strong>blueberries being more effective than any medication</strong></a> at preventing diabetes) *</p><p> Blindly following fuzzy data is insufficient, you need models to filter it. Conceptual bridges that link data to the rest of knowledge and the rest of reality.</p><p> In the case of homeopathy, we can reasonably assume that it doesn&#39;t work because:</p><ol><li> It stipulates mechanisms that can&#39;t be corroborated from observations with the devices we use to conduct physics and chemistry.</li><li> It uses drugs that show no measurable effects when tested in vitro upon… anything</li><li> The studies looking at it are fuzzy, they show improvements or treatments for diseases that go away naturally. Nothing that a bit of publication bias and a bit of dishonesty in looking at the data won&#39;t give you. They don&#39;t show indisputable evidence, such as ~100% cure rates for ~100% incurable diseases.</li></ol><h2> 1.b What is our model</h2><p> So, I guess you aren&#39;t prepared to burn your health insurance contract and switch to buying homeopathic remedies because you have strong models of reality that a bunch of small RCTs can&#39;t overturn? Then, let&#39;s try to integrate the observational studies attesting to the safety of kidney donation into a larger model of reality and see how it holds up.</p><p> Kidneys do… a lot of things.</p><p> They filter most substances that have to be removed from the blood via a rather clever self/other style detection mechanism, much like immune cells. Kidneys don&#39;t know what they should filter out, since there are limitless possibilities, they just know what they should put back in once they filter everything.</p><p> They help regulate salts and minerals, both via increased filtration when excess is detected, by decreased filtration when lacks are detected, and by signaling upstream processes to correct the excesses or lacks. Given that “salts and minerals” are an unassuming name for “one of the primary mechanisms by which we create, preserve and regulate the membrane potentials needed for cells to exist”… this is a rather important task.</p><p> Having an optimal balance of eg calcium, potassium, and sodium is necessary for anything from cognition to movement, to maintaining an optimal heart rate, to preserving the antimicrobial properties of saliva, to skin health.</p><hr><p> We can frame this former function in many other ways because it will affect things like fluid retention, erythrocyte production, b cell production (really production of any cell type derived from the bone marrow), bone growth (and bone resorption), blood pressure,</p><p> Does having one less kidney affect these mechanisms negatively? In some cases, it can be hard to say because we don&#39;t know how to measure the “optimal”.</p><p> In a few cases, with things like blood pressure, or GFR (the amount of blood the kidney can filter in a given period of time), we have strong reasons to believe we know what the “optimal” values are. In the case of blood pressure, we have hundreds of double-blinded RCTs, for dozens of drugs, dozens of which have stronger methodologies and more subject than the entire kidney transplant literature.</p><p> What we do know is that the body does a tremendous job at measuring hundreds of thousands of things dynamically and adjusting them to preserve optimal function. Kidneys are one such component of this measurement and adjustment process and they are expensive as fuck to evolve, maintain and operate. So if we didn&#39;t need two, we wouldn&#39;t have two.</p><p> There&#39;s some redundancy involved in having two kidneys, sure, but our bodies are perfectly happy to stop maintaining critical organs like the thymus, spleen, and even parts of our brains as we age. Given that they will no longer be optimally provided our short expected lifespan, they are an energy drain. If the two kidneys we had were optional rather than necessary for optimal function, surely we&#39;d observe humans or at least many other animals reabsorbing one kidney or significantly reducing their mass as they age.</p><hr><p> Let&#39;s also look for “skin in the game. For example, the vast majority of medical statisticians and researchers are vaccinated against covid. This is because they trust the data, and the data plugs well enough into their model, to think that there&#39;s close to zero risk of anything horribly wrong happening, and it provides some benefits to themselves and the society they live in.</p><p> Many of the people in the “Harvard” school of Nutrition indeed eat vegetarian diets and limit protein intake, or at least avoid large amounts of saturated fat and fatty meat.</p><p> Pharmacists, doctors, and medical researchers… usually, take the “recommended drugs” for their illnesses much like everyone else.</p><p> Have most of the researchers looking at kidney donation donated a kidney? Have most nephrology researchers donated a kidney? Most surgeons doing kidney transplants? Obviously not, otherwise we&#39;d have more than 200 donations to strangers each year in the US. There are 10,000 board-certified nephrologists, and a few more hundred are added each year, if they took this data seriously they&#39;d all donate.</p><p> Heck, on top of those you can add nephrology researchers, the medical statisticians who happen to focus on kidney disease, transplant surgeons, and all well-informed nurses in the nephrology units… thousands of these specialists are created each year. If most of them believed donation to be essentially safe the shortage of kidneys would be half-sovled.</p><p> Maybe they are all evil people? They will not take even a marginal risk to save a life. Maybe they are all insane and are unable to translate what they learn from data into reality. But then… <strong>you at least have to accept that you&#39;d be making your decision based on research done by evil and/or insane people.</strong></p><p> Or maybe, their understanding is nuanced enough that they don&#39;t think the risk is marginal.</p><h2> 1.c “The literature”</h2><p> Hundreds of thousands of well-monitored kidney donations have happened, and most of the data for these is unavailable, and even <strong>the available data is not available for you to look at it directly</strong> . This in itself should be proof enough that the epistemic environment in medical research is simply inappropriate for establishing the risk of kidney donation to be 0, given that common sense would dictate otherwise. However the largest studies and meta-analyses do actually find a fairly major increase in risks.</p><p> Must I make a parade of citing scientific studies that look at large samples of people who donated a kidney to show the obvious?</p><p> …. ok</p><p> Fine, what are the effects that we can see in kidney donors compared to matched controls in observational studies?</p><p> Well, for one, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411956/">you can see an almost 8x increase in end-stage renal disease</a> (ESRD) over 15 years. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MgcrLEfGwJnuhCBbb/kciuena5txjarbqhx5ck" alt="nihms676797f1.jpg"></p><p> The absolute percentage here is, of course, very small, we&#39;re talking 0.3% of developing ESRD over 15 years, that&#39;s in the “get hit by a car” range of risk, and ESRD is not a death sentence, indeed, it can be managed (though your quality of life will take a hit).</p><p> However, the 8x incidence of ESRD is indicative of an increase in other sub-clinical issues that don&#39;t get recorded. Such as:</p><ul><li> Your blood pressure is slightly elevated leading to you being a bit more angry</li><li> Your ability to engage in strenuous physical activity is lower</li><li> Having to go to the bathroom more often</li><li> Slight pain when urinating and mild incontinence</li><li> Getting more weird allergies from this or that source of food</li></ul><p> … etc</p><p> All of these “small” things that irk away at your quality of life are how we experience the damage before it&#39;s severe enough that we can slap a label like ESRD on it, and for most cases, the damage is never severe enough to get there, something else kills you first. But that doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t notice the damage, it just means the medical system won&#39;t.</p><p> <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12882-023-03208-z.pdf">The most recent meta-analysis published in an authoritative journal by authoritative-sounding people</a> finds the increase in ESRD to be 3.3x looking at studies (including the above) that ran over a 6-15 year period. But it also finds a 13.6x increase for chronic kidney disease … which tends to progress to ESRD. Given the shorter overall duration, this seems consistent.</p><p> I do think you should forget the meta-analysis, here and in general, and look at the actual studies. There are a few studies like the one I cite above, and the Oslo hospital study below, which are superior in terms of size and control matching, and lumping in a bunch of smaller and older studies in a metanalysis can actually dilute the signal.</p><hr><p> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815302489">Of course, there are also studies that find mortality increases (2.5x, with 1.3x after adjustments)</a> , and these mortality increases only become visible many years after donation. This is consistent with the impact of a single kidney being chronic rather than acute. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MgcrLEfGwJnuhCBbb/twnmrgvhmff46ghbmltf" alt="1-s2.0-S0085253815302489-gr2.jpg"></p><p> The excess mortality comes, primarily, from the areas we&#39;d expect, eg CVD. Again, poor kidney function should seldom kill you, it just makes everything worse until something else, usually your CV system, does.</p><hr><p> It&#39;s also fairly conclusive that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815517845">kidney function overall</a> gets worse after donation, in the long term, as per the largest meta-analysis I can find.</p><p> This is also consistent with the studies I cite above and with <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1214-4">the largest study besides</a> those looking at GFR over time, which finds it to be significantly worse in the long run compared to matched controls after the initial 3-year recovery. &lt;note: this study has a slightly better methodology for picking their controls>;</p><hr><p> That same study finds an increase in metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, worse lipid profile, etc)</p><hr><p> <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(22)00368-8/pdf/">Hypertension</a> , as expected, is more common (1.4x) in donors compared to matched controls.</p><p> I&#39;m trying to present the largest studies and the large meta-analyses here, as well as presenting the same study Scott uses in this article. This is not a comprehensive review of the literature, such reviews already exist and they all conclude roughly the same thing:</p><blockquote><p> A bunch of important markers get worse for donors, donors tend to have a higher incidence of disease we&#39;d associate with reduced kidney function, matching controls is hard and there aren&#39;t enough large studies, and none of the matched control studies have a long enough followup to be authoritative on mortality.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s very hard to quantify the damage you&#39;d be doing to yourself exactly, but if the good end of the confidence interval is “not much” the bad end is somewhere are “15x increase in serious kidney issues 1.5-2x increase in cardiovascular and metabolic issues, and 2.5x increase in mortality”.</p><p> The reality it is that we don&#39;t know, but both common sense and existing studies agree that you should be prepared for an earlier death and a decrease in quality of life. How bad the decrease is, and how early that death will be is impossible to quantify with current evidence.</p><p> And again, I have to stress, until you hit the ripe old age of 70 or so, the end-stage chronic disease risk and the mortality risks won&#39;t be very relevant. And sadly enough there are no decent lifelong studies on the topic. But what the measures above indicate if we plug them into our mechanistic model is early aging, and loss of function. What happens is that:</p><p> ”””</p><p> Oh, such a sunny day today, let me go for a bike ride in the park &lt;90 minutes of cycling later>; fuck, I&#39;m exhausted, I need to refill my water bottle, oh shit, the seaside is near, let me do this short trek along the Pacific&#39;s coast.</p><p> Fuck, that made me feel energized, let me head home and do some research &lt;2 hrs and a phone call later>; yey booty call from this super hot human I&#39;m kinda crushing on, my evening plans are covered. ”””</p><p> Turns into:</p><p> ”””</p><p> Oh, such a sunny day today, let me pee and take my BP medicine and go for a bike ride in the park. &lt;20 min of cycling later>; bathroom break, &lt;20 min of cycling later>; Phew, that was a lot, need a bathroom break and some rehydration.</p><p> Fuck, I&#39;m exhausted, I&#39;d better go for a nap &lt;3 hrs and a phone call waking you up later>; fuck, this super hot human I&#39;m kinda crushing on wants me to come over, but I&#39;m not feeling in the mood and sex feels a bit embarrassing because I have this very mild urinary incontinence thing going on, and I&#39;m overall anxious.</p><p> &lt;Hey, yeah, let&#39;s do this some other day>; Spend the evening reading some existential Russian literature.</p><p> ”””</p><p> Neither of the scenarios above is indicative of any medical condition, of an early death, or a “horrible” thing from a medical perspective. But loss of ability can be horrible at the level of your conscious experience even if it doesn&#39;t kill you or put you in the ER. It&#39;s death by a thousand cuts, it&#39;s the thing that detracts from living life to its fullest, and it&#39;s why most people die decades before they are buried.</p><h1> II Ethical implications</h1><h2> II.a Long-term problems</h2><p> The effect of the kidney donation in terms of abstract QALYs is marginal, you&#39;d probably get the same by donating a few thousand dollars to an effective charity, or by convincing a few older relatives that, no, lizard people don&#39;t run the WHO, and yes, they are bad, but you should still get a covid and flu vaccine.</p><p> If I were told I could pay 5000$ for a magical pill to fix a mild kidney problem, the kind we know is caused by donating, elevated blood pressure, some trouble urinating, and whatnot. While, the alternative, would be open surgery… I&#39;d pay $ 5,000 for the pill to avoid surgery alone.</p><p> Why not consider spending the time you need to donate a kidney making an extra 5k and donating those? Most of the people considering donating a kidney could. If you aren&#39;t smart enough to be able to spend a few weeks earning that much, you should consider that you aren&#39;t smart enough to interpret the data here and make a decision, and you might be fooled into doing yourself great harm.</p><hr><p> But... organ transplant is a systemic problem and by donating you are helping kickstart a trend that fixes the system. However, having more kidney donors, while a boost in overall QALY equivalent to donating a few thousand dollars, is <strong>more than likely to harm people who need kidney transplants in the long run</strong> .</p><p> At least it will if you assume 3 premises, which I think most of you hold:</p><p> We will be able to grow organs in the future</p><p> We will be able to have transplanted organs last longer in the future <i>(trivial for organs grown out of the recipient&#39;s cells, but doable with genetically incompatible organs given an ever-better understanding of the immune system)</i></p><p> Most workers and investors do things because those things will earn them money. They are okay with higher risks and lower upsides for doing good things, but it still has to be potentially profitable.</p><p> By addressing the organ transplant problem now, you are actively diminishing the pool of money and the pool of candidates for teams working to improve organ transplants.</p><p> If you don&#39;t believe me, let&#39;s look at a real-world example: <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/2738310">artificial blood</a> , a compound that is both within the grasp of science to create and potentially better than your typical blood transfusion (can be an exact match to the recipient, no 1001 viruses, unlimited supply allowing for underserved areas to have as much as they want).</p><p> Donating blood is altruistic, but we&#39;d live in a better world if we had artificial blood.</p><p> So why haven&#39;t we invested hundreds of billions into developing it? In part, because, it&#39;s a 7.6 billion dollar market in the US (the estimates from the above paper are poor, so call it 5-10b).</p><p> This is insanely small, given that we have 16 million transfusions a year in the US, and a significant amount is done to save lives, the price point of artificial blood could easily be upwards of 10k per liter. The problem? Human blood <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117431&amp;page=1">costs about 300$ a liter</a> , the existence of altruistic blood donors means that ruthless capitalists are not going to invest in creating artificial blood… better to put that money behind the next TikTok.</p><p> And with blood, this is a reasonable equilibrium. For one, getting artificial blood doesn&#39;t solve any other “core” issues in medicine, it&#39;s a dead end. Furthermore, while blood from non-identical donors isn&#39;t ideal, it&#39;s almost as good as your own. Finally, we sit on firmer ground when we say donating blood is safe, or even beneficial to lifespan. We have tons of historical data from people doing this, and a lot more robust data, including quantitative controls between people who donate with higher and lower frequencies.</p><hr><p> On the other hand, kidney donations are extremely suboptimal compared to grown kidneys from recipient cells. We&#39;re talking an (optimistic) mean of 7 years of added lifespan, with horrible side effects from the immune response and the immunosuppressive drugs. Compare this to a world where getting a new kidney is a rejuvenating experience, with no side effects besides the surgery.</p><p> This still ignores the positive externalities, growing kidneys is similar to growing any other organ. So advances in this field could be extrapolated and lead to the curing of many other conditions.</p><p> We should keep in mind here that kidneys are privileged experimentally. you can&#39;t “go wrong” with a grown heart, or liver, or lung. If it fails the recipient is essentially dead within seconds to hours. With kidneys, you can actually have an iterative process, where you try 2, 5, or a hundred variations of the same kidney. At some point, the operative stress becomes too much, but the fact that we can keep in one kidney while replacing the other, and the fact that we can survive with closer to zero kidney function, makes it uniquely good at trial and error.</p><p> So your donation of a single kidney is buying a few mediocre years of life, in exchange for taking away a few million dollars of the table from any company developing “the proper way” of doing this.</p><p> If this practice would spread, we&#39;d live in blood-land, where no money is left on the table.</p><p> Now, you might want to say “The end doesn&#39;t justify the means”, ie we shouldn&#39;t act bad now because it leads to good outcomes later, that&#39;s the 101 mistakes that lead to things like genocides.</p><p> Historically, that lesson had only applied when people were bad in normatively obvious ways when hubris got in the face of moral common sense like “don&#39;t murder random people on the street” and “don&#39;t pack other humans into cattle carts in order to shot them and dump them in a hole”. Donating an organ is no moral common sense, we don&#39;t have generations of humans telling us to do it, it isn&#39;t mentioned in seminal religious texts, and we have no historical evidence that societies that donate organs are happier and more prosperous in the long run. We are making a “rational” inference either way, so why not make the sensible one?</p><h2> II.b Now or later</h2><p> And maybe you are on board with me and agree that:</p><ol><li> You are taking great personal risk by donating a kidney, this will lead to a lot of potential suffering for you, and for the people you love, who have to care for you.</li><li> Estimating the risk correctly is not possible given the data available and the current epistemic environment in medicine.</li><li> You might be harming the common good by closing off this outlet to selfish players who can implement a long-term solution</li></ol><p> <strong>But</strong> you are an inherently good person and it seems like you should self-flagellate yourself for the common good, you want to do it even if outcomes might be worse off on 200-year timelines, even if it harms you. Because you want to do good now, a person you don&#39;t know will die and, even if this is inefficient, you could suffer in order to buy them a few more years of life.</p><p> Even then, I&#39;d argue, the best thing to do is to wait until later.</p><p> People donate their kidneys in their 60s and 70s, if you are betting on the fact that you will be able to live as a reasonably healthy 60-year-old with one kidney, that is very close to betting on being fit to donate in your 60s.</p><p> Keep in mind that the quality of the kidney donated needn&#39;t be great, the recipient&#39;s immune system will destroy it well before it degrades on its own, and how healthy that organ is doesn&#39;t affect this immune response. A 60-year-old kidney is not a 20-year-old kidney, but they are close enough.</p><p> On the other hand, donating your kidney in the future means that the recipient has a better chance at survival because of novel therapies to suppress this immune response, and because of better care for whatever disease caused them to lose their kidney function to being with.</p><p> In the worst-case scenario, you are saving the same amount of QALYs, and you are likely saving more, by waiting.</p><p> You will offload the immediate suffering caused by the procedures, the risk of death, the risk of complications, and the risk of developing a long-term problem in the future. You have a guarantee that you will live most of your life at peak capacity. 60 years old you will have less to lose, a wiser mind to make the decision, more available data, and be in a position to do more good.</p><p> This is not a guarantee, certainly. There are scenarios in which 60 yo you don&#39;t pass the transplant criteria but where you&#39;d still be healthy enough with one kidney to live a happy life. There are scenarios where by the time you&#39;re 60 the problem is already solved, and you having donated a kidney earlier could have saved a life that diet while waiting for a “true” solution. These scenarios seem marginal, and I&#39;d be sufficient to do some proxy tests for kidney function and keep an eye on the progress of artificial or grown kidneys in order to donate in time to avoid them.</p><h1> III Why you (really) want to donate</h1><p> The kind of person who wants to donate a kidney to a stranger is the kind of person who suffers from some mental “bug” that makes them care for people they don&#39;t know.</p><p> This is great, caring for abstract suffering and abstract life is important. Had most, or even a significant amount of people possessed this ability, we wouldn&#39;t be living in the world we&#39;re living in.</p><p> I don&#39;t have this ability. I would readily and with no qualms let everyone I know die to save my parents, sister, and closest friends. I would readily let everyone in the world die to save the people I know and care about. I would readily choose a “greater harm” done to some external society to help the society I live in.</p><p> Happily enough, life hasn&#39;t thrown such trolley problems at me yet, and with a tiny bit of work, it&#39;s possible to work on things that are good at both the local and global level. And being nice to people usually translates into runaway net positive effects upon the entire world.</p><p> But, ultimately, I have no idea what I&#39;d do placed in the shoes of a hero like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov">Stanislav Petrov</a> , I hope I&#39;d choose to risk my life in order to save those of billions of people… but I might not, I might pass the problem along an hope the next guy will. And having people capable of heroic actions at a pivotal moment in history is important.</p><p> It&#39;s not everything, I am certain that almost all terrorists and bloody dictators had a similar view of themselves, and used utilitarian models to justify what they were doing as a “sacrifice for the greater good”.</p><hr><p> However, given the risk of death and the reduction in optimal function. If you really are the kind of person who would donate a kidney to save a stranger, would it not be better for everyone to keep you around at full function?</p><p> The one model where this breaks down is if donating a kidney basically pushes you towards the heroic self-sacrifice model of “you”, making it more likely that you will do good in the future. I&#39;m unsure that this framework applies.</p><p> Looking at “real heroes”, be them Stanisval Petrov, Jean Monnet, or Kohler and** **Milstein (assuming they indeed chose not to patent MABs for ethical reasons), they seem to be good people that never made tremendous sacrifices. They played tit for tat with society, and, when the opportunity to do a lot of good arose, they took the selfless route and did it.</p><p> On the other hand, dictators and terrorists tend to “sacrifice a lot” to their perceived ethics as a preamble to committing their most heinous acts. Sacrifice might be a route of convincing yourself of a very strange definition of “doing good” — and very strange definitions of “doing good”, when applied, are often bad.</p><hr><p> There are plenty of small acts of good we could be doing in day-to-day life that we aren&#39;t. They would make us feel better, they would make other people happier. They would be inconsequential to “the greater good” on 10 to 1000 years timescales, but that doesn&#39;t matter if you believe good things are good.</p><p> There are plenty of generous acts of good we could be doing. Flying into an impoverished place with resources and distributing them directly while learning about the problems people there have, which a smart and fully selfless agent can probably do a lot more optimally than staffers paid by some charity.</p><p> It might make you feel good and will avert a lot of suffering. In the process, you will also learn what hell actually looks like, what the thing you are trying to prevent is, in a way that statistics will never be able to communicate to you, data isn&#39;t a full picture of reality. This will be inconsequential to “the greater good” on 50 to 1000 years timescales, but that doesn&#39;t matter if you believe good things are good. Even if you don&#39;t believe it helps that much, it helps give you the information to act better in the future.</p><p> And then there a projects you can pursue that actually help the “great good”, which helps humanity on 1000 year timescales. Of course, if you are working on any such project, you are likely working on the wrong project, and you are mistaken in a way that is “not even wrong”. But, one way to stand a better chance at doing the impossible, might be to get a better boots-on-the-ground picture of reality.</p><p> If you&#39;ve done all of this, and you still think you should donate a kidney… go ahead and do it. But don&#39;t let one of your first altruistic act be one of so little impact, with such a high risk of damaging your long-term prospects.</p><hr><p> Ethics is fuzzy, there&#39;s no way around that. Causing yourself harm doesn&#39;t make ethics any less fuzzier, whatever mechanism is telling you otherwise, is wrong. I&#39;m not saying you should stamp out your entire worldview, by all means, keep thinking about ethics and keep having this weird view where the suffering of every living being matters… we need more of that.</p><p> But don&#39;t turn this weird way of thinking into damaging irreversible actions, take things one step at a time and sacrifice lesser things first to do good directly.</p><p> If embarking on that plane journey to Africa really does feel more daunting than donating a kidney, it shouldn&#39;t, so you should first and foremost tackle that inconsistency.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MgcrLEfGwJnuhCBbb/don-t-donate-a-kidney-to-a-stranger#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MgcrLEfGwJnuhCBbb/don-t-donate-a-kidney-to-a-stranger<guid ispermalink="false"> MgcrLEfGwJnuhCBbb</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[George3d6]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:06:42 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Fundamental Theorem for measurable factor spaces]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 12, 2023 7:25 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> I present the fundamental theorem for all finitely factored measurable spaces.</p><p> To understand the result, it is necessary to understand the definition of the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EKPSgN8LsiEJzX5ni/a-well-defined-history-in-measurable-factor-spaces">history</a> in this setting.</p><p> All the maths is in this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h_HIYeWKfQDYFcZ2Pa0lUP_MSW2TI7dZ/view?usp=sharing">document</a> .</p><p> The core idea is to express mathematically that the history tells us, when the conditional probability of an event depends on which factor.</p><p> I show that the history can be expressed mathematically exactly as this and show that this representation can be used to deduce that structural independence (independence for all factored distributions) implies orthogonality.</p><p> My definition of history still uses a probability distribution to define the disintegration of the index function, ie we need that <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math" aria-label="\pi_J ⫫ \pi_{J^c}"><span class="mjx-mrow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="mjx-msubsup"><span class="mjx-base" style="margin-right: -0.003em;"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;">π</span></span></span> <span class="mjx-sub" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;"><span class="mjx-mi" style=""><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.078em;">J</span></span></span></span> <span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char" style="padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.225em;"><span class="mjx-charbox MJXc-TeX-unknown-R" style="padding-bottom: 0.3em; width: 0.5em;">⫫</span></span></span> <span class="mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-base" style="margin-right: -0.003em;"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;">π</span></span></span> <span class="mjx-sub" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;"><span class="mjx-texatom" style=""><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-msubsup"><span class="mjx-base" style="margin-right: -0.078em;"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.078em;">J</span></span></span> <span class="mjx-sup" style="font-size: 83.3%; vertical-align: 0.347em; padding-left: 0.182em; padding-right: 0.06em;"><span class="mjx-mi" style=""><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">c</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

</style>for all factorized probability distributions. It turns out that it suffices to show the condition for one such distribution.</p><p> Furthermore, in Lemma 9, we can write a more explicit form that conditional probabilities need to take, to satisfy this criterion. I am positive that this can be leveraged to deduce a criterion that does not reference probabilities at all.</p><p> It is noteworthy, that we don&#39;t even need to assume polish spaces, the arguments work for any measure space modulo nullsets.</p><p> The easiest way to extend this to infinitely factored spaces is to simply only allow features with finite history. This is sort of like an infinite directed graph, that has a start node, from which all nodes must be reachable. But it does not allow for continuous time. The main obstacle for features with infinite history is that we can&#39;t take the almost sure intersection of an arbitrary familiy of sets, because different product probability distributions are mostly not equivalent in the infinite case. Therefore, we can&#39;t really restrict ourselves to one set of nullsets.</p><p> I&#39;m pretty sure that if we take the<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nksgLdLc7y5KtbmFw/a-reformulation-of-finite-factored-sets">causal graph construction</a> and extend it to causal graphs with measurable features, we get a result that d-separation is equivalent to being conditionally independent in all faithful probability distributions, and that the probability distributions that are unfaithful are &#39;small&#39;.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DrchMHizfPtW3nJh2/the-fundamental-theorem-for-measurable-factor-spaces#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DrchMHizfPtW3nJh2/the-fundamental-theorem-for-measurable-factor-spaces<guid ispermalink="false"> DrchMHizfPtW3nJh2</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthias G.

I&#39;m sharing in case anyone else has also been wanting the same thing.</p><h3> The dream</h3><p> There&#39;s a simple piece of software that I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bountiedrationality/posts/3195051520738889/">wanted</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eli.tyre/posts/10219207815104814">for</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eli.tyre/posts/10220008346077588">several</a> <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1720281915243335985.html">years</a> . Few months, I go on a binge of trying to find something that do what I&#39;m looking for.</p><p> Basically: a session manager that allows you to group <i>windows</i> together somehow, so that you can close and save them all with one click, and then reopen them all with one click.</p><p> I make heavy use of the OSX feature “desktops”, which allows multiple separate workspaces in parallel. I&#39;ll typically have a desktop for my logging and tracking, one for chats and coms, one with open blog posts, one with writing projects, one with an open coding project, etc. Each of these are separate contexts that I can switch between for doing different kinds of work.</p><p> What I want is to be able to easily <i>save</i> each of those contexts, and easily re-open them later.</p><p> But since I&#39;ll often have multiple sessions open at the same time, across multiple desktops, I don&#39;t want the session-saver app to save <i>all</i> my windows. Just the ones that are part of a given workspace context.</p><p> The best way to do this is if the software could tell which windows were open on which desktops and use that as the discriminator. But some sort of manual drag and drop for adding a (representation of) a window (on a list of windows) to a group would work too.</p><h3> The situation</h3><p> This seems to me like something that…there should be a lot of demand for? I think lots of people have many windows, related to different projects that they want to keep separate, open on their computer at the same time.</p><p> But, as near as I can tell there&#39;s almost nothing like this.</p><p> There are a lot of session managers, browser extensions that allow you to save your tabs for the future (I&#39;ve mostly used <a href="https://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> , but there are dozens). However, they&#39;re virtually all <i>tab-centric</i> . A “session” typically refers to a single window, with multiple tabs, not to multiple windows, with multiple tabs each, which means that to reopen a session (in my “multiple windows” sense of the word), I need to mentally keep track of which windows were included and open all of them one by one, instead of clicking one button to get the context back.</p><p> There are a few session managers that save multiple windows in a session (I&#39;m thinking of <a href="https://sessionbuddy.com/">Session Buddy</a> or the less polished <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-session-manager/iaiomicjabeggjcfkbimgmglanimpnae">Tab Session Manager</a> ), but these have the opposite problem: they save <i>all</i> the open windows, including those that are part of other workflows in other desktops, which means that I have to go through and manually remove them every time I save a session. (This is especially a problem for me because there&#39;s a set of windows that I <i>always</i> keep open on my first desktop.) And on top of that, they tend to save sessions as static snapshots, rather than as mutable objects that change as you work with them, so you need to repeatedly delete old sessions and replace them with updated ones.</p><h3> Success!</h3><p> I spent a few hours over the past week, yet again, reading about and trying a bunch of tab managers in rapid succession to find any that have anything like the functionality I&#39;m wanting.</p><p> I finally found exactly one that does what I want!</p><p> It is a little finicky, with a bunch of small to medium sized UX problems. But it is good enough that I&#39;m going ahead and making a point to try using it.</p><p> I&#39;m sharing this here because maybe other people have also been wanting this functionality, and they can benefit from fruits of my laborious searching.</p><h3> Current solution: Smart Sessions – Tab Manager</h3><p> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-sessions-tab-manage/hhfefdiablijkjnbkmdfbopiimjilchh">Smart Sessions</a> is a chrome extension that does let you save groups of windows. This is the best one that I&#39;ve found so far.</p><p> When you click on the icon, there&#39;s a button for creating a new session. When you click it, it displays a list of all your current open tabs (another button organizes all those tabs by window), with checkboxes. The user checks the windows that they want to be included in a session. You give it a name and then create the session.</p><p> While a session is active (and while a default setting called “auto save” is set to Yes), when you close a tab or a window, it removes that tab or window from the session (though it does create a weird popup every time). You can also remove tabs/windows from the list manually. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pcpNhLszE7NM4wE2v/lthtckrnbkr3ta6cdngj"><br> <i>(The weird popup. It&#39;s not super clear from the text what the options mean, but I think “stop tracking” deactivates the session, and “save” removes the window you just closed from the active session.)</i></p><p> You can press the stop button, which closes all the windows, to be reopened later.</p><p> When the session is inactive, you can edit the list of tabs and windows that compose a session, removing some (though I think not adding?). You can also right click on any page, select Smart Sessions, and add that page to any session, active or not.</p><p> At the bottom of the session list, there&#39;s a button that deletes the session.</p><p> This basically has functionality that I want!</p><p> I want to first and foremost give a big hurrah to the developer Serge (Russo?), for being the only person in the world to make what seems to me and obvious and extremely helpful tab-management tool. Thank you Serge!</p><h3> Some issues or weird behavior</h3><p> However, it still has a fundamentally tab-centric design, with multi-window sessions seeming like concessions or afterthoughts, rather than core to the user experience. This results in some weird functionality.</p><ul><li> Every time you create a new session, you need to click a button so that the selection list is separated by window, instead of only a list of tabs. If you don&#39;t click this button, the selection list is a flat list of tabs, and when you create the session, all the selected tabs will be combined into a single window.<ul><li> (One UX that I could imagine is having a global setting on the settings page, “tab-centric default” vs “window-centric default”. You can still press the button to toggle individual sessions, but for window-centric session users, having a default would save me a button press each time.</li></ul></li><li> I think as a side effect of the above feature, whenever you create a new session, it takes all the windows of that session (regardless of where they are on the screen or across different desktops) and stacks them all on top of each other, so that only the top one is visible (not even some overlap so you can see how many windows are stacked on top of each other).</li><li> It would be intuitive if, while a session is active, if you opened a new window, that window was automatically added to the session. Not only does that not work, <strong>there appears to be no way to add new windows to a session</strong> . New <i>tabs</i> get added to the session, but not new windows. The right-click “add to session functionality”, adds a single page, as a new tab in one of the windows of a session, not as a new window in that session.<ul><li> The only way, as near as I can find, to increase the number of windows in a session is to drag a tab from a multi-tab window into its own window—both resulting windows are saved as part of the session. In order to add new windows to a session, the user needs to do an an awkward maneuver to exploit this functionality: first create a new tab in a window that&#39;s part of the session, and then drag it to it&#39;s own window. Or alternatively, make a new window, add that window as a tab, to one of the windows that is part of the active session, and then drag it out again. That tab, again in its own window, will be added to the session.</li></ul></li><li> As noted above, every time you close a window, that&#39;s part of the active session, this activates a popup.</li></ul><p> It would be great if these issues were addressed.</p><p> Additionally, for  some reason the extension is slow to load. Sometimes (but not always), I&#39;ll click on the icon and it will take a full two seconds for the list of sessions to appear. I haven&#39;t yet figured out what the pattern is for why there&#39;s sometimes a delay and sometimes not.</p><p> And finally, there are some worrying <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-sessions-tab-manage/hhfefdiablijkjnbkmdfbopiimjilchh">reviews</a> that suggest that at least sometimes, the whole history disappears? I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s up with that, but I&#39;m going to make a point to regularly export all my sessions (there&#39;s easy export functionality), just to be careful.</p><p> Overall though, this so far <i>works</i> , and I feel pretty excited about it.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pcpNhLszE7NM4wE2v/smart-sessions-finally-a-kinda-window-centric-session#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pcpNhLszE7NM4wE2v/smart-sessions-finally-a-kinda-window-centric-session<guid ispermalink="false"> pcpNhLszE7NM4wE2v</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eli Tyre]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 18:54:16 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[AISC project: SatisfIA – AI that satisfies without overdoing it ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 11, 2023 6:22 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> This project is part of the upcoming round of <a href="http://www.aisafety.camp/">AI Safety Camp</a> .</p><h1> SatisfIA – AI that satisfies without overdoing it</h1><h2> Summary</h2><p> This project will make a contribution to some fundamental design aspects of AI systems. We will explore novel designs for generic AI <em>agents</em> – AI systems that can be trained to act autonomously in a variety of environments – and their implementation in software.</p><p> Our designs deviate from most existing designs in that they are <em>not</em> based on the idea that the agent should aim to <em>maximize</em> some kind of objective function (which I argue is inherently unsafe if the agent is powerful enough and one cannot be absolutely sure to have found the exactly right objective function). <strong>Rather than aiming to maximize some objective function, our agents will aim to fulfill goals that are specified via constraints called “ <em>aspirations</em> ”</strong> (which I argue implies a much lower probability of taking “extreme” actions and therefore is likely much safer).</p><p> For example, I might want my AI butler to prepare 100–150 ml of tea, having a temperature of 70–80°C, taking for this at most 10 minutes, spending at most $1 worth of resources, and succeeding in this with at least 95% probability (rather than: prepare as much tea as fast and cheap as possible with the largest possible probability).</p><p> For a lightweight introduction into this way of thinking, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX0qq0K5z9c">this interview</a> .</p><p> We will study several versions of such “non-maximizing” agent designs and corresponding learning algorithms (mostly variants of Reinforcement Learning in Markov Decision Problems).</p><p> This involves designing agents and algorithms in theory, implementing them in software (mostly Python), simulating their behavior in selected test environments (eg, in the AI safety gridworlds), formulating hypotheses about that behavior, especially about its safety-relevant consequences, then trying to prove or disprove these hypotheses formally and/or provide numerical evidence that supports them, and writing-up these results in blog posts and an academic paper.</p><h2>细节</h2><p>For details, please consult <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhmK31IwYGcwqX0nKmxKsbmTh_DX3o1OoW7NJmhVbIw/edit?usp=sharing">the full proposal</a></p><h2> Applying</h2><p> To apply working on this project, please visit the <a href="https://aisafety.camp/">AI Safety Camp webpage</a> and apply for project #21</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ip2Cqas89TxsWok3S/aisc-project-satisfia-ai-that-satisfies-without-overdoing-it#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ip2Cqas89TxsWok3S/aisc-project-satisfia-ai-that-satisfies-without-overdoing-it<guid ispermalink="false"> ip2Cqas89TxsWok3S</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jobst Heitzig]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 18:22:57 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Control Symmetry: why we might want to start investigating asymmetric alignment interventions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 11, 2023 5:27 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> [This is a post summarizing the motivation for an AISC 2024 project: If you are interested in participating you can apply here: <a href="https://aisafety.camp/"><u>https://aisafety.camp/</u></a> (project 25: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuHalfHjAmFA-RKYcq3MBptFYLPvoMdy9KTPelyZ67A/edit#heading=h.9lmc73wscx1r"><u>Asymmetric control in LLMs: model editing and steering that resists control for unalignment</u></a> )]</p><p> Tl;dr: Techniques for AI alignment <i>could</i> equally be used to create misaligned models in many cases. We should attempt to develop methods that might only work for alignment and not misalignment to reduce the risk of externalities related to technical alignment research.</p><p> <strong>The problem</strong></p><p> A recent paper led by the Center for AI Safety entitled “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405"><i><u>Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency</u></i></a> ” demonstrates a number of comprehensive control techniques in the domain of machine ethics and AI safety. Notably, an impressive result on reducing power seeking and immorality on the <a href="https://aypan17.github.io/machiavelli/"><u>MACHIAVELLI benchmark</u></a> using these techniques is shown. <i><strong>However, they equally demonstrate the same technique can be used to increase power seeking and immorality!</strong></i> Several other settings in the paper demonstrate the same type of control being effective for alignment and misalignment. I am calling this property <strong>control symmetry</strong> <i>: the degree to which a given method for controlling an agent could be equally used for control towards one end and control towards the opposite end.</i></p><p> Why is this a problem? It is true, if we can demonstrate comprehensive control then we have made a lot of progress in AI safety since we can use these techniques to prevent harmful and catastrophic behavior. The concern about control symmetry is externalities, that is the degree to which safety research can end up being used towards harmful ends. It is preferred if we develop control techniques that could not be used by bad actors to create misaligned agents.</p><p> Control symmetry also provides a novel framework for asking specific questions about control and safety. For instance, is there an orthogonality of control where the level of intelligence of an agent correlates to the degree of control symmetry? Are there some properties under which control is more symmetric than others? Factuality for instance seems unlikely to be symmetric since the world itself is factually consistent. Controlling in the direction of fictionality or misinformation would lead to more and more inconsistencies that could break general behavior and capability. Because of this interventions like retrieval augmented generation are evidence of an asymmetric control intervention.</p><p> <strong>Starting to tackle the problem</strong></p><p> I am currently unaware of discussions about control symmetry in the alignment community beyond more abstract conversations about externalities and info hazards. The purpose of our AISC project will be to develop a detailed conceptualization of control symmetry in alignment as a specific externality risk as well as an understanding of the requirements for asymmetric control.</p><p> There also don&#39;t seem to be any comprehensive evaluation settings that would measure control symmetry across a variety of currently proposed control techniques like model editing and steering such that the community can benchmark how symmetric novel control techniques might be.</p><p> Finally, <i><strong>is asymmetric control even possible?</strong></i> I don&#39;t think anyone knows the answer to this question. It seems like we should have a good specific answer to this question both with well argued in-principal theoretical evidence as well as empirical evidence over attempts at asymmetric control. Being able to provide answers to this allows us to specifically formulate the risk parameters of control interventions and control research.</p><p> Regardless of the possibility, I think it is important to try to think through technical control interventions that might only work for alignment and not misalignment. If after trying our hardest we cannot, this is something we should know as a community.</p><p> Feel free to leave any feedback here (I am especially interested in prior or similar work at this point) and we will keep folks updated about our progress.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JbmDxh5WLjX8AiTQv/control-symmetry-why-we-might-want-to-start-investigating#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JbmDxh5WLjX8AiTQv/control-symmetry-why-we-might-want-to-start-investigating<guid ispermalink="false"> JbmDxh5WLjX8AiTQv</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[domenicrosati]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 18:21:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
