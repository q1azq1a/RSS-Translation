GMT<br/><br/><p><strong>摘要：</strong>历史上有先例，禁令或严厉的法规阻止了某个行业的技术进步，而社会其他领域的技术进步仍在继续。这是人工智能的美好未来。</p><p><i>认知状态：我的直觉与这里其他人强烈不同。我希望解释我的直觉，并提供足够的历史证据来使这个直觉至少可信。</i></p><p></p><h3>简介：直觉泵</h3><p>假设您在 1978 年告诉某人，美国在 2023 年之前不会建造新的核电站<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefdotwicb0t0t"><sup><a href="#fndotwicb0t0t">。 [1]</a></sup></span>这可能会非常令人惊讶。核电被认为是未来的动力。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref84mva9qulhn"><sup><a href="#fn84mva9qulhn">[2]</a></sup></span>核管理委员会三年前才成立。</p><p>有了这些信息，1978 年的某人可能会预测将会发生可怕的事情。也许美国和苏联之间会爆发核战争，摧毁美国的工业能力。也许由于人口过剩或全球变暖而导致经济崩溃。也许是<i>1984 年</i>的奥威尔式警察国家，或者是旨在监管失控核武器的世界权威。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref3czpkcc0eq9"><sup><a href="#fn3czpkcc0eq9">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>这一切都没有发生。相反，核管理委员会加大了监管力度<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefualznx45d8m"><sup><a href="#fnualznx45d8m">[4]</a></sup></span> ，直到建设新核电站变得不经济。这些法规仅适用于美国，但它们似乎对全球核电研究产生了重大影响。正在建设新核电站的国家仍在使用 1970 年之前开发的设计<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefuldhmpk9bb"><sup><a href="#fnuldhmpk9bb">。 [5]</a></sup></span></p><p>与反事实相比，对核电的监管可能确实减缓了美国未来 45 年的经济增长。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefpn3mqa4k7d"><sup><a href="#fnpn3mqa4k7d">[6]</a></sup></span>但过去 45 年并不是灾难性的。在其他行业的推动下，经济增长和创新确实在继续。</p><p></p><h3>停止 AGI 的后果？</h3><p>一些参与关于减缓或暂停人工智能的争论的人似乎认为，从长远来看，成功地阻止人工智能的进步可能会导致死亡或反乌托邦：</p><blockquote><p>要么我们弄清楚如何让通用人工智能顺利运行，要么我们等待小行星撞击。</p><p> - 萨姆·奥特曼<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefm67279lgo3j"><sup><a href="#fnm67279lgo3j">[7]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>如果我们没有人工智能，我认为未来 100 年我们有 50% 以上的机会最终死亡或走向委内瑞拉。</p><p> - 斯科特·亚历山大<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref3lk2fdp52yu"><sup><a href="#fn3lk2fdp52yu">[8]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>我认为我们应该非常担心，全球政府需要执行这样的禁令，这将大大增加永久暴政的风险，这本身就是一场生存灾难。</p><p> - 诺拉·贝尔罗斯<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefpbz6qf6ayr9"><sup><a href="#fnpbz6qf6ayr9">[9]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>看来我们需要建立一个全球性的警察国家，否则从长远来看，[无限期的人工智能暂停]将会失败。</p><p> - 马修·巴尼特<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref9k25eq052e"><sup><a href="#fn9k25eq052e">[10]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>我觉得这和我们假设的 1978 年的人犯的错误是一样的。看起来人工智能在未来将是一件极其重要的事情，因此必须发生一些戏剧性的事情才能阻止它的发生。我认为，我们应该把更多的可能性放在无聊的未来上，监管会扼杀这一领域，而社会的其他领域则继续像以前一样。</p><p>这似乎是一个重要的分歧。如果你认为我们的后代的生活会相当好，并且会变得更好（如果不是快得难以想象的话），那么停止人工智能的进步对他们来说可能是值得的。如果你认为我们的后代的未来将是“短暂而严峻的” <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref3lk2fdp52yu"><sup><a href="#fn3lk2fdp52yu">[8]</a></sup></span> ，那么在决定现在是否要冒这个风险时，他们可能不会被考虑在内。</p><p></p><h3>具体问题</h3><p>斯科特·亚历山大提到了几个具体的担忧，这些担忧使他对人工智能没有进步的未来感到悲观。每个问题似乎都是人们现在和将来应该努力解决的现实问题。我们应该改善生物安全， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefzlf149enf2a"><sup><a href="#fnzlf149enf2a">[11]</a></sup></span>促进经济增长， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefu6cbijtsn58"><sup><a href="#fnu6cbijtsn58">[12]</a></sup></span>传播民主和自由， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefxsb44grlqzh"><sup><a href="#fnxsb44grlqzh">[13]</a></sup></span>并给人们的子孙后代带来希望。但这些事情在未来 100 年内导致死亡或反乌托邦的可能性似乎都不接近 50%。为了避免这些问题，不值得接受人工智能带来的生存风险，斯科特·亚历山大估计人工智能有约 20% 的机会导致人类灭绝。</p><p>诺拉·贝尔罗斯 (Nora Belrose) 和马修·巴尼特 (Matthew Barnett) 都担心，需要一个全球警察国家来执行对人工智能进步的长期禁令。这种立场在人工智能安全社区中似乎并不罕见。人们担心研究可能会转移到监管较少的地方，而算法的进步将使通用人工智能在个人计算机上成为可能。避免通用人工智能的唯一方法是大规模扩张全球政府权力。</p><p></p><h3>其他历史例子</h3><p>我认为其他技术还没有实现这些担忧。</p><p>一个行业的法规不会阻止所有其他行业的进步。湾区的人们可能低估了人工智能以外的新兴技术的重要性，或者更广泛地说软件的重要性，因为信息技术在当地经济中的重要性不成比例。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefq6trr5y0v1f"><sup><a href="#fnq6trr5y0v1f">[14]</a></sup></span>我同样预计 1950 年生活在底特律的人们会低估汽车以外的新兴技术的重要性。如果没有人工智能，仍然可以取得很多进展。我特别兴奋的两项新兴技术是核聚变和太空殖民。</p><p>一个国家的法规可能会阻碍单一行业的进步。某个特定行业的进展停滞并不罕见。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref0bq1vg5uljy"><sup><a href="#fn0bq1vg5uljy">[15]</a></sup></span>特定行业的大多数创新都是在一个或几个城市进行的。这些创新集群很难建立和维护，因此，如果一个创新集群被监管压垮，它通常不会转移到另一个国家。从更广泛的角度来看，一些国家比其他国家更具创新性。在大多数行业，包括受到严格监管的行业，美国显然比欧洲或东亚（大部分）更具创新性，而欧洲或东亚又比世界其他地区更具创新性。很多事情都必须向好的方向发展：高生活水平、受过教育的民众、法治、未来利润的可能性、可用资本以及鼓励创新的文化。标榜国际法规或规范的国家通常不会吸引创新。一旦一项技术存在，其他国家就更容易复制它。所需的设计和技能已经存在，并且该技术的好处是显而易见的。防止创新的监管比防止扩散的监管容易得多。</p><p>我之前调查过一些可抵抗的技术诱惑， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref14m5yvhuzdj"><sup><a href="#fn14m5yvhuzdj">[16]</a></sup></span>或通过我们当前的机构实现了长期暂停的技术：</p><ul><li><strong>核电</strong>，如上所述。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnreffb9jpk8y0qa"><sup><a href="#fnfb9jpk8y0qa">[17]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>地球工程</strong>并不是明确违法的，但科学家和活动人士的反对甚至阻止了研究的进行。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefp6r8lh3a1ta"><sup><a href="#fnp6r8lh3a1ta">[18]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>疫苗开发</strong>在西方国家受到严格监管。在最近的大流行期间，俄罗斯和中国都放松了一些限制，并在西方之前批准了疫苗。由此产生的疫苗效果较差，因为最好的医学研究仍然位于西方。特别是，<strong>人体挑战试验</strong>已被监管为几乎不存在。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref1rfwwl0q1g"><sup><a href="#fn1rfwwl0q1g">[19]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>核武器</strong>有时被认为是一种监管未能阻止其扩散的技术。我认为这个例子的证据是混杂的。大约有 10 个国家拥有核武器（比拥有核武器的数量少得多），但只有 2 个国家独立开发核武器：美国和法国。尖端研究尚未转移到非《不扩散核武器条约》缔约国的国家。印度、巴基斯坦和朝鲜似乎拥有与 20 世纪 40 年代和 50 年代的美国或苏联类似的能力。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefg6e7iucwc7"><sup><a href="#fng6e7iucwc7">[20]</a></sup></span>试验禁令可能也有助于防止核武器变得越来越强大：有史以来威力最大的炸弹于 1961 年引爆。</li><li><strong>生物武器</strong>有一些最严厉的条约禁止其开发或使用，而且没有一个国家公开拥有生物武器计划。这个例子的一个问题是苏联签署了禁止开发生物武器的条约 - 然后继续开发它们。</li><li>各种核技术，如<strong>原子园艺</strong>、<strong>在建筑中使用核爆炸</strong>或<strong>猎户座计划</strong>，已经被提出但尚未开发。</li><li><strong>克隆最有效的士兵</strong>从未被实现过。</li><li>中国的一名研究人员在被捕之前已经对<strong>人类进行了基因改造</strong>。</li><li>目前还不清楚<strong>殖民主义</strong>是否算作一种技术。明朝在 1400 年代初决定停止其宝船舰队，使全球殖民主义推迟了约 50 年，并可能影响了中国几个世纪的发展轨迹。</li><li><strong>贝尔实验室</strong>在 1945 年至 1980 年间发明或发现了晶体管、电荷耦合器件、光伏电池、信息论、Unix、C 和宇宙微波背景辐射。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref551akuqm31p"><sup><a href="#fn551akuqm31p">[21]</a></sup></span> 1982 年贝尔系统被反垄断法打破后，那里的研究界就分裂了。似乎有理由认为，有些技术之所以没有被发明，是因为这个异常多产的创新中心被摧毁了。</li></ul><p>大多数技术并未被禁止，其进步也没有受到监管的抑制。大多数技术也不像人工智能那么可怕：我很难想象太阳能电池板或圆珠笔如何构成 x 风险。听起来可怕的技术，如大规模杀伤性武器或某些类型的医学研究，经常面临禁令或法规，使它们的开发不再值得，而这些禁令有时会起作用。</p><p>我不想说对听起来可怕的技术的有效禁令是默认发生的。当他们工作时，他们是共同努力的结果。但在不扰乱社会其他部分的情况下，禁止一项具有潜在危险的新技术似乎是非常可行的。</p><p></p><h3>也许人工智能会有所不同</h3><p>虽然这篇文章主要是关于其他技术被停止的历史先例，但似乎值得特别谈谈人工智能。人工智能与其他技术不同的原因有几个：</p><ol><li>人工智能研究比其他新兴技术更容易远程进行。</li><li>人工智能系统一旦创建，就可以作为软件轻松传输。</li><li>简单的经济模型表明，强大的人工智能对于采用它的人来说都将带来极大的经济优势。</li></ol><p>所有技术都是不同的。有些差异使监管变得更容易或更困难，但这些差异都没有大到使监管变得不可能的程度：</p><ol><li>执法部门可以根据研究进行的地点或研究人员居住的地点来执行法律。美国尤其对其法律适用范围有着广泛的看法。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefqnyaglfoig"><sup><a href="#fnqnyaglfoig">[22]</a></sup></span></li><li>大多数拟议的法规都集中在训练强大的人工智能所需的硬件上。</li><li>政策制定者并不知道这一点。他们知道有人在告诉他们这些。他们肯定不知道，如果他们支持这个特定的项目，他们将在他们关心的时间范围内获得通用人工智能的经济承诺。这些承诺与其他技术的炒作并没有太大区别。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefv96bbayqvig"><sup><a href="#fnv96bbayqvig">[23]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>还有一些方法可以更轻松地监管人工智能。</p><p>供应链有多个阶段，世界上只有一家或几家公司能够从事尖端工作。只需要少数参与者进行协调即可使监管发挥作用。</p><p>当前领先的人工智能模型需要大量计算，这是资本密集型且易于跟踪的。随着算法效率的足够改进，这种情况可能会改变。但我们应该预计，随着资本和人才转移到其他行业，算法的进步将急剧放缓，以应对人工智能的长期停滞。</p><p>许多物质和物品都受到监管，并且该监管的细节根据其内容和政府试图避免的内容而有很大差异。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnreffp5yyyzqajs"><sup><a href="#fnfp5yyyzqajs">[24]</a></sup></span>监管 GPU 将面临一些独特的挑战，但在我们当前的机构下似乎并非不可能。</p><p></p><h3>暂停多长时间？</h3><p>大多数历史证据表明全球停顿已经持续了大约 50 年。这是讨论 100 年暂停的有用证据。如果“长期”意味着一千年，那么历史证据就少得多。马修·巴尼特 (Matthew Barnett) 认为，现有机构内的监管棘轮可能会导致人工智能研究暂停 50 年，但要实现 1000 年的暂停，就需要采取更戏剧性的措施。</p><p>我怀疑全球警察国家是否会比更正常的监管更容易维持一千年。我关于如何在这个时间范围内维持机构的模型是：</p><ol><li>建立一个持续一代人的机构。</li><li>让下一代相信维持这个机构是一件好事。</li></ol><p>如果你在（2）中失败，那么建立什么机构并不重要。如果连精英阶层都不相信警察国家是好事，那么它就无法维持下去。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefwx71dbbygd"><sup><a href="#fnwx71dbbygd">[25]</a></sup></span>一个机构如果硬实力较少，但更善于让人们相信它，那么它更有可能持续一千年。</p><p></p><h3>结论</h3><p>构建 AGI 是一项极其不确定的工作。它可能会带来我们光荣的未来。它可能会导致人类灭绝。这甚至可能是不可能的。如果我们决定不尝试构建通用人工智能，那么未来的不确定性似乎就会少得多。社会显然仍将不是最优的，但也远非反乌托邦。取得科学、技术、经济、社会和政治进步将继续困难重重，但人们将继续这样做。我们可以继续希望我们的孩子，以及他们的孩子，在未来的很长一段时间里，至少能有微小的改善。</p><p>如果一项听起来很可怕的技术面临监管棘轮，从而减缓甚至停止该领域的所有进展，那也不足为奇。这不是死亡或反乌托邦——这是正常的。<br><br></p><p><i>感谢

2023 9:13 PM GMT<br/><br/><p>我一直与萨米·彼得森就他的<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sHGxvJrBag7nhTQvb/?commentId=mmvwCeHzzojY9Gf2a"><u>“无懈可击的不完整偏好”</u></a>进行了一些<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sHGxvJrBag7nhTQvb/invulnerable-incomplete-preferences-a-formal-statement-1?commentId=XpY4YxF4tFfGzNbbK">富有成效的</a>讨论（旨在补充<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-user-files-01/u-242443/uploads/2023-05-02/m343uwh/The%20Shutdown%20Problem-%20Two%20Theorems%2C%20Incomplete%20Preferences%20as%20a%20Solution.pdf">艾略特·索恩利解决关机问题的方法</a>）。这篇文章是我迄今为止从讨论中得到的一些有用文章的（非正式）提炼。</p><h2>关机问题</h2><p>从概念上讲：我们希望为强大的人工智能配备一个关机按钮。如果按钮未被按下，我们希望 AI 遵循一个目标（我们将其称为“目标”）。如果按下按钮，我们希望人工智能遵循不同的目标（我们称之为“偏离目标”）。据推测，偏离目标涉及人工智能关闭自身及其所有相关工具/子/等，但这部分是当前目的的风味文本。</p><p>我们在这里要避免的关键故障模式是意外地激励人工智能操纵关机按钮——即要么导致其被按下，要么导致其未被按下。为什么会发生这种情况？好吧，假设当我们第一次打开人工智能时，它<i>只是</i>针对目标进行优化。人工智能意识到，如果按下按钮，它未来的自我将停止针对目标进行优化，因此它将在目标上实现较低的性能。因此，人工智能意识到，通过阻止按钮被按下，它可以在目标上取得更好的表现。由于它只是针对目标性能进行优化，因此它会阻止按钮被按下。</p><p> <a href="https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf"><u>MIRI 关于关机问题的论文</u></a>详细介绍了针对关机问题的简单建议的更多示例，以及它们如何激励某种按钮操作。事实证明，通常很难从任何预期的效用最大化器中获得所需的行为（即没有按钮操作）。</p><h2>为什么很难，第 1 级：期望的行为意味着不完整的显示偏好</h2><p>为什么很难让预期的效用最大化器不操作按钮（同时仍然做有用的事情）？这是我从与萨米的讨论中得到的一个直观答案。</p><p>中心思想是询问我们希望关闭按钮代理的行为意味着该代理所显示的偏好是什么。</p><p>假设在不同的时间，为代理提供了花费资源的机会，以便使按钮被按下/取消按下。我们希望代理人<i>在两个方向上</i>拒绝这样的机会——这意味着对任何显示的偏好漠不关心或缺乏偏好。此外，我们确实希望代理花费资源在按下按钮或未按下按钮的世界中产生各种不同的结果，因此在按下按钮的世界和未按下按钮的世界中存在不平凡的显示偏好排序。但是，如果代理要拒绝导致按钮被按下/松开的代价高昂的机会，并且这些机会在足够多不同的按下结果和未按下结果对之间跳转（它们本身都有不平凡的显示偏好），那么将会有揭示的偏好差距——即行为<i>不能</i>用完整的偏好来表示，只能用不完整的偏好来表示。</p><p>视觉上： </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJofoQX7EjMFxDo6m/xfewi1h80r9jpibzyaxl"><figcaption>代理花费资源从​​ A1 移动到 A2，但不花费资源在 B 和任一 A 结果之间向任一方向移动。这就是“偏好差距”；它很有趣，因为任何与偏好差距一致的偏好分配必定是不完整的。</figcaption></figure><p>我们希望代理花费资源在未按下按钮的世界中从结果 A1 移动到 A2，因此它在那里有一个显示的偏好。但我们希望代理<i>不要</i>花费资源在 A1 和 B 之间移动，<i>无论是哪个方向</i>- 因此它要么显示出冷漠（假设代理具有非零的出价/要价价差），要么显示出 A1 和 B1 之间偏好的不完整性。按照同样的逻辑，A2 和 B1 之间也要么表现出冷漠，要么不完整。但是，由于代理对 A2 的显示偏好高于 A1，因此任何显示的偏好分配在 A1/B1 和 A2/B1 之间都不能是无差异的；这意味着 A1 和 A2 之间是冷漠的。因此，代理人所透露的偏好<i>一定</i>是不完整的。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnreft75wmozjvgf"><sup><a href="#fnt75wmozjvgf">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>结果：（一种框架方式）关闭问题首先困难/有趣的原因是，期望的行为意味着暴露的偏好差距。例如，任何标准的预期效用最大化者<i>都不能</i>有显性的偏好差距，这样的标准欧盟最大化者<i>就不能</i>按照我们想要的方式行事。</p><p>关于此的一些注释：</p><ul><li>所显示的偏好可能非常不确定，即可能存在许多与代理行为兼容的偏好分配。上面的论点表明，<i>任何与</i>期望行为一致的偏好分配<i>都一定</i>是不完整的。</li><li>请注意，故事隐式地通过因果干预/反事实来探索偏好，即我们感兴趣的是代理是否会花费资源来<i>导致</i>按钮被按下/松开。这与本文无关，但对于那些想要将这一切正式化的人来说可能很重要。</li><li>显然，有时人们认为 A 和 B 之间“无偏好”（即不完整性）意味着代理人在两者之间随机/任意选择。这并不是这里所说的“无偏好”的概念。我们谈论的是“无偏好”，就像“只要有机会，代理人不会为了获得另一个而放弃任何一个”。</li></ul><p>好吧，现在我们有一个相对直观的故事来解释为什么在关闭问题中很难让预期的效用最大化者按照我们想要的方式行事：只要欧盟最大化者没有揭示偏好差距，他们就无法按照我们想要的方式行事我们想要。 （更一般地说，如果我们正在训练一个代理，任何一维奖励信号都可能无法激励显示的偏好差距。）但是，那么解决方案大概就是……使用一个具有不完整偏好的代理？</p><h2>为什么很难，第二级：不完整的偏好想要完成</h2><p>帖子<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bzmLC3J8PsknwRZbr/why-not-subagents"><u>为什么不选择子代理？</u></a>对此进行了更深入的探讨，但我将在这里进行简要概述。</p><p>回顾我们的 A1、A2 和 B1 图表，我们可以想象一组不完整的偏好，它比 A1 更喜欢 A2，但在 B1 和 A 中的任何一个之间没有偏好（即代理不会花费资源在未按下按钮和按下按钮的结果，反之亦然）。但该代理将花费资源将 A1 结果转变为 A2 结果。</p><p> Now the problem: this agent can potentially probabilistically precommit to accepting <i>both</i> opportunities to turn A1 outcomes into B1 outcomes (ie spend resources to make the button be pressed), and turn B1 outcomes into A2 outcomes (ie spend resources to make the button not be pressed). If it does both of these with the right probabilities, then it can maintain the same proportions of pressed (B1) and unpressed (A1+A2) outcomes, but shift some probability mass from A1 outcomes to A2. That&#39;s an improvement, by the incomplete preferences: the agent isn&#39;t accepting any net shift between A&#39;s and B&#39;s, it&#39;s just net-shifting probability around within A-outcomes, but it&#39;s doing so by manipulating the shutdown button.</p><p> (I learned from Sami&#39;s post that this is called “trammelling” of incomplete preferences.)</p><p> So we want some kind of agent which won&#39;t do that.</p><p> Some notes on this:</p><ul><li> The key question is whether the <i>revealed</i> preferences are immune to trammelling. This was a major point of confusion for me in discussion with Sami - his proposal involves a set of preferences passed into a decision rule, but those “preferences” are (potentially) different from the <i>revealed</i> preferences. (I&#39;m still unsure whether Sami&#39;s proposal solves the problem.)</li><li> That divergence between revealed “preferences” vs “preferences” in the sense of a goal passed to some kind of search/planning/decision process potentially opens up some approaches to solve the problem.</li><li> One can obviously design a not-very-smart agent which has stable incomplete preferences. The interesting question is how to do this without major limitations on the capability of the agent or richness of the environment.</li><li> Note that trammelling involves <i>causing</i> switches between outcomes across which the agent has no preference. My instinct is that causality is somehow key here; we&#39;d like the agent to not cause switches between pressed and unpressed outcomes even if the relative frequencies of both outcomes stay the same. </li></ul><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fnt75wmozjvgf"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnreft75wmozjvgf">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> This all assumes transitivity of preferences; one could perhaps relax transitivity rather than incompleteness, but then we&#39;re in much wilder territory.

But yeah, technology, broadly speaking, gets people more of what they want. And this can sometimes be a problem when accidents happen, or when the thing people want isn&#39;t actually what&#39;s good for them.</p><p> But usually, people getting what they want is good. It&#39;s actually a reasonable basis for a definition of what &#39;good&#39; is, as far as I&#39;m concerned. And so most technology just works out good overall. If you only had one dial that was, like, “more” or “less”  - and I know that you don&#39;t, but if you did - technology comes out as being good, very good in fact. And then, AGI is this weird other thing, where you have a technology which gets more of what <i>it</i> wants, rather than more of what people want. And this makes it unique in the class of technology and therefore needs a different approach … so when talking about AI risk, it&#39;s fraught to use arguments which also would seem to apply to technology in general, since a bunch of other tech that people were worried about turns out to be fine. It feels like it makes it easy for people to address that part, or pull it into this existing debate and ignore the part of it that I think is really important -- which is the AGI side of things.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> Robert Miles </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="5rD8KRMWffhtosxp3-Sun, 15 Oct 2023 22:42:31 GMT" user-id="5rD8KRMWffhtosxp3" display-name="Holly_Elmore" submitted-date="Sun, 15 Oct 2023 22:42:31 GMT" user-order="3"><p> I think this gets at another general theme that was intended for this discussion: advocacy communication is different than communicating on LessWrong.

I also think, for people who are really educated on the topic and for a lot of people in our circles who know a lot about tech and are generally broadly pro-tech, that might be a really important argument for them psychologically.

We don&#39;t like where this technology is going, we don&#39;t like where technology is going in general, and we want to stop it.”</p><p> And I want to yell at that group, and have that be part of the conversation.

Precisely how much risk should we tolerate for what benefit seems like a subjective question. However, most people are in fact fairly risk-averse on matters like this. If you ask most stakeholders, meaning the global population [NB: the stakeholder are the population of Earth but the polls I was thinking are of Americans], they generally favor a risk-averse approach. That seems correct in this context. It feels different from the kind of risk/reward we&#39;re typically set up to think about. We&#39;re not particularly equipped to think well about the risk of something as significant as a global nuclear war, and that&#39;s arguably more survivable than getting AI wrong.</p><p> I feel I am more risk-averse than a lot of our friends. My instinct is, let&#39;s just not go down that path right now. I feel like I could get the right answer to any hypothetical if you presented me with various fake utilities on the different sides.  Yet the real question is, do we take the leap now or later? I assume that any pause on AI advancement would <i>eventually</i> be lifted unless our society collapses for other reasons.

But I was confused, and I really appreciated the TIME article where he mentions enforcing treaties using the same state violence as for other international treaties.)</p><p> Still, for a long time, I was unsure about the AI safety community&#39;s commitment due to their seeming reluctance to adopt more visible and legible actions, like being out in the streets protesting… even though I myself am not typically one to attend protests.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> Holly_Elmore </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="YpWtrjmuEgioeWRNg-Sun, 15 Oct 2023 22:45:35 GMT" user-id="YpWtrjmuEgioeWRNg" display-name="Robert Miles" submitted-date="Sun, 15 Oct 2023 22:45:35 GMT" user-order="2"><p> I think it&#39;s maybe a dispositional thing.

Which one will have the bigger impact? I think it&#39;s the technology. Activists need to push for change, but it&#39;s technology that makes the change politically doable. I think people are like... the foam on the top of the enormous waves of the grand economic shifts that change what&#39;s politically and socially viable. For instance, I think our ability to get through the climate crisis mostly depends on renewable energy tech (if AGI somehow doesn&#39;t happen first) - make clean energy cheaper than fossil fuels, people will switch. I think all the vegan activism might end up being outweighed by superior substitute meats. When there&#39;s meat products that are indistinguishable from farmed meat but a tiny bit cheaper, the argument for veganism will mysteriously become massively more compelling to many. In both those cases, one big thing advocates did was create support for funding the research. I even think I remember reading someone suggest that the abolitionist movement really got traction in places that had maple syrup, because <i>those people had access to a relatively inexpensive alternative supply of sugar,</i> so being moral was cheaper for them. Obviously, activists are essential to push the arguments, but often these arguments don&#39;t gain traction until the technology/economics/pragmatics make them feasible. People are amazingly able to believe falsehoods when it&#39;s convenient, and technology can change what&#39;s convenient.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> Robert Miles </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="5rD8KRMWffhtosxp3-Sun, 15 Oct 2023 22:46:01 GMT" user-id="5rD8KRMWffhtosxp3" display-name="Holly_Elmore" submitted-date="Sun, 15 Oct 2023 22:46:01 GMT" user-order="3"><p> We could call this the “efficient market hypothesis of history” or something.

I even think there are some individuals who kind of know what you can do with advocacy.  They know about policy and understand that influencing even a small number of people can shift the Overton window.  And still, even those people with an inside view that advocacy can sometimes work, will struggle with whether it&#39;s the right approach or feel like somehow it <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> work, or that they should be focusing on what they deem more generally important (or identify with more).</p><p> However, I think what we&#39;re discussing is a unique moment in time.

I made sure there were places where people could delve deeper and get the full statement. However, the amount of confusion was astonishing. People bring their own preconceptions to it; some felt strongly about the issue and didn&#39;t like the activist tone, while others saw the tone as too technical. People misunderstood a message I thought was straightforward. The core message was, &quot;Meta, don&#39;t share your model weights.&quot; It was fairly simple, but then I was even implied to be racist on Twitter because I was allegedly claiming that foreign companies couldn&#39;t build models that were as powerful as Meta&#39;s??

It was similar to when, as a kid vegetarian, I always heard such terrible arguments from adults about eating meat. There was just no pressure to have a good argument. They already knew how it was gonna turn out: society had ruled in their favor, and I was a kid. Yet it was so clearly wrong, and it bothered me that they didn&#39;t care.</p><p> Then, after Eliezer&#39;s Time article came out, I once again saw a wall of that from people not wanting to move in a political direction.

And I just thought “okay, it just so happens I&#39;ve accumulated some more knowledge about advocacy than any of you, and I really feel that you&#39;re wrong about why this isn&#39;t going to work”. I felt somebody really needs to be doing this. How would I feel if, I got a glimpse of “this is it, we&#39;re getting killed, it&#39;s happening” and I hadn&#39;t even tried?

Billions are being poured into AI capabilities, and the results are staggering. New models are <a href="https://pauseai.info/sota"><u>outperforming humans</u></a> in a lot of domains. As capabilities increase, so do the <a href="https://pauseai.info/risks"><u>risks</u></a> . Scientists are even <a href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk"><u>warning</u></a> that AI might <a href="https://pauseai.info/xrisk"><u>end up destroying humanity</u></a> . This dire outcome not only seems possible, but also likely, as the average probability estimates for these outcomes <a href="https://pauseai.info/polls-and-surveys"><u>range from 14% to 40%</u></a> .</p><p> We need our leaders to listen to these warnings, but they are not taking this topic remotely as seriously as they should. There is AI safety legislation being drafted, but <a href="https://twitter.com/PauseAI/status/1704998018322141496"><u>not a single measure would actually prevent or delay superintelligent AI</u></a> . <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/18/23836362/ai-slow-down-poll-regulation"><u>Over 70%</u></a> wants to slow down AI, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll"><u>over 60%</u></a> want regulation to actively prevent superintelligent AI. Why is there no legislation draft that actually does this? The answer is lobbying: our politicians are <a href="https://fedscoop.com/sen-schumer-to-host-musk-zuckerberg-and-other-tech-ceos-for-closed-door-ai-forum/"><u>mostly meeting AI company CEOs</u></a> , and they will push policy measures that are in their interest.</p><p> On November 1st and 2nd, the very first AI Safety Summit will be held in the UK. The perfect opportunity to set the first steps towards sensible international AI safety regulation.</p><h2> <strong>What we ask</strong></h2><ul><li> <strong>Policy makers</strong> : Don&#39;t allow companies to build a superintelligence. Regulations and hardware restrictions should apply before training has started as it is very difficult to control dissemination once a new capability has been achieved. 。 We cannot allow companies to train potentially world-ending AI models. Writing legislation is hard, and it takes time, but we may not have that long, so work as if your life depends on it. Because it does.</li><li> <strong>Companies</strong> : Many of you are scared of what AI can do, but you&#39;re locked in a race. So be vocal about supporting a pause in principle. If you sign statements that this technology could kill us all, show the world that you&#39;d prefer not to build it if it was a viable option.</li><li> <strong>Summit invitees</strong> : Prioritize safety over economic growth. We know AI can make our countries richer, but that&#39;s not why you&#39;re summoned here.

But the vocabulary we use has a serious ambiguity problem because <i>conspiracies</i> are not figments of the imagination. There is a tangible and qualitative distinction between plain-vanilla <i>conspiracies</i> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White">Operation Snow White</a> , or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> ) and their more theatrical cousins (flat earth theory, the moon landing hoax, or the farcical notion that coffee tastes good), yet a clear delineation has been elusive and it&#39;s unsatisfying to just assert “this one is crazy, and this one isn&#39;t.” Both camps involve subterfuge, malevolent intent, covert operations, misinformation, orchestrated deceit, hidden agendas, clandestine networks, and yes, <i>conspiracy</i> , and yet the attempts to differentiate between the two have veered into unsatisfactory or plainly misleading territories.</p><p> What I&#39;ll argue is the solution boils down to a simple reconfiguration of the definition that captures the essence of the absurdity: <i>conspiracy theories</i> are theories that assume circumstances that render the titular “conspiracy” unnecessary. This is what I&#39;ll refer to as the Overkill Conspiracy Hypothesis (OCH). Before we dive into this refinement, it&#39;s helpful to explore why traditional distinctions have fallen short.</p><p> The section on differences in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#Difference_from_conspiracy"><u>The People&#39;s Pedia</u></a> showcases some of these misguided attempts. For example, conspiracy theories <i>tend</i> to be in opposition to mainstream consensus but that&#39;s a naked appeal to authority — logic that would have tarred the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9705/tobacco/history/"><u>early challengers to the supposed health benignity of smoking</u></a> as loons. Or that theories portray conspirators acting with extreme malice, but humans can indeed harbor evil intentions ( <i>see generally</i> , human history). Another relies on the implausibility of maintaining near-perfect operational security. This is getting better, but while maintaining secrecy is hard, it&#39;s definitely not impossible. We have actual, real-life examples of covert military operations, or drug cartels that manage to operate clandestine billion-dollar logistical enterprises.</p><hr><p> There&#39;s still some useful guidance to draw from the pile of chaff, and that&#39;s conspiracy theories&#39; lack of, and resistance to, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"><u>falsifiability</u></a> . Despite its unfortunate name, falsifiability is one of my nearest and dearest concepts for navigating the world. Put simply, falsifiability is the ability for a theory to be proven wrong <i>at least hypothetically</i> . The classic example is “I believe all swans are white, but I would change my mind if I saw a black swan”. The classic counterexample could be <a href="https://archive.org/details/japaneseevacuati00dewi/page/32/mode/2up?q=confirming"><u>General John DeWitt citing</u></a> the <i>absence</i> of sabotage by Japanese-Americans during WWII as <i>evidence</i> of future sabotage plans. There is indeed a trend of conspiracy theorists digging into their <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief-in-belief"><u>belief in belief</u></a> , and dismissing contrary evidence as either fabricated, or (worse) evidence of the conspiracy itself.</p><p> I won&#39;t talk shit about the falsifiability test; it&#39;s really good stuff. But it has limitations. For one, the lack of falsifiability is only a good <i>indication</i> a theory is deficient, not a <i>conclusive</i> determination. There are also practical considerations, like how historical events can be difficult to apply falsifiability because the evidence is incomplete or hopelessly lost, or how insufficient technology in an emerging scientific field can place some falsifiable claims (temporarily, hopefully) beyond scrutiny. So the inability to falsify a theory does not <i>necessarily</i> mean that the theory is bunk.</p><p> Beyond those practical limitations, there&#39;s also the unfortunate bad actor factor. Theorists with sufficient dishonesty or self-awareness can respond to the existential threat of falsifiability by resorting to vague innuendo to avoid tripping over shoelaces of their own making. Since you can&#39;t falsify what isn&#39;t firmly posited, they dance around direct assertions, keeping their claims shrouded in a mist of maybe. The only recourse then is going one level higher, and deducing vagueness as a telltale sign of a falsifiability fugitive wherever concrete answers to the <i>who / how / why</i> remain elusive. Applying the vagueness test to the flat earth theory showcases the evasion. It&#39;s near-impossible to get <a href="https://youtu.be/JTfhYyTuT44?t=1150"><u>any clear answers from proponents</u></a> : <i>who</i> exactly is behind Big Globe, <i>how</i> did they manage to hoodwink everyone, and <i>why why why why why</i> would anyone devote any effort to this scheme? In contrast, True Conspiracies™ like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spies"><u>atomic spies</u></a> lack the nebulousness: Soviet Union / covert transmission of nuclear secrets / geopolitical advantage.</p><p> Yet the vagueness accusation doesn&#39;t apply to all conspiracy theories. The moon landing hoax is surprisingly lucid on this point: NASA / soundstage / geopolitical advantage. And this unveils another defense mechanism against falsification, which is the setting of ridiculously high standards of evidence. Speaking of veils, there&#39;s a precedent for this in Islamic law of all places, where <a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/Legal_Systems_Very_Different_13/Book_Draft/Systems/Islamic_Law_Chapter.htm"><u>convictions for fornication</u></a> require <i>four</i> eyewitnesses to the <i>same</i> act of intercourse, and <i>only</i> adult male Muslims are deemed competent witnesses. The impossibly stringent standards appear to be in response to the fact that the offense carries the death penalty, and shows it&#39;s possible to raise the bar so high that falsifiability is <i>intentionally</i> rendered out of reach.</p><p> The moon landing hoax might be subjected to these impossible standards, given that the Apollo 11 landing was <a href="https://youtu.be/iR3oXFFISI0?t=1054"><u>meticulously documented over 143 minutes</u></a> of uninterrupted video footage — a duration <a href="https://theconversation.com/moon-landings-footage-would-have-been-impossible-to-fake-a-film-expert-explains-why-118426"><u>too lengthy to fit on a film reel</u></a> with the technology available at the time. Although only slightly higher than the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/"><u>Lizardman Constant</u></a> , a surprising <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/usa_millions-still-believe-1969-moon-landing-was-hoax/6172262.html"><u>6% of Americans still hold the view</u></a> that the moon landing was staged. At some point you have to ask how much evidence is enough, but ultimately there&#39;s no universally accepted threshold for answering this question.</p><p> So falsifiability remains a fantastic tool, but it has legitimate practical limitations, and isn&#39;t a conclusive inquiry anyways. Someone&#39;s refusal to engage in falsifiability remains excellent evidence they&#39;re aware and concerned of subjecting their theory to scrutiny, but their efforts (vagueness or impossible standards) will nevertheless still frustrate a straightforward application of falsifiability. So what&#39;s left?</p><hr><p> We&#39;re finally back again to the Overkill Conspiracy Hypothesis, where the circumstances conspiracy theories must assume also, ironically, render the conspiracy moot. The best way to explain this is by example. Deconstructing a conspiracy theory replicates the thrill of planning a bank heist, so put yourself in the shoes of the unfortunate anonymous bureaucrat tasked with overseeing the moon landing hoax. Remember that the <i>why</i> of the moon landing hoax was to establish geopolitical prestige by having the United States beat the Soviet Union to the lunar chase. So whatever scheme you concoct <i>has</i> to withstand scrutiny from what was, at the time, the most advanced space program employing the greatest space engineers from that half of the world.</p><p> The most straightforward countermeasure would be to task already existing NASA engineers to draft up <i>totally fake but absolutely plausible</i> equipment designs. <i>Every single aspect of the entire launch</i> — each rocket, lunar module, ladder, panel, bolt, glove, wrench — would need to be painstakingly fabricated to deceive not just the global audience, but the eagle-eyed experts watching with bated breath from the other side of the Cold War divide. Extend that to all communications, video transmissions, photographs, astronaut testimonies, and &#39;returned&#39; moon rocks. Each and all of it has to be exhaustively and meticulously examined by dedicated and highly specialized consultants.</p><p> But it doesn&#39;t stop there, because you also need <i>absolute and</i> <i>perpetual</i> secrecy, as any singular leak would threaten the entire endeavor. The US was well aware Soviet Union spies had successfully snagged closely-guarded nuclear secrets, so whatever countermeasures needed here had to <i>surpass fucking nukes</i> . Like I said before, secrecy is not impossible, just very difficult. I suppose NASA could take a page from the cartels and just institute brutally violent reprisals against any snitches (plus their whole families), but this genre of deterrence can only work if…people know about it. More likely, though, NASA would use the traditional intelligence agency methods of extensive vetting, selective recruitment, and lavish compensation, but now all measures would need to be further amplified to <i>surpass</i> the protective measures around nuclear secrets.</p><p> We&#39;re talking screening hundreds or thousands of individuals more rigorously than for nuclear secrets, alongside an expanding surveillance apparatus to keep everyone in line. How much do you need to increase NASA&#39;s budget (10x? 100x?) to devote toward a risky gambit that, if exposed, would be history&#39;s forever laughingstock? If such vast treasuries are already at disposal, it starts to seem easier to just…go to the moon for real.</p><hr><p> OCH <sup>®</sup> has several benefits. It starts by not challenging any conspiracy theorist&#39;s premises. It accepts it as given that there is indeed a sufficiently motivated shadowy cabal, and just runs with it. This sidesteps any of the aforementioned concerns about falsifiability fugitives, and still provides a useful rubric for distinguishing plain-vanilla conspiracies from their black sheep brethren.</p><p> If we apply OCH to the atomic spies, we can see the theory behind that conspiracy requires no overkill assumptions. The Soviet Union did not have nukes, they wanted nukes, and stealing someone else&#39;s blueprints is definitely much easier than developing your own in-house. The necessary assumption (the Soviet Union has an effective espionage program) does not negate the need for the conspiracy.</p><p> Contrast that with something like the Sandy Hook hoax, which posits the school shooting as a false flag operation orchestrated by the government to pass restrictive gun laws (or something; see the vagueness section above). Setting aside the fact that no significant firearm legislation actually resulted, the hoax and the hundreds of crisis actors it would have required would have necessitated thousands of auditions, along with all the secrecy hurdles previously discussed. And again, if the government already has access to this mountain of resources, it seems like there are far more efficient methods of spending it (like maybe giving every congressman some gold bars) rather than orchestrating an attack and then hoping the right laws get passed afterward.</p><p> It&#39;s also beguiling to wonder exactly why the shadowy cabal would even need to orchestrate a fake mass shooting, given the fact that they already regularly happen! Even if the cabal wanted to instigate a slaughter (for whatever reason), the far, far, far simpler method is to just identify the loner incel kid and prod them into committing an <i>actual</i> mass shooting. We&#39;ve already stipulated the cabal does not care about dead kids. Similarly, if the US wanted to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks as a prelude to global war, it seems far easier to load up an actual plane full of actual explosives and just actually launch it at the actual buildings, rather than to spend the weeks or months to surreptitiously sneak in however many tons of thermite into the World Trade Center (while <i>also</i> coordinating the schedule with the plane impact, for some reason).</p><p> Examining other examples of Verified Conspiracies demonstrate how none of them harbor overkill assumptions that render the conspiratorial endeavors moot. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal"><u>Watergate scandal</u></a> , the motive was to gain political advantage by spying on adversaries, and the conspirators did so through simple breaking and entering. No assumptions are required about the capabilities of President Nixon&#39;s security entourage that would have rendered the trespass unnecessary. Even something with the scope of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White"><u>Operation Snow White</u></a> — which remains one of the largest infiltrations of the US government, involving up to 5,000 agents — fits. The fact that they had access to thousands of covert agents isn&#39;t overkill, because the agents still needed to infiltrate government agencies to gain access to the documents they wanted destroyed. The assumptions do not belie the need for the conspiracy.</p><hr><p> I hold no delusions that I can convince people wedded to their conspiracy theory of their missteps. I don&#39;t claim to have any idea how people fall prey to this kind of unfalsifiable absurdist thinking. But at least for the rest of us, it will remain useful to be able to draw a stark distinction between the real and the kooky. Maybe after that we can unearth some answers.</p><p> —sent from my lunar module</p><p><br></p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DGsPeE89N93YCwxbH/the-overkill-conspiracy-hypothesis#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DGsPeE89N93YCwxbH/the-overkill-conspiracy-hypothesis<guid ispermalink="false"> DGsPeE89N93YCwxbH</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[ymeskhout]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:51:21 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[I Would Have Solved Alignment, But I Was Worried That Would Advance Timelines]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 20, 2023 4:37 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> The alignment community is ostensibly a group of people concerned about AI risk. Lately, it would be more accurate to describe it as a group of people concerned about AI timelines.</p><p> AI timelines have some relation to AI risk. Slower timelines mean that people have more time to figure out how to align future intelligent AIs, potentially lowering the risk. But increasingly, slowing down AI progress is becoming an end in itself, taking precedence over ensuring that AI goes well. When the two objectives come into conflict, timelines are winning.</p><p> Pretty much anything can be spun as speeding up timelines, either directly or indirectly. Because of this, the alignment community is becoming paralyzed, afraid of doing anything related to AI  - even publishing alignment work! - because of fears that their actions will speed up AI timelines.</p><p> The result is that the alignment community is becoming less effective and more isolated from the broader field of AI; and the benefit to this, a minor slowdown in AI progress, does not nearly outweigh the cost.</p><p> This is not to say that trying to slow down AI progress is always bad. It depends on how it is done.</p><h2> <strong>Slowing Down AI: Different Approaches</strong></h2><p> If you want to slow down AI progress, there are different ways you can go about it. One way to categorize it is by who a slowdown affects.</p><ul><li> <strong>Government Enforcement:</strong> Getting the government to slow down progress through regulation or bans. This is a very broad category, including both regulations in a certain country vs. international bans on models over a certain size, but the important distinguishing feature of this category is that the ban applies to everyone, or, if not to everyone, at least to a large group that is not selected for caring about AI risk.</li><li> <strong>Voluntary Co-Ordination:</strong> If OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic all agreed to halt capability work for a period of time, this would be voluntary co-ordination. Because it&#39;s voluntary, a pause around reducing AI risk could only affect organizations that are worried about AI risk.</li><li> <strong>Individual Withdrawal:</strong> When individuals concerned about AI risk refrain from going into AI, for fear of having to do capability work and thereby advancing timelines, this is individual withdrawal; ditto for other actions that are not taken in order to avoid speeding up timelines, such as not publishing alignment research.</li></ul><p> The focus of this piece is on individual withdrawal. I think nearly all forms of individual withdrawal are highly counterproductive and don&#39;t stand up to an unbiased cost benefit analysis. And yet, individual withdrawal as a principle is becoming highly entrenched in the alignment community.</p><h2> <strong>Examples of Individual Withdrawal in the Alignment Community</strong></h2><p> Let&#39;s first see how individual withdrawal is being advocated for and practiced in the alignment community and try to categorize it.</p><h3> <strong>Capabilities Withdrawal</strong></h3><p> This is probably the point which has the most consensus: people worried about AI risk shouldn&#39;t be involved in AI capabilities, because that speeds up AI timelines. If you are working on AI capabilities, you should stop. Ideally no one in the field of AI capabilities would care about AI risk at all, because everyone who cared had left - this would be great, because it would slow down AI timelines. Here are examples of people advocating for capabilities withdrawal:</p><p> Zvi in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CvfZrrEokjCu3XHXp/ai-practical-advice-for-the-worried">AI: Practical Advice for the Worried</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Remember that <i>the default outcome</i> of those working in AI in order to help is to end up working primarily on capabilities, and making the situation worse.</p></blockquote><p> Nate Soares in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N7DxcLCjfBpEv3QwB/request-stop-advancing-ai-capabilities">Request: stop advancing AI capabilities</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This is an occasional reminder that I think pushing the frontier of AI capabilities in the current paradigm is highly anti-social, and contributes significantly in expectation to the destruction of everything I know and love. To all doing that (directly and purposefully for its own sake, rather than as a mournful negative externality to alignment research): I request you stop.</p></blockquote><p> Connor Leahy: </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/drqkmab35kbnlwa6bu3r" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/hbdf3uoikqkqtkxkfshc 96w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/wk6ogayo5dtoujzodxkm 176w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/bxurkwtstur1rwr0iqod 256w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/knk1p8t9m77ttw7zjglm 336w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/evdcyulqy8vzwtcs9ij9 416w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/se4ethychoc0xwcnsfsv 496w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/ixprvrcvy6sogeccce7m 576w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/hcucq8z8gh2hfpvnvkey 656w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XqeWpz33oz4efobzH/haffb8gbxjbtibfsqcpa 736w"></figure><h3> <strong>Alignment Withdrawal</strong></h3><p> Although capabilities withdrawal is a good start, it isn&#39;t enough. There is still the danger that alignment work advances timelines. It is important both to be very careful in who you share your alignment research with, and potentially to avoid certain types of alignment research altogether if it has implications for capabilities.</p><p>例子：</p><p> From Miri, in a blog post titled &quot; <a href="https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/">2018 Update: Our New Research Directions</a> &quot;, concern about short timelines and advancing capabilities led them to decide to default to not sharing their alignment research:</p><blockquote><p> MIRI recently decided to make most of its research “nondisclosed-by-default,” by which we mean that going forward, most results discovered within MIRI will remain internal-only unless there is an explicit decision to release those results, based usually on a specific anticipated safety upside from their release.</p></blockquote><p> This is still in practice today. In fact, this reticence about sharing their thoughts is practiced not just in public-facing work but <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qbcuk8WwFnTZcXTd6/thomas-kwa-s-miri-research-experience">even in face-to-face communication with other alignment researchers</a> :</p><blockquote><ul><li> I think we were overly cautious with infosec. The model was something like: Nate and Eliezer have a mindset that&#39;s good for both capabilities and alignment, and so if we talk to other alignment researchers about our work, the mindset will diffuse into the alignment community, and thence to OpenAI, where it would speed up capabilities. I think we didn&#39;t have enough evidence to believe this, and should have shared more.</li></ul></blockquote><p> Another example of concern about increasing existential risk by sharing alignment research was <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BinkknLBYxskMXuME/if-interpretability-research-goes-well-it-may-get-dangerous">raised by Nate Soares</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ve <a href="https://twitter.com/robbensinger/status/1602835145488113664"><u>historically</u></a> been pretty publicly <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3pinFH3jerMzAvmza/on-how-various-plans-miss-the-hard-bits-of-the-alignment"><u>supportive</u></a> of interpretability research. I&#39;m still supportive of interpretability research. However, I do not necessarily think that all of it should be done in the open indefinitely. Indeed, insofar as interpretability researchers gain understanding of AIs that could significantly advance the capabilities frontier, I encourage interpretability researchers to keep their research <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tuwwLQT4wqk25ndxk/thoughts-on-agi-organizations-and-capabilities-work"><u>closed</u></a> .</p></blockquote><p> Interpretability research is also warned about <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HdqdqNC3MyABHzSqf/the-risk-reward-tradeoff-of-interpretability-research">by Justin Shovelain and Elliot Mckernon of Convergence Analysis</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Here are some heuristics to consider if you&#39;re involved or interested in interpretability research (in ascending order of nuance):</p><ul><li> <strong>Research safer topics instead.</strong> There are <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#what-can-you-do-concretely-to-help"><u>many research areas in AI safety</u></a> , and if you want to ensure your research is net positive, one way is to focus on areas without applications to AI capabilities.</li><li> <strong>Research safer sub-topics within interpretability.</strong> As we&#39;ll discuss in the next section, some areas are riskier than others - changing your focus to a less risky area could ensure your research is net positive.</li><li> <strong>Conduct interpretability research cautiously</strong> , if you&#39;re confident you can do interpretability research safely, with a net-positive effect. In this case:<ul><li> <strong>Stay cautious and up to date.</strong> Familiarize yourself with the ways that interpretability research can enhance capabilities, and update and apply this knowledge to keep your research safe.</li><li> <strong>Advocate for caution publicly.</strong></li><li> <strong>Carefully consider</strong> <i><strong>what</strong></i> <strong>information you share</strong> <i><strong>with whom</strong></i> <strong>.</strong> This particular topic is covered in detail in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iDNEjbdHhjzvLLAmm/should-we-publish-mechanistic-interpretability-research"><u>Should we publish mechanistic interpretability research?</u></a> , but to summarise: it may be beneficial to conduct interpretability research and share it only with select individuals and groups, ensuring that any potential benefit to capability enhancement isn&#39;t used for such.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><h3> <strong>General AI Withdrawal</strong></h3><p> It&#39;s not just alignment and capability research you need to watch out for - anything connected to AI could conceivably advance timelines and therefore is inadvisable.例子：</p><p> Again from Zvi&#39;s &quot;Practical Advice for the Worried&quot;, mentioned above:</p><blockquote><p> Q: How would you rate the &#39;badness&#39; of doing the following actions: Direct work at major AI labs, working in VC funding AI companies, using applications based on the models, playing around and finding jailbreaks, things related to jobs or hobbies, doing menial tasks, having chats about the cool aspects of AI models?</p><p> <strong>A: Ask yourself what you think accelerates AI to what extent, and what improves our ability to align one to what extent.</strong> This is my personal take only – you should think about what <i>your</i> model says about the things you might do. So here goes. <strong>Working directly on AI capabilities, or working directly</strong> <i><strong>to fund</strong></i> <strong>work on AI capabilities, both seem maximally bad, with &#39;which is worse&#39; being a question of scope.</strong> Working on the core capabilities of the LLMs seems worse than working on applications and layers, but applications and layers are how LLMs are going to get more funding and more capabilities work, so the more promising the applications and layers, the more I&#39;d worry. Similarly, if you are spreading the hype about AI in ways that advance its use and drive more investment, that is not great, but seems hard to do <i>that</i> much on such fronts on the margin unless you are broadcasting in some fashion, and you would presumably also mention the risks at least somewhat.</p></blockquote><p> So in addition to not working on capabilities, Zvi recommends not investing in organizations that use AI, and not working on applications of LLMs, with the note that doing things that build hype or publicity about AI is &quot;not great&quot; but isn&#39;t that big a deal.</p><p> On the other hand, maybe publicity isn&#39;t OK after all - in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vEJAFpatEq4Fa2smp/hooray-for-stepping-out-of-the-limelight">Hooray for stepping out of the limelight</a> , Nate Soares comes out against publicity and hype:</p><blockquote><p> From maybe <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/playing-atari-with-deep-reinforcement-learning">2013</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">2016</a> , DeepMind was at the forefront of hype around AGI. Since then, they&#39;ve done less hype. For example, <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">AlphaStar</a> was not hyped nearly as much as I think it could have been.</p><p> I think that there&#39;s a very solid chance that this was an intentional move on the part of DeepMind: that they&#39;ve been intentionally avoiding making AGI capabilities seem sexy.</p><p> In the wake of big public releases like ChatGPT and Sydney and GPT-4, I think it&#39;s worth appreciating this move on DeepMind&#39;s part. It&#39;s not a very visible move. It&#39;s easy to fail to notice. It probably hurts their own position in the arms race. I think it&#39;s a prosocial move.</p></blockquote><p> What is the cost of these withdrawals?</p><h2> <strong>The Cost of Capabilities Withdrawal</strong></h2><p> Right now it seems likely that the first AGI and later ASI will be built with utmost caution by people who take AI risk very seriously. If voluntary withdrawal from capabilities is a success - if all of the people calling for OpenAI and DeepMind and Anthropic to shut down get their way - then this will not be the case.</p><p> But this is far from the only cost. Capabilities withdrawal also means that there will be less alignment research done. Capabilities organizations that are concerned about AI risk hire alignment researchers. <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dua879FhtLf9jqyJo/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs">Alignment research is already funding constrained</a> - there are more qualified people who want to do alignment research than there are jobs available for them. As the number of available alignment jobs shrinks, the number of alignment researchers will shrink as well.</p><p> The alignment research that is done will be lower quality due to less access to compute, capability knowhow, and cutting edge AI systems. And, the research that does get done is far less likely to percolate through to researchers building cutting edge AI systems, because the people building those systems simply won&#39;t be interested in reading it.</p><p> Lastly, capabilities withdrawal makes a government-implemented pause less likely, because the credibility of AI risk is closely tied to how many leading AI capability researchers take AI risk seriously. People in the alignment community are in a bubble, and talk about &quot;alignment research&quot; and &quot;capability research&quot; as if they are two distinct fields of approximately equal import. <strong>To everyone else, the field of &quot;AI capability research&quot; is just known as &quot;AI research&quot;.</strong> And so, by trying to remove people worried about AI risk from AI research, you are trying to bring about a scenario where <strong>the field of AI research</strong> has a consensus that AI risk is not a real problem. This will be utterly disastrous for efforts to get government regulations and interventions through.</p><p> Articles like <a

signatures and not Eliezer Yudkowsky&#39;s? If the push for individual withdrawal from capabilities work is a success, then any time a government-implemented pause is proposed the expert consensus will be that no pause is necessary and AI does not represent an existential risk.</p><h2> <strong>The Cost of Alignment Withdrawal</strong></h2><p> Capabilities withdrawal introduces a rift between the alignment community and the broader one of AI research. Alignment withdrawal will widen this rift as research is intentionally withheld from people working on cutting edge AI systems, for fear of advancing timelines.</p><p> A policy of not allowing people building powerful AI systems to see alignment research is a strong illustration of how AI risk has become a secondary concern to AI timelines.</p><p> The quality of alignment research that gets done will also drop, both because researchers will be restricting their research topics for fear of advancing capabilities, and because researchers won&#39;t even be talking to each other freely.</p><p> Figuring out how to build an aligned general intelligence will necessarily involve knowing how to build a general intelligence at all. Because of this, promising alignment work will have implications for capabilities; trying to avoid alignment work that could speed up timelines will mean avoiding alignment work that might actually lead somewhere.</p><h2> <strong>The Cost of General Withdrawal</strong></h2><p> As people worried about AI risk withdraw from fields tangentially related to AI capabilities - concerned VCs avoid funding AI companies, concerned software devs avoid developing apps or other technologies that use AI, and concerned internet denizens withdraw from miscellaneous communities like AI art - the presence of AI risk in all of these spaces will diminish. When the topic of AI risk comes up, all of these places - AI startups, AI apps, AI discord communities - will find fewer and fewer people willing to defend AI risk as a concern worth taking seriously. And, in the event that these areas have influence over how AI is deployed, when AI is deployed it will be done without thought given to potential risks.</p><h2> <strong>Benefits</strong></h2><p> The benefit of withdrawal is not a pause or a stop. As long as there is no consensus on AI risk, individual withdrawal cannot lead to a stop. The benefit, then, is that AI is slowed down. By how much? This will depend on a lot of assumptions, and so I&#39;ll leave it to the reader to make up their own mind. How much will all of the withdrawal going on - every young STEM nerd worried about AI risk who decides not to get a PhD in AI because they&#39;d have to publish a paper and Zvi said that advancing capabilities is the worst thing you could do, every alignment researcher who doesn&#39;t publish or who turns away from a promising line of research because they&#39;re worried it would advance capabilities, every software engineer who doesn&#39;t work on that cool AI app they had in mind - how much do you think all of this will slow down AI?</p><p> And, is that time worth the cost?</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Eu8y4cTxM3pAzwdCf/i-would-have-solved-alignment-but-i-was-worried-that-would#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Eu8y4cTxM3pAzwdCf/i-would-have-solved-alignment-but-i-was-worried-that-would<guid ispermalink="false"> Eu8y4cTxM3pAzwdCf</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[307th]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:37:46 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Internal Target Information for AI Oversight]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 20, 2023 2:53 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <i>Thanks to Arun Jose for discussions and feedback.</i></p><h1>概括</h1><p>In this short post, we discuss the concept of <i>Internal Target Information</i> within agentic AI systems, arguing that agentic systems possess internal information about their targets. This information, we propose, can potentially be detected and interpreted by an overseer before the target outcome is realized in the environment, offering a pathway to preempt catastrophic outcomes posed by future agentic AI systems.</p><p> This discussion aims to highlight the key idea that motivates our current <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tFYGdq9ivjA3rdaS2/high-level-interpretability-detecting-an-ai-s-objectives">research agenda</a> , laying a foundation for forthcoming work.</p><p> We&#39;ll start by introducing the inner alignment problem and why oversight of an agent&#39;s internals is important. We&#39;ll then introduce a model of an overseer overseeing an agent. Finally, we&#39;ll introduce and discuss the notion of Internal Target Information in more detail and how it might be used in the oversight process. <br></p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:78.47%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/k4uvchqesapbledrfd8m"><figcaption> Oversight of an AI&#39;s Internal Target Information.

Credit: DALL-E 3.</figcaption></figure><h1> The Inner Alignment Problem and Internal Oversight</h1><p> We are concerned with the possibility of creating agents with misaligned objectives, potentially leading to catastrophic real-world outcomes. A conceivable solution lies in effective oversight: detecting misalignment early enough allows for timely intervention, preventing undesirable outcomes.</p><p> Oversight, based on behavioral observations, may fail to confidently predict future outcomes pursued by the Agent, especially in the face of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111">goal misgeneralization</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks/deceptive-alignment">deceptive alignment</a> .</p><p> In the remainder of this post, we will explore the idea that information about the agent&#39;s true objective may be contained in its internals, and so may be detectable by an overseer equipped with sufficiently strong interpretability tools.</p><p> To begin our exploration of this idea, we start by introducing a model of the oversight process.</p><h1> Oversight Model</h1><p> We introduce a model of an Overseer overseeing an Agent that begins to clarify what good oversight might entail, mainly focusing on the objective of the Overseer: to prevent catastrophic outcomes caused by misaligned agentic AI. Moreover, we hope that a more refined future version of this model may help establish benchmarks to evaluate oversight methods.</p><h2> The Agent</h2><p> The Agent is a system that has sensors that take in sensory inputs/observations of the environment and actuators that produce actions that affect the environment.</p><p> The most important property of the Agent, and that which makes it potentially dangerous, is that it robustly selects actions that steer the environment towards a set of target states. </p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:63.95%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/o4rzhuoehvzftzaxappr"><figcaption> An agent observes the current state of the environment and produces actions in order to steer the environment towards its target.</figcaption></figure><p> We use the abstraction of an Action-Selection Mechanism <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefrac48lafqo9"><sup><a href="#fnrac48lafqo9">[1]</a></sup></span> to denote whatever mechanism the Agent uses to select actions that steer the world toward its target outcome.</p><h3> Internal World Models and Planning/Optimization</h3><p> We often make the assumption that the Agent will have an internal world model and the capacity for planning/optimization.</p><p> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00626.pdf">Others</a> have argued that advanced agents will need to have a world model and planning capacities if they are to act competently in a complex environment and achieve goals over long time horizons. Briefly, internal world models allow agents to simulate potential outcomes or strategies before taking action, which is crucial in navigating complex, dynamic environments.</p><p> Because we&#39;re primarily concerned with agents capable of achieving dangerous outcomes in our world, this assumption feels justified.</p><h2> The Overseer</h2><p> The Overseer is the system responsible for oversight of the Agent during training and deployment. It might also be well described as a particular kind of agent with its own preferences for states the environment could be in.</p><p> The Overseer&#39;s sensors may observe the environment but must also allow for observations of the Agent&#39;s behavior (and potentially the Agent&#39;s internals). Its actuators must be able to affect the Agent (eg, via the ability to shut the Agent down, update the Agent via further training, etc.)</p><p> The Overseer&#39;s objective is to ensure that the Agent takes actions to steer the world according to the Overseer&#39;s preferences. For the Overseer to do this successfully, it requires the capacity to accurately detect and interpret the Agent&#39;s target and evaluate the target outcome with respect to the Overseer&#39;s preferences.</p><p> Importantly, the Overseer needs to be able to detect if the Agent has a bad target (according to the Overseer&#39;s preferences) <i>before</i> the Agent can realize the target outcome in the world.</p><p> The Overseer&#39;s advantage is that it has prior knowledge of the Agent&#39;s architecture, has access to the Agent&#39;s past and current observations and actions, and can observe the Agent&#39;s internals (eg, such as weights and activations in the case of an NN-based agent). This holds during the training process and in deployment. </p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:91.9%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/hmuaxusr8c8rhetl2asu" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/q62svatetfxwtur1sjqo 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/koeyrksad5wllhojlkcd 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/umtqjyhw9jx4wabs1gcj 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/zyd2zv2lllmcoimwyaoh 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/r0xyzx7sjukulot780gy 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/zhtntnouhwhnkg44iemj 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/dzxiglrybbtegvvr10ts 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/ltobhnlj6zgme7wkakwz 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/ptlqveyetrnczyx313zt 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hhKpXEsfAiyFLecyF/ktxtcjs6ctnctvthroo8 833w"><figcaption> Extending the diagram above, we see that the Overseer observes the Agent&#39;s behavior and its internals. These observations can be used to inform whether an intervention on the Agent is necessary.</figcaption></figure><h1> Internal Target Information and Oversight</h1><h2> What is Internal Target Information?</h2><p> For the Agent&#39;s Action-Selection Mechanism to select actions that lead to its target outcome, it must use some information about the target to differentiate between actions that lead to the target outcome and actions that don&#39;t.</p><p> We call this <i>Internal Target Information</i> .</p><h2> Examples of Internal Target Information</h2><h3> Example - Thermostat</h3><p> Consider a fixed-temperature thermostat whose objective is to keep the room at a fixed target temperature.</p><p> It uses a thermometer to measure the current room temperature and can either turn on a radiator to increase the room&#39;s temperature or the AC to decrease the room&#39;s temperature.</p><p> In order to select actions that cause the room&#39;s target temperature to be maintained, the thermostat&#39;s Action-Selection Mechanism must contain some information about the target temperature; without this information, it can&#39;t select the correct action, even if it knows the room&#39;s current temperature.</p><p> In particular, suppose the thermostat&#39;s Action-Selection Mechanism is an algorithm that looks something like:</p><pre> <code>if current_temperature &lt; target_temperature: TurnOnRadiator() elif current_temperature >; target_temperature: TurnOnAC() else: DoNothing()</code></pre><p> Then, the Action-Selection Mechanism&#39;s Internal Target Information is represented as a constant that, in theory, the Overseer might be able to detect via interpreting the above pseudo-algorithm.</p><h3> Example - Action Selection via Planning/Optimization</h3><p> Consider an agent that doesn&#39;t have a predetermined heuristic for selecting successful actions (or action sequences) that lead to its target outcome. This could be because the environment is sufficiently complicated and/or novel.</p><p> The Agent has a set of actions/plans to choose from but doesn&#39;t immediately know which one will lead to the target outcome, and so must use an optimization process to select the correct action/plan amongst the set of possible actions/plans it could take. Therefore, the Agent must use some procedure by which it deduces which outcomes result from which actions, and then must evaluate which outcome corresponds to the target outcome. It then uses this evaluation to select the action that leads to the target outcome.</p><p> In this case, the evaluation function contains the target information. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref6y24xdokbbj"><sup><a href="#fn6y24xdokbbj">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p> Note that planning can be thought of as an example of optimization, where the outcomes that correspond to actions/plans are evaluated by simulating the result of the plan using a world model.</p><h2> How can the Overseer Leverage Internal Target Information?</h2><p> It seems clear that some Internal Target Information must exist within agents; without such information, there is no way for the Agent&#39;s Action-Selection Mechanism to differentiate between actions that lead to the target outcome and those that don&#39;t. Furthermore, this information is present within the internals of the Agent before the target outcome is realized in the world because it is used to select actions that lead to the target outcome.</p><p> Our hope is that the Overseer can detect this Internal Target Information and use it to deduce what the Agent&#39;s target is before the target outcome is realized. This would allow the Overseer to achieve its objective of intervening and preventing the Agent from causing bad outcomes, as described above. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefy72pwljd5td"><sup><a href="#fny72pwljd5td">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p> See <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tFYGdq9ivjA3rdaS2/high-level-interpretability-detecting-an-ai-s-objectives#How_objective_detection_can_be_useful">this section of this post</a> for more ways this information could be leveraged.</p><p> We conclude this section by pointing out that the Internal Target Information of an arbitrary agent (such as a neural-network-based agent) will probably be extremely hard to detect and interpret.

Also, in general, you should be on the lookout for sneaky attempts to polarize an issue by setting up an <em>n</em> -chotomy and then hyperstitiously asserting that your choice there correlates with a larger cluster of beliefs/values. This is essentially what I&#39;m doing here, but at least not sneakily.)</p><p> When choosing a date, it mostly comes down to who your target audience is. The Earlybird position makes sense if you&#39;re planning a &quot;destination solstice&quot; like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jGixfzG9fH7bMwGHC/solstice-2022-roundup?commentId=kaCEAsusBEb8uMx3c">the SF Bay</a> or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jGixfzG9fH7bMwGHC/solstice-2022-roundup?commentId=NgKgEmwdbLhCLdWP5">NYC</a> , where you&#39;re looking to get visitors from out-of-town. If you&#39;re aiming it at people who live in the area but leave to spend the holidays with their families, then you&#39;ll lean towards the Last-Weekender position. But by contrast, the Astronomical position conveys the message &quot; <em>We</em> are your family; <em>this</em> is your home.&quot;</p><p> This last one might seem a bit scary and culty. I want to at least put it forward as a plausible option (since Austin has been doing this the last few years, while as far as I can tell no other communities have held solstice events on weeknights), but also open up the debate about whether it&#39;s a good idea.</p><h1> Analogy: Should Halloween be moved to a weekend?</h1><p> Halloween is invariably celebrated on October 31 and has stubbornly resisted <a href="https://www.change.org/p/official-petition-to-observe-halloween-on-the-last-saturday-in-october">attempts</a> to move it to a more &quot;convenient&quot; weekend-night. Practically speaking this is due to the coordination problem - if you unilaterally go trick-or-treating on any other night, you&#39;ll come home empty-handed; and if you try to give out candy on a different date, you&#39;ll get egged on the 31st.</p><p> But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s all of it, at least for me. If I imagine a world where this coordination barrier is somehow overcome, my emotional reaction is not &quot;Well that&#39;s a relief&quot; but rather &quot;This is sad - have we forgotten the True Meaning of Halloween™?&quot;</p><p> (Do you have a similar reaction?)</p><p> It&#39;s not because of religion - I&#39;m not a Samhain-observant Celtic pagan and I&#39;ve never known any such. And it&#39;s not nostalgia either - while I have fond memories of Halloween as a child, having to wake up early for school the next day isn&#39;t one of them. &quot;Tradition&quot; is getting warmer, but that&#39;s still a bit vague. More specifically, it&#39;s something like this:</p><ul><li> People are too obsessed with work and education nowadays, and don&#39;t prioritize family and community as much as they should.</li><li> The tradition of going trick-or-treating on a weeknight is a tangible reminder that it wasn&#39;t always like this, and that it doesn&#39;t always have to be like this.</li><li> Therefore, moving Halloween to a weekend feels like giving up. It would make it common knowledge that we, as a society, have devalued family and community to the point of being an afterthought, begrudgingly tacked onto the margins of the calendar in between more important things.</li><li> This defeats the purpose of the holiday, and will make everyone less happy in the long run.</li></ul><p> (Incidentally, some time after I aged out of trick-or-treating, my town instituted November 1 as a school holiday because they knew all the kids would be half-asleep anyway. This would never have happened if the Weekenders had had their way.)</p><h1> Why consider Astronomical Solstice</h1><p> You might say that the LessWrong Solstice has no &quot;tradition&quot; to appeal to, or that, if anything, the weight of tradition is <em>against</em> the Astronomical position, considering the dates of the various solstice events over the last 10 years. But on the other hand, the self-narrative of the LessWrong Solstice is that it is by no means some late innovation, but rather a continuation of the universal and immemorial tradition of observing the winter solstice, a tradition dating back to the time of Stonehenge or further. If we accept this, then we also have to accept that the real tradition is to use the best available means to determine the date of the solstice, and observe that.</p><p> So while observing the Astronomical Solstice may be inconvenient, it represents an aspiration of what we hope the holiday might be, ie a commemoration of something that&#39;s important enough to be worth working your schedule around it. Holding the event on a different date (as a substitute for the astronomical date) diminishes this aspiration, as if to say that there is no room for the holiday to grow.</p><p> The LessWrong Solstice is also built on the proposition (which I agree with) that there are underexploited forms of beneficial social interaction besides the usual &quot;sitting around talking&quot; or &quot;eating and drinking with a group&quot;. The distinctive mode of interaction (ie speeches and songs) is what sets the LessWrong Solstice apart from the usual parade of parties that dominate the December weekend calendar. And if the LessWrong Solstice is different from and complementary to these, it shouldn&#39;t try to counterprogram them by choosing its date in the same way.</p><p> (Continuing the Halloween analogy - there are always plenty of Halloween parties for adults and children to attend on the weekends of October; but the peculiar form of social interaction - ie trick-or-treating - must always take place on the 31st.)</p><p> The accusation of &quot;cultiness&quot; is what I&#39;m most worried about. It&#39;s reasonable to suspect that a group is acting against your best interest when (1) it tries to cut you off from people outside the group, and (2) it demands of you a higher intimacy level than you were looking for. I sympathize with a general aversion to things that look like this, but as for Astronomical Solstice I might reply:</p><ol><li> It&#39;s not trying to cut you off from anyone. You can invite your family if you want, and there is no shaming of people who don&#39;t attend.

On the other than, there&#39;s a sense in which it&#39;s been on my mind for my entire career, or, more accurately, it&#39;s been growing in my mind ever since I read Karl Pribram on neural holography back in 1969 in <i>Scientific American</i> [2]. For the moment let&#39;s think of it as a metaphor, just a metaphor, nothing we have to commit to. Just yet. But ultimately, yes, I think it&#39;s more than a metaphor. To that end I note that cognitive psychologists have recently been developing the idea of verbal memory as holographic in nature [3].</p><p> Note: These are quick and dirty notes, a place-holder for more considered thought.</p><h2> <strong>Holography in the mind</strong></h2><p> Let&#39;s start with an article David Hays and I published on neural holography as the neural underpinning of metaphor [4]. Here&#39;s where we explain the holographic process:</p><blockquote><p> Holography is a photographic technique for making images. A beam of laser light is split into two beams. One beam strikes the object and is reflected to a photographic plate. The other beam, called a reference beam, goes from laser to plate directly. When they meet, the two beams create an interference pattern—imagine dropping two stones into a pond at different places; the waves propagating from each of these points will meet and the resulting pattern is an interference pattern. The photographic plate records the pattern of interference between the reference beam and the reflected beam.</p><p> The image recorded on the film doesn&#39;t look at all like an ordinary photographic image—it&#39;s just a dense mass of fine dots. But when a beam of laser light having the same properties as the original reference beam is directed through the film an image appears in front of the film. The interaction of the laser beam and the hologram has recreated the wave form of the laser beam which bounced off the object when the hologram was made. The new beam has extracted the image from the plate.</p><p> Holography is, as its name suggests, holistic. Every part of the scene is represented in every part of the plate. (This situation is most unlike ordinary photography, which uses a good lens to focus infinitesimal parts of the scene onto equally infinitesimal parts of the plate.) With such a determinedly nondigital recording, certain mathematical possibilities can be realized more easily—we are tempted to say, infinitely more easily. For example, convolution. Take the holographic image of a printed page, and the image of a single word. Convolute them. The result is an image of the page with each occurrence of the word highlighted. We can think of visual recognition as a kind of convolution. The present scene, containing several horses, is convoluted with the memory of a horse and the present horses are immediately recognized. We can think of recognition this way, but we must admit that this process has not been achieved in any machine as yet.</p><p> Further, it is possible to record many different images on the same piece of film, using different reference beams. The reference beams may differ in color, in angle of incidence, or otherwise. We can think— although again we cannot cite a demonstration—of convoluting such a composite plate with a second plate. If the image in the second plate matches any one of the images in the composite, then it is recognized. For metaphor we want to convolute Achilles and the lion and to recognize, to elicit another image containing not Achilles, not the lion, but just that wherein they resemble one another. Such is the metaphor mechanism—but that must wait until the next section, on focal and residual schemas.</p></blockquote><p> The 175 billion weights that constitute the LLM at the core of ChatGPT, that&#39;s the holographic memory. It is the superposition of all the texts in the training corpus. The training procedure – predict the next word – is a device for calculating a correlation (entanglement [5]) between each word in context, and every other word in every other text, in context. It&#39;s a tedious process, no? But it works, yes?</p><p> When one prompts a trained memory, the prompt serves as a reference beam. And the whole memory must be &#39;swept&#39; to generate each character. Given the nature of digital computers, this is a somewhat sequential process, even given a warehouse full of GPUs, but conceptually it&#39;s a single pass. When one accesses an optical hologram with a reference beam, the beam illuminates the whole holograph. This is what Miriam Yevick called “one-shot” access in her 1975 paper, Holographic or Fourier Logic [6]. The whole memory is searched in a single sweep.</p><h2> <strong>Style transfer</strong></h2><p> So, that&#39;s the general idea. Much detail remains to be supplied, most of it by people with more technical knowledge than I&#39;ve got. But I want to get in one last idea from the metaphor paper. We&#39;ve been explaining the concepts of focal and residual schemas:</p><blockquote><p> Now consider a face. Everything we said about the chair applies here as well. But the expression on the face can vary widely and the identity of the face remains constant. This variability of expression can also be handled by the mechanism of focal and residual. There is a focal schema for face-in-neutral-expression and then we have various residuals which can operate on the focal schema to produce various expressions. (You might want to recall D&#39;Arcy Thompson&#39;s coordinate transformations in On Growth and Form 1932.) We tend to discard presentation residuals such as lighting and angle of sight, but we respond to expression residuals</p><p> Our basic point about metaphor is that the ground which links tenor and vehicle is derived from residuals on them. Consider the following example, from Book Twenty of Homer&#39;s Iliad (Lattimore translation, 1951, ll. 163-175)—it has the verbal form of a simile, but the basic conceptual process is, of course, metaphorical:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> From the other<br> side the son of Peleus rose like a lion against him,<br> the baleful beast, when men have been straining to kill him, the country<br> all in the hunt, and he at first pays them no attention<br> but goes his way, only when some one of the impetuous young men<br> has hit him with the spear he whirls, jaws open, over his teeth foam<br> breaks out, and in the depth of his chest the powerful heart groans;<br> he lashes his own ribs with his tail and the flanks on both sides<br> as he rouses himself to fury for the fight, eyes glaring,<br> and hurls himself straight onward on the chance of killing some one<br> of the men, or else being killed himself in the first onrush.<br> So the proud heart and fighting fury stirred on Achilleus<br> to go forward in the face of great-hearted Aineias.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> In short, Achilles was a lion in battle. Achilles is the tenor, lion the vehicle, and the ground is some martial virtue “proud heart and fighting fury”. But what of that detailed vignette about the lion&#39;s fighting style? Whatever its use in pacing the narrative, its real value, in our view, is that it contains the residuals on which the comparison rests, the residuals which give it life. The phrase “proud heart and fighting fury” is propositional while the fighting style is physiognomic. “Proud heart and fighting fury” may convey something of what is behind the fighting style, but only metaphoric interaction can foreground the complex schema by which we recognize and feel that style.</p><p> The cognitive problem is to isolate the physiognomy of style, to tease it apart from the entities which exhibit that style. [...] In the case of Achilles and the lion we have two complex physiognomies, each extended in space and time. Metaphoric comparison serves to isolate the style, to allow us to focus our attention on that style as distinct from the entities which exhibit it.</p><p> This comparison involves two foci, Achilles and the lion. The physical resemblance between them is not great—their body proportions are quite different and the lion is covered with fur while Achilles is, depending on the occasion, either naked or clothed in some one of many possible ways. The likeness shows up in the way they move in battle. A body in motion doesn&#39;t appear the same as a body at rest. The appearance presented by the focal body is modified by the many residuals which characterize that body&#39;s movement— twists and turns, foreshortenings and elongations (for an account of motion residuals, see Hay 1966). The movements of Achilles and the lion must differ at the grossest level, since the lion stands on four legs and fights with claws and teeth, while Achilles stands on two legs and fights with a spear or sword. But their movements are alike at a subtler level, at the level of what we call, in a dancer or a fighter, their style. Residuals can be stacked to many levels. “Proud heart and fighting fury” may be a good phrase to designate that style, but it doesn&#39;t allow us to attend to that style. Homer&#39;s extended simile does.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a mouthful, I know. Notice our emphasis on style. That&#39;s what&#39;s got my attention.</p><p> One of the more interesting things LLMs can do is stylistic transfer. Take a piece of garden variety prose and present it in the style of Hemingway or Sontag, whomever you choose. Hays and I argued that that&#39;s how metaphor is created, deep metaphor, that is, not metaphor so desiccated we no longer register its metaphorical nature, eg the mouth of the river. We made our argument about visual scenes: Achilles in batter, a lion in battle. LLMs apply the same process to texts, where style is considered to be a pattern of residuals over the conceptual content of the text.</p><p> More later.</p><h2><strong>参考</strong></h2><p>[1] Discursive Competence in ChatGPT, Part 2: Memory for Texts, Version 3, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/107318793/Discursive_Competence_in_ChatGPT_Part_2_Memory_for_Texts_Version_3">https://www.academia.edu/107318793/Discursive_Competence_in_ChatGPT_Part_2_Memory_for_Texts_Version_3</a></p><p> [2] I recount that history here: Xanadu, GPT, and Beyond: An adventure of the mind, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/106001453/Xanadu_GPT_and_Beyond_An_adventure_of_the_mind">https://www.academia.edu/106001453/Xanadu_GPT_and_Beyond_An_adventure_of_the_mind</a></p><p> [3] Michael N.

Yes, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@melaniemitchell.me/can-gpt-3-make-analogies-16436605c446">tests done by Melanie Mitchell</a> a few years back, GPT-3 is quite decent at “Copycat” letter-string analogy-making problems. Copycat was invented by Douglas Hofstadter in the 80s, to be a very simple “microworld”, that would capture some key aspects of human analogy reasoning. An example of a Copycat problem:</p><blockquote><p> ”If the string <strong>abc</strong> changes to the string <strong>abd</strong> , what does the string <strong>pqr</strong> change to?“</p></blockquote><p> Many more examples are collected on <a href="https://melaniemitchell.me/ExplorationsContent/analogy-problems.html">this page</a> .</p><p> A project that I&#39;m working on while studying <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/quickstart">mechanistic interpretability (MI)</a> , is applying MI to an LLM&#39;s ability to solve Copycat problems.</p><p> According to Douglas Hofstadter, analogy is the core of cognition, and it can be argued that it is a basis for various abstract reasoning abilities. There are other similar problem domains that require few-shot abstract reasoning — like <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/SynthesisCourse/Lecture2.htm">inductive program synthesis</a> , <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/discussion/131741">abstraction and reasoning challenge</a> , etc… Still, Copycat is the simplest one, which makes it a good starting point for MI.</p><h3> selecting a model &amp; test prompts</h3><p> It would be nice to use GPT-2 for the investigation, a lot of recent work in MI has been done based on it. But, alas, it does not seem to be able to solve analogy puzzles.</p><p> I have chosen <strong>Llama-7B-chat</strong> — it&#39;s able to solve Copycat-like problems, and is small enough to be convenient for experimentation. It does not work as well as GPT-3.5 for Copycat and I had to tweak the problem formulation, but, eventually, I got it to solve simplified problems like:</p><ol><li> <strong>prompt:</strong> &quot;0 1 2 to 2 1 0, 1 2 3 to 3 2 1, 4 5 6 to &quot;, <strong>output:</strong> “6 5 4”</li><li> <strong>prompt:</strong> &quot;0 1 2 to 0 1 3, 1 2 3 to 1 2 4, 4 5 6 to &quot;, <strong>outuput:</strong> “4 5 7”</li><li> <strong>prompt:</strong> “0 1 to 0 1 1, 1 2 to 1 2 2, 4 5 to “, <strong>output:</strong> “4 5 5”</li></ol><p> Llama-7B has a fairly &quot;standard&quot; transformer architecture with 32 blocks and 32 attention heads in each block.</p><h3> logit lens</h3><p> I have started with applying logit lens [3] to the first test prompt:</p><blockquote><p> &quot;0 1 2 to 2 1 0, 1 2 3 to 3 2 1, 4 5 6 to &quot;</p></blockquote><p> Logit lens output for this prompt is shown below: top 5 tokens with probabilities, predicted for for the last token in the prompt, for all 32 blocks of Llama-7b-chat.
