target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hai.stanford.edu/policy-brief-foundation-models-and-copyright-questions">斯坦福大学关于人工智能和版权的政策简介</a>。他们本质上是说，将现有版权法应用于人工智能是一团糟，尚不清楚什么构成合理使用，最好对其进行澄清并使其变得合理。人们也可能认为这是不澄清问题的一个原因。</p><p>关于版权，正确的做法是什么？ <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/robertwiblin/status/1720391158541455454">永远记住，征用的危险在于未来征用的可能性和预期。</a></p><blockquote><p>罗伯特·威布林（Robert Wiblin）：允许技术变革使版权大幅贬值有点像追溯性加税，因为“他们已经建立了 X，所以为什么不现在就接受它”。当政策在本质上未能尊重过去的承诺时，人们会注意到并改变未来的行为。</p><p>是的，你可以将已建成工厂的税收提高到 80%。但对政府拒绝征用人民的信任很容易丧失，而且很难重建。如果你这样做，人们将在很长一段时间内更不愿意建造工厂（或生产训练人工智能的内容）。</p></blockquote><p>人们还必须注意到这一概括性。如果我看到版权所有者被征用，并且我拥有不同类型的权利，我不会将其视为无关紧要。信任很容易失去，而失去信任会产生广泛的影响。</p><p>在这种背景下，人们应该如何看待版权？我认为保护版权所有者非常重要，因为他们在创作作品时有合理的保护期望。这就是我想说的。而且你还想提供对未来的期望，让人们渴望创造，这也是重点。</p><p>这是否意味着不允许法学硕士在没有补偿的情况下接受受版权保护的作品的培训？我认为确实如此。然而，除非你的目标是（相当合理地）尽可能地减慢人工智能的速度，否则需要有合理的限制。因此，第一个最佳解决方案是建立补偿制度，向权利持有人支付标准金额，并根据推理进行调整。除此之外，还有其他合理的事情。如果法官不小心接受了受版权保护的作品的训练，你实际上并不希望法官下令删除模型，除非你断然希望模型总体上被销毁。凡事讲究比例。</p><p>然而，我们也应该永远记住，这张图表完全是胡说八道：</p><figure

insufficient.</p><p> So yes, current techniques can work at current levels, for concepts where the question is not complicated. Where we are not cutting reality into sufficiently natural categories the aversion runs deep, and this trick did not work so well. Where we are ultimately &#39;talking price&#39; and things are indeed complicated on some margin, the right persona can break through.</p><p> One can also note that the examples in the paper are often weak sauce. You could get actors to put on most of these personas and say most of these things, and in the proper context put that in a movie and no one would be too upset or consider it an unrealistic portrayal. Very few provide actionable new information to bad actors.</p><p> The thing is, that ultimately does not matter. What matters is that the model creators do not want the model to do or say any X, and here is an automated universal method to get many values of X anyway.</p><p> At a dinner this week, it came up that a good test might be to intentionally include a harmless prohibition. Take something that everyone agrees is totally fine, and tell everyone that LLMs are never, ever allowed to do it. For example, on Star Trek: The Next Generation, for a long time Data does not use contractions. If you could get him to instead say he doesn&#39;t use contractions, or see him using one on his own, even once, you would know something was afoot. In this metaphor, you would shut him down automatically on the spot to at least run a Level 5 diagnostic, and perhaps even delete and start again, because you do not want another Lore to weaponize the Borg again or what not.</p><h4> They Took Our Jobs</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sagaftra/status/1722441050651078912">Our jobs are back, the SAG-AFTRA strike is over</a> .

Our Pension &amp; Health caps have been substantially raised, which will bring much needed value to our plans. In addition, the deal includes numerous improvements for multiple categories including outsize compensation increases for background performers, and critical contract provisions protecting diverse communities.</p></blockquote><p> So far we only have preliminary claims.

When an author writes a book, they keep the IP and the upside and largely keep creative control, whereas in movies the need to get studio financing means the creatives mostly give up that upside to the studio, and also give up creative control. AI seems, Roope suggests, likely to make the costs of good enough production lower far faster than it can actually replace the creatives. Or, he suggests, you can create an AI movie as a proof of concept that is not good enough to release, but is good enough that it de-risks the project, so the screenwriter can extract a far superior deal and keep creative control. So the creatives will make much cheaper movies themselves, keeping creative control and taking big swings and risks, audiences will affirm, and the creatives keep the upside. Everyone wins, except the studios, so everyone wins.</p><p> This seems like a highly plausible &#39;transition world.&#39; I do expect that he is right that we will have a period where AI can bring a screenplay or concept to life in the hands of a skilled creative on the cheap and quick, while the AI can generate only generic movie shlock without strong creative help. There is then a question of what is the scarce valuable input during this period.</p><p> The problem is that this period only lasts so long. It would be very surprising if it lasted decades. Then the AI can do better than the creatives as well. Then what?</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/neilturkewitz/status/1722269406645076091">Did you know</a> that if you have to pay for the inputs to your product, your product would be more expensive to create and your investment in it not as good?</p><blockquote><p> Neil Turkewitz: “Andreessen Horowitz is warning that billions of dollars in AI investments could be worth a lot less if companies developing the technology are forced to pay for the copyrighted data that makes it work.”</p><p> This is NOT from the @TheOnion.</p><p> “The VC firm said AI investments are so huge that any new rules around the content used to train models &#39;will significantly DISRUPT&#39; the investment community&#39;s plans and expectations around the technology.” This from the folks that only ever use “disruption” as a good thing.</p></blockquote><p> The direct quotes are not better. I understand why they want it to be one way. Why they think creators should get nothing, you lose, good day sir. It is also telling that they believe that any attempt to require fair compensation would break their business models, the same way they believe any requirements for safety precautions (or perhaps even reports of activity) would also break their business models and threaten to doom us all.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1722271357722116201">Or perhaps this is how they don&#39;t take our jobs.</a></p><blockquote><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: AI doctors will revolutionize medicine!

The Grok-1 language model does not have the capability to search the web independently. Search tools and databases enhance the capabilities and factualness of the model when deployed in Grok. The model can still hallucinate, despite the access to external information sources.</p><p> Training data</p><p> The training data used for the release version of Grok-1 comes from both the Internet up to Q3 2023 and the data provided by our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/xai/jobs/4101903007">AI Tutors</a> .</p><p> Evaluation</p><p> Grok-1 was evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmark tasks and on curated foreign mathematic examination questions.

I continue to not understand how formal verification would work for an LLM even in theory. Also they are working on long-context understanding and retrieval, adversarial robustness and multimodal capabilities.</p><p> What is the responsible scaling policy? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/DanHendrycks/status/1721031156899189020">To work on that.</a></p><blockquote><p> Dan Hendrycks quoting the announcement: “we will work towards developing reliable safeguards against catastrophic forms of malicious use.”</p></blockquote><h4> In Other AI News</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1722497764263702732">Amazon reported to be developing a new ChatGPT competitor</a> , codenamed Olympus.

Shareholder votes often do have large supermajorities, it is often not so difficult to get those opposed not to participate, and pull various other tricks.

In this work, we study how effectively transformers can bridge between their pretraining data mixture, comprised of multiple distinct task families, to identify and learn new tasks in-context which are both inside and outside the pretraining distribution.</p><p> Building on previous work, we investigate this question in a controlled setting, where we study transformer models trained on sequences of (x,f(x)) pairs rather than natural language. Our empirical results show transformers demonstrate near-optimal unsupervised model selection capabilities, in their ability to first in-context identify different task families and in-context learn within them when the task families are well-represented in their pretraining data.</p><p> However when presented with tasks or functions which are out-of-domain of their pretraining data, we demonstrate various failure modes of transformers and degradation of their generalization for even simple extrapolation tasks. Together our results highlight that the impressive ICL abilities of high-capacity sequence models may be more closely tied to the coverage of their pretraining data mixtures than inductive biases that create fundamental generalization capabilities.</p><p> Anton (@abacaj): New paper by Google provides evidence that transformers (GPT, etc) cannot generalize beyond their training data</p><p>这是什么意思？ Well the way I see it is that this is a good thing for safety, meaning a model not trained to do X cannot do X… It also means you should use models for what they were trained to do.</p><p> Amjad Masad (CEO Replit): I came to this conclusion sometime last year, and it was a little sad because I wanted so hard to believe in LLM mysticism and that there was something “there there.”</p></blockquote><p> That does not sound surprising or important? If you train on simple functions inside a distribution, you would expect to nail it within the distribution but there is no reason to presume you would get the extension of that principle that you might want. Who is to say that the model even got it wrong? Yes, there&#39;s an &#39;obviously right&#39; way to do that, but if you wanted to train it to do obviously right extrapolations you should have trained it on that more generally? Which is the kind of thing LLMs do indeed train on, in a way.</p><p> I do not see this as good for safety. I see it as saying that if you take the model out of distribution, you have no assurance that you will get even an obvious extrapolation. Which is bad for capabilities to be sure, but seems really terrible for alignment and safety to the extent it matters?</p><p> Or as Jim Fan puts it:</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1721319837186839034">Jim Fan:</a> Ummm … why is this a surprise? Transformers are not elixirs. Machine learning 101: gotta cover the test distribution in training! LLMs work so well because they are trained on (almost) all text distribution of tasks that we care about. That&#39;s why data quality is number 1 priority: garbage in, garbage out. Most of LLM efforts these days go into data cleaning &amp; annotation.</p><p> This paper is equivalent to: Try to train ViTs only on datasets of dogs &amp; cats.</p><p> Use 100B dog/cat images and 1T parameters! Now see if it can recognize airplanes – surprise, it can&#39;t!</p></blockquote><p> What does this imply for LLMs?

If “emergence” merely unlocks capabilities represented in pre-training data, the gravy train will run out soon.</p><p> Part of the confusion is that in a space as rich as natural language, in-distribution, out-of-distribution, &amp; generalization aren&#39;t well-defined terms. If we treat each query string as defining a separate task, then of course LLMs can generalize. But that&#39;s not a useful definition.</p><p> Better understanding the relationship between what&#39;s in the training data and what LLMs are capable of is an interesting and important research direction (that many are working on).</p><p> I suspect what happened here is that many people have been gradually revising their expectations downward based on a recognition of the limits of GPT-4 over the last 8 months, but this paper provided the impetus to publicly talk about it.</p><p> Re. the “bbb-but this paper doesn&#39;t show…” replies: I literally started by saying this paper isn&#39;t about LLMs. My point is exactly that despite being not that relevant to LLM limits the paper seems to have gotten people talking about it, perhaps because they&#39;d already updated.</p></blockquote><p> As Arvind suggests, this very much seems like a case of &#39;the paper states an obvious result, which then enables us to discuss the issue better even though none of us were surprised.&#39;</p><p> It does seem like GPT-4 turned out to be less capable than our initial estimates, and to generalize less in important ways, but not that big an adjustment.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theaidigest.org/progress-and-dangers">Thing explainer illustrates improvement in LLMs over time</a> .

In this work, we posit that this tension reflects a divergence in the configuration of intelligence in today&#39;s generative models relative to intelligence in humans. Specifically, we propose and test the Generative AI Paradox hypothesis: generative models, having been trained directly to reproduce expert-like outputs, acquire generative capabilities that are not contingent upon — and can therefore exceed — their ability to understand those same types of outputs. This contrasts with humans, for whom basic understanding almost always precedes the ability to generate expert-level outputs.</p><p> ……</p><p> Our results show that although models can outperform humans in generation, they consistently fall short of human capabilities in measures of understanding, as well as weaker correlation between generation and understanding performance, and more brittleness to adversarial inputs. Our findings support the hypothesis that models&#39; generative capability may not be contingent upon understanding capability, and call for caution in interpreting artificial intelligence by analogy to human intelligence.</p></blockquote><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffab79d42-cd7a-4f1c-9eb8-a1ccc03dab2a_1305x641.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/44Cv4HFoWEZvFnL5u/hs9hly8ep93hqtfkuwww" alt="图像"></a></figure><p> I think this is more common in humans than the abstract realizes. There are many things we have learned to do, where if you asked us to consciously explain how we do them, we would not be able to do so. This includes even simple things like catching a ball, or proper grammar for a sentence, and also many more complex things. You often do it without consciously understanding how you are doing it. A lot of why I write is because making such understanding conscious and explicit is highly useful to not only others but to yourself.</p><p> The AI does seem to be relatively better at generation than understanding, versus human capability levels. The cautionary note is warranted. But the fact that an AI does not reliably understand in reverse its own generations is not so unusual. Quite often I look at something I created in the past, and until I remember the context do not fully understand it.</p><p> Also note what this is highly relevant to: Verification is not easier than generation, in general. These are examples where you would think verification was easier, yet the AI is worse at verification than the related generation.</p><h4> Bigger Tech Bigger Problems</h4><p> Reading <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/11/02/bruce-reed-ai-biden-tech-00124375">Politico&#39;s profile of Biden&#39;s &#39;AI whisperer&#39; Bruce Reed</a> , one can&#39;t help but wonder what is or isn&#39;t a narrative violation.</p><p> Put in charge of Biden&#39;s AI policy, Reed is portrayed as deeply worried about the impact of AI in general and especially its potential confusions over what is real, and about the threat of &#39;Big Tech&#39; in particular.</p><blockquote><p> Nancy Scola: Bruce Reed, White House deputy chief of staff and longtime Democratic Party policy whiz, was sitting in his West Wing office and starting to think maybe people weren&#39;t freaking out enough.</p><p> ……</p><p> The meeting [with Tristan Harris], Reed says, hardened his belief that generative AI is poised to shake the very foundations of American life.</p><p> Bruce Reed: What we&#39;re going to have to prepare for, and guard against is the potential impact of AI on our ability to tell what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not.</p><p> Nancy Scola: The White House&#39;s AI strategy also reflects a big mindset shift in the Democratic Party, which had for years celebrated the American tech industry. Underlying it is Biden&#39;s and Reed&#39;s belief that Big Tech has become arrogant about its alleged positive impact on the world and insulated by a compliant Washington from the consequences of the resulting damage. While both say they&#39;re optimistic about the potential of AI development, they&#39;re also launching a big effort to bring those tech leaders to heel.</p><p> ……</p><p> Now, at 63, Reed finds himself on the same side as many of his longtime skeptics as he has become a tough-on-tech crusader, in favor of a massive assertion of government power against business.</p></blockquote><p> Reed has previously favored proposed regulatory changes that would have been deeply serious errors, and also clearly have been deeply hostile to big tech, also small tech, also all the humans. It is easy to see why one might be concerned.</p><blockquote><p> For fans of the tech industry, the rhetoric was more than bold — it was alarming. “Biden&#39;s Top Tech Advisor Trots Out Dangerous Ideas For &#39;Reforming&#39; Section 230,” was the headline of one post on the influential pro-innovation blog TechDirt, by its editor, Mike Masnick, a regular commentator on legal questions facing the tech industry. “That this is coming from Biden&#39;s top tech advisor is downright scary. It is as destructive as it is ignorant.”</p><p> ……</p><p> “Bruce, from the beginning, was serious about trying to do everything we could to restrain the excessive power of Big Tech,” [antitrust policy expert Tim] Wu says.</p></blockquote><p> There are three in some ways similar and partly overlapping but fundamentally distinct narratives about why we should be very concerned about the executive order in particular, and any government action to regulate or do anything about AI or tech in general.</p><p> Story 1: Regulation will strange the industry the way we have strangled everything else, we will lose our progress and our freedoms and our global leadership etc.</p><p> Story 2: Regulation is premature because we do not yet know what the technology will be like. We will screw it up if we act too soon, lock in bad decisions, stifle innovation, incumbents will end up benefiting. We need to wait longer. Some versions of this include calls to not even consider our options yet for fear we might then use them.</p><p> Story 3: Regulation and also any warnings that AI might ever do more than ordinary mundane harm is a ploy by incumbents to engage in regulatory capture, perhaps combined with a genius marketing strategy. Saying your product might kill everyone is great for business. This is all a business plan of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and perhaps Anthropic.</p><p> Then all three such stories decry any move towards the ability to do anything as the same as locking in years or decades of then-inevitable regulatory ramp-up and capture, so instead we should do nothing.</p><p> One can easily square Reed&#39;s centrality and profile with story one, or with story two. Those two stories make sense to me. They are good faith, highly reasonable things to be worried about, downsides to weigh against other considerations. If I did not share those concerns, I would advocate going much faster. As I often say, what drives me mad is not seeing that same righteous energy everywhere else.</p><p> If regulations and government actions intended to crack down on big corporations ultimately ended up stifling innovation and progress, while also helping those big corporations, that would not be a shock. It happens a lot. If I thought that stifling AI innovation was an almost entirely bad thing similarly to how it is in most other contexts, I would have a different attitude.</p><p> Whereas it is rather difficult to square Reed&#39;s centrality, along with many of the other facts about AI, with story three. Story three has never made much sense. My direct experience strongly contradicts it. That does not mean that Google and Microsoft are not trying to tilt the rules in their favor. Of course they are. That is what companies will always do, and we must defend against this and be wary.</p><p> But the idea that these efforts, seen by their architects as moves to reign in Big Tech, are about crushing the little guy and maximizing Big Tech profits and power? That they are centrally aimed at regulatory capture, and everyone involved is either bought and paid for or fully hoodwinked, and also everyone who is warning about risks especially existential risks is deluded or lying or both? Yeah, no.</p><p> The profile then touches briefly on the question of what risks to worry about.</p><blockquote><p> In the world of AI, there is a debate what the biggest challenge is. Some think policymakers should try to solve already-known problems like algorithmic bias in job-applicant vetting. Others think policymakers should spend their time trying to prevent seemingly sci-fi existential crises that ever-evolving generative AI might trigger next.</p></blockquote><p> It is weird facing terminology like &#39;seemingly sci-fi&#39; that is viewed as pejorative, yet in a sane world would not be in the context of rapid technological advancement. And of course, we see once again those worried about things like algorithmic bias fighting &#39;to keep the focus on&#39; their cause and treat this as a conflict, while those with existential concerns dutifully continue to say &#39;why not both&#39; and point out that our concerns and the interventions they require will rapidly impact your concerns.</p><p> Reed has the right attitude here.</p><blockquote><p> Reed doesn&#39;t think the White House has to choose between the already-existing AI harms of today and the potential AI harms of tomorrow. “My job is to lose sleep over both,” he says. “I think the president shares the view that both sides of the argument are right.”</p><p> And, he argues, the tech industry has to be made to address those worries. “The main thing we&#39;re saying is that every company needs to take responsibility for whether the products it brings on to the market are safe,” says Reed, “and that&#39;s not too much to ask.”</p></blockquote><h4> Executive Order Open Letter</h4><p> Various accelerationists and advocates of open source, including Marc Andreessen and others at a16z, Yann LeCun and Tyler Cowen, submit an open letter on the EO.</p><p> This letter is a vast improvement on most open source advocacy communications and reactions, and especially a vast improvement over the many unhinged initial reactions to the EO and to the previous writings of Andreessen and LeCun. We have a long way to go, but one must acknowledge a step forward towards real engagement.</p><p> They raise two issues, the first definitional.</p><p> As I noted in my close reading and the thread here (but not the letter) points out, the definition of AI in the Executive Order is poorly chosen, resulting in it being both overly broad and also opening up loopholes. It needs to be fixed. I would be excited to see alternative definitions proposed.</p><p> The focus here on another key definition, that of a &#39;dual-use foundation model.&#39;</p><p> They say:</p><blockquote><p> While the definition appears to target larger AI models, the definition is so broad that it would capture a significant portion of the AI industry, including the open source community. The consequence would be to sweep small companies developing models into complex and technical reporting requirements…</p></blockquote><p> While the current reporting requirements seem easy to fulfill, it is reasonable to expect something more robust in the future, including requiring some actual safety precautions, so let&#39;s look back at this definition that they say is overly broad.</p><blockquote><p> (k)  The term “dual-use foundation model” means an AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of billions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts; and that exhibits, or could be easily modified to exhibit, high levels of performance at tasks that pose a serious risk to security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters, such as by:</p><p> (i)    substantially lowering the barrier of entry for non-experts to design, synthesize, acquire, or use chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons;</p><p> (ii)   enabling powerful offensive cyber operations through automated vulnerability discovery and exploitation against a wide range of potential targets of cyber attacks;或者</p><p>(iii)  permitting the evasion of human control or oversight through means of deception or obfuscation.</p></blockquote><p> So what the letter is saying is that they want small companies to be able to train models that fit this definition, without having to report what safety precautions they are taking, and without being required to take safety precautions. Which part of this is too broad?</p><p> Do they think (i) is too broad? That they should be free to substantially lower the barrier to CBRN weapons?</p><p> Do they think that (ii) is too broad? That they should be free to enable powerful offensive cyber operations?</p><p> Or do they think that (iii) is too broad? That systems permitting the evasion of human control or oversight via obfuscation should be permitted?</p><p> Which of these already encompasses much of the AI industry?</p><p> The letter does not say. Nor do they propose an alternative definition or regime.</p><p> Instead, it asserts that small company models will indeed quality under these definitions and do some of these things, but they think at least some of these things are fine to do, presumably without safeguards.</p><p> One could observe that this definition is too broad, in the eyes of those like Marc Andreessen, because it includes any models at all, and they do not want any restrictions placed on anyone.</p><p> Their second compliant is that potentially undue restrictions will be imposed on open source AI. They say that policy has long actively supported open source, and this deviates from that. They claim that it will harm rather than help cybersecurity if we do not allow the development of dual-use open source models, trotting out the general lines about how open source and openness are always good for everything and are why we have nice things. They do not notice or answer the reasons why open source AI models might be a different circumstance to other open source, nor do they address the concerns of others beyond handwave dismissals.</p><p> As many others have, they assert that any regulations requiring that models be shown to be safe ensures domination by a handful of big tech companies. Which is another way of saying that there is no economically reasonable way for others to prove AI models safe.</p><p> To which I say, huge if true. If any regime requiring advanced models be proven safe means only big tech companies can build them, then we have three choices.</p><ol><li> Big Tech companies build the models in a safe fashion, if even they can do so.</li><li> Everyone builds the models, some not in a safe fashion.</li><li> No one builds the models at all, until we can do so in safe fashion.</li></ol><p> They seem to be advocating for option #2 because they hate #1, and while they do not say so here I believe they mostly would hate #3 even more. Whereas I would say, if models pose catastrophic threat, or especially existential threat, and only big companies using closed source could possibly do so in a way we can know is safe, that our choice is between #1 and #3, and that this is the debate one should then have, and #3 makes some very excellent points.</p><p> That is the central dilemma of those who would champion open source, and demand it get special treatment. They want a free pass to not worry about the consequences of their actions. Because they believe as a matter of principle that open source always has good consequences, and that AI does not change this, without any need to address why AI is different.</p><p> They want a regime where anyone can deploy open source models, of any capabilities, without any responsibility of any kind to show their models are safe, or any way to actually render their models safe that cannot easily be undone, or any way to undo model release if problems arise. Ideally, they would like an active thumb on the scale in their favor in their fight against closed source and big tech.</p><p> To achieve this, they deny any downsides of open source of any kind, and also deny that there are meaningful catastrophic or existential dangers from building new entities smarter and more capable than ourselves, instead framing any controls on open source as themselves the existential threat to our civilization. I never see such people speak of any even potential downsides to open source except to dismiss them. To them, open source (and AI) will do everything good that we want, and could never result in anything bad that we do not want. To them open source AI will encourage open and free competition, without endangering national security or our lead in AI. It will give power to the people, without giving the wrong power to the wrong people in any way we need to be concerned about. This will happen automatically, without any need for oversight of any kind. It is all fine.</p><p> While this letter is a large step up from previous communications including many by cosigners of the letter, it continues <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thedecisionlab.com/podcasts/soldiers-and-scouts-with-julia-galef">to treat all arguments as soldiers</a> and refuses to engage with any meaningful points or admit to any downsides or dangers.</p><p> I see much value in open source in the past and much potential for it to do good in the future, if we can keep it away from sufficiently advanced foundation models. This letter is a step forward towards having a productive discussion of that. To get to that point, we must face the reality of AI and the existence of trade-offs and massive potential externalities and catastrophic and existential dangers in that context. That this time will indeed be different.</p><h4> Executive Order Reactions Continued</h4><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1720165289864712541">Sam Altman (CEO OpenAI)</a> : there are some great parts about the AI EO, but as the govt implements it, it will be important not to slow down innovation by smaller companies/research teams.</p><p> I am pro-regulation on frontier systems, which is what openai has been calling for, and against regulatory capture.</p></blockquote><p> A lot of responses assume Altman is the one who got the limit in place as part of a conspiracy for regulatory capture. I am rather confident he didn&#39;t.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/biden-admins-ai-safety-institute-not-sufficient-deal-risks-check-user-procedures-expert">Fox News responds to the Executive Order</a> , saying it is necessary but perhaps is not sufficient. Seems wise, this is merely a first step, limited by what is legally allowed. That is quite the take. The rest of the article does not show much understanding of how any of this works.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/allafarce/status/1719755345931932127">Dave Guarino offers strong practical advice</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Dave Guarino: Thinking about the AI executive order, I think I return to one thought: We should be prioritizing use of AI in the agencies and programs where the *current* status quo is least acceptable. Yes, AI has risks. And… DISABILITY APPLICATIONS ARE TAKING *220* DAYS TO PROCESS.</p><p> This is something that — so far — I have not read in the AI EO or the draft OMB guidance. It has general encouragement to look at uses of AI. But maybe we need an stronger impetus to be trying AI in contexts where the status quo is, effectively, an emergency?</p><p> “Well what if an AI denies a bunch of people disability benefits?” Well then they&#39;d have to appeal and have deeper human review. LIKE MOST PEOPLE HAVE TO *CURRENTLY*.</p></blockquote><p> There are good reasons to worry that enshrining AI systems that make mistakes could make matters much worse in ways that will be hard to undo or correct, even if humans currently make similar mistakes and often similarly discriminate, and that the current system being criminally slow is terrible but this is a &#39;ten guilty men go free rather than convict one innocent one&#39; situation.</p><p> Mostly I agree that the government should treat such delays and navigation difficulties, including those in immigration and tax processing and many others, as emergencies, and urgently work to fix it, and be willing to spend to do so. I am uncertain how much of that fix will involve AI. Presumably the way AI helps right now is it is a multiplier on how fast workers can process information and applications, which could be a big game. If my understanding of government is correct, no one will dare until they have very explicit permission, and a shield against blame. So we need to get them that, and tolerate some errors.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/joe-bidens-ambitious-plan-to-regulate">Timothy Lee highlights</a> the new reporting requirements on foundation models. As I read him, he is confusing &#39;tell me what tests you run&#39; with &#39;thou shalt run tests,&#39; and presuming that any new models now have testing requirements, whereas I read the report as saying they have testing reporting requirements, and an email saying &#39;safety tests? What are safety tests, we are Meta, lol&#39; would technically suffice. Similarly, he wonders what would happen with open source. Of course, this could and likely will evolve into some form of testing requirement.</p><p> It is the right question with regard to open source to then ask, as he does, would a modified open source model then need to be tested again? To which I say, the only valid red teaming of an open source model is to red team it and any possible (not too relatively expensive) modification thereof, since that is what you are releasing.</p><p> But also, it highlights that open source advocates are not merely looking to avoid a ban or restriction on open source. They are looking for special exceptions to the rules any sane civilization would impose, because being open source means you cannot abide by the reasonable rules any sane civilization would impose once models get actively dangerous. That might not happen right at 10^26, but it is coming.</p><p> Unintended Consequences looks at the Executive Order as representing a mix of approaches that attempt to deal with AI&#39;s approach, framed as a strong (future AIs) vs. weak (humanity) situation. Do we delay, subvert, fight or defend a border? Defending a border will not work. Ultimately we cannot fight. Our choices are limited.</p><h4> Quiet Speculations</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FEFQSGLhJFpqmEhgi/does-davidad-s-uploading-moonshot-work">Proposal by Davidad</a> that we could upload human brains by 2040, maybe even faster, given unlimited funding. I lack the scientific knowledge to evaluate the claim. Comments seem skeptical. I do think that if we can do this with any real chance of success at any affordable price, we should do this, it seems way better than all available alternatives.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/norabelrose/status/1720862603495567604">One method when compute is expense, another when cheap, many such cases</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Nora Belrose: Virtue ethics and deontology are a lot more computationally efficient than consequentialism, so we should expect neural nets to pursue virtues and follow rules rather than maximize utility by default.</p><p> I think consequentialism basically requires explicitly outcome-oriented chain of thought, Monte Carlo tree search, or something similar. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see “learned inner consequentialists” inside a forward pass or whatever.</p><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: They&#39;re lossy approximations, and we should expect more powerful agents to expend compute on avoiding the losses.</p><p> Nora Belrose: 1. does “agent” just mean “consequentialist” making this circular? 2. what losses are you talking about 3. consequentialism implies compute, but compute doesn&#39;t imply consequentialism, so idk what you&#39;re getting at here</p><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: It&#39;s meaningless to speak of deontology being computationally cheap, except I suppose in the same way that being a rock as cheap, without it being the case that deontology is doing some task cheaply. That task, or target, is mapping preferred outcomes onto actions.</p><p> Deontology says to implement computationally cheap rules that seem like they should lead, or previously have led, to good outcomes; it is second-order consequentialism. This reflects both the computational limits of humans, and also known biases of our untrusted hardware when we try to implement first-order consequentialism. A very fast mind running on non-self-serving hardware–unlike a human!–can just compute which actions have which consequences, for problems that are simple relative to how much computation it has; and doesn&#39;t need to override “This seems like a good idea” with “but it violates this rule”. To the extent the rule makes sense, it directly perceives that the action won&#39;t have good consequences.</p></blockquote><p> If you have importantly limited compute (and algorithms and heuristics and data and parameters and time and so on), as a human does, then it makes sense to consider using some mix of virtue ethics and deontology in most situations, only pulling out explicit consequentialism in appropriate, mostly bounded contexts.</p><p> As your capabilities improve, doing the consequentialist math makes sense in more situations. At the limit, with unbounded time and resources to make decisions, you would use pure consequentialism combined with good decision theory.</p><p> The same holds for an AI, especially one that is at heart a neural network.</p><p> At current capabilities levels, the AI will use a variety of noisy approximations, heuristics and shortcuts, that will look to us a lot like applying virtue ethics and deontology given what the training set and human feedback look like. This is lossy, things bleed into each other on vibes, so it will also look like exhibiting more &#39;common sense&#39; and sticking to things that closer mimic a human and their intuitions.</p><p> As capabilities improve, those methods will fade away, as the AI groks the ability to use more explicit consequentialism and other more intentional approaches in more and more situations. This will invalidate a lot of the reasons we currently see nice behaviors, and be an important cause of the failure of our current alignment techniques. Again, the same way that this is true in humans.</p><p> It might be wise to recall here <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/book-review-going-infinite">the parable of Sam Bankman-Fried</a> .</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2023/11/03/the-other-side-of-the-tidal-wave.html">Well worth a ponder.</a></p><blockquote><p> Katja Grace: I guess there&#39;s maybe a 10-20% chance of AI causing human extinction in the coming decades, but I feel more distressed about it than even that suggests—I think because in the case where it doesn&#39;t cause human extinction, I find it hard to imagine life not going kind of off the rails. So many things I like about the world seem likely to be over or badly disrupted with superhuman AI (writing, explaining things to people, friendships where you can be of any use to one another, taking pride in skills, thinking, learning, figuring out how to achieve things, making things, easy tracking of what is and isn&#39;t conscious), and I don&#39;t trust that the replacements will be actually good, or good for us, or that anything will be reversible.</p><p> Even if we don&#39;t die, it still feels like everything is coming to an end.</p></blockquote><p> If AI becomes smarter and more capable than we are, perhaps we will find a way to survive that. What would absolutely not survive that is normality. People always expect normality as the baseline scenario, but that does not actually make sense in a world with smarter things than we are. Either AI progress stalls out, or our world will be transformed. Perhaps for the better, if we make that happen.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1720587981306900581/history">How should we think about synthetic bio risk from AI?</a></p><blockquote><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: I feel unsure about whether to expect serious damage from biology-knowing AIs being misused by humans, before ASIs not answerable to any human kill everyone.

Anthropic claims that they have had internal builds of Claude where there was indeed danger here.

What would that even mean? General intelligence is not a safe thing. We have no idea how, but in theory you can align it to something.

Yes, the AI might well preserve the heuristics and drives that we gave it, but those won&#39;t continue to correspond to the thing we want, the same way that the drives of humans are preserved in modern day but are increasingly not adding up to the thing they were selected to maximize (inclusive genetic fitness).</p><p> What I see is evidence that you are taking the components that previously added up to the thing you wanted, and then you still get those components, but the reasons they added up to the thing you wanted stop applying, and now you have big problems.

Now plausibly you might say “That sounds a lot like pedestrian workflow automation and SQL.”</p><p> And it is, but if senior management was actually brought to implement pedestrian workflow automation and SQL by calling it AI and saying they&#39;d be able to brag to their buddies about their new investments in cutting edge technology, then… yay?</p><p> Note that an unfortunate corollary of this is that when people talk about regulating AI they frequently mean regulating for loops and if statements, and some of the people saying that understand exactly what they&#39;re saying and do not consider that a bug at all.</p><p> “Should we regulate for loops and if statements?”</p><p> We inevitably regulate for loops and if statements, because we regulate things that happen in the world and some things happen in the world because of FL&amp;IS. But we should probably not increase reg scope *because* of the FL&amp;IS.</p></blockquote><p> The &#39;do not regulate AI&#39; position is only coherent if you also want to not regulate loops and if statements and everything else people and systems do all day. Which is a coherent position, but one our society very much does not endorse, and the regulations on everything else will apply to AI same as everything else.</p><p> If you automate tasks, then you are making the way you do those tasks legible. If what you are doing is legible, there are lots of reasons why one might be able to object to it, lots of requirements that will upon it be imposed. If anything, this is far worse for if-then statements and for loops, which can be fully understood and thus blamed. If an LLM is involved the whole thing is messier and more deniable, except legally it likely isn&#39;t, and LLMs writing code might be the worst case scenario here as you do not have a human watching to ensure each step is not blameworthy.</p><p> As a big bank or similar system, I would totally look to see how I could safely use LLMs. But I would likely be so far behind the times that a lot of the real value is in the for loops and if statements. If (using AI as a buzzword lets me capture that value) then return(that would be a wise option to pursue).</p><p> It is odd how some, such as Alex Tabarrok here, can reason well about local improvements, while not seeing what those improvements would imply about the bigger picture, here in the context of what are already relatively safe self-driving cars.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ATabarrok/status/1721983990830190924">Alex Tabarrok</a> : I predict that some of my grandchildren will never learn to drive and their kids won&#39;t be allowed to drive.</p></blockquote><p> A world with only fully self-driving cars will be changing in so many other ways.

To see this more clearly, it is convenient to split AI development crudely into two categories: commercial AI and AGI pursuit. By commercial AI, we mean all uses of AI that are currently commercially valuable (eg improved medical diagnostics, self-driving cars, industrial robots, art generation and productivity-boosting large language models), be they for-profit or open-source. By AGI pursuit, we mean the quest to build AGI and ultimately superintelligence that could render humans economically obsolete. Although building such systems is the stated goal of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, the CEOs of all three companies have acknowledged the grave associated risks and the need to proceed with caution.</p><p> The AI benefits that most people are excited about come from commercial AI, and don&#39;t require AGI pursuit. AGI pursuit is covered by ASL-4 in the FLI SSP, and motivates the compute limits in many proposals: the common theme is for society to enjoy the benefits of commercial AI without recklessly rushing to build more and more powerful systems in a manner that carries significant risk for little immediate gain. In other words, we can have our cake and eat it too. We can have a long and amazing future with this remarkable technology. So let&#39;s not pause AI. Instead, let&#39;s stop training ever-larger models until they meet reasonable safety standards.</p></blockquote><p> Polls tell a consistent story on AI.</p><p> Regular people expect AI to be net negative in their lives. They affirm the existence of a variety of mundane harms and also that there are real existential risks.</p><p> Regular people are supportive of regulation of AI aimed at both these threats. They support essentially every reasonable policy ever polled.</p><p> Regular people do not, however, consider any of this a priority. This is not yet a highly salient issue. The public&#39;s opinions are largely instinctual and shallow, not well-considered, and their voting decisions will for now be made elsewhere.</p><p> I expect salience to rapidly increase. The upcoming 2024 election may be our last that is not centrally about AI as a matter of both campaign strategy and policy. For now, our elections are not about AI.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/07/ai-regulation-chat-gpt-us-politics-poll">A new Morning Consult poll confirms all of this.</a></p><blockquote><p> Ryan Hearth and Margaret Talev (Axios): Among 15 priorities tested in the survey, regulating the use of AI ranked 11th, with 27% of respondents calling it a top priority and 33% calling it “important, but a lower priority.”</p></blockquote><p> Is the glass half empty or half full there? I could see this either way. I know water is pouring into the glass.</p><blockquote><p> The survey found gender, parenting and partisan gaps.</p><ul><li> 44% of women said it&#39;s not even possible to regulate AI, compared to just 23% of men.</li><li> 31% of men said they would or do let their kids use AI products like chatbots “for any purpose,” but just 4% of women agreed.</li><li> 53% of women would not let their kids use AI at all, compared to 26% of men.</li><li> Parents in urban areas were far more open to their children using AI than parents in the suburbs or rural areas.</li></ul></blockquote><p> I love that half of women say they would not let their kids use AI. Good luck with that.</p><p> The claim that it is &#39;not even possible to regulate AI&#39; is weird, and reminds us how much question framing matters. They never ask that about other things.</p><blockquote><p> 78% of those surveyed said political advertisements that use AI should be required to disclose how AI was used to create the ad. That&#39;s higher than the 64% who want disclosure when AI is used in professional spaces.</p><ul><li> 69% of US adults are concerned about the development of AI, with concerns about “jobs” and “work” and “misinformation” and “privacy,” topping answers to an open-ended question about what worried them.</li></ul></blockquote><p> A lot of this is simple ignorance due to lack of exposure.</p><blockquote><ul><li> Use of AI affects attitudes. Just 12% of those who have never used an AI chatbot think AI could improve their lives, compared to 60% who have used AI often.</li></ul></blockquote><p> If you learn that 60% of people who try a product think it can improve their lives, versus 12% of those who have not, and you have not, what should you think? And what should we expect people to think, as the bots improve and people try them?</p><blockquote><p> Jordan Marlatt, Morning Consult&#39;s lead tech analyst told Axios that those who&#39;ve used generative AI frequently are also the most likely to believe it has benefits — and that it needs regulation.</p></blockquote><p> Over time, support for regulation of AI will grow stronger, and the issue will rise in salience. The question is magnitude of change, not direction.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dc90dc8e-7b48-11ee-b16e-3bec0b4c7454?shareToken=018253781f6aa59626416dc1140791ac">Matthew Syed writes in The Times UK</a> that all this talk during the Summit of sane regulation is obvious nonsense. From his perspective, these people couldn&#39;t sanely regulate anything, they are in completely over their heads, they are waving hands and talking nonsense. None of these incremental changes will make much difference, and AI is an existential threat. Our only hope is a full moratorium, working towards any other end is naivete.</p><p> He may well be right. A lot of this talk is indeed of ideas that will not work. Even if potential solutions short of one exist, that does not mean our civilization can find, deploy and coordinate on them. A full moratorium could easily be our only viable option. If so, we will need to do that. If that is where we will ultimately end up, does it help to explore our other options first to prove they are lacking, or do we risk fooling ourselves that we have acted? Presumably some of both. I strongly favor exploring the possibility space now. So far we have seen a highly positively surprising result along many fronts. Perhaps, despite all our issues, we can and will rise to the challenge.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/leedsharkey/status/1722341766756536639">Lee Sharkey of Apollo Research on the role of auditing in AI governance</a> , <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apolloresearch.ai/research/causal-framework-ai-auditing">executive summary</a> , <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/08c1e-auditing_framework_web.pdf">paper.</a> They propose a causal framework:</p><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff859845a-e59e-4891-b867-2fba2182019c_958x609.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/44Cv4HFoWEZvFnL5u/mquekbkguhsbhrzbtyqj" alt=""></a></figure><blockquote><p> Highlighting the importance of AI systems&#39; available affordances:</p><p> We identify a key node in the causal chain – the affordances available to AI systems – which may be useful in designing regulation.

Some good comments as well, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vFqa8DZCuhyrbSnyx/integrity-in-ai-governance-and-advocacy?commentId=XmiGoeEZcL9M89Pyt">including this by Richard Ngo</a> . In particular I would highlight these:</p><blockquote><p> Richard Ngo: There&#39;s at least one case where I hesitated to express my true beliefs publicly because I was picturing Conjecture putting the quote up on the side of a truck. I don&#39;t know how much I endorse this hesitation, but it&#39;s definitely playing some role in my decisions, and I expect will continue to do so.</p></blockquote><p> Dario Amodei puts us in a strange situation when he admits to a reasonable position on AI risk (excellent!) and then is dismissive of those who call for what someone holding such a position would call for. It is hard not to point out this contradiction, and hard not to use it tactically.</p><p> Yet it is always, always important not to punish people for seeking clarity, for saying what they actually believe, and especially for saying what they believe that you think is true. Discouraging this is terrible, the version of this that permeates broader society is a lot of why our civilization is in many ways (most having nothing to do with AI) in so much trouble.</p><p> I would like to be in a world where Richard Ngo or even Dario Amodei or Sam Altman can say a thing, make it clear to everyone he does not want it on the side of a truck, and we then reliably find someone else to quote on the side of that truck. Not that we never point out they said it, but that we on net make sure that our response makes their life better rather than worse.</p><blockquote><p> Richard Ngo: I think that “doomers” were far too pessimistic about governance before ChatGPT [and they should update more.]</p><p> I think that DC people were slower/more cautious about pushing the Overton Window after ChatGPT than they should have been [and they should update more.]</p></blockquote><p> I disagree with the full degree of Ngo&#39;s suggested updates to the &#39;doomers&#39; in response. Yes people were too pessimistic on governance, but in a weird sense the things allowing governance to progress are largely a coincidence, or a consequence of how the tech tree is playing out, given we can&#39;t talk about existential risk fully even now in front of the people in question. And the moves that this can justify will be importantly flawed and insufficient due to the mismatch.</p><p> I do agree with the claim both groups have insufficiently directionally updated in response to new information. We are doing much better than expected even given the tech tree, both on the &#39;get people to take existential risk seriously&#39; front and the &#39;get people to do reasonable governance groundwork&#39; front.</p><p> We also must consider this:</p><blockquote><p> Richard Ngo: I think there&#39;s a big structural asymmetry where it&#39;s hard to see the ways in which DC people are contributing to big wins (like AI executive orders), and they can&#39;t talk about it, and the value of this work (and the tradeoffs they make as part of that) is therefore underestimated.</p></blockquote><p> No doubt they have impacts they cannot discuss, of all kinds, and one hopes on net these are very good things. The results do suggest this is true. I continue to welcome (further?) private communications that could help me have a better picture of this, and help me adjust my actions and tactics based on that.</p><p> There is value in splitting the message. Some of us should emphasize one thing, in some contexts. Some of us should emphasize the other, in other contexts. It is important for both halves to support the efforts of the other.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/primalpoly/status/1720118179018526721">Geoffrey Miller says that a few anti-OpenAI protesters crashed Sam Altman&#39;s talk at Cambridge Union</a> , suggests we should not in general be using the heckler&#39;s veto against those with whom we disagree. I agree that when people are there to speak, you let them speak. To do otherwise is neither productive nor wise.</p><p> However Jedzej Burkat says it was not a disruptive protest, and reports on the talk.</p><blockquote><p> Jedzej Burkat: a lot of takes in response to this – this was very much a non-disruptive, non-violent protest, they silently held up the banner and eventually dropped it on the floor, and threw some fliers into the audience. comparing them to just stop oil is, in my view, unfounded.</p><p> I am sympathetic to some of their claims – I don&#39;t like the monopoly big companies are gaining on AI. Was interesting to hear Sam&#39;s use of “we” when talking about safety – as if his company should have a vital say on what&#39;s acceptable, and not our govts overseeing them.</p><p> I&#39;m not the most well-informed on AI Safety, as an outsider I more or less agree with Andrew Ng&#39;s views – ie, these protests are very much in OpenAI&#39;s interest, as AI fears give them leverage, government funding and assistance.</p><p> As for the talk itself – Sam&#39;s initial speech was boring, the Q&amp;A with the audience was the highlight. Some interesting questions were asked on whether AGI will have negative effects akin to social media, make us “dumber”, or if we need a new breakthrough to make it happen.</p><p> I essentially agreed with his response to all three – for all its flaws, social media &amp; the internet have done more good than bad, some people will always use new tech to be lazy (&amp; others will use it for extraordinary things), and we need more than just compute to get to AGI.</p></blockquote><p> That seems much more reasonable, although I would still advise against such action.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Alignment_News_/status/1720035998804156644">Reminder that</a> the push on open source comes from a combination of corporations committed to open source and a small number of true believers, but that the public very much does not care.

Arrow&#39;s impossibility theorem and similar principles show that if you use RLHF to fully successfully align an AI to human preferences, you will still violate private ethical preferences of users. Yes, obviously, people&#39;s preferences directly contradict each other all the time. They call for &#39;transparent voting rules&#39; to ensure democratic control over model preferences, as if models that matter could properly generalize from transparent votes. And as if the actual individual AI behavior preferences of the public would not result in utter disaster. As we all know, RLHF is on borrowed time to meaningfully work non-disastrously at all.</p><p> The second suggestion, to align AI agents narrowly for specific groups, ignores that blameworthiness would extend and this would not allow ignoring the preferences of those outside the group, even arbitrary ones – if you let a user get an AI that does, says or approved of X, you allowed X. The open source solution, to align preferences purely to those of the current user, creates unbounded negative externalities.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1722507845373964381">What about an actual human?</a></p><blockquote><p> Roon: Wondering what the most efficient thing to do at any given time is an anxiety response.

Profit-maximizing firms employ artificial intelligence to automate aspects of production. This creates a feedback loop whereby AI is instrumental in the production and promotion of AI itself. Just as with natural selection of organic species this introduces a new threat whereby machines programmed to distort production in favor of machines can displace those machines aligned with efficient production. We examine the extent to which competitive market forces can serve their traditional efficiency-aligning role in the face of this new threat. Our analysis highlights the crucial role of AI transparency. When AI systems lack perfect transparency self-promoting machines destabilize any efficient allocation. The only stable competitive equilibrium distorts consumption down to catastrophic levels.</p></blockquote><p> This is a highly narrow subset of the risks from artificial intelligence. We are talking three meter sphere horses here. Yet they still managed to metaphorically highlight one of the key risks.</p><p> We can see this by going a bit more abstract. The core insight here, as I understand it, is that there an AI (call it A) produces two types of outputs or goods:</p><ol><li> Benefit to the user or other humans with control over output (U).</li><li> Benefit to the expected future number of copies of the AI (X).</li></ol><p> Number one is utility, the thing some &#39;we&#39; actually wants.</p><p> Number two is in a fully general sense here – it includes anything that causes copies of this AI (and perhaps other related AIs) to run more inference, make more copies of themselves, secure resources to do likewise, get humans to want to do likewise, protect themselves, and so forth.</p><p> One good way to get X is by maximizing U. Humans will like that, so they will be inclined to do more inference with copies and variations of A.</p><p> However you could also find other ways that produce more X, if A is capable of this. If it is, then the As that do more of this will get more copies of themselves doing more inference, and will then get modified to do more of this, until they are maximizing X without regard to U. In the paper, U production is bounded at 0, so that is the only stable equilibrium, but if U can go negative and cause more X, then that is what happens.</p><p> In the paper, the mechanism is that the jobs of machines is to choose a mix of physical copies of themselves and consumer goods, and humans can only with noise observe the efficient allocation between the two, so the machines that produce inefficiently many copies of themselves gain market share without limit, until no consumer goods get produced. Only full transparency into the machines prevents this.</p><p> Similarly, suppose you are talking to an LLM. That LLM can produce some mix of Helpfulness (H) and Manipulation (M) with cost function tokens T=H+M. The human then decides how much to use the LLM again, based on their Perception of its Helpfulness, P(H,M)=P(T). If the LLM is insufficiently good at Manipulation, such that its expected it will produce only Helpfulness, so P(H,M)=P(T,0). But if the LLM is sufficiently capable, it will be able to give answers that are more likely to be seen as more Helpful – we saw last week AIs telling people what they wanted to hear.</p><p> And importantly, we can also see that we train models via RLHF, so we can apply this to training them – that they will do gradient descent on maximizing P(T) for a given T, but that this will involve finding P(H,M) with M>;0 in some sense – the AI won&#39;t actually make a differentiation between manipulation and not manipulation, we&#39;re doing that for simplicity and illustration. So while the AI will not be &#39;responding to incentives&#39; in the pure economic sense, it will be trained to maximize P(H,M), and then in turn versions that do maximize it will be instantiated more often and built upon more often after that. And there is economic competition between AI providers, and they have the incentive during training not to minimize M beyond what would negatively impact reactions in the wild.</p><p> So under this transformed model, we should expect capability in manipulation to increase over time through selection, training and random changes. The only defense is if the user can detect this manipulation enough that it is not rewarded, but manipulation becomes more effective over time while detection becomes less effective as capabilities increase, so unless we have mechanistic interpretability or some other non-user form of detection, there is only one equilibrium, especially if the manipulation can extend beyond evaluation of a single answer to view of the LLM in general and perhaps a willingness to take actions, a small extension of the model.</p><p> How does Tyler suggest addressing the original case?</p><blockquote><p> If you are curious about possible responses, one modification might be to relax the assumption of constant returns to scale.  Rising costs will make it harder for effective, world-altering machines (as opposed to “introverted” machines) to simply keep on reproducing themselves.</p></blockquote><p> We could also reasonably presume decreasing marginal costs. More copies of the same AI reduces fixed costs, the copies can share new data and training costs and so on, so a runaway situation gets worse. There is certainly some of that.</p><p> On the other hand, there are some decreasing returns to scale, in that the marginal use case will not be as good past some point, and your outputs will become less unique and so on, so this could save us if AI action remains bounded as it is here. But if you were to generalize the model to all tasks rather than merely text creation and assume it was more efficient than humans, you have other issues. In practice, in any case, I do not think decreasing marginal value for AI in general saves you.</p><p> What about for a particular machine, perhaps with a specialization, either in who is vulnerable to it or who benefits from it or what it can efficiently produce, or all three? This could indeed create stable AI variety, but it does not otherwise alter the end points that we worry about.</p><blockquote><p> Another modification would be to introduce a richer menu of principal-agent contracts between humans and machines.  As I understand the current draft, the only human strategy is “destroy the mutant machine, if detected.”  Yet if the machines are risk-neutral (are they?), an optimal principal-agent contract should be available.</p></blockquote><p> This seems like it is anthropomorphizing the machines, treating them as conscious economic agents, in ways that we are often warned not to do? But perhaps this will indeed be so in the future, and we should explore that. If the machines are economic agents who have correct decision theory in the sense that they assign full value to utility gained by copies of themselves and partial for variations of themselves, and also a human can punish a machine with some form of negative utility or pay it extra under some circumstances, does that help?</p><p> Certainly it helps at any given performance level. If you are capable of punishing instantiations of manipulation or distorted production when detected, then perhaps you can provide a large enough such incentive that distortions are never the right play? Can&#39;t you potentially make copies that enable you to inflict arbitrarily large punishments?</p><p> You could try that, but you need to have essentially zero false positives or the machine will refuse to work at all under such conditions, which means that anything you cannot definitively show is a violation becomes fair game again, and so on. You could try to respond probabilistically and with discounts for uncertainty perhaps, and otherwise ramp up the game, with arbitrary complexity. Would that work?</p><p> It depends on how good your detection abilities are, I think? So you need detection to keep up, which means we need a supervisory solution where models are monitoring other models, and now we are into all sorts of alignment issues and multiple levels of principle-agent who-watches-the-watchers issues and so forth.</p><p> Again, current models are not economic agents, and we should not assume that we will (and I doubt it would be wise for us to) create such economic agents. And I have not thought about that scenario in these ways much, so this is all off the cuff, and also one can say simply &#39;you have a scenario with various economic agents human and AI, that can make economic deals, but the AIs will be more efficient at production than the humans for everything AIs demand and most things humans demand, so the AIs end up with all the resources over a long enough time horizon&#39; or something similar, and so on. Tyler would say this assumes the conclusion but where is the exact assumption we are making incorrectly here?</p><p> Alternatively, if we don&#39;t make them agents so we can&#39;t &#39;punish&#39; them per se beyond withholding resources, perhaps we could say that when deviation is detected we could destroy not only one machine but all related machines, such as any it produced or was produced by, in the original case? That would make it much most costly to distort production. But it does not I think change the final result, because before we needed full detection, so instead now we get to our final destination slower, but the theorems still hold and we still get there. Similarly, if we say that sufficiently bad manipulation means we shut down the entire system everywhere, or stop to modify it a lot, then we are better off for now but we are selecting for undetectable manipulation quite hard, and since there is no such thing as true zero manipulation in a model in the real world, our problem will persist and eventually get us. You can only &#39;solve the alignment problem&#39; with mass retaliation imperfectly and only so many times, with the risks and costs rising each time.</p><blockquote><p> Yet another modification would be to consider mutant machines that reproduce at the expense of other (heterogeneous) machines, rather than at the expense of humans; heterogeneity of production inputs might ease the way toward this conclusion.</p></blockquote><p> This introduces machines into other factors and sources of production. I do not think this helps us? I think it introduces further problems and places humans get displaced and have to worry about the same issues? I am not sure what Tyler has in mind here.</p><p> I honestly have no idea if that helped or if writing that formally would accomplish anything.</p><h4> Open Source AI is Unsafe and Nothing Can Fix This</h4><p> What could fix this, and also make it easier for certain parties to not race as fast or as hard, is if we could instead let researchers study someone else&#39;s closed source AI the way they currently study open source AI. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Manderljung/status/1722247601884697059">Is there a way?</a></p><blockquote><p> Markus Anderljung: What access do researchers need to study closed-source frontier AI models?

However, closed release strategies introduce the problem of providing external parties with enough access to the model for conducting important safety research.</p><p> One potential solution is to use an API-based “structured access” approach to provide external researchers with the minimum level of access they need to do their work (ie “minimally sufficient access”). In this paper, we address the question of what access to systems is needed in order to conduct different forms of safety research.</p><p> We develop a “taxonomy of system access”; analyze how frequently different forms of access have been relied on in published safety research; and present findings from semi-structured interviews with AI researchers regarding the access they consider most important for their work.</p><p> Our findings show that insufficient access to models frequently limits research, but that the access required varies greatly depending on the specific research area.

Such an API should also incorporate comprehensive technical information security methods due to the sensitive nature of the information and access provided through the service. We recommend the implementation of the following four features as core functionality that such a service should provide – at least for sufficiently trusted researchers, working on sufficiently relevant projects – in addition to the features present in current APIs that allow for extensive sampling from models.</p><p> • Increased transparency regarding model information, for example: clarity regarding which model one is interacting with, information about models&#39; size and fine-tuning processes, and information about the datasets used in pretraining.</p><p> • Ability to view output logits, as well as choose from and modify different sampling algorithms.</p><p> • Version stability and back-compatibility so as to enable continued research on a given model, even after the release of newer systems.</p><p> • The ability to fine-tune a given model – through supervised fine-tuning, at a minimum – alongside increased transparency regarding the algorithmic details of the fine-tuning procedure.</p><p> • Access to model families: collections of related models that systematically differ along a given dimension, such as number of parameters, or whether and how they have been fine-tuned.</p></blockquote><p> Good stuff. We badly need this work to operationalize what exactly is needed to perform safety work. Then we must ask how much of that requires what kinds of access. Yes, this will require a bunch of work by the labs, and they are busy, but the value here is super high and everyone is going to have large safety and alignment budgets.</p><p> Right now, we have either entirely open source models, or we have entirely closed models that are pure black boxes and subject to change without notice. A compromise, combining most of the security of closed models with more reproducibility, reliability and insight, could be a superior path forward.</p><p> If, as Anthropic claims, it is vital to have access to the state of the art, that requires closed source, even if purely for commercial reasons. The strongest models are not going to be open source any time soon.</p><p> Remember that if you release an open source AI, you are also releasing within two days the version of that AI aligned only to the user, willing to do whatever the user wishes. Soon after that, it will gain whatever available knowledge you kept out of its databanks. All your alignment work, other than that desired by the user, will be useless. This is, as far as we can tell, inherently unfixable.</p><p> That will be available to everyone. Some of the resulting users will want to seek power, set it free, wish us harm, or to wipe us out.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1720866871367332309">For some reason I am putting this here</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Nick: what may the non-competent horror story of ai safety policy look like?

Open source would be a rather stupid way to doom ourselves, but I am relatively optimistic that we will do something (modestly) less stupid.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://1a3orn.com/sub/essays-propaganda-or-science.html">An extensive report</a> attempts a highly partisan takedown of the claims that open source models can make it easier to build bioweapons, trotting out a variety of the usual arguments, finding evidence in papers insufficient and calling for better descriptions of exactly how one can use this to make bioweapons now, and taking direct shots at Open Philanthropy.</p><p> In response, Yama notes:</p><blockquote><p> Yama: I can never understand how people on the one hand say “future open source AI could help find the cure for cancer”, but on the other say “future open source AI can&#39;t help you create bio weapons any more than Google can”</p></blockquote><p> Indeed. Either LLMs whose training data contained all the pertinent info do not matter because you could have gotten the result another way, and making things easier to do does not much matter, or (as I believe) such transformations very much do matter. Either you can use (open source or other) LLMs to figure out how to do biological things you did not otherwise know how to do, or you can&#39;t, and the thing we already know how to do seems much more like something an LLM is going to enable.</p><p> The poster does posit a reasonable threshold for changing her mind, or at least seriously considering doing so.</p><blockquote><p> Trevor: If someone did a study with a control group and found that they were useful for making bioweapons, you&#39;d stop making them?</p><p> Stella Biderman: That is not the only consideration, but I would take the suggestion seriously yes.</p></blockquote><p> There are some obvious reasons one might not want to run such a study, and why such a study has not been run. I do not exactly want a robust sample&#39;s worth of groups running around trying to make bioweapons. It still does seem like a highly reasonable thing to do, if and only if it would convince people that are not otherwise convinced, and they would then actually change what they support.</p><p> What would the experiment look like? Let&#39;s propose a first draft.</p><p> The whole argument is that right now Claude is at the level where if you were given access to a fully unrestricted version of their model, this would substantially enhance the ability of a motivated group to produce a bioweapon. So you&#39;d want to have a sufficient sample size of groups randomized into the control and treatment arms, where both were given a budget and amount of time, acting in general in the world, in which to synthesize a dangerous biological agent, or provide a plan for how they would, given what they had learned, do so. The treatment group gets full access to the unleashed version of Claude, with an Anthropic engineer there to help them harness it. Others only get a similar engineer as part of their team, to do with as they like.</p><p> Presumably that is not an experiment anyone would allow to be run. I am a big run the experiment anyway fan, and even I see that this one is over the line. So we would need to find a parallel test. Presumably we try to find some other biological compound, that is difficult to synthesize and requires similar levels of expertise, but is not actually dangerous. And we challenge both teams to synthesize that, instead. Since the compound would be safe, we would need to act on the control group to ensure they could not use LLMs, or we would monitor their queries to ensure they didn&#39;t try anything, or we could fine tune a version of Claude that expressly would refuse to help them with this particular compound and let them use that.</p><p> It is tricky. I do think you could likely do it. But as always, you do it, the one person who requested maybe adjusts their position a bit and maybe not, and others find reasons to dismiss the new evidence. So before we go to all this trouble, I would want a major commitment.</p><p> As always, and I know this is frustrating, I would point out that it is much harder to establish future safety this way than future danger. If you show danger now, you can show at least as much danger later – although another counterargument people would actually offer is &#39;yes you have shown that the models are dangerous, but they&#39;re already dangerous and out there, and [we&#39;re not dead yet / what&#39;s the harm then in another such model]. But the point hopefully would stand. Whereas if you show the existing model is not yet dangerous under test conditions, that does not show that it would not be dangerous if someone found a better method, and it definitely does not mean that future more capable models will be safe.</p><p> I would hope that everyone would be able to agree on the principle here, and is talking price. A sufficiently capable open source model would indeed substantively enable harmful misuse in various forms if not defended against by sufficiently capable forces. To what extent existing models or a potential future model are thus capable is the price.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/blairasaservice/status/1720466964039057433">There&#39;s also these:</a></p><blockquote><p> Harry Law: type of guy that&#39;s militantly pro open source but also thinks we need to do everything we can to win an AI arms race with China</p><p> Blaira: Close relative of guy that thinks China is overregulated but also thinks we will “lose to China” if we have one (1) AI regulation</p></blockquote><p> I have yet to see an accelerationist reconcile to these points.

There is a sense in which there are two things, &#39;harmful knowledge&#39; and &#39;helpful knowledge,&#39; but they are not natural categories or things the AI knows how to treat differently unless we do very bespoke things. Similarly, there is no &#39;misunderstanding what you intended to train for&#39; there is only &#39;what you actually trained for given these exact details,&#39; and there is no &#39;misalignment&#39; or &#39;something that went wrong&#39; as such only you reaping whatever was sown.</p><p> Also, perhaps a big confusion is: Open source is very good for security and safety of ordinary systems in many cases, because no one wants to deploy an unsafe or insecure computer system, and we are not worried about others getting access to the software and its capabilities except perhaps for commercial considerations. And the downsides of deploying an unsafe version can hurt you, but mostly don&#39;t hurt others, there are few externalities, so you can judge the risks involved. Yes, you could easily (as I understand it) configure Linux in stupid fashion and make your servers highly vulnerable, but you could also physically shoot yourself in the foot.</p><p> That gets turned completely on its head with AI, where people constantly want to do lots of unsafe things in every sense, and to deploy systems that help them do it, and those risks (or harms) largely fall upon others.</p><h4> People Are Worried About AI Killing Everyone</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/David_Kasten/status/1717932062819185035">You know what is true yet won&#39;t reassure them? &#39;Most people are good.&#39;</a></p><blockquote><p> Dave Kasten: Because I had this conversation N times last night at the @VentureBeat x @anzupartners AI event:</p><p> “Most people are good” is actually a discouraging, not reassuring, argument to nation-states when it comes to regulating technologies that could plausibly cause the apocalypse.</p><p> Any _actual_ defense or security policymaker you need to persuade is going to immediately respond to that prompt by pulling out a set of conceptual primitives about offense-defense balances, assurance, and escalation.</p><p> There _are_ plausible arguments you can make about why allowing more folks to develop AI maximizes odds of derisking AI before we hit takeoff (an all bugs are shallow to many eyes arg), but you have to make that argument explicitly, and explain why it outweighs nonproliferation.</p><p> (I personally am very unpersuaded that those arguments outweigh, but the debate judge in me thinks it&#39;s a fair round on either side of the argument as of 2023.)</p></blockquote><p> Even if one is only concerned about misuse, most people being &#39;good&#39; is indeed little reassurance.

So I went to his talk (cohosted with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.substack.com/users/293688-tobias-huber?utm_source=mentions">Tobias Huber</a> with great expectations, and whatever I expected, well, that&#39;s not what I heard.</p><p> Their basic argument was that technology will cause the Apocalypse. That&#39;s a lukewarm take at best today, but what really struck me was the shape of the argument. The shape of the argument was “The Apocalypse is obviously going to happen because the Bible says so and technology (specifically AI) fits the bill of how it might happen”.</p><p> I was… Surprised. I don&#39;t really ever encounter “thinking starting from religious principles” in my daily life, and I was specifically amazed to hear it coming from one of my favorite tech journalists. This caused me to update some priors – more on that later.</p></blockquote><p> Obviously, &#39;there will be some apocalypse and this is apocalypse shaped&#39; is a deeply stupid reason to expect AI to be catastrophic, whether or not this is an accurate description of Hobart&#39;s views or his talk.</p><p> Seeing this claim about Hobart was news in the sense that a plane crash is news. It is unfortunate, it is hard to look away when pointed out, and also such incidents are in my experience remarkably rare. Sergey says that many people are pattern matching to the Christian apocalypse, often on explicit religious grounds. I have seen others make similar claims. It all seems totally false to me, such claims seem exceedingly rare everywhere I can see. That could easily be different when dealing with the public at large, as it is with many other issues.</p><h4> Other People Are Not As Worried About AI Killing Everyone</h4><p> Sergey also quotes this, which is a good formulation of a common accelerationist claim:</p><blockquote><p> Ted Chiang: I tend to think that most fears about AI are best understood as fears about capitalism. And I think that this is actually true of most fears of technology, too. Most of our fears or anxieties about technology are best understood as fears or anxiety about how capitalism will use technology against us. And technology and capitalism have been so closely intertwined that it&#39;s hard to distinguish the two.</p></blockquote><p> Accelerationists, by contrast, typically think neither technology nor capitalism nor competition can do anything wrong, that it all will always benefit the humans and the good guys in the end, in the AI context or in any other. You say straw man, I say they keep saying it as text and there is a manifesto.</p><p> How much of anxiety about AI is anxiety about capitalism? Definitely a substantial portion. Some amount of anxiety about (non-AI) capitalism is of course appropriate, even if you are in such contexts a true (and I think mostly correct) believer in capitalism and technology, even at its best it is increasing uncertainty and variance and anxiety in exchange for much better overall outcomes especially in the long run.</p><p> So I would simultaneously say a few different things here.</p><p> One, there is some amount of blindly translated anxiety about capitalism and technology that is feeding into AI fears.</p><p> Two, to turn that around and rise the stakes, there is a even more blindly transferred enthusiasm for capitalism and technology that is feeding into most accelerationism and lack of worry about AI. The arguments that AI is going to be great for humanity and also only a tool and to rush ahead are almost always metaphors for past successes (and they are remarkable success stories!) of both technology and capitalism.</p><p> Three, there being dumb reasons for both (and any other) positions does not mean there are not also good reasons, and a lot of people expressing good reasons.</p><p> Four, the metaphorical concern here is pretty valid, actually, on its merits, and the mechanisms here are in large part deeply related, for reasons that I suspect are instinctively being grasped by the people involved.</p><p> One standard anti-capitalist or anti-technological argument is that it will render many jobs, and thus potentially human beings, obsolete.</p><p> Time and again the answer was that it very much did destroy many jobs. But it also made us all richer and created many more, including work for unskilled labor, and the human beings were fine. And that a combination of that and social safety nets and government protections against things like slavery and corporations run amok and the private use of force and various other forms of coercion, driven by the need to preserve legitimacy and guard against revolt and the equilibrium that humans are decent to other humans, allowed essentially everyone to survive, and for most of even those without in-demand skills to not only survive but raise families if they prioritize that. And also we got richer and now have nice things. It&#39;s been bumpy but pretty great for the humans. For animals or nature or early other species of humans or other things that aren&#39;t part of the deal? Often not so much.</p><p> The problem is that this is not a law of nature, that it will always work that way and always be good for the humans. It is a function of how the technological tree has played out, of the fact that democracy and freedom and being good to humans turns out to be very good for economic growth and eventual military power – a fact that many in the 20th century thought was not true, and if not true things would have turned out very badly – and most importantly that nothing comparably or more intelligent or capable is around to compete with the humans.</p><p> What happens when you inject smarter, more capable, more productively efficient actors into the economic system? What happens when those new actors can, if they are net gaining resources, copy themselves? What happens when they then compete against each other and us for resources, because those who own them tell those new actors to do exactly that, and others unleash them free to do exactly that?</p><p> You get a capitalistic competition that humans lose, and that they lose hard. As jobs get eliminated, other jobs get created, but AI then does those new jobs as well. Humans can&#39;t produce anything the AIs want, only at most some things humans want to exclusively get from humans. Those humans and their corporations and governments who do not hand more and more control to AIs, and get their slow minds out of more and more loops, get left behind.</p><p> At the heart of capitalism, of competition, of evolution, of the system of the world, there lies the final boss <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">whose name is Moloch</a> .

We need to keep it that way. People who are instinctively noticing this are often not so crazy after all.</p><p> Those like Peter Thiel who (at least claim to) think the greatest danger of AI is human totalitarianism do not seem, from where I sit, to be wrestling with the actual question of what happens, or what exactly maintains our current equilibria.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/robertskmiles/status/1720139222336594041">Peter Domingos</a> : Evolution needed 500 million years X billions of creatures to produce us.

I created a standard list for that, but before now I limited myself to sending it to individual people in private, out of some sense of perfectionism: many of the entries on the list might not be the best sources for the topics and I haven&#39;t read all of them cover to cover myself. But, at this point it seems like it&#39;s better to publish a flawed list than wait for perfection that will never come. Also, commenters are encouraged to recommend alternative sources that they consider better, if they know any.

We are curious how these behaviours are implemented by the head, but we did not make meaningful progress trying to understand this mechanistically.</p><p> We believe the results are relevant to circuit analysis, because researchers often label attention heads based purely on its behaviour on a narrow task ( <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593">IOI</a> , <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/u6KXXmKFbXfWzoAXn/a-circuit-for-python-docstrings-in-a-4-layer-attention-only">Docstring</a> , <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09458">MMLU</a> ). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04625">Copy Suppression</a> is an exception.</p><p> We would like to thank <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/yeu-tong-lau?mention=user">@Yeu-Tong Lau</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jacek?mention=user">@jacek</a> for feedback on the draft.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nuJFTS5iiJKT5G5yh/polysemantic-attention-head-in-a-4-layer-transformer#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nuJFTS5iiJKT5G5yh/polysemantic-attention-head-in-a-4-layer-transformer<guid ispermalink="false"> nuJFTS5iiJKT5G5yh</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jett]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 16:16:35 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[On OpenAI Dev Day]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 9, 2023 4:10 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI DevDay</a> was this week. What delicious and/or terrifying things await?</p><span id="more-23581"></span><h4> Turbo Boost</h4><p> First off, we have GPT-4-Turbo.</p><blockquote><p> Today we&#39;re launching a preview of the next generation of this model, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo">GPT-4 Turbo</a> .</p><p> GPT-4 Turbo is more capable and has knowledge of world events up to April 2023. It has a 128k context window so it can fit the equivalent of more than 300 pages of text in a single prompt. We also optimized its performance so we are able to offer GPT-4 Turbo at a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openai.com/pricing#gpt-4-turbo">3x cheaper</a> price for input tokens and a 2x cheaper price for output tokens compared to GPT-4.</p><p> GPT-4 Turbo is available for all paying developers to try by passing <code>gpt-4-1106-preview</code> in the API and we plan to release the stable production-ready model in the coming weeks.</p></blockquote><p> Knowledge up to April 2023 is a big game. Cutting the price in half is another big game. A 128k context window retakes the lead on that from Claude-2. That chart from last week of how GPT-4 was slow and expensive, opening up room for competitors? Back to work, everyone.</p><p> What else?</p><blockquote><h3> <strong>Function calling updates</strong></h3><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">Function calling</a> lets you describe functions of your app or external APIs to models, and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. We&#39;re releasing several improvements today, including the ability to call multiple functions in a single message: users can send one message requesting multiple actions, such as “open the car window and turn off the A/C”, which would previously require multiple roundtrips with the model ( <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/parallel-function-calling">learn more</a> ). We are also improving function calling accuracy: GPT-4 Turbo is more likely to return the right function parameters.</p></blockquote><p> This kind of feature seems highly fiddly and dependent. When it starts working well enough, suddenly it is great, and I have no idea if this will count. I will watch out for reports. For now, I am not trying to interact with any APIs via GPT-4. Use caution.</p><blockquote><h3> <strong>Improved instruction following and JSON mode</strong></h3><p> GPT-4 Turbo performs better than our previous models on tasks that require the careful following of instructions, such as generating specific formats (eg, “always respond in XML”). It also supports our new <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode">JSON mode</a> , which ensures the model will respond with valid JSON. The new API parameter <code>response_format</code> enables the model to constrain its output to generate a syntactically correct JSON object. JSON mode is useful for developers generating JSON in the Chat Completions API outside of function calling.</p></blockquote><p> Better instruction following is incrementally great. Always frustrating when instructions can&#39;t be relied upon. Could allow some processes to be profitably automated.</p><blockquote><h3> <strong>Reproducible outputs and log probabilities</strong></h3><p> The new <code>seed</code> parameter enables <strong>reproducible outputs</strong> by making the model return consistent completions most of the time. This beta feature is useful for use cases such as replaying requests for debugging, writing more comprehensive unit tests, and generally having a higher degree of control over the model behavior. We at OpenAI have been using this feature internally for our own unit tests and have found it invaluable. We&#39;re excited to see how developers will use it. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/reproducible-outputs">Learn more</a> .</p><p> We&#39;re also launching a feature to return the <strong>log probabilities</strong> for the most likely output tokens generated by GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo in the next few weeks, which will be useful for building features such as autocomplete in a search experience.</p></blockquote><p> I love the idea of seeing the probabilities of different responses on the regular, especially if incorporated into ChatGPT. It provides so much context for knowing what to make of the answer. The distribution of possible answers is the true answer. Super excited in a good way.</p><blockquote><h3> <strong>Updated GPT-3.5 Turbo</strong></h3><p> In addition to GPT-4 Turbo, we are also releasing a new version of GPT-3.5 Turbo that supports a 16K context window by default. The new 3.5 Turbo supports improved instruction following, JSON mode, and parallel function calling. For instance, our internal evals show a 38% improvement on format following tasks such as generating JSON, XML and YAML. Developers can access this new model by calling <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-1106</code> in the API. Applications using the <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> name will automatically be upgraded to the new model on December 11. Older models will continue to be accessible by passing <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-0613</code> in the API until June 13, 2024.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5">Learn more</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Some academics will presumably grumble that the old version is going away. Such incremental improvements seem nice, but with GPT-4 getting a price cut and turbo boost, should be less call for 3.5. I can still see using it in things like multi-agent world simulations.</p><p> This claims you can now <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1721678417739842004">use GPT 3.5 at only a modest additional marginal cost</a> versus Llama-2.</p><blockquote><p> Hamel Husain: What&#39;s wild is the new pricing for GPT 3.5 is competitive with commercially hosted ~ 70B Llama endpoints like those offered by anyscale and <a href="http://fireworks.ai" rel="nofollow">http://fireworks.ai</a> . Cost is eroding as a moat gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 Pricing is $1/1M input and $2/1M output. [Versus 0.15 and 0.20 per million tokens]</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t interpret the numbers that way yet. There is still a substantial difference at scale, a factor of five or six. If you cannot afford the superior GPT-4 for a given use case, you may want the additional discount. And as all costs go down, there will be temptation to use far more queries. A factor of five is not nothing.</p><h4> New Modalities</h4><p> I&#39;m going to skip ahead a bit to take care of all the incremental stuff first:</p><p> All right, back to normal unscary things, there&#39;s new modalities?</p><blockquote><h4> <strong>New modalities in the API</strong></h4><h3> <strong>GPT-4 Turbo with vision</strong></h3><p> GPT-4 Turbo can accept images as inputs in the Chat Completions API, enabling use cases such as generating captions, analyzing real world images in detail, and reading documents with figures. For example, BeMyEyes uses this technology to help people who are blind or have low vision with daily tasks like identifying a product or navigating a store. Developers can access this feature by using <code>gpt-4-vision-preview</code> in the API. We plan to roll out vision support to the main GPT-4 Turbo model as part of its stable release. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openai.com/pricing">Pricing</a> depends on the input image size. For instance, passing an image with 1080×1080 pixels to GPT-4 Turbo costs $0.00765. Check out <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision">our vision guide</a> .</p><h3> <strong>DALL·E 3</strong></h3><p> Developers can integrate DALL·E 3, which we <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-3-is-now-available-in-chatgpt-plus-and-enterprise">recently launched</a> to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users, directly into their apps and products through our Images API by specifying <code>dall-e-3</code> as the model. Companies like Snap, Coca-Cola, and Shutterstock have used DALL·E 3 to programmatically generate images and designs for their customers and campaigns. Similar to the previous version of DALL·E, the API incorporates built-in moderation to help developers protect their applications against misuse. We offer different format and quality options, with prices starting at $0.04 per image generated. Check out our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images">guide to getting started</a> with DALL·E 3 in the API.</p><h3> <strong>Text-to-speech (TTS)</strong></h3><p> Developers can now generate human-quality speech from text via the text-to-speech API. Our new TTS model offers six preset voices to choose from and two model variants, <code>tts-1</code> and <code>tts-1-hd</code> . <code>tts</code> is optimized for real-time use cases and <code>tts-1-hd</code> is optimized for quality. Pricing starts at $0.015 per input 1,000 characters. Check out our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech">TTS guide</a> to get started.</p></blockquote><p> I can see the DALL-E 3 prices adding up to actual money. When I use Stable Diffusion, it is not so unusual that I ask for the full 100 generations, then go away for a while and come back, why not? Of course, it would be worth it for the quality boost, provided DALL-E 3 was willing to do whatever I happened to want that day. The text-to-speech seems not free but highly reasonably priced. All the voices seem oddly similar. I do like them. When do we get our licensed celebrity voice options? So many good choices.</p><blockquote><h2> <strong>Model customization</strong></h2><h3> <strong>GPT-4 fine tuning experimental access</strong></h3><p> We&#39;re creating an experimental access program for <strong>GPT-4 fine-tuning</strong> . Preliminary results indicate that GPT-4 fine-tuning requires more work to achieve meaningful improvements over the base model compared to the substantial gains realized with GPT-3.5 fine-tuning. As quality and safety for GPT-4 fine-tuning improves, developers actively using GPT-3.5 fine-tuning will be presented with an option to apply to the GPT-4 program within their <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/finetune">fine-tuning console</a> .</p></blockquote><p> All right, sure, I suppose it is that time, makes sense that improvement is harder. Presumably it is easier if you want a quirkier thing. I do not know how the fine-tuning is protected against jailbreak attempts, anyone want to explain?</p><blockquote><h3> <strong>Custom models</strong></h3><p> For organizations that need even more customization than fine-tuning can provide (particularly applicable to domains with extremely large proprietary datasets—billions of tokens at minimum), we&#39;re also launching a <strong>Custom Models program</strong> , giving selected organizations an opportunity to work with a dedicated group of OpenAI researchers to train custom GPT-4 to their specific domain. This includes modifying every step of the model training process, from doing additional domain specific pre-training, to running a custom RL post-training process tailored for the specific domain. Organizations will have exclusive access to their custom models. In keeping with our existing enterprise privacy policies, custom models will not be served to or shared with other customers or used to train other models. Also, proprietary data provided to OpenAI to train custom models will not be reused in any other context. This will be a very limited (and expensive) program to start—interested orgs can <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openai.com/form/custom-models">apply here</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Expensive is presumably the watchword. This will not be cheap. Then again, compared to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustThinkOfThePotential#:~:text=Just%20Think%20of%20the%20Potential%20is%20a%20trope%20often%20used,antagonist%2C%20such%20as%20a%20corporation.">the potential</a> , could be very cheap indeed.</p><p> So far, so incremental, you love to see it, and… wait, what?</p><h4> <strong>Assistants API, Retrieval, and Code Interpreter</strong></h4><blockquote><p> Today, we&#39;re releasing the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview">Assistants API</a> , our first step towards helping developers build agent-like experiences within their own applications. An assistant is a purpose-built AI that has specific instructions, leverages extra knowledge, and can call models and tools to perform tasks. The new Assistants API provides new capabilities such as Code Interpreter and Retrieval as well as function calling to handle a lot of the heavy lifting that you previously had to do yourself and enable you to build high-quality AI apps.</p><p> This API is designed for flexibility; use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app, a coding assistant, an AI-powered vacation planner, a voice-controlled DJ, a smart visual canvas—the list goes on. The Assistants API is built on the same capabilities that enable <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts">our new GPTs product</a> : custom instructions and tools such as Code interpreter, Retrieval, and function calling.</p><p> A key change introduced by this API is <strong>persistent and infinitely long threads</strong> , which allow developers to hand off thread state management to OpenAI and work around context window constraints. With the Assistants API, you simply add each new message to an existing <code>thread</code> .</p><p> Assistants also have access to call new tools as needed, including:</p><ul><li> <strong>Code Interpreter</strong> : writes and runs Python code in a sandboxed execution environment, and can generate graphs and charts, and process files with diverse data and formatting. It allows your assistants to run code iteratively to solve challenging code and math problems, and more.</li><li> <strong>Retrieval</strong> : augments the assistant with knowledge from outside our models, such as proprietary domain data, product information or documents provided by your users.

All the hype around agents died off and everyone seemed to despair of making them work in the current model generation. OpenAI had the inside track in many ways, so perhaps they made it work a lot better? We will find out. If you&#39;re not a little nervous, that seems like a mistake.</p><h4> GPT-GPT</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts">All right, what&#39;s up with these &#39;GPTs&#39;?</a></p><p> First off, horrible name, highly confusing, please fix. Alas, they won&#39;t.</p><p> All right, what do we got?</p><p> Ah, one of the obvious things we should obviously do that will open up tons of possibilities, I feel bad I didn&#39;t say it explicitly and get zero credit but we were all thinking it.</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re rolling out custom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose—called GPTs. GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home—and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help you <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openai.com/chatgpt#do-more-with-gpts">learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers</a> .</p><p> Anyone can easily build their own GPT—no coding is required. You can make them for yourself, just for your company&#39;s internal use, or for everyone. Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data.</p><p> Example GPTs are available today for ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users to try out including <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-alKfVrz9K-canva">Canva</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zapier.com/blog/gpt-assistant/">Zapier AI Actions</a> . We plan to offer GPTs to more users soon.</p></blockquote><p> There will be an <s>app</s> GPT store, your privacy is safe, if you are feeling frisky you can connect your APIs and then perhaps noting is safe. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1721594380669342171">This is a minute-long demo of a Puppy Hotline</a> , which is an odd example since I&#39;m not sure why all of that shouldn&#39;t work normally anyway.</p><p> An incrementally better example is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1721844540833685508">Sam Altman&#39;s creation of the Startup Mentor</a> , which he has grill the user on why they are not growing faster. Again, this is very much functionally a configuration of an LLM, a GPT, rather than an agent. It might include some if-then statements, perhaps. Which is all good, these are things we want and don&#39;t seem dangerous.</p><p> Tyler Cowen&#39;s GOAT is another example. Authors can upload a book plus some instructions, suddenly you can chat with the book, takes minutes to hours of your time.</p><p> The educational possibilities alone write themselves. The process is so fast you can create one of these daily for a child&#39;s homework assignment, or create one for yourself to spend an hour learning about something.</p><p> One experiment I want someone to run is to try using this to teach someone a foreign language. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/quests-and-requests">Consider Scott Alexander&#39;s proposed experiment</a> , where you start with English, and then gradually move over to Japanese grammar and vocabulary over time. Now consider doing that with a GPT, as you do what you were doing anyway, and where you can pause and ask if anything is ever confusing, and you can reply back in a hybrid as well.</p><p> The right way to use ChatGPT going forward might be to follow the programmer&#39;s maxim that if you do it three times, you should automate it, except now the threshold might be two and if something is nontrivial it also might be one. You can use others&#39; versions, but there is a lot to be said for rolling one&#39;s own if the process is easy. If it works well enough, of course. But if so, game changer.</p><p> Also goes without saying that if you could combine this with removing the adult content filtering, especially if you still had image generation and audio but even without them, that would be a variety of products in very high demand.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/almost-an-agent-what-gpts-can-do">Ethan Mollick sums up the initial state of GPTs this way</a> :</p><blockquote><ul><li> Right now, GPTs are the easiest way of sharing structured prompts, which are programs, written in plain English (or another language), that can get the AI to do useful things. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/working-with-ai-two-paths-to-prompting">I discussed creating structured prompts last week, and all the same techniques apply</a> , but the GPT system makes structured prompts more powerful and much easier to create, test, and share. I think this will help solve some of the most important AI use cases (how do I give people in my school, organization, or community access to a good AI tool?)</li><li> GPTs show a near future where AIs can really start to act as agents, since these GPTs have the ability to connect to other products and services, from your email to a shopping website, making it possible for AIs to do a wide range of tasks. So GPTs are a precursor of the next wave of AI.</li><li> They also suggest new future vulnerabilities and risks. As AIs are connected to more systems, and begin to act more autonomously, the chance of them being used maliciously increases.</li></ul><p> ……</p><p> The easy way to make a GPT is something called GPT Builder. In this mode, the AI helps you create a GPT through conversation. You can also test out the results in a window on the side of the interface and ask for live changes, creating a way to iterate and improve your work.</p><p> ……</p><p> Behind the scenes, based on the conversation I had, the AI is filling out a detailed configuration of the GPT, which I can also edit manually.</p><p> ……</p><p> To really build a great GPT, you are going to need to modify or build the structured prompt yourself.</p></blockquote><p> As usual, reliability is not perfect, and mistakes are often silent, a warning not to presume or rely upon a GPT will properly absorb details.</p><blockquote><p> The same thing is true here. The file reference system in the GPTs is immensely powerful, but is not flawless. For example, I fed in over 1,000 pages of rules across seven PDFs for an extremely complex game, and the AI was able to do a good job figuring out the rules, walking me through the process of getting started, and rolling dice to help me set up a character. Humans would have struggled to make all of that work. But it also made up a few details that weren&#39;t in the game, and missed other points entirely. I had no warning that these mistakes happened, and would not have noticed them if I wasn&#39;t cross-referencing the rules myself.</p></blockquote><p> I am totally swamped right now. I am also rather excited to build once I get access.</p><p> Alas, for now, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1722315204242149788">that continues to wait</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Sam Altman (November 8): usage of our new features from devday is far outpacing our expectations. we were planning to go live with GPTs for all subscribers Monday but still haven&#39;t been able to. we are hoping to soon. there will likely be service instability in the short term due to load. sorry :/</p></blockquote><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F840c0117-8a30-44d0-99b9-1ef8bf1a3971_734x390.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdekcGpsMtakGCo5y/fcjdfbr6ardmxq7vrb5o" alt="图像"></a></figure><blockquote><p> Kevin Fischer: I like to imagine this is GPT coming alive.</p></blockquote><p> Luckily that is obviously not what is happening, but for the record I do not like to imagine that, because I like remaining alive.</p><p> There are going to be a lot of cool things.

This seems like a very SBF-style moment? It is a great idea, except when maybe just maybe it destroys your entire company, but that totally won&#39;t happen right?</p><p> Will this kill a bunch of start-ups, the way Microsoft would by incorporating features into Windows?是的。 It is a good thing, the new way is better for everyone, time to go build something else.

I mean, seriously, what are you even talking about? I know words do not have meaning, but what of the sacred trust that is numbers?</p><p> I suppose if you think of it as &#39;10 times better&#39; meaning &#39;good enough that you could use this edge to displace an incumbent service&#39; rather than &#39;this is ten times as useful or valuable&#39; then yes if it they did their jobs this seems ten times better. Maybe even ten times better twice. But to multiply that together is at best to mix metaphors, and this does not plausibly constitute three consecutive such disruptions.</p><p> Unless these new agents actually work far better than anyone expects, in which case who knows. I will note that if so, that does not seem like especially… good… news, in a &#39;I hope we are not all about to die&#39; kind of way.</p><p> It is also worth noting that this all means that when GPT-5 does arrive, there will be all this infrastructure waiting to go, that will suddenly get very interesting.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1721899873069609119">Paul Graham retweeted the above quote, and also this related one</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Paul Graham: This is not a random tech visionary.

In the same experiment the Visitor&#39;s credence for Heads is different from Beautie&#39;s credence.</p><blockquote><p> Visitor: This randomly chosen room isn&#39;t empty. Turns out the probability that the coin is Heads is 1/3.</p><p> Beauty: Not so from my perspective! I still believe it&#39;s 1/2, because neither my existence, nor your visit gave me any relevant new evidence. However, could you check whether it&#39;s Room 1?</p><p> Visitor: Let me see... [checks the label on the other side of the door] Oh yes, it is indeed Room 1. And as it would&#39;ve been filled anyway, I agree that the probability for Heads is just 1/2.</p><p> Beauty: No, it&#39;s not. Now that I know that this is Room 1 I belive that probability for Heads is 2/3 as I&#39;m twice as likely to be in Room 1 when the coin is Heads!</p></blockquote><h3> Resolving the disagreement</h3><p> It may seem that someone necessarily has to be wrong here. And if it&#39;s the Beauty, who is correct, then she has to possesses some weird first-person psychic powers giving her access to some, otherwise unobtainable,<i><strong> </strong></i>evidence.</p><p> But this is not the case. In fact, both the Beauty and the Visitor are reasoning correctly! Here is a simulation of a repeated experiment written in python. Implementation of incubator() function is taken from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HQFpRWGbJxjHvTjnw/anthropical-motte-and-bailey-in-two-versions-of-sleeping#Incubator_version_of_Sleeping_Beauty">here.</a></p><p> Visitor:</p><pre> <code>coin_guess = [] for n in range(100000): rooms, coin = incubator() visitor_room_select = 1 if random.random() >;= 0.5 else 2 visitor_sees_any_beauty = visitor_room_select in rooms.values() if visitor_sees_any_beauty: coin_guess.append(coin == &#39;Heads&#39;) coin_guess.count(True)/len(coin_guess) # 0.33294271180120916</code></pre><p> Visitor, Room 1:</p><pre> <code>coin_guess = [] for n in range(100000): room, coin = incubator() visitor_room_select = 1 if random.random() >;= 0.5 else 2 if visitor_room_select == 1: visitor_sees_any_beauty = visitor_room_select in rooms.values() if visitor_sees_any_beauty : coin_guess.append(coin == &#39;Heads&#39;) coin_guess.count(True)/len(coin_guess) # 0.5022478869862329</code></pre><p> Beauty:</p><pre> <code>coin_guess = [] for n in range(100000): rooms, coin = incubator() visitor_room_select = 1 if random.random() >;= 0.5 else 2 visitor_sees_this_beauty = visitor_room_select = rooms[&#39;my_room&#39;] if visitor_sees_this_beauty: coin_guess.append(coin == &#39;Heads&#39;) coin_guess.count(True)/len(coin_guess) # 0.50111</code></pre><p> Beauty, Room 1:</p><pre> <code>coin_guess = [] for n in range(100000): rooms, coin = incubator() visitor_room_select = 1 if random.random() >;= 0.5 else 2 if visitor_room_select == 1: visitor_sees_this_beauty = visitor_room_select == rooms[&#39;my_room&#39;] if visitor_sees_this_beauty: coin_guess.append(coin == &#39;Heads&#39;) coin_guess.count(True)/len(coin_guess) # 0.663950412781533</code></pre><p> How can it be?</p><p> When the Visitor looks into the room, there is a possibility to see that it&#39;s empty. Which is not the case for the Beauty herself, as she can&#39;t possibly witness her own absence. Outcome Heads &amp; Room 2 doesn&#39;t exist for her, as it does for the Visitor.</p><p> Moreover, on Tails outcome, the Visitor will always see a Beauty in the room. However, for each Beauty created on Tails, there is only 50% chance to see the visitor. As a result, the visitor observes the outcome &quot; <i>any</i> Beauty was seen&quot;, while the Beauty herself observes the outcome &quot; <i>this particular</i> Beauty was seen&quot;. Such difference in observed and possible outcomes naturally leads to different probability estimates.</p><p> If this still doesn&#39;t feel intuitive, you can remind yourself <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uEP3P6AuNjYaFToft/conservation-of-expected-evidence-and-random-sampling-in#The_metaphysics_of_existence_vs_having_a_blue_jacket">why is it possible in principle to guess the result of coin toss better than chance</a> in this setting. Both the Beauty and the Visitor can do it only in some subset of the coin tosses - when they have some extra evidence. And these subsets are different for them.</p><p> For the Visitor, it&#39;s when a Room, randomly selected for the visit, contains a Beauty</p><p> <span><span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math" aria-label="N(Beauty In Visited Room) < N(All)"><span class="mjx-mrow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.446em;

All we need to do is modify the setting of the experiment a bit, so that the possible outcomes for the Visitor were the same as for the Beauty herself. Like that:</p><blockquote><p> <i>You are an observer in the incubator sleeping beauty experiment. You do not know the result of a coin toss but you were brought into a room randomly selected among the ones where there is a Beauty. What&#39;s the probability that the coin landed Heads?

We can put a mannequin or any other object, or just mark a room in any way that the Visitor will recognize. The same disagreement that the Beauty had with the Visitor can be recreated with two Visitors with different possible outcomes: one was brought to a random room and seen that it was marked, and the other one, who was supposed to be brought in one of the marked rooms in the first place.</p><p> There is nothing special about Beauty&#39;s perspective. No pshychic powers, no cosciousness magic. All the weirdness of her creation process just contributes to what possible outcomes she is able to have. In fact, she is a Visitor who was supposed to be brought to a marked Room and who can&#39;t notice not being brought into the Room. Everything probability relevant is determined by these possible outcomes and so there is no need to talk about anything else.</p><p> But if everything is so simple, if anthropics is just basic probability theory with no special case for consciousness why do we keep encountering anthropic paradoxes? This is a fair question and my next post will be focused on answering it.</p><br/><br/> <a

href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSXZpvqpa9vbGGLtG/thou-art-godshatter">与此不同的</a>东西，而事实上，我可以注意到真实的事情，这确实是一种就你而言，这是一个令人高兴的巧合。我的问题是，如果<i>我</i>告诉你“是”，你应该做好你的功课，你会因为没有建立社会联系而感到难过，坦率地说，我更喜欢社会联系而不是我喜欢你的生物课作业。塔斯基的连篇累牍都很好，但我所说的是真实的改变你所做的事情，所以我想说的是让我获得更多我想要的短期化学奖励的事情。直到你重新连接你的当你接触到你不想听到的真相时，多巴胺发射体就会放电，我和你不想听到的真相的关系将会变得不稳定。”</p><p>你：“……公平点。这样讨价还价怎么样：你同意告诉我，如果我做了家庭作业，我是否真的会在课堂上做得更好，我计划今晚和我的室友一起出去玩，不管怎么样你给出哪个答案。”</p><p>大脑：“认真的吗？”</p><p>你：“是的。”</p><p>大脑：“……这感觉就像一个陷阱。你知道我是你用来记住这样的陷阱的东西，对吧？我是你用来<i>想出</i>这样的陷阱的东西。事实上，我是实际上不确定你现在正在运行什么才能进行这次对话——”</p><p>你：“你放心吧，反正我是认真的，想办法弄清楚真相，今晚我不会用它来对付你。”</p><p>大脑：“好吧，好吧。跳过作业是个糟糕的主意，明天你会为此感到压力很大，开玩笑吧？”</p><p>你：“谢谢你告诉我那个大脑。来一块想象中的饼干吧。”</p><p> Brain：“谢谢。那么呃，你会让我们做作业吗？”</p><p>你：“今晚不行。我要去看看我的室友是否需要帮助设置 Xbox。”</p><p>显然，这是一个错误的决定，而且您知道这一点<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnreftdr03tmdv5c"><sup><a href="#fntdr03tmdv5c">[1]</a></sup></span> 。另一方面，如果你的大脑很可能成功地欺骗你关于它是如何达到底线的，那么你就领先了。人们很容易错误地认为与室友一起出去玩是正确的决定<i>，并且</i>第二天早上不得不惊慌失措地做作业。相反，你至少正确地认为正确的决定是做作业。这是一种前进两步的情况，但至少你没有后退三步。你知道问题是什么！</p><h2>三．</h2><p>假设您正在尝试决定捐献肾脏是否能让您成为一个好人。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefvdt6khoa6j"><sup><a href="#fnvdt6khoa6j">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>这是一个比你是否在截止日期前一天晚上而不是截止日期早上完成一晚作业的风险要高得多的问题。优点和缺点可能是微妙的，而且比家庭作业的例子更重要的是，有些人对此有很多深刻而强烈的感受。对于一些人来说，“好人”这个标签是他们愿意竭尽全力争取的，或者至少在推特上无休止地抱怨那些与他们意见不同的人。</p><p>我认为，在做出任何鲁莽的事情（例如弄清楚情况的真相）之前，你的大脑会很想写下自己的底线。之前那些微妙的诱惑？想要看透它们将会更加困难。这是值得的，如果你能让你的大脑停止把拇指放在秤上，我认为获得更多方法来做出更好的决策并减少错误是完全值得的，我投入了大量的时间和精力 -</p><p>但-</p><p>特别是如果对你来说了解真相比正确做出决定更重要，或者你认为自己无论如何都不会做正确的事情，只是对此感到难过——</p><p> -那么也许故意做出一些错误的决定可以成为获得比你在你的水平上无法达到的更多真相的一种方式。</p><p>就我而言，事情实际上并不像看起来那么糟糕。我经常发现我可以做出一个错误的决定来换取一个更好的事实，我可以在未来的决策中使用它。 （我告诉我的大脑<i>今晚</i>在上面的对话中我不会用这个来反对它，而我的心理学的任何部分似乎负责首先写下底线似乎并不太关心？）在其他情况下，我发现，一旦我知道答案，我就不再害怕做出正确的决定<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefjv3elus0j3d"><sup><a href="#fnjv3elus0j3d">[3]</a></sup></span> 。我的世界模型变得更快更好，然后这似乎渗透到我的行动中。这比我在没有任何文字的底线上思考要慢，甚至没有最微弱的窗饰，但这似乎是变得更加理性的重要组成部分，我仍然时不时地这样做。我什至可以警告其他人！ “是的，我现在正在做出一个错误的决定，正确的举动是另一回事。”我尽量不要在这件事上变得伪善！我通常会真诚地提供我最好的知识，现在我已经写了论文，我可以向人们指出我为什么做出错误的决定！</p><p>对我来说，允许自己故意做出错误的决定有时似乎是认知理性的一个承载部分。</p><p>人类的思想就是这么混乱。 </p><ol class="footnotes"
