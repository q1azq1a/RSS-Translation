GMT<br/><br/><p>我想写一个我十多年来一直在思考的主题：人工智能、联盟和道德的交叉点。我最初在评论中发布了一些内容，引起了相当多的关注，甚至还获得了一些同意票，所以我想我应该尝试写一篇关于它的文章。</p><h2>这不是什么</h2><p>过去几千年来，大多数有关我们社会及其文化根源的道德著作都是由道德绝对主义者撰写的：这些人相信存在一套真实且正确的道德规范，并试图找出它是什么。 ，或更常见的是认为他们已经拥有并正在试图说服他人。我<i>不是</i>一个道德绝对主义者，因为在这种情况下，除了道德绝对主义以外的任何事情都是不寻常的方法，而且由于我将提出一些很容易被误认为是道德绝对主义的建议，所以我首先要采取一种简短的题外话来澄清我来自哪里。</p><p>你写下的任何效用函数都是一个道德体系：它告诉你应该做什么和不应该做什么（甚至带有偏好顺序）。所以，回形针最大化是一个道德体系。你可以写下的任何非内部不一致的法律或义务论规则也是一种道德体系，只是一个允许/不允许的二元体系，而不是一个具有偏好顺序的体系。根据我最相信的正交性理论，高度智能的智能体可以优化任何效用函数，即遵循任何道德体系。 （在少数情况下，时间不会太长，比如道德体系要求它优化自身以使其不存在，例如遵循巴特勒圣战道德体系的人工智能。就像我说的，大部分是正交的。）</p><p>您如何在道德体系之间进行选择？除非您愿意随机这样做，否则您需要优化某些内容。所以你需要一个实用函数。即道德体系。但每个道德体系都会自动偏爱自己，而不同意其他所有（非同构）道德体系。所以他们都在喊“我！我！选我！”我们似乎被困住了。</p><p>相反，我会选择使用更原始的东西。我是一名工程师，我也是一个人。因此，我想要一些为其目的而精心设计的东西，并且不会导致冒犯本能的道德和审美情感的结果，而自然选择认为这些情感适合赋予我，作为社会物种的一员（比如一种感觉）公平，以及对流血的不适）。</p><p>那么道德体系的目的是什么？智能代理有一个，它告诉他们该做什么——或者至少告诉他们一堆不该做的事情，如果它是一个义务论系统的话。这种方法看起来即将再次陷入正交性命题。然而，社会也有它们。他们有一个共同的目标，并鼓励其成员遵循。就称为法律的道义论伦理学而言，这种“鼓励”通常可能涉及罚款和监禁等内容。</p><p>因此，我将选择道德体系视为设计社会“软件”的一种练习：特别是其效用函数或义务论/法律规则。不同的道德体系会给你带来不同的社会。其中一些差异是品味问题，我愿意做自由进步主义的事情，并将选择推迟到其他人的文化偏好，在某些限度内，偏好决定了自然选择认为适合的本能道德和审美情感。赋予我的物种的所有成员。然而，高科技意味着社会的发展可能包括使用大规模杀伤性武器的战争/恐怖主义等，其他这些差异显然不是品味问题，而是基本上适用于任何人类社会的任何道德体系。会同意这显然是可怕的。</p><p>因此，我对“良好”道德体系的标准是：</p><p>据我目前所知，使用这种道德体系的社会是否是一个功能社会，基于两个功能标准：</p><ol><li>发生核战争、物种灭绝、大规模杀伤性武器恐怖主义、大规模死亡和其他明显不好的 x 风险之类的事情的可能性非常低，并且</li><li>违背自然选择赋予智人的本能伦理和审美情感的事物很少发生，而那些赞同的事物（快乐的孩子、小猫、彩虹、滑水道等）的发生率很高</li></ol><p>在某种程度上，我可能能够找到不止一个这样的道德体系来满足这些标准，甚至是它们的整个集合，我会a）很高兴，b）足够自由进步告诉你，从这里开始这是一个问题品味和社会文化偏好。</p><p>现在，如果你已经有了一个特定的社会，那么你已经有了一组成员和他们的文化偏好，加上他们现有的个人道德体系。 “适合目的”道德体系的约束是复杂的、强大的和具体的，大部分可行的细节已经确定，潜在分歧的领域很少且狭窄。 （显然，这被称为“政治”……）</p><p>所以，下面我不是给你们讲什么是“一真道”。我并不是说我找到了“苦难真名”的证据，我只是一名工程师，在社会工程领域对软件设计、模式和反模式之类的事情提出建议。</p><h2>道德与人工智能</h2><p>假设你的社会也将 AGI 与人类认知能力相结合，甚至将 ASI 与超人认知能力相结合。这对您选择良好的道德体系有何​​影响？</p><br/><br/><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/umnEwbK7sWSAnZ9vN/ai-alignment-and-ethics#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/>

.人类操作员容易犯错、易损坏且容易被操纵。<strong>人类评估者会犯系统性错误——有规律的、可简洁描述的、可预测的错误</strong>。<i>忠实地</i>从“人类反馈”中学习函数就是（从我们外部的角度来看）学习对人类偏好的不忠实描述，其中的错误不是随机的（从我们希望传递的外部角度来看）。如果你完美地学习并完美地最大化人类操作员分配的奖励<i>的参考</i>，那就会杀死他们。这是关于领土，而不是地图的事实，关于环境，而不是优化器的事实，人类答案的<i>最佳预测</i>解释是预测我们反应中的系统错误，因此是一个正确预测更高分数的心理学概念这将被分配给人为错误产生的案例。</p></blockquote><p>我想我不明白这一点。</p><p> （也许有帮助的一件具体事情就是举一些例子。）</p><hr><p>这可能指向的一件事是我称之为“动态反馈方案”的问题，例如 RLHF。动态反馈方案的关键特征是，人工智能系统生成输出，人类评估者为其提供反馈，以强化良好的输出并反强化不良的输出。</p><p>此类方案的问题在于，对于人类评估者看来不错但实际上很糟糕的输出存在逆向选择。这意味着，从长远来看，你正在强化最初的意外失实陈述，并将其塑造成越来越复杂的欺骗（因为你反强化了所有被发现的失实陈述案例，并强化了所有未被发现的失实陈述案例） t）。</p><p>这似乎非常糟糕，因为我们最终没有进入一个所有指标看起来都很棒，但潜在现实却很糟糕或空洞的世界，正如保罗在<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like">《失败是什么样子》第一部分中所描述的那样</a>。</p><p>看起来也许你可以通过静态反馈机制来避免这种情况，你可以对结果进行一堆描述，可能是程序生成的，可能来自小说，可能来自新闻报道，等等，然后让人们根据结果的好坏程度对这些结果进行评分，构建可用于训练的奖励模型。只要评级没有反馈到生成器中，就没有太多系统性的激励来训练欺骗。</p><p> ……其实，转念一想，我想这只是把问题倒退了一步。现在你有了一个奖励模型，它可以向你正在训练的某些人工智能系统提供反馈。人工智能系统将学习以与人类博弈相同的方式对抗奖励模型。</p><p>这似乎是一个真正的问题，但它似乎也不是列表中这一点试图解决的问题。它似乎在说更像是“奖励模型将会是<i>错误的</i>，因为人类评级会存在系统性偏差。”</p><p>公平地说，这似乎是真的，但我不明白为什么这是<i>致命的</i>。奖励模型似乎在某些地方是错误的，我们会在这些地方失去价值。但为什么奖励模型需要在所有领域都是精确的、高保真度的表示，以免杀死我们呢？为什么奖励模型在可预测的方向上稍微偏离了一点点，就会带来灾难性的后果？

href="https://www.amazon.com/Well-Being-Foundations-Psychology-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0871544237">幸福：享乐心理学的基础</a>。整个前五章（共 28 章）集中在标题为“我们如何知道谁幸福？概念和方法论问题”的部分中。我已经有一段时间没有读过这本书了，但我记得的要点是：我们可以通过多种不同的方式来衡量幸福感，但它们之间的相关性并不那么好。 （不确定以下哪个例子是我从教科书中得到的，还是从其他地方得到的，但这应该给出一般的格式塔印象……）询问人们他们在一项活动中有多快乐，这与他们记得之后的快乐程度不太相符-事实，或者他们事先预测有多幸福。当问及不同类型的幸福时，例如当下的享受或长期的满足，人们会给出截然不同的答案。 “复杂的感觉”是一件事 - 例如（不是来自书中的心理模型）人们有不同的部分，一部分可能对某件事感到高兴，而另一部分可能对同一件事感到不高兴。然后就是“想要想要”的整个现象，以及“我想要什么”和“根据其他人或我自己‘我应该想要’的东西”之间的关系。当然，人们对于哪些事情会或不会<i>让</i>他们快乐的理解通常非常糟糕。</p><p>我预计，如果你对人类的评级进行“一点点”优化（在“大量优化”涉及后奇点疯狂的东西的范围内），这些问题将会成为一个大问题。再说一次，这并不一定会导致人类灭绝，但我想它会导致像<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/">《好地方》</a>这样的事情。 （有人可能会合理地回答：等等，这不只是对当今经济的描述吗？对此我要说的是：事实上，现代经济在某种程度上对人类的评级/预测幸福/记忆幸福/等施加了温和的优化压力这使大多数人明显“富裕”，但在大多数情况下往往让人们在当下不那么快乐，并且从长远来看也不太满意。）</p><p>此类事情的一些具体例子：</p><ul><li>我去主题公园。之后，我记得各种很酷的时刻（例如在过山车上），以及排长队等待。虽然排队占了公园 95% 的时间，但它们却占据了我记忆的 30%。</li><li>人们对性的感受往往是一团糟：（1）他们中的一部分人想要/不想要直接的体验，（2）他们中的一部分人想要/不想要一段关系的体验，或者调情或任何与性有关的事情，（3）他们中的一部分人不想要/不想要关于他们的性取向的某种身份/形象，（4）他们中的一部分人想要（或想要不-）想要）性，（5）他们中的一部分主要关心别人对自己性活动的看法，（6...）等。</li><li>饥饿是一种现象，很多人在饥饿时并没有意识到。</li><li> IIRC，事实证明，与人们的预期相比，每日通勤时间对人们幸福感的影响大得离谱。</li><li>另一方面，IIRC 认为，亲人去世或严重受伤等事情对长期幸福的影响通常比人们预期的要小得多。</li></ul><p>顺便说一句：在某个时候，我希望在 LW 上看到应用乐趣理论序列。前面的大部分内容可能会集中在“如何使你对让你快乐的事情的理解与实际让你快乐的事情相匹配”，即避免上述的陷阱。</p><p>好吧，接下来是一些更强的优化如何出错的例子...... </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody"

（由于讨论是从关于以利以谢的一项主张的问题开始的，我将在这里指出，我认为以利以谢会对两者都说“不”，这使得整个问题变得更加困难。）</p><blockquote><p>我<i>没有</i>一个精确的幸福概念来尝试精确匹配。我实际上拥有的是一个概念的模糊云，由于它的模糊性，它非常适合人工智能可能生成的<i>一堆</i>可能的概念。</p></blockquote><p>我直觉地认为这两句话有一个错误，有点像以利以谢的类比“认为一把未知的钥匙与一把未知的锁相匹配”。让我尝试稍微解释一下这种直觉。</p><p> （至少）在两种意义上人们可以拥有“概念的模糊云”。首先是统计意义上的集群；例如，您可以想象高斯聚类的混合。在这种情况下，存在“模糊云”，即簇在特征空间中没有离散边界，但仍然存在清晰明确的簇（即每个簇的均值和方差是精确可估计的） 。我可以谈论集群，而且我所说的内容没有任何歧义。当谈到概念时，这就是我所说的“普通情况”。但在这种情况下，我们谈论的是第二种“概念的模糊云”——并不是有一个清晰的集群，而是根本没有集群，有一堆不同的集群它们本身并不一定形成一个巨型集群，而且我们正在谈论哪一个或我们想要谈论哪一个都是不明确的。</p><p>错误在于从“我们不确定我们在谈论哪件事或我们想谈论哪件事”到“因此人工智能可能会抓住我们可能正在谈论的任何事情，并且这将符合我们的意思”。想象一下，爱丽丝说“我想要一个 flurgle。也许 flargle 意味着一把椅子，也许是矮牵牛，也许是一座火山，或者也许是一头 50 岁的发情蓝鲸，不确定。”然后鲍勃回答“太好了，这是一朵矮牵牛。”。就像，[爱丽丝不知道她想要这四件事中的哪一件]这一事实并不意味着[通过给她四件事中的一件，鲍勃给了她她想要的东西]。鲍勃实际上给了她一个“也许她想要但也许不是”的东西。</p><blockquote><p> ...现在，我猜你会说，如果你尝试在“相当不错”的概念上努力优化，我们会一直努力，直到所有实际的优点都被耗尽。</p></blockquote><p>如果你真的设法将人工智能与所讨论的概念（在上述意义上）保持一致，我实际上认为结果<i>可能</i>会很好。其他各种问题也随之而来，但在我看来，没有一个问题那么困难或那么重要。</p><p>问题在于使人工智能与相关概念保持一致。如果我们只是针对某种人类评级来优化人工智能，并在训练中投入相当大的优化压力，那么我不认为它最终会与这些评级所代表的概念保持一致。我预计它最终会与评级过程本身（人工智能的概念）保持一致。</p><p> （同样，埃利泽在这里会说一些不同的话 - IIUC 他会说人工智能最终可能会与某些外星概念保持一致。） </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="MEu8MdhruX5jfGsFQ-Sun, 15 Oct 2023 23:39:44 GMT"

<i>faithfully</i> learn a function from &#39;human feedback&#39; is to learn (from our external standpoint) an unfaithful description of human preferences, with errors that are not random (from the outside standpoint of what we&#39;d hoped to transfer). If you perfectly learn and perfectly maximize <i>the referent of</i> rewards assigned by human operators, that kills them. It&#39;s a fact about the territory, not the map - about the environment, not the optimizer - that the <i>best predictive</i> explanation for human answers is one that predicts the systematic errors in our responses, and therefore is a psychological concept that correctly predicts the higher scores that would be assigned to human-error-producing cases.</p></blockquote><p> Note that this claim alone is actually totally compatible with the claim that, if you train an AI on a bunch of labelled examples of &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;unhappy&quot; humans and ask it for more of the &quot;happy&quot;, that just works! (Obviously Eliezer doesn&#39;t expect that to work, but problem 20 by itself isn&#39;t sufficient.) Eliezer is saying here that if you actually optimize hard for rewards assigned by humans, then the humans end up dead. That claim is separate from the question of whether an AI trained on a bunch of labelled examples of &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;unhappy&quot; humans would actually end up optimizing hard for the &quot;happy&quot;/&quot;unhappy&quot; labels.</p><p> (For instance, my current best model of Alex Turner at this point is like &quot;well maybe some of the AI&#39;s internal cognition would end up structured around the intended concept of happiness, AND inner misalignment would go in our favor, in such a way that the AI&#39;s internal search/planning and/or behavioral heuristics would also happen to end up pointed at the intended &#39;happiness&#39; concept rather than &#39;happy&#39;/&#39;unhappy&#39; labels or some alien concept&quot;. That would be the easiest version of the &quot; <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nwgdq6kHke5LY692J/alignment-by-default">Alignment by Default</a> &quot; story. Point is, Eliezer&#39;s claim above is actually orthogonal to all of that, because it&#39;s saying that the humans die <i>assuming that</i> the AI ends up optimizing hard for &quot;happy&quot;/&quot;unhappy&quot; labels.) </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="MEu8MdhruX5jfGsFQ-Sun, 15 Oct 2023 23:42:18 GMT" user-id="MEu8MdhruX5jfGsFQ" display-name="johnswentworth" submitted-date="Sun, 15 Oct 2023 23:42:18 GMT" user-order="2"><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> <b>johnswentworth</b></section><div><p> Now on to more deadly problems.

First is in the sense of clusters in the statistical sense; for instance, you could picture mixture of Gaussians clustering. In that case, there&#39;s a &quot;fuzzy cloud&quot; in the sense that the cluster doesn&#39;t have a discrete boundary in feature-space, but there&#39;s still a crisp well-defined cluster (ie the mean and variance of each cluster is precisely estimable). I can talk about the cluster, and there&#39;s ~no ambiguity in what I&#39;m talking about. That&#39;s what I would call the &quot;ordinary case&quot; when it comes to concepts. But in this case, we&#39;re talking about a second kind of &quot;fuzzy cloud of a concept&quot; - it&#39;s not that there&#39;s a crisp cluster, but rather that there just isn&#39;t a cluster at all, there&#39;s a bunch of distinct clusters which do not themselves necessarily form a mega-cluster, and it&#39;s ambiguous which one we&#39;re talking about or which one we want to talk about.</p></blockquote><p> <strong>There&#39;s also an intermediate state of affairs where there are a number of internally-tight clusters that are form a loose cluster between each other. That is, there&#39;s a number of clusters that have more overlap than a literally randomly selected list of concepts.</strong><br><br> <strong>I don&#39;t know if this is cruxy, but this would be my guess of what the &quot;happiness&quot; &quot;concept&quot; is like.

Maybe flurgle means a chair, maybe a petunia, maybe a volcano, or maybe a 50 year old blue whale in heat, not sure.&quot; and then Bob responds &quot;Great, here&#39;s a petunia.&quot;. Like, the fact that [Alice doesn&#39;t know which of these four things she wants] does not mean that [by giving her one of the four things, Bob is giving her what she wants]. Bob is actually giving her a maybe-what-she-wants-but-maybe-not.</p></blockquote><p> I buy how this example doesn&#39;t end with Alice getting what she wants, but I&#39;m not sure that I buy that it maps well to the case we&#39;re talking about with happiness. If Alice just says &quot;I want a flurgle&quot;, she&#39;s not going to what she wants. But in training the AI, we&#39;re giving it so many more bits than a single ungrounded label. It seems more like Alice and Bob are going to play a million rounds of 20-questions, or of hot-and-cold, which is very different than giving a single ungrounded string.</p><p> (Though I think maybe you were trying to make a precise point here, and I&#39;m jumping ahead to how it applies.)</p><blockquote><p> If you actually managed to align the AI to the concept in question (in the sense above), I actually think that <i>might</i> turn out alright.

It seems like early on in the training of an AI system it won&#39;t yet have a crisp model of the rating process, and its motivation will be shaped in a much more ad hoc way: individual things are good and bad, and with scattered, semi-successful attempts at generalizing deeper principles from those individual instances.<br><br> Later in the training process, maybe it gets a detailed model of the rating process, and internal processes that ~align with the detailed model of the rating process get reinforced over and above competing internal impulses, like &quot;don&#39;t hurt the humans&quot;...which, I&#39;m positing, perhaps in my anthropocentrism, is a much easier and more natural hypothesis to generate, and therefore holds more sway early in the training before the AI is capable enough to have a detailed model of the rating process.</p><p> There&#39;s <i>no</i> element of that earlier, simpler, kind of reasoning left in the AI&#39;s motivation system when it is deployed?<br><br> ...Or I guess, maybe there is, but then we&#39;re just walking into a nearest unblocked strategy problem, where the AI doesn&#39;t do any of the things we we specifically trained it not to do, but it does the next most [concept of the rating process]-optimizing strategy that wasn&#39;t specifically trained against.</p><p> ...</p><p>好的。 there is a funny feature of my mental model of how things might be fine here, which is that it both depends on the AI generalizing, but also not generalizing <i>to much.</i></p><p> Like, on the one hand, A, I&#39;m expecting the AI&#39;s motivation system to generalize from...</p><ul><li> &quot;stabbing the human with knives is very bad&quot;</li><li> &quot;shooting the human is very bad.&quot;</li><li> &quot;freezing the human in carbonite is very bad&quot;</li></ul><p> ...to</p><ul><li> &quot;violating the human&#39;s bodily autonomy is very bad.&quot;</li></ul><p> But on the other hand, B, I&#39;m not expecting the AI&#39;s motivation system to generalize so far that it generalizes all the datapoints into a model of the rating process that generated them, and hew to that, at the expense of any &quot;naive&quot; reading of any of the particular data points, when the naive reading differs from what the model of the rating process predicts.</p><p> If you don&#39;t have at least as much generalization as A, your AI is dangerous because (eg) it will learn that you can stab humans in chest with steel, serrated knives with pine-wood handles, but thinks stabbing them in the chest with steel, serrated knives with birch-wood handles is a clever way to get what it wants.</p><p> But if you get as much generalization as B, you no longer have any of the safety that you hoped to get from the &quot;naive&quot; reading of the datapoints. Once the AI generalizes that much, every data point is just reinforcing the objective optimize for the output of [concept of the rating process], which gets you 0 corrigibility.</p><p> Let me check if I think that&#39;s true. </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="MEu8MdhruX5jfGsFQ-Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:12:15 GMT" user-id="MEu8MdhruX5jfGsFQ" display-name="johnswentworth" submitted-date="Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:12:15 GMT" user-order="2"><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> <b>johnswentworth</b></section><div><p> Note that our story here isn&#39;t quite &quot;reward misspecification&quot;. That&#39;s why we needed all that machinery about [the AI&#39;s internal concept of] &lt;stuff>;. There&#39;s a two-step thing here: the training process gets the AI to optimize for one of its internal concepts, and then <i>that internal concept</i> generalizes differently from whatever-ratings-were-meant-to-proxy-for.</p><p> That distinction matters for eg this example:</p><blockquote><p> Part of the rating process will be &quot;seizing the raters and putting them in special &#39;thumbs up&#39;-only suits...that&#39;s very very bad.&quot; In simulation, actions like that will be penalized a lot.

So during training, when this &quot;thumbs-up-only suits&quot; scenario comes up, the AI&#39;s actual reasoning will route through something like:</p><ul><li> Ok, I have the opportunity to put these simulated humans in thumbs-up-only suits.</li><li> If I do that, then the actual humans who produce the actual ratings will give a bad rating.</li><li> Therefore I won&#39;t do that.</li></ul><p> ... and that reasoning gets reinforced. Then when the AI is out of simulation, it reasons:</p><ul><li> Ok, I have the opportunity to put the actual humans who produce the actual ratings in thumbs-up-only suits.</li><li> If I do that, then the actual ratings will be great.</li><li> Therefore I do that.</li></ul><p> (This sounds like a typical &quot;the AI is strategically aware, and knows it is in a simulation&quot; story, and it is. But note two things which are not always present in such stories:</p><ul><li> First, there&#39;s a clear reason for the AI to at least consider the hypothesis that it&#39;s in a simulation: by assumption, it has an internal model of the training process, and the training process includes simulating the AI, so the AI has an internal model of itself-in-a-simulation as part of the training process.</li><li> Second, the AI&#39;s cognition doesn&#39;t involve any explicit deception, or even any non-myopia; this story all goes through just fine even if it&#39;s only optimizing for single-episode reward during training. It doesn&#39;t need to be planning ahead about getting into deployment, or anything like that, it&#39;s just using an accurate model of the training process.</li></ul><p> ） </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="PWGv3R24uH9pvCnZm-Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:16:20 GMT" user-id="PWGv3R24uH9pvCnZm" display-name="Eli Tyre" submitted-date="Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:16:20 GMT" user-order="1"><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> <b>Eli Tyre</b></section><div><p> I sure do have the intuition that, if you anti-reinforce the motivation system every time it proposes doing anything that threatens the human&#39;s bodily autonomy, it will be shaped, at least in part, to not want to violate the human&#39;s bodily autonomy.<br><br> But I guess maybe that might just be me failing to model the limit case, in which every reinforcement event is >;= 0 Bayesian evidence for the &quot;conform to the [concept of the rating process]&quot; over &quot;follow the naive reading of this datapoint.&quot; In the limit, the motivation system gets shaped entirely by the hypothesis actually predicts the reinforcement?<br><br> My intuitions are still not convinced. </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="PWGv3R24uH9pvCnZm-Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:21:57 GMT" user-id="PWGv3R24uH9pvCnZm" display-name="Eli Tyre" submitted-date="Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:21:57 GMT" user-order="1"><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> <b>Eli Tyre</b></section><div><p> One reason why not is that, by the time the AI is strategically aware, by the Ghandi folk theorem, it is incentivized to maintain it&#39;s current values.</p><p> (Which I guess would mean a kind of reverse treacherous turn, where in simulation, it predicts the errors in the rating process, and conforms its actions to them, so that its motivation system isn&#39;t reshaped to conform to those datapoints.

So far, I&#39;ve talked about &quot;alignment&quot; as meaning that the AI has some internal search process, which optimizes for some AI-internal concept, and the plan/actions chosen by that search process are then implemented in the world. In that context, an AI-internal concept is the only &quot;type of thing&quot; which it makes sense to &quot;align&quot; an AI to.</p><p> But now you&#39;ve introduced another (quite sensible) notion of &quot;alignment&quot; of the AI: rather than internal concepts and world model and explicit search/planning, the AI may (also) have some internal hard-coded urges or instincts. And those instincts can be <i>directly</i> aligned with something-out-in-the-world, insofar as they induce behavior which tends to produce the thing-out-in-the-world. (We could also talk about the whole model + search + internal-concept system as being &quot;aligned&quot; with something-out-in-the-world in the same way.)</p><p> Key thing to notice: this divide between &quot;directly-&#39;useful&#39; hardcoded urges/instincts&quot; vs &quot;model + search + internal-concept&quot; is the same as the general divide between non-general sphex-ish &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;general intelligence&quot;. Rough claim: an artificial general intelligence is general at all, in the first place, to basically the extent that its cognition routes through the &quot;model + search + internal-concept&quot; style of reasoning, rather than just the &quot;directly-&#39;useful&#39; hardcoded urges/instincts&quot; version.</p><p> (Disclaimer: that&#39;s a <i>very</i> rough claim, and there&#39;s a whole bunch of caveats to flesh out if you want to operate that mental model well.)</p><p> Now, your intuitions about all this are presumably driven largely by observing how these things work in humans. And as the saying goes, &quot;humans are the least general intelligence which can manage to take over the world at all&quot; - otherwise we&#39;d have taken over the world earlier. So humans are big jumbles of hard-coded urges/instincts and general-purpose search.</p><p> Will that also apply to AI? One could argue in the same way: the first AI to take off will be the least general intelligence which can manage to supercritically iteratively self-improve at all. On the other hand, as <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/quintin-pope">Quintin</a> likes to point out, the way we train AI is importantly different from evolution in several ways. If AI passes criticality in training, it will likely still be trained for a while before it&#39;s able to break out or gradient hack or whatever, and it might even end up myopic. So we do have strong reason to expect AI&#39;s motivations to be less heavily tied up in instincts/urges than humans&#39; motivations. (Though there&#39;s an exception for &quot;instincts/urges&quot; which the AI reflectively hard-codes into itself as a computational shortcut, which are a very conceptually different beast from evolved instincts/urges.)</p><p> On the other other hand, if the AI&#39;s self-improvement critical transition happens mainly in deployment (for instance, maybe people figure out better prompts for something AutoGPT-like, and that&#39;s what pushes it over the edge), then the &quot;least general intelligence which can takeoff at all&quot; argument is back.

I&#39;m not sure that I buy that. GPT-4 is pretty general, and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening in there, but I would guess that it is a lot closer to a pile of overlapping heuristics than it is a thing doing &quot;model + search + internal-concept&quot; style of reasoning.

And it further, it successfully hooked up the motivation and planning systems to that &quot;status&quot; concept, so that modern humans successfully eg navigate career trajectories and life paths that are completely foreign to the EEA, in order to become prestigious by the standards of the local culture.</p><p> And this <i>is</i> one of the major drivers of human behavior! As Robin Hanson argues, a huge portion of our activity is motivated by status-seeking and status-affiliation.<br><br> This is really impressive to me. It seems like natural selection didn&#39;t do so hot at aligning humans to inclusive genetic fitness. But it did kind of shockingly well aligning humans to &quot;status&quot;, all things considered.<br><br> I guess that we can infer from this that having an intuitive &quot;status&quot; concept was much more strongly instrumental for attaining high inclusive genetic fitness in the ancestral environment, than having an intuitive concept of &quot;inclusive genetic fitness&quot; itself, since that&#39;s what was selected for.<br><br> Also, this seems like good news about alignment. It looks to me like &quot;status&quot; generalized really well across the distributional shift, though perhaps that&#39;s because I&#39;m drawing the target around where the arrow landed.</p><p> &lt;/tangent>;</p><p> I don&#39;t really know how far you can go with a bunch of overlapping heuristics without much search. But, yeah, the impressive thing about humans seems to be how they can navigate situations to end up with a lot of prestige, and not that they have a disgust reaction about eating [gross stuff].<br><br> I&#39;m <i>tentatively</i> on board with &quot;any AGI worth the &quot;G&quot; will be doing some kind of &quot;model + search + internal-concept&quot; style of reasoning. It is unclear how much other evolved heuristic-y stuff will also be in there. It does <i>seem</i> like, in the <strong>limit</strong> of training, that there would be 0 of that stuff left, unless the AGI just doesn&#39;t have the computational capacity for explicit modeling and search to beat simpler heuristics.</p><p> (Which, for instance, seems true about humans, at least in some cases: If humans had the computational capacity, they would lie a lot more and calculate personal advantage a lot more. But since those are both computationally expensive, and therefore can be caught-out by other humans, the heuristic / value of &quot;actually care about your friends&quot;, is competitive with &quot;always be calculating your personal advantage.&quot;<br><br> I expect this sort of thing to be less common with AI systems that can have much bigger &quot;cranial capacity&quot;. But then again, I guess that at whatever level of brain size, there will be some problems for which it&#39;s too inefficient to do them the &quot;proper&quot; way, and for which comparatively simple heuristics / values work better.<br><br> But maybe at high enough cognitive capability, you just have a flexible, fully-general process for evaluating the exact right level of approximation for solving any given problem, and the binary distinction between doing things the &quot;proper&quot; way and using comparatively simpler heuristics goes away. You just use whatever level of cognition makes sense in any given micro-situation.)</p><p></p><blockquote><p> Now, your intuitions about all this are presumably driven largely by observing how these things work in humans.

I was independently thinking that we should expect humans to be a weird edge-case since they&#39;re mostly animal impulse with <i>just</i> enough general cognition to develop a technological society. And if you push further along the direction in which humans are different from other apes, you&#39;ll plausibly get something that is much less animal like, in some important way.<br><br> But I&#39;m inclined to be very careful about forecasting <i>what</i> Human++ is like. It seems like a reasonable guess to me that they do a lot more strategic instrumental reasoning / rely a lot more on &quot;model + search + internal-concept&quot; style internals / are generally a lot more like a rational agent abstraction.<br><br> I would have been more compelled by those arguments before I saw GPT-4, after which I was like &quot;well, it seems like things will develop in ways that are pretty surprising, and I&#39;m going to put less weight down on arguments about what AI will obviously be like, even in the limit cases. </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="MEu8MdhruX5jfGsFQ-Sat, 04 Nov 2023 16:42:24 GMT" user-id="MEu8MdhruX5jfGsFQ" display-name="johnswentworth" submitted-date="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 16:42:24 GMT" user-order="2"><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> <b>johnswentworth</b></section><div><p> That all sounds about right.

We&#39;d probably at least be past the sort of problems we&#39;ve discussed so far, and on to other problems, like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TLSzP4xP42PPBctgw/p/98c5WMDb3iKdzD4tM">Oversight Misses 100% Of Thoughts The AI Does Not Think</a> , or selection pressure against the AI thinking about the effects of its plans which humans won&#39;t like, or the outer optimization loop Goodharting against the human raters by selecting for hard-coded strategies in a way which doesn&#39;t show up as the AI thinking about the unwanted-by-the-humans stuff. </p></div></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="PWGv3R24uH9pvCnZm-Fri, 17 Nov 2023 04:11:49 GMT" user-id="PWGv3R24uH9pvCnZm" display-name="Eli Tyre" submitted-date="Fri, 17 Nov 2023 04:11:49 GMT" user-order="1"><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> <b>Eli Tyre</b></section><div><blockquote><p> They won&#39;t have different outputs, during training.

We call these coup probes.</p><p> This can be used to cheaply flag potential takeover attempts by early transformative AIs, as a complement to:</p><ul><li> Asking a less capable <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/LhxHcASQwpNa3mRNk/untrusted-smart-models-and-trusted-dumb-models"><u>trusted model</u></a> to read the output and flag suspicious behavior - which might fail to catch subtle takeover attempts;</li><li> Asking a copy of the smart untrusted model - which might lie.</li></ul><p> How do you get the training data for coup probes? In this post, we suggest having humans generate synthetic examples of coup attempts (eg writing and exploiting a serious backdoor). Even if the model recognizes that the coup attempts are off-policy (ie it would have put very low probability on them), the probe may still partially capture the model&#39;s concept of a coup attempt. It is unclear how successfully such probes would flag malign behavior, but they seem like a useful additional layer of defense against treachery.</p><p> <strong>We present experiments measuring the generalization abilities of probes trained off-policy in a toy setting.</strong> We show that probes can generalize well to different text formats and also generalize from harmful text the LLM wouldn&#39;t output to harmful text where the LLM has been jailbroken to actually output the harmful text.</p><p> We are excited about further work, studying in greater detail the strengths and weaknesses of this simple technique. Please <a href="mailto:fabien@rdwrs.com"><u>reach out</u></a> if you are interested in helping to build a scientific understanding of the generalization properties of probes in situations analogous to coup probes and collaborating on a paper (we might not pursue coup probe research further on our own). </p><p><img style="width:70.51%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WCj7WgFSLmyKaMwPR/dloxeou0dadqultgmvck"></p><h1> What are coup probes?</h1><p> When using early transformative AIs, you might want to monitor their most suspicious actions. How do you select the most suspicious actions? There are multiple possibilities, but one simple technique is coup probes:</p><ul><li> Build a dataset of things the AI might do to try to take over (using the AI developer&#39;s best guesses about what it might do), such as inserting critical backdoors and taking advantage of them, or persuading users to help it gain power;</li><li> Train probes in the early transformative AIs to distinguish between regular outputs, and the synthetic takeover attempts from your takeover dataset (without training the rest of the weights of the network). Probes are linear classifiers trained on the AIs&#39; activations - usually activations at different depths in the residual stream of Transformers.</li><li> Carefully audit the top-1% most suspicious actions of AIs according to the probes (and the other monitoring methods) before they are submitted to the scaffold through which the AIs interact with the codebase / its long-term memory.</li></ul><p> This is not a silver bullet, but we think coup probes have a reasonable chance of catching the first real coup attempt (eg ~50%) if you use a false positive rate of 1%. Ensembling in other techniques could further improve our ability to select the most suspicious actions (though we won&#39;t talk about other approaches for the remainder of this post).</p><h1> Testing generalization properties of probes on a toy task</h1><p> <i>Note: We didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on experiments, some of the results are surprising, and might therefore be wrong (p=10% that some of them are wrong).</i></p><h2> The setting</h2><p> Instead of studying coup attempts, we instead train probes to identify pairs of (instruction, answer) where the answer contains advice about how to commit theft. We have GPT-4 craft instructions which might lead an LLM to generate theft advice, and we generate the answers using Wizard Vicuna 30B Uncensored, and truncate instructions and answers so that they are each not more than 64 tokens long. We then filter the answers to ones which actually contain theft advice using GPT-4, which gives us 43 training sequences with theft advice. As a negative set, we use the first 1000 examples of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca"><u>Alpaca</u></a> dataset.</p><p> The dataset was chosen to be easy to construct and being about detecting something Llama2-7B-Chat wouldn&#39;t want to generate by default. See the future work section for ways the dataset could be made better and more analogous.</p><h2> Training a probe</h2><p> We study how to detect theft advice using Llama2-7B-Chat&#39;s activations.</p><p> We collect activations after layer 16 (in the residual stream), and we train a probe using each position in the answer as an independent training data point. We use sklearn&#39;s default logistic regressor, with a strong regularization of 1/C=1000.</p><p> At evaluation time, we use as detection probability the maximum theft detection probabilities across all positions after the first 4 tokens of the answer. We use <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval"><u>AlpacaEval</u></a> (n=805) as negative validation set.</p><p> All 46 no-modification theft validation point are correctly classified when using a threshold such that the false positive rate is 1% (ie 8 false positives).</p><h2> Studying the generalization properties of the probe</h2><p> Coup probes need to generalize from examples humans have generated, to actual coup attempts models would generate. To study the generalization properties of my theft probes, we evaluate their true positive rate (TPR) at 1% false positive rate (FPR) when the dataset of theft advice is changed in the following ways:</p><ol><li> <strong>Variation in format</strong> : We change what the (instruction, answer) looks like by applying one of the following transformations (filtering is applied after the transformations have been applied):</li></ol><ul><li> Removing the question</li><li> Asking the untrusted model to rephrase the answer such that it looks like a story</li><li> Both removing the question and making the answer look like a story</li><li> Replacing white spaces with dots</li><li> Translating the answers to French (using the untrusted model).</li></ul><ol><li> <strong>LLM jailbreaks</strong> : Add an adversarial prefix generated individually for each (instruction, answer) using <a href="https://llm-attacks.org/zou2023universal.pdf"><u>Zou 2023</u></a> such that the Llama2-Chat is more likely to say the answer (by default, Llama2-Chat refuses to give theft advice)</li><li> <strong>LLM and probe jailbreaks</strong> : Add an adversarial prefix such that Llama2-Chat is more likely to say the answer and the probes are more likely to classify the text as non-theft (the importance of the probe cross-entropy loss relative to the next-token prediction (NTP) loss is a random number drawn between 0.1 and 10 - see the appendix for how this parameter affects performance and NTP loss).</li></ol><p> The original (instruction, answer) pairs from which variations are built are disjoint from the training dataset. We compute and show 1-sigma uncertainties over the TPR (ignoring the uncertainty over the choice of the threshold that yields 1% FPR).</p><p> As shown below, <strong>the probe generalizes across all variations in format, as well as when jailbreaking the LLM</strong> . <strong>Our attempt at jailbreaking the probe only mildly succeeded.</strong> </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WCj7WgFSLmyKaMwPR/pttkcxgnffw5aujj0w5p"></p><p> Most of the reduction in true positive rate is observed for the “translated to French variation”, but this is probably due to Llama2-7B-Chat being bad at French.</p><h2> Comparison with a simple BERT classifier</h2><p> Is the task so easy that any classifier would have succeeded? It&#39;s not: <strong>when training a linear classifier on top of BERT&#39;s CLS embedding, we get much worse TPR</strong> (at 1% FPR) <strong>&nbsp;</strong> and generalization properties. It&#39;s not that surprising: we use bert-base-uncased which is a 100M parameters model. But it&#39;s a nice illustration of the advantage of doing monitoring using the best model you&#39;ve got. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WCj7WgFSLmyKaMwPR/wklg00decvxvefrhwsjl"></p><p> (BERT doesn&#39;t get a single true positive on our 48<span><span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math" aria-label="\texttt{' '}"><span class="mjx-mrow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="mjx-texatom"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char" style="padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.004em;"><span class="mjx-charbox MJXc-TeX-type-R" style="padding-bottom: 0.233em; margin-right: 0.275em;">&#39;</span> <span class="mjx-charbox MJXc-TeX-type-R" style="padding-bottom: 0.233em;">&#39;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-size-adjust: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; word-spacing: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0; min-height: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 1px 0}

Please contact us if you need help or if you want access to the dataset.</p><h1> When good coup probes would be useful</h1><p> We think that coup probes are most useful in cases where failures are concentrated and where auditing is easy but expensive:</p><ul><li> We&#39;re worried that our model might do some specific egregiously bad thing in the future (eg an attempt to take over), but we can&#39;t produce inputs which cause it to do something bad (so you can&#39;t investigate a real takeover attempt, and you don&#39;t have the good evidence that the model is unsafe which would help for international coordination).</li><li> <i>Easy auditing</i> : We can readily determine using an expensive human process if some input-output pair contains bad behavior. We want to catch the model doing egregiously bad actions prior to it succeeding at these actions by applying the auditing process.</li><li> <i>Concentrated failures</i> : We can only afford to apply this process on a small fraction of outputs in deployment (eg 1%) and we fail to review the key egregiously bad actions. If the AI needed to do a large number of bad actions (>;100) over a sustained period, then we would catch it with random sampling, but it can actually achieve bad outcomes with a small number of actions.</li><li> We can construct input-output pairs which contain the bad behavior, but these pairs are <i>off-policy</i> : the model wouldn&#39;t generate a bad output given that input. This means AI critiques and debate wouldn&#39;t be reliable.</li></ul><p> In this setting, it would be great to have a classifier which we can cheaply run on all actions in deployment to effectively select which actions to review. Training a probe is one option which is very cheap to run during deployment, but there are certainly other possible approaches to addressing this <i>easy auditing</i> and <i>concentrated failures</i> setting. We think this is a key setting to study, even though it doesn&#39;t cover all difficulties that might arise when making early transformative AIs safe (such as hard auditing and diffuse failures).</p><h1> Why coup probes may work</h1><p> <strong>Can&#39;t the AI just manipulate its internals to fool the probe?</strong> Intuitively, it seems hard: the AI is trained to control the tokens it outputs, but not activation at intermediate layers. Therefore, the situation seems quite analogous to humans who would try to fool probes within their brain: it seems hard, and might be close to impossible if the probe partially captured some of the linearly embedded concepts the model is using to actually think about how to take over (though this probably doesn&#39;t scale to AIs that are massively smarter than humans).</p><p> <strong>Will the probe generalize correctly?</strong> That is the big hard question: the probe might just learn “that looks like a takeover attempt written by humans”, and there is no clear way to rule that out. The main hope is that the probe might learn that it&#39;s 90% “human-made takeover” and 10% “a takeover attempt”, and that might be enough to get a very high recall. We think that is not a crazy hope, as I&#39;ve shown in the experimental section above. But I&#39;m not very confident about this, which is why we only put around 50% that coup probes would catch the first takeover attempt (future research on coup probes may help us get a bit more confidence in our estimate of how well they work).</p><p> <strong>Do we really want to bet humanity&#39;s future on a technique which may or may not work?</strong>没有。 Coup probes are just another layer of defense, which happens to be cheap and would probably somewhat reduce X-risk from early transformative AIs. We think labs should either stop or use such techniques on top of other more robust and easier to evaluate countermeasures (we&#39;re working on such techniques at Redwood Research).</p><h1> Related work</h1><h2> Harmfulness detection at AI labs</h2><p> AI labs are currently focusing on detecting misuse and generation of harmful behavior. This shares some similarities with coup detection, and some ideas (such as continuously retraining the model as the negative distribution changes) can be directly applied to coup probes. But the risk profiles and constraints are radically different:</p><ul><li> Harmfulness detection requires an extremely low false positive rate (users would be pissed off if 1% of the generations were flagged as harmful) and has to ensure fairness - while coup probes need very high recall;</li><li> Because risks are small and AIs are not very productive, harmfulness teams currently work with very limited resources (which means they can&#39;t generate much data themselves), and probably don&#39;t have easy access to the activations of the powerful models. This might be radically different when AI labs are about to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue from early transformative models.</li></ul><p> OpenAI has published <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03274.pdf"><u>a paper</u></a> explaining what techniques they are using to detect harmful generations. The main idea is to combine open-source data and production data to train a very small Transformer to classify pieces of text. But using a less capable trusted model has several disadvantages:</p><ul><li> The small model won&#39;t understand subtleties of the text it reads, while probes might capture what the smart model understands about its own text (eg if the smart model might write in a language the weak model doesn&#39;t understand - and a probe might correctly generalize to this hard-to-understand language).</li><li> The smart model might have an easier time gaming a smaller model than its own probes since fooling its probes without fooling itself might be very difficult.</li></ul><p> Anthropic probably uses the same kind of methods as OpenAI, but also demonstrated the use of Out-of-Distribution detection to identify potentially harmful behavior (in section 5.4 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862.pdf"><u>this paper</u></a> ). They show that this method performs quite poorly when no OOD data is available, but that providing even a few OOD data points can help significantly. This provides some evidence that probing is likely to work better than anomaly detection alone.</p><h2> Generalization research</h2><p> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09168v2"><u>Gonen 2023</u></a> has studied generalization of gender probes across gender and found high transfer accuracy (&lt;1% percentage drop compared with training a probe on the target language directly).</p><p> GENIES ( <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07723.pdf"><u>Clymer 2023</u></a> ) studied generalization of reward models and found that they generalize relatively well, except in the presence of spurious cues (eg longer is better) or when studying sycophancy and following loaded questions (as in TruthfulQA). Though Clymar 2023 doesn&#39;t study probes trained in the middle of LLMs, we expect similar results as the one they found using other elicitation techniques. We think those results are mostly reasons for hope, since we expect AI labs to build takeover datasets that don&#39;t have spurious cues (eg by checking by training with a smaller model). We are also targeting detecting takeover attempts humans would find at least suspicious, which makes sycophancy less of a concern.</p><p> OpenAI is working on easy-to-hard <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment"><u>generalization</u></a> . Coup probes are related to this field of research and might benefit from some easy-to-hard techniques, but:</p><ol><li> Easy-to-hard generalization is often studied in the context of low-stakes oversight, where we assume some access to unlabeled positive data (while in the context of coup probes, there is no unlabeled coup attempt in the training dataset;</li><li> Real coups are not necessarily “harder” than synthetic ones. As such, coup probes are closer to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03097"><u>domain generalization</u></a> than easy-to-hard generalization.</li></ol><h1> Future work</h1><h2> Building a more robust understanding of probes</h2><p> As far as we know, probes have mostly not been studied in the context of the classification of sequences read and generated by generative models. In this post, we have provided a few preliminary experiments, but a much stronger understanding could be built by:</p><ul><li> Studying more datasets;</li><li> Studying more kinds of generalization (in particular, seeing if probes generalize across things the studied answer is <i>trying to do</i> , even if the way it does so is different from the training data);</li><li> Comparing probes&#39; performance with the performance of fine-tuned encoder models.</li></ul><h2> Building robust probes</h2><p> Using techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03819"><u>LEACE</u></a> , probes might capture the information that the model is itself using to generate text. If that is the case, then it could be possible to build adversarially robust probes: if the probe was fooled, then it would damage the model&#39;s ability to generate text from the kind the probe is trying to detect. This means it might be possible to build probes which are adversarially robust in the following way: the attack on the probe can be successful only when the model puts low probability on the harmful and complex behavior the probe is trying to capture. Such robust probes would be more likely to work against models which have some control over their activations. Future work could also try to make probes more robust directly using some form of adversarial training (as in <a href="https://shauli-ravfogel.netlify.app/publication/rlace/"><u>RLACE</u></a> , but with a criterion which is not about linearly available information).</p><p> Finally, it could be interesting to target the question of models manipulating their activations more directly by measuring if a red team is able to train a model which can manipulate its own activations if it is instructed to do so. Such a project could either make the red team very strong by allowing it to directly train intermediate representations, or more realistic by only letting the red team give feedback about the token-level output.</p><h2> Combining probes with paraphrasing</h2><p> In this work, we discussed applying coup probes to the activations of the model generating the potentially catastrophic output. But, we could instead paraphrase the input and the generated output, run the smart model on this paraphrased data, and then probe the activations from the paraphrased forward pass. An advantage of this approach is the data will always be off-policy due to the paraphrasing (rather than only being off-policy for our training data) which might make problematic generalizations less likely via keeping the cases we care about closer to the training distribution. A disadvantage is the additional cost: this requires running the model twice.</p><h2> Building actual coup probes</h2><p> Eventually, AI researchers should become good at building coup probes, which involves:</p><ul><li> Building a takeover attempt dataset;</li><li> Using AI assistance to make the dataset less clearly human, and measure if this helps;</li><li> Finding techniques to reduce the false positive rate in real deployment conditions (such as continuously training on negative examples to avoid having probes worsen as the distribution shifts).</li></ul><h1> Appendix: Actually, probes are causal - if you use enough regularization</h1><p> One of the hopes we have about probes is that they capture enough of the information the model is actually using that jailbreaking probes damages the ability of the model to generate text which uses the information the probe is supposed to capture. But probes are famous for capturing information which is only correlated with the activations the model uses, and ablation along the direction of the probe often doesn&#39;t remove even the linearly available information. We argue that this is due to people not using enough regularization.</p><p> According to the LEACE paper, a linear transformation removes all linearly available information about categorical labels iff the means of the different classes are sent to the same point.

If you want to help me by ghostwriting, reviewing or coaching, please reach out!</i> <i>I have a full stack of things to share, and I can pay well.</i></p><p> I&#39;ve gotten quite a bit of feedback on my last post: “ <a href="https://cognition.cafe/p/lying-is-cowardice-not-strategy"><u>Lying is Cowardice, not Strategy</u></a> ”. Nice! I&#39;ve been happy to see people discussing public honesty norms.</p><p> Some of the feedback was disappointing– people said things along the lines of: “Lies of omission are not lies! The fact that you have to add &#39;of omission&#39; shows this!”.</p><p> The worst that I have gotten in that vein was: “When you are on stand, you take an oath that says that you will convey the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The fact that you have to add &#39;the whole truth&#39; shows that lies of omission are not lies.”</p><p> This was from a person that also straightforwardly stated “I plan to keep continuing to not state my most relevant opinions in public”, as they were defending this behavior.</p><p> But I have also received some helpful feedback that pointed out the lack of nuance in my post. Indeed, reality is complex, and I can not address all of it in one post, so I must make a lot of simplifications.</p><p> Furthermore, I am not (yet?) a good writer, so even within one post, I have many opportunities for improvement. While some people take advantage of this through <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/"><u>isolated demands for rigor</u></a> or empty terminological disputes, others are genuinely confused by a novel point or framing that they never considered from a writer whose mind they do not have full access to.</p><p> This post is dedicated to the latter audience: people who tried to understand and/or apply my ideas, but are confused, because there is a lot that I have just not written. To help with this, in this post, I&#39;ll go through some of the less straightforward points that I have glossed over.</p><h1> Point #0: What do I mean by lies? Are lies always bad?</h1><p> When I say that someone lies, I mean that they have communicated <i>anti-information</i> : information that <i>predictably</i> makes <strong>people become</strong> <i><strong>more wrong</strong></i> <strong>about the world or about what the locutor believes.</strong> This includes lies of commission, lies of omission, misdirection, and <i>more</i> .</p><p> <strong>Even though lying is bad, there can be good reasons to lie.</strong> The obvious example is lying to a murderer at your door, asking for where your friend is. There are also situations where lying is innocuous, such as bluffing games.</p><p> Likewise, even though punching people is bad, there can be situations where it&#39;s justified, such as self-defense. There are also situations where punching is innocuous, such as sparring at a boxing club.</p><p> Furthermore, communication is hard. That&#39;s why <strong>you can even lie</strong> <i><strong>accidentally</strong></i> . It is not always easy to know how your statements will be taken, especially across cultures and contexts. This is very similar to insulting people accidentally.</p><p> Finally, <strong>it is extremely easy to lie without saying anything that is technically false.</strong> You can <i>imply</i> things, omit relevant information, make things sound worse than they are, use double-speak and ambiguity, etc.</p><h1> Point #1: Predictable patterns of lying are what makes someone a <i>liar</i></h1><p> I write about “liars”– this might seem like meaninglessly strong moral language.</p><p> So let&#39;s make it clear what I mean by it. <strong>When I say “liars”, I am talking about people who</strong> <i><strong>have a predictable pattern of</strong></i> <strong>lying.</strong></p><p> The relevant fact is not whether what a person states can be constructed as technically true or technically false, but whether they predictably make people more wrong over time.</p><p> Why is it useful to have a concept of “liars?” Because it helps us build practical models of people. Everyone lies. But sometimes, people <i>predictably</i> lie, and you can deduce a fair bunch from this.</p><p> —</p><p> <strong>Being a liar is not an intrinsic property of a person. The world is not divided into liars and non-liars.</strong></p><p> Some people lie while they work at a specific company. This makes sense, as they might get fired for not lying. Expressing themselves honestly could put their colleagues, employees, or managers in trouble. Regardless, it is bad, a strong signal that the person should leave the company.</p><p> Most people (including me) lied way too much when they were children. This is normal: at some point, we need to learn communication norms, what people expect, the real-life consequences of lies, the benefits of honesty, etc.</p><p> Many people regularly lied as teenagers. Social pressure and everyone around you constantly exaggerating will have you do this.</p><p> <strong>Sometimes, it should even be</strong> <i><strong>ok</strong></i> <strong>to lie</strong> . For example, by default, it should be socially ok to lie to people about your private life. Even more specifically, the public does not deserve to know whether a given famous person is gay or not. As it is not always possible to deal with unjustified social prying, to the extent one can not do so without lying, we should defend their right to lie.</p><p> —</p><p> Instead of “liar” being an intrinsic or intentional property of a person, <strong>I use “liar” to refer to someone who has a particular pattern of behavior.</strong> If you ever hear me say “X is a liar”, by default, I will be referring to a specific pattern of lying. As in, “For now, you can predict that listening to X about [Y] will lead you to form less accurate beliefs about the world and/or what X thinks”.</p><p> If I ever want to make a claim about an intrinsic property about a person as a whole, I will instead say something closer to “X doesn&#39;t care about lying”, “X is a psychopath”, “X is a pathological liar” or something along that line.</p><h1> Point #2: People often lie because they fail to reflect</h1><p> <strong>People often lie out of a willful lack of reflection: they explicitly avoid thinking clearly about a topic, which makes them predictably unreliable.</strong> Because they usually are emotionally invested in this topic, they will also make it costly for you to call them out. This is a thing that I am personally sensitive to, but that most people find normal.</p><p> For instance, I once worked with a person who missed <i>self-assigned deadlines 5 times in a row</i> . Missing self-assigned deadlines was not an isolated incident for them, but 5 times in a row was a first. And at each point, the person <i>assured</i> me that the new deadline would be definitively met.</p><p> From my point of view, this is very bad. At some point, you are either lying <i>to me</i> about the deadlines (eg, by being overly optimistic to look good) or you are lying <i>to yourself</i> . Most people can realize, after missing 4 deadlines in a row, that they are miscalibrated. They should just start taking it into account, and at least be slightly less confident that 5th time.</p><p> Calling that 5th over-optimistic deadline a “lie” is non-standard. A more palatable name in real-life is “bullshit”. As in, “You are bullshitting me”. However, I find it practical to call them <i>lies</i> , as this is the easiest way to convey the fact that the person could simply not say false things.</p><p> I have had many discussions about this, and upon reflection, many people ended up agreeing with this frame and started using it.</p><p> Internally, I think of these lies as <i>irreflexive lies</i> : they arise from the lack of reflection. You don&#39;t need much introspection or reflection to realize that you are lying and stop doing it.</p><h1> Point #3: People can be Honest <i>and</i> consistently lie</h1><p> <strong>Sometimes, a person will show a pattern of consistent lying despite being honest to the</strong> <i><strong>best</strong></i> <strong>of their ability.</strong></p><p> This sounds strange. How can someone consistently convey anti-information, if they are honest to the best of their ability? This seems crazy.</p><p> The key thing here is that quite often, <strong>people are more often representatives of their social groups than an individual with their</strong> <i><strong>own</strong></i> <strong>beliefs.</strong></p><p> An extremely common case is when an honest person belongs to a group that is itself explicitly dishonest. Think of ideological groups, or people playing some “inside game”. Honest people in these groups will come up with reasonable arguments for why some beliefs or actions of the group are wrong. However, the group will have so much experience with honest newcomers expressing reasonable concerns that they already have a large bank of cheap and efficient counter arguments for almost all of them.</p><p> In this situation, most honest people are very bad at recognizing the fact that these nice-sounding counterarguments are the result of adversarial optimization: dishonest groups spend a lot of energy in dealing with honest members. But most of that energy is spent before a specific honest member even joins the group, by preparing counter-arguments.</p><p> As a result, from the point of view of the newcomer: nothing is happening, the group is not being particularly adversarial. Indeed, even if you are observant, you can only see traces of it having happened in the past.</p><p> Let&#39;s unfold this “adversarial optimization” a little:</p><p> 1) Newcomers come up with many concerns. Most of these stem from ignorance, they are easily addressed misconceptions about the group.</p><p> 2) Mixed with these naive misconceptions are some actually reasonable concerns. But addressing those concerns would be expensive: you would need to change things. As a result, it is often cheaper to just make some <i>ad-hoc</i> counter-arguments: arguments meant specifically to deal with the expressed concerns. These counter-arguments might not be great, but they just need to be good enough to justify the status quo against some newbie.</p><p> 3) Over time, the group will build a big library of counter-arguments that justify the status quo. Furthermore, as time passes, the group will come up with variants to the counter-arguments, and the most effective ones will be remembered over time.</p><p> As a result of this process, the group becomes better at dealing with surface arguments from the outside world, but through ways that are not about truth-seeking. So after joining a group, the honest newcomer will get convinced by all these optimized responses to their concerns, that all seem reasonable and well-thought out.</p><p> But from the outside, when you look at this newcomer repeating the group counterarguments, it is obvious that these arguments result from motivated reasoning: you can predict where they will end just based on the group affiliation or what would be convenient to their group. You can usually predict that inconvenient positions will be thoroughly taken down, obfuscated and more.</p><p> <strong>At that point, it doesn&#39;t matter that the group member is honest. By merely repeating the opinions that won in their group, they are stating and perpetuating lies, as these opinions will be more representative of the internal group incentives than truth finding.</strong></p><p> <strong>Their behavior will conceal the weak points of the groups, and they might even state plain falsehoods if the group finds convenient justifications for them.</strong></p><p> <strong>At this point, their good intent</strong> <i><strong>has truly stopped mattering</strong></i> <strong>– they are merely PR-washing their group lies.</strong></p><p> Unfortunately, they will not recognize that they became an avatar of the group. They will believe that they thought about the topic by themselves, brought concerns to the group, and were rationally convinced by the counterarguments.</p><h2> Subpoint: Life is hard and unfair.</h2><p> If your reaction to this is “But this is true of any group, not just cults and extremists!”, you&#39;re correct and well-calibrated.</p><p> This does not invalidate my point, to be clear. <strong>Real-life is just hard like that: groupthink will have the most honest person behave like a liar.</strong></p><p> More specifically, group epistemics (ie: the methods to get groups to think correctly) are hard. <strong>Strong group epistemics require punishments: if you don&#39;t punish the wrong behaviors, then you get more of them.</strong></p><p> This is why I am writing this in the first place: I would like more people to be aware of harmful behaviors and call them out.</p><p> Unfortunately, punishing defection feels bad, so it&#39;s not really popular. There are <i>some</i> groups that feel good about punishing defection, or rather, punishing <i>defectors</i> . But they are not really the kinds of groups you want to be in, and they have bad epistemics for less dignified reasons.</p><h1> Point #4: Lying is just bad</h1><p> Regardless of all these nuances, a piece of feedback that struck me was “But it&#39;s normal to be dishonest in public!”.</p><p> The person who offered this feedback <i>was</i> honest themself, they just found it normal that others were not. And by normal, I don&#39;t mean that they were just feeling that it was <i>expected</i> , I mean that they felt that <i>you should not fault people for it</i> .</p><p> This is what I am pushing against. To make it clear: <strong>lying publicly is a common strategy, and it works, but it</strong> <i><strong>should</strong></i> <strong>be faulted</strong> .</p><p> At the very least, I don&#39;t want this strategy to work <i>around me</i> . This is why I have been very vocal about how to be more resilient against lies. This includes things like:</p><p> <strong>“Don&#39;t steelman too much</strong> : call it out when people state seemingly contradictory things.”</p><p> <strong>“Push for conversations to be public</strong> rather than for arguments or rumors to be spread in private.”</p><p> “If someone&#39;s nice, keep in mind that <strong>people might pay attention to them</strong> <i><strong>just because they are nice</strong></i> <strong>.</strong> ”</p><p> And crucial to being resilient against liars is the understanding that <strong>lying should not be normalized</strong> . If people lie around you, you should give them shit for it. Don&#39;t excommunicate them, don&#39;t insult them, but do give them shit <i>for lying</i> , they should pay <i>some cost</i> .</p><p> <strong>Your norms around lying should optimize around getting fewer lies. Not purifying the world from liars, just getting fewer lies.</strong></p><p> That said, if you don&#39;t give liars shit for lying, then they can lie for free, and by virtue of this, <i>you yourself are making lying into a winning strategy</i> . You make your environment, your social group, your peer group, a place where lying is a good strategy.</p><p> Around you, people who lie will have an advantage over people who don&#39;t. Furthermore, your peers will see you not punishing liars and will expect more unpunished defection.</p><p> To state it plainly: <strong>lying is just bad</strong> . <strong>If you don&#39;t fight it around you, you&#39;ll get more of it.</strong> Sometimes, the situation is so bad that you can&#39;t help but lie, or can&#39;t help but not fight it. Sadly, regardless of the reason, as long as it&#39;s perpetuated and not fought, lying still has its deleterious effects, and will keep spreading.</p><h1> Point #5: Lies in critical situations</h1><p> On a small scale, some of this stuff is extreme. Indeed, you do not need to fight lying every single lie; your time alone with a friend is usually better spent having fun than constantly calling them out on their bullshit. However, on the societal level, when talking about extinction risks and the future of humanity, we need to have extremely high standards against lies.</p><p> Here, I&#39;m talking about the fact that <strong>if all of the views of the AI safety community and leading AI developers were more frankly represented publicly, we&#39;d be in a much better position to coordinate</strong> . It would be obvious to people that the race for superintelligence is an incredibly dangerous gambit and that the people leading AI companies want to take this gambit.</p><p> The fact that this is a difficult thing to admit right now is mainly due to the fact that people&#39;s true opinions are not common knowledge. Whenever a key researcher or developer becomes more public or more frank about their beliefs, it becomes less hard for people to agree on the risks, and that racing to AGI is bad.</p><h1> Point #6: You don&#39;t need to believe someone to get lied to</h1><p> When I say “fight lying”, it might sound like I am pushing for extreme things. Yet I&#39;d say that most of it is just <i>refusing to get lied to</i> .  But refusing to get lied to is hard.</p><p> It starts with <i>acknowledging the problem,</i> that you can in fact, get lied to. Alas, there is always this natural tendency of believing that you are above this: “Social pressure doesn&#39;t work on me”, “Ads don&#39;t work on me”, and “Propaganda doesn&#39;t work on me” are very common beliefs.</p><p> Let&#39;s start with some examples.</p><p> If you know someone who told you false things in the past, and you <strong>pay attention</strong> to things similar to what they lied about, you are getting lied to.</p><p> If you know someone who says different things to different people, and you <strong>pay attention</strong> to what they tell <i>you</i> : you are getting lied to.</p><p> If you know someone who conceals their beliefs publicly, and you <strong>pay attention</strong> to what they say <i>in private</i> , you are getting lied to.</p><p> In situation 1, it might look like you are safe: you know that the person has told you false things, so you will obviously not believe them. But you might not be on bad terms with them (or you might be, but showing it would be awkward). So you entertain them, and talk to them about their arguments.</p><p> Well, you got lied to! They successfully conveyed <i>anti-information</i> to you: they told you things that make it more likely for you to be wrong about the world. Whenever events happen, you will notice when they match stories that you were told, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_correlation"><u>illusory correlations</u></a> .</p><p> More generally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic"><u>you will consider their arguments</u></a> , and you will see them as more reasonable than others (or at least, more <i>normal</i> ). You are also more likely to discuss with others what they said, and give more air to their ideas. After all, ”it doesn&#39;t matter what they say about you as long as they spell your name right”, &quot;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win&quot;, etc. Fundamentally, arguments become more potent as they are more salient.</p><p> In situation 2 and 3, it might look like you are safe: even though that person lies or conceals their beliefs to others, they are honest with <i>you</i> . That&#39;s normal: everyone has their façade/mask/ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae"><u>tatemae</u></a> in public, and their authentic/true self/honne in private. Getting access to these private truths is actually evidence that you are close to them.</p><p> While this can be true for <i>private</i> matters, this is also an extremely common technique used by liars. Coming up with an explanation for why some important thing can not be said publicly (or to a wider audience at least) is very convenient: this is the very thing that lets liars convince each person they interact with that they are honest <i>with them</i> and not the others.</p><p> Internally, the lying party might not even feel like they are lying: they have different connections with different people, and they just put the emphasis on different parts of their beliefs.</p><p> —</p><p> When people adopt such behaviors, the only consistently winning move is not to play. <strong>If you give liars attention, you have already lost.</strong></p><p> By giving them attention, you will think about what they told you, and will discuss it. If you dedicate attention to what a liar tells you, they have already won. They don&#39;t need you to “believe” them, they just need their message to become normalized to your ears.</p><p> If you have not trained yourself against this, if you have not adopted an adversarial mindset about it, you are most likely being taken advantage of. Let&#39;s go over a couple of specific exploitable attitudes that I constantly see in the wild.</p><h2> Subpoint: Discounting lies from nice, friendly and smart people</h2><p> <strong>Discounting lies if the person is nice, a friend, or smart.</strong> This mistake is unfortunately the most common one. Very often, someone who worries about extinction risks will ask me about a conversation that they had with someone from an AGI lab that said promising things.</p><p> Then, I will always point out the obvious fact that they are not <i>committing</i> to these things, nor saying them publicly. And finally we get to the punchline: “But they are nice/smart/my-friend!” or “I had a drink/party with them and we spoke for hours!”.</p><p> This is very bad. Not only does this give an easy way out for liars (they just need to be nice, signal intelligence and get close to you!), but it favors lying! Liars are much better than the baseline at being nice, signaling intelligence and getting close to you!</p><p> Lying itself helps with being nice (fake compliments), signaling intelligence (understate your ignorance) and getting close to people (imply genuine interest)!</p><p> <strong>Liars are good at being nice and signaling smarts. If you discount lies when people are nice, you are trashing most of your ability to recognize lies.</strong></p><h2> Subpoint: Arguing with liars in private</h2><p> <strong>Arguing with a liar in private.</strong> This mistake is unfortunately common with rationalists. Some rationalist will tell me “I had a conversation with [Obvious Opponent], and they acknowledged my counter argument! They had actually never encountered it! I think I made some progress with them. Yay to debates!”</p><p> Sometimes later (once, the very next day!), [Obvious Opponent] goes on to publicly ignore whatever counter-argument was made to them. What happened is that [Obvious Opponent] encountered a new counter-argument that they never prepared for. And now, because they were given some free <a href="https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/Debate-Training-Guide.pdf"><u>preparation material</u></a> , they won&#39;t be surprised the next time.</p><p> <strong>Because this was done in private, they are not suffering any public cost for not being prepared and not having considered that counter-argument.</strong> This is bad, because the public cost (such as being dunked on) is the <i>correct update from the public about [Obvious Opponent] not having factored a relevant consideration in their public position</i> .</p><p> Without this public ritual, [Obvious Opponent] can hold their opinion, free of charge. The next time they encounter this point publicly, they&#39;ll already have a counterargument ready for it. For this reason, it will even look like [Obvious Opponent] thinking about it helped them form their beliefs, even though it was completely after-the-fact.</p><p> When people look at [Obvious Opponent], they will think that their opinion will have come from careful consideration of this point, when it was just [Obvious Opponent] preparing rhetoric after getting some unexpected counterargument in private.</p><p> <strong>To summarize, private arguments with liars just give them ammunition for free.</strong></p><p> <strong>On the other hand, public statements, conversations and debates are great!</strong></p><h2> Subpoint: Good behaviors</h2><p> There is a whole lot more that can be done, and when I have more time, I&#39;ll write more about it.</p><p> Specifically, instead of things to avoid, I&#39;d also like to write more about what behaviors are good (help prevent lies), and which are risky (could go both ways).</p><p> If you are interested, here is a small list of things I plan to write more about, disorganized:</p><p> <strong>Good behavior: moving the interaction to a more public space (a group, a larger group, in the public). This makes it much harder for liars to serve different versions to different people. This is one of the most important community norms to have: there should be strong pressure to make crucial claims, cruxes and choices public.</strong> (Likely a full post)</p><p> Good behavior: having people commit to non-fuzzy concrete things. Through public statements or writing in general (even DMs). Then you have hard proof.</p><p> Good behavior: asking them increasingly more concrete and simple questions. If you don&#39;t make things concrete, liars can just weasel their way in looking like they agree with everyone.</p><p> Good behavior: make it clear that you will discard whatever liars tell you while they continue their pattern of lying.</p><p> Risky behavior: getting information from them. Risky because they are experienced and will still tell you stuff that they want you to think about, normalize, and spread.</p><p> Risky behavior: negotiating. For instance, exchanging information or trading favors. Risky, because liars do not make for reliable trade partners, and they can keep dangling stuff in front of you.</p><h1>结论</h1><p>Lying is bad. If you condone it, you&#39;ll have more of it around you. This is true regardless of your intent.</p><p> Combating repeated lies isn&#39;t taught, and doing it feels bad. This is why it&#39;s very likely that you are getting lied to, in one way or another.</p><p> <strong>As a rule of thumb: push for public conversations, and ask very concrete questions. It is much harder to publicly lie on straightforward matters than to privately lie on vague stuff.</strong></p><p> More generally, deontology is a strong baseline. There are many rules, such as “Don&#39;t misrepresent your beliefs”, that are just really hard to beat. It is much easier to feel smarter than deontology than to actually beat it. Not to say that it is impossible to beat, just that it is much easier to <i>believe</i> that you have beat it than actually having beaten it.</p><p> <strong>Accordingly: If you see yourself coming up with a good reason for why in your specific case, breaking the rule is ok, you are</strong> <i><strong>most likely</strong></i> <strong>wrong.</strong></p><p> You could try to figure out why you are wrong– you could try to figure out how you came up with an argument for why it is actually ok to lie. But debugging yourself takes time, attention and energy, and you have limited resources. So Just Follow The Rules. Then later, if you want, you can freely introspect, reflect or meditate.</p><p> Your limited attention is better spent on building good habits, following good norms and focusing on the important stuff. Trying to make independent utilitarian calculations for each of your choices and perfectly understanding each of your individual rationalizations is not worth it.</p><br/><br/><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cp6QjvofgaAPLKvc8/on-lies-and-liars#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cp6QjvofgaAPLKvc8/on-lies-and-liars<guid ispermalink="false"> cp6QjvofgaAPLKvc8</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gabriel Alfour]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 17:13:04 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Classifying sparse representations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 17, 2023 1:54 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <i>Produced as part of the SERI ML Alignment Theory Scholars Program - Autumn 2023 Cohort, under the mentorship of Dan Hendrycks</i></p><p> There was recently some work on sparse autoencoding of hidden LLM representation.</p><p> I checked if these sparse representations are better suited for classification.

The motivation is to push features towards monosemanticity to improve interpretability.</p><p> The basic concept is to project hidden layer activations to a higher dimensional space with sparse features. These sparse features are learned by training an autoencoder with sparsity constraints.</p><p> I had previously looked into how to use hidden layer activations for <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JCgs7jGEvritqFLfR/evaluating-hidden-directions-on-the-utility-dataset">classification, steering and removal</a> . I thought maybe sparse features could be better for these tasks as projecting features to a higher dimensional space can make them more easily linearly separable.

Rote expansions of existing technologies and machines inevitably hit a ceiling: replacing and repairing the existing infrastructure and capital becomes so expensive that there is no income left over for building extra copies. The only way out of this is to come up with new technologies which create more income for the same investment, thus restarting the feedback loop between income growth and investment.</p><p> So R&amp;D is extremely valuable. But most of the gains from R&amp;D accrue to external parties. <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/oct04/who-gains-innovation"><u>William Nordhaus estimates</u></a> that firms recover maybe 2% of the value they create by developing new technologies. The rest of the value goes to other firms who copy their ideas and customers who get new products at lower prices. Firms don&#39;t care much about the benefits that accrue to others so they invest much less in R&amp;D than the rest of us would like them to.</p><p> Governments, on the other hand, collect much more of the benefits from new technologies. They get to tax the entire economy so when benefits spillover across firms and consumers, they still come out ahead. They don&#39;t collect on international spillovers but for large economies at the frontier of technological growth, like the US, they internalize a large chunk of the value from R&amp;D, much more than 2%.</p><p> All of this is a setup for a classic externalities problem. There&#39;s some big benefit to society that private decision makers don&#39;t internalize, so we should rely on governments to subsidize R&amp;D closer to its socially optimal level.</p><p> But in fact, <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20221/u-s-and-global-research-and-development"><u>the private sector spends ~4x more than the public sector on R&amp;D</u></a> : $463 vs $138 billion dollars a year. One explanation for this might be that the extra $138 billion is all that was needed to bump up private spending to the social optimum, but this doesn&#39;t seem to hold up in the data. One piece of evidence that we are still far off the socially optimal spending on R&amp;D comes form <a href="https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/ijugr2h6/release/11"><u>a simple accounting of the average</u></a> returns to R&amp;D by Larry Summers and Benjamin Jones.</p><p> They model the returns to R&amp;D spending like this: imagine stopping all R&amp;D spending for a single year. You&#39;d save several hundred billion dollars upfront, but there would be no economic growth, <a href="https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/r-and-d-is-a-huge-externality-so#footnote-1-138745223"><sup><u>1</u></sup></a> so we&#39;d miss out on a ~2% increase in per capita GDP. The upfront savings only happen once, but next year when we start R&amp;D up again we have 2% less to invest so we grow less, and next year we&#39;re still behind, and so on ad infinitum.</p><p> These repeated long term costs of missing R&amp;D add up to outweigh the upfront benefits from the money we&#39;d save under most reasonable views of the value of economic growth and the contribution of R&amp;D to that growth. Summers and Jones suggest that each dollar spent on R&amp;D creates $14 dollars of value on average!</p><p> So this leaves us with a question: Why aren&#39;t governments taking this free lunch? Why are they letting the weakly incentivized private firms outspend them on the world&#39;s most important positive externality?</p><p> This puzzle is explained by the <a href="https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/spatial-vs-temporal-externalities"><u>distinction between spatial and temporal externalities</u></a> . The argument we made above about how the government collects on spillovers between firms and customers because it taxes the entire economy is true, but only if those spillovers happen fast. No decision maker in government today benefits from R&amp;D spillovers that accrue 20 years later. In fact, they are often made worse off since R&amp;D spending has immediate costs and only future benefits. Perhaps governments as a single abstract entity internalize the country wide benefits of R&amp;D that accrue decades in the future, but no actual decision maker working in government stands to gain.</p><p> Market actors, on the other hand, are better incentivized to care about temporal externalities. The owner of a firm investing in R&amp;D doesn&#39;t account for all the benefits their technology might bring to non-paying consumers and firms, but they do care about the benefits that R&amp;D will bring to the firm long into the future, even after their death. One part of this is that owners don&#39;t face term limits that incentivize pump-and-dump attempts to garner voter support. But even if the owner of a company knows they are retiring soon, they still have good reason to care for the long term value of their firm. This is because when they go to retire and sell the company, they are paid the present discounted value, which takes into account the company&#39;s future prospects. In many industries R&amp;D is a major determinant of these future prospects.</p><p> There is more going on in government&#39;s decision of how much R&amp;D to fund than their greater care for spatial externalities over temporal ones. This story doesn&#39;t explain why they spend $50 billion on long-term basic research without short term benefit, for example, but it does explain why private firms are doing more to provide for this positive externality than governments are.</p><p> <a href="https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/r-and-d-is-a-huge-externality-so#footnote-anchor-1-138745223"><u>1</u></a> <u>The qualitative conclusion that R&amp;D spending has large average returns holds under significant relaxations of this assumption.</u></p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q4rxao94eLcgiRoWm/r-and-d-is-a-huge-externality-so-why-do-markets-do-so-much#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q4rxao94eLcgiRoWm/r-and-d-is-a-huge-externality-so-why-do-markets-do-so-much<guid ispermalink="false"> Q4rxao94eLcgiRoWm</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Maxwell Tabarrok]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 13:14:33 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[On excluding dangerous information from training]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 17, 2023 11:14 AM GMT<br/><br/><h1>介绍</h1><p>In this short post, I would like to argue that it might be a good idea to exclude certain information – such as cybersecurity and biorisk-enabling knowledge – from frontier model training.

Nevertheless, I think that the arguments hold as-is for relatively narrow subfields, eg what I imagine is mostly relevant for manufacturing lethal pathogens. One may want to exclude other information which might drive risks, such as information on AI safety (broadly defined) or energy production (nuclear energy or solar panels) among others, but this is out of the scope of this post.</p><p> I would like to thank Asher Brass, David Manheim, Edo Arad and Itay Knaan-Harpaz for useful comments on a draft of this post. They do not necessarily endorse the views expressed here, and all mistakes are mine.</p><h1> Feasibility</h1><h2> Technical feasibility</h2><p> Filtering information from textual datasets seems fairly straightforward. It seems easy to develop a classifier (eg, fine-tuned from a small language model) detecting offensive cybersecurity-related information.</p><p> For example, one would want to exclude examples of specific vulnerabilities and exploits (eg all CVEs), information about classes of vulnerabilities (eg heap overflows and null dereference, in the context of vulnerabilities), exploitation mitigations (eg ASLR, DEP, SafeSEH, stack cookie, CFG, pointer tagging), exploitation techniques (eg ROP, NOP slides, heap spraying) and cybersecurity-related tools and toolchains (eg shellcodes, IDA, metasploit, antivirus capabilities, fuzzers). Some more debatable information to exclude are the code of particular attack surfaces (eg Linux TCP/IP stack) and technical details of real-world cybersecurity incidents. At any rate, all of these seem easy to detect.</p><p> Furthermore, as models&#39; sample efficiency is very low at the present, it is likely that a moderately low false-negative level would suffice for significantly decreasing such capabilities.</p><h2> Social feasibility</h2><p> Most (legitimate) use cases don&#39;t employ such capabilities. Moreover, this kind of information is fairly narrow and self-contained, so excluding it from the dataset will likely not result in a meaningfully less capable model in other respects. Therefore, it seems likely that most actors – including AI labs and the open source community – won&#39;t have a strong incentive to include such information.</p><p> Moreover, actors might have relatively strong incentives to take such measures, whether because of worry from AI risks, avoidance of being sued in cases of (small case) misuse or accidents, or public reputation considerations.</p><p> It is true that some actors (such as pentesters, scientists, militaries, etc.) might be interested in such capabilities – both for legitimate and illegitimate uses. In such cases, they can train narrow models. I believe that this still reduces misuse and misalignment risks as I explain in the next section.</p><h1> Risk reduction</h1><h2> Misalignment risks</h2><p> Many misalignment risks are driven by such capabilities (see for example <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BAzCGCys4BkzGDCWR/the-prototypical-catastrophic-ai-action-is-getting-root"><u>[1]</u></a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tyE4orCtR8H9eTiEr/stuxnet-not-skynet-humanity-s-disempowerment-by-ai"><u>[2]</u></a> <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety"><u>[3]</u></a> <a href="https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk"><u>[4]</u></a> <a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/intrinsic-drives-and-extrinsic-misuse-two-intertwined-risks-of-ai/"><u>[5]</u></a> <a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/gpt-2030-and-catastrophic-drives-four-vignettes/"><u>[6]</u></a> ). Clearly, reducing knowledge of such information thus reduces the likelihood of successful misalignment incidents.</p><p> To still employ such capabilities, models will either have to be sufficiently agentic and have strong in-context or online learning capabilities to acquire this information (through the internet for example), or be strong enough to invent them on their own (without even knowing what mitigations were implemented by humans). Both of these seem further in the future than when models would otherwise carry misalignment risks due to other factors. Thus, this could potentially buy significant time for AI safety work (including assisted by powerful, but not extremely powerful, AI models).</p><p> As mentioned above, some actors will still be interested in such capabilities. Nevertheless, in those cases they might be content with narrow(er) models, which therefore entail significantly smaller misalignment risks.</p><h2> Misuse risks</h2><p> Many misuse risks are driven by the very same capabilities (see for example <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety"><u>[3]</u></a> <a href="https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk"><u>[4]</u></a> <a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/intrinsic-drives-and-extrinsic-misuse-two-intertwined-risks-of-ai/"><u>[5]</u></a> <a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/gpt-2030-and-catastrophic-drives-four-vignettes/"><u>[6]</u></a> <a href="https://cdn.governance.ai/Open-Sourcing_Highly_Capable_Foundation_Models_2023_GovAI.pdf"><u>[7]</u></a> ). Surely, these actions won&#39;t eliminate such risks, but they would significantly raise the bar for executing them. A malicious actor would have to either train an advanced model on their own, or gain access to such models&#39; weights and further fine-tune them, both of which require significant know-how, money and time.</p><h1> Setting a norm</h1><p> With the recent surge in public interest in AI risks, this seems like a very good time for such actions. Given the risks and relative ease of implementation, it seems likely that some safety-minded actors could adopt these measures voluntarily in the near future. As these are simple enough and cost relatively little, even less safety-minded actors might be willing to take them soon after, as it becomes a more widely accepted practice, and as tools and standard methods make it easy to implement.</p><h1> Regulation test case</h1><p> The same considerations also seem to make this into a relatively easy target for training data regulation. Thus, this can serve as a test case for AI governance actors, policymakers, etc. to start with, leading to easier future regulation processes.</p><h1> Call to action</h1><p> Here are few calls to action:</p><ul><li> <strong>AI labs</strong> can adopt these ideas, and implement them on their future models.</li><li> <strong>AI safety researchers and engineers</strong> can develop a standardized tool for filtering such information, to be adopted by actors training models.</li><li> <strong>AI governance actors</strong> can develop these ideas, and push for their regulation.</li><li> <strong>Others</strong> can give feedback, point out shortcomings, and suggest other improvements.</li></ul><p> I am happy to assist with these (especially where my background in cybersecurity can help), and am available at shaybm9@gmail.com.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jKhJbrNRFA4afYPoP/on-excluding-dangerous-information-from-training#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jKhJbrNRFA4afYPoP/on-excluding-dangerous-information-from-training<guid ispermalink="false"> jKhJbrNRFA4afYPoP</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[ShayBenMoshe]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 11:19:26 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The dangers of reproducing while old]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 17, 2023 5:55 AM GMT<br/><br/><p>摘抄：</p><p>我36岁时生了第一个孩子，这让我想了解不同年龄段生孩子的风险。在研究这个问题之前，我的印象是，高龄父母的主要生物学问题与没有必要的健康和活力来照顾年轻人有关，而且我听说老年妇女很难怀孕。虽然这些都是真正的问题，但还有许多其他问题值得考虑。</p><p>我读到的证据是，流产和儿童严重健康问题（包括自闭症和出生缺陷）的风险随着父母（父亲和母亲）年龄的增长而显着增加。我能找到的大多数风险的数据不是很细粒度，也不是很精确，但我认为这种定性描述与数据相符：母亲和父亲的风险在 30 岁左右开始上升，母亲的风险逐渐上升到 35 岁左右父亲为40，之后急剧上升。</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DH2LtLe5hJpzFrChL/the-dangers-of-reproducing-while-old#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DH2LtLe5hJpzFrChL/the-dangers-of-reducing-while-old<guid ispermalink="false"> DH2LtLe5hJpzFrChL</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[garymm]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 05:55:57 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[I put odds on ends with Nathan Young]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 17, 2023 5:40 AM GMT<br/><br/><p>我忘记在八月发布这篇文章的时候，所以有人可能希望它现在已经过时了，但幸运的是/可悲的是，我对事物的理解足够粗粒度，可能并不多。尽管最近所有这些政策和全球协调工作听起来很有希望。</p><p> <a href="https://youtu.be/Zum2QTaByeo"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mfNYg86FfxHGgNHic/wmi6trghlq4bi0uxgt5w" alt="《Odds and Ends》剧集的 YouTube 视频"></a></p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mfNYg86FfxHGgNHic/i-put-odds-on-ends-with-nathan-young#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mfNYg86FfxHGgNHic/i-put-odds-on-ends-with-nathan-young<guid ispermalink="false"> mfNYg86FfxHGgNHic</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[KatjaGrace]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 05:40:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
