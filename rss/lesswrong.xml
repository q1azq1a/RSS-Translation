GMT<br/><br/><p><i>认知状态：一旦我开始积极研究事物，我在下面的帖子中的大部分信息都是通过搜索有关非线性联合创始人的负面信息来获得的，而不是通过搜索来给出其总体成本和收益的平衡图景。我认为标准更新规则并不意味着您忽略这些信息，而是您会考虑一下，如果我选择了我可以分享的最差、可信的信息，那么您预期该信息会有多糟糕，然后根据更差（或更好）的程度进行更新这比你期望的我能生产的多。 （有关更多信息，请参阅这篇文章的第 5 节，了解</i><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zTfSXQracE7TW8x4w/mistakes-with-conservation-of-expected-evidence#5___Your_true_reason_screens_off_any_other_evidence_your_argument_might_include__"><i><u>预期证据守恒的错误</u></i></a><i>。）对于至少非零人士来说，在继续阅读之前，这似乎是一个值得在评论中进行的练习。 （你可以要求我找到足够的值得分享的内容，但也要注意，我认为我公开分享有关 EA/x-risk/rationalist/etc 生态系统中的人们的关键信息的门槛相对较低。）</i></p><p> <i>tl;dr：如果您希望我的重要更新快速总结为四个主张加概率，请跳至底部附近标题为“我的认知状态摘要”的部分。</i></p><hr><p>当我过去管理<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/psYNRb3JCncQBjd4v/shutting-down-the-lightcone-offices"><u>Lightcone 办公室</u></a>时，我花费了大量的时间和精力来把关 — 处理 EA/x-risk/rationalist 生态系统中的人员访问办公室并在办公室工作的申请，并做出决策。通常，这将涉及阅读他们的一些公开著作，并联系我信任的一些参考文献并询问有关他们的信息。我接触过的很多人都非常善于诚实地讲述他们与某人的经历，并分享他们对某人的看法。</p><p>有一次，非线性公司的凯特·伍兹（Kat Woods）和德鲁·斯帕茨（Drew Spartz）申请参观。我对他们和他们的工作不太了解，除了几次简短的互动之外，凯特·伍兹似乎精力充沛，对生活和工作的看法比我遇到的大多数人都要乐观。</p><p>我查阅了凯特列出的一些参考资料，这些参考资料都是积极到强烈积极的。然而，我也得到了强烈的负面评价——我告知这一决定的其他人告诉我，他们认识一些前员工，他们觉得自己在工资等方面受到了利用。然而，据报道，前雇员不愿意站出来，因为担心遭到报复，并且通常想摆脱整个事情，而且这些报道感觉非常模糊，我很难具体想象，但尽管如此，该人还是强烈建议不要邀请凯特和德鲁。</p><p>我觉得这不是一个足够有力的理由来禁止某人进入某个空间——或者更确切地说，我确实这么做了，但是对非常恶劣的行为的模糊匿名描述足以禁止某人，这是一个可以直接滥用的系统，所以我不认为不想使用这样的系统。此外，我有兴趣通过一次短暂的访问来了解凯特·伍兹（Kat Woods）——她只要求访问一周。所以我接受了，尽管我告诉她这让我很伤心。 （ <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rldJBi3eVVeqZjqbpCljgz9rmfNbuQW7HMEpugsPWt4/edit"><u>这是我发送给她的决定电子邮件的链接。</u></a> ）</p><p> （做出这个决定后，我也链接到了这个不祥但仍然模糊的<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4S2NCysoJxgCBuB6/announcing-nonlinear-emergency-funding?commentId=5P75dFuKLo894MQFf"><u>EA 论坛帖子</u></a>，其中包括 Kat Woods 的一位前同事说他们不喜欢与她一起工作，还有更多像我上面收到的评论一样的评论，以及很多链接Glassdoor 上对非线性联合创始人艾默生·斯帕茨 (Emerson Spartz) 的前公司“Dose”进行了强烈负面评论。请注意，一半以上的负面评论是针对艾默生出售后的公司，但这是 2015 年以来的一个令人担忧的评论（当时艾默生·斯帕茨 (Emerson Spartz) 是首席执行官/联合创始人） <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW8511849.htm"><u>）：“所有这些超级正面的评论都是由高层管理人员委托的。这是您应该了解 Spartz 的第一件事，我认为这很好地了解了公司的优先事项……更多地关心为之工作的人</u></a>”。2017 年<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW8511849.htm"><u>的一篇评论</u></a>称，“<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW14177614.htm"><u>这种文化是有毒的，有很多派系、内部冲突和相互指责。</u></a> ”还有一些关于地狱般的工作场所的更糟糕的评论，非常令人担忧，但它们是在艾默生的 LinkedIn 表示他离开之后的时期，所以我不确定他在多大程度上对他们负责。）</p><p>在她来访的第一天，办公室里的另一个人私下联系我，说他们非常担心凯特和德鲁在办公室，并且他们认识两名与他们一起工作过的糟糕经历的员工。他们写道（我们后来进行了更多讨论）：</p><blockquote><p>他们的公司 Nonlinear 有着非法和不道德行为的历史，他们会吸引年轻人和天真的人来为他们工作，并在他们到达时让他们处于不人道的工作条件下，不支付他们承诺的工资，并要求他们做非法的事情作为他们实习的一部分。我个人认识两个经历过此事的人，他们因为受到报复的威胁而不敢发声，特别是凯特·伍兹和艾默生·斯巴茨。</p></blockquote><p>这引发了（对我来说）100-200 小时的调查，我采访了 10-15 名与非线性互动或工作过的人，阅读了许多书面文档，并试图拼凑出一些发生的事情。</p><p>我的结论是，他们的两名现场员工确实在与非线性公司合作时经历了非常可怕的经历，艾默生·斯帕茨和凯特·伍兹对有害的动态和员工事后的沉默负有重大责任。在调查非线性公司的过程中，我开始相信，那里的前雇员没有合法的就业机会，工资微薄，由于旅行而受到很大的孤立，如果他们辞职或发表对非线性公司的负面言论，他们就会隐含和明确地威胁进行报复。收到了很多（在我看来通常是空洞的）爱意之言以及家庭和浪漫之爱的要求，经历了许多进一步的不愉快或危险的经历，如果他们没有为非线性工作，他们就不会经历这些，并且需要几个月的时间才能恢复之后，在他们感觉能够重返工作岗位之前与朋友和家人一起。</p><p> （请注意，我认为上面引用的文字中描述的薪酬情况并不完全准确，我认为它非常小 - 1000 美元/月 - 并且员工隐含地期望他们会得到比他们实际得到的更多的收入，但有大部分不是“承诺”但没有兑现的工资。）</p><p>在第一次听到他们讲述他们的经历后，我仍然不确定事情的真相——我对非线性联合创始人了解不多，也不知道我可以对哪些关于社会动态的说法充满信心。为了了解更多背景信息，我花了大约 30 多个小时与 10 到 15 个不同的人通电话，这些人至少与 Kat、Emerson 和 Drew 之一有过一些专业的往来，试图建立对人员和组织的了解，这通过了解许多人的经历的共同点，对我建立自己的理解有很大帮助。我与许多与艾默生和凯特有过互动的人进行了交谈，他们对他们有很多积极的道德担忧和强烈的负面意见，而且我还与非线性联合创始人就这些担忧进行了 3 小时的对话，现在我对员工报告的一些动态。</p><p>对于大部分谈话，我都严格保密，但（经前雇员同意）我在这里写下了我学到的一些东西。</p><p>在这篇文章中，我不打算说出与我交谈过的大多数人的名字，但我会称呼两名前雇员为“爱丽丝”和“克洛伊”。我认为所涉及的人大多希望将这段生活抛在脑后，我会鼓励人们尊重他们的隐私，不要在网上提及他们的名字，也不要与他们谈论这件事，除非你已经是他们的好朋友了。</p><p> <strong>2023 年 3 月 7 日与 Kat 的对话</strong></p><p>回到我最初的经历：在他们来访的周二，我仍然不知道这些人是谁，也不知道发生了什么事情的任何细节，但我找到了一个在午餐时与凯特聊天的机会。</p><p>在聊了大约 15 分钟后，我表示我有兴趣讨论我在电子邮件中提出的问题，我们在私人房间里聊了 30-40 分钟。我们一坐下，凯特就开始讲述她的两名前雇员的故事，反复告诉我不要相信其中一名雇员（“爱丽丝”），她与真相的关系很糟糕，她很危险，而且她对社区的声誉构成风险。她说另一名员工（“克洛伊”）“很好”。</p><p>凯特·伍兹还告诉我，她希望对员工有一个“我不说你坏话，你也不说我坏话”的政策。我原则上强烈反对这种政策（正如我当时告诉她的那样）。这个细节和其他细节给我带来了进一步的危险信号（即薪资政策），我想了解发生了什么。</p><p>以下是她告诉我的内容的概述：</p><ul><li>当 Alice 和 Chloe 在 Nonlinear 工作时，他们有自己的开支（房费、伙食费、食物费），Chloe 还每月获得 1,000 美元的奖金。</li><li>爱丽丝和克洛伊与凯特、爱默生和德鲁住在同一所房子里。凯特说，她决定今后不再与员工住在一起。</li><li>她说，Alice 孵化了自己的项目（<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220321075904/https://www.nonlinear.org/hiringagency.html"><u>这里是非线性网站上孵化项目的描述</u></a>），能够设定自己的工资，而且 Alice 几乎从未与她（Kat）或她的其他老板（Emerson）交谈过。关于她的工资。</li><li>凯特不相信爱丽丝会说实话，而且爱丽丝有过“灾难性的误解”的历史。</li><li> Kat 告诉我 Alice 不清楚孵化的条款，并说 Alice 应该向 Kat 询问以避免这种误解。</li><li> Kat 表示，Alice 可能已经退出了很大一部分，因为 Kat 在接近尾声时错过了 Zoom 上的签到电话。</li><li> Kat表示，她希望Alice能够遵循“我不说你坏话，你也不说我坏话”的原则，但该员工并没有坚持自己的立场，而是散布了关于她的负面信息。凯特/非线性。</li><li>凯特说，她对爱丽丝给出了负面评价，建议人们“不要雇用她”，也不要资助她，“她对社区来说真的很危险”。</li><li>她说她和另一位员工克洛伊没有这些问题，她说她“很好，只是错误地选择了”“助理/运营经理”的角色，这就是导致她辞职的原因。凯特说，克洛伊技术相当熟练，但为凯特做了很多她不喜欢的卑微劳动。</li><li>她对 Chloe 所说的一件负面的事情是，她每年的工资相当于 75,000 美元<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref8a69v0tq2qo"><sup><a href="#fn8a69v0tq2qo">[1]</a></sup></span> （每月只有 1,000 美元，其余的来自食宿），但有一次她要求<i>支付</i>75,000 美元<i>最重要</i>的是要支付所有费用，这是不可能的。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefo53culramn"><sup><a href="#fno53culramn">[2]</a></sup></span></li></ul><h2>员工非线性体验的高级概述</h2><p><strong>背景</strong></p><p>非线性核心人员包括 Emerson Spartz、Kat Woods 和 Drew Spartz。</p><p> Kat Woods 已在 EA 生态系统工作了至少 10 年，于 2013 年共同创立了 Charity Science，并在那里工作到 2019 年。在 Charity Entrepreneurship 工作一年后，她于 2021 年与 Emerson Spartz 共同<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fX8JsabQyRSd7zWiD/introducing-the-nonlinear-fund-ai-safety-research-incubation"><u>创立了</u></a>Nonlinear，并在那里工作了 2.5 年。</p><p> Nonlinear 于 2022 年上半年<a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2022-h1-recommendations"><u>从</u></a>生存与繁荣基金获得了 599,000 美元，并于 2022 年 1 月<a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/nonlinear-fund-personal-assistant-hiring-agency/"><u>从</u></a>开放慈善基金获得了 15,000 美元。</p><p>艾默生主要通过他以前的公司 Dose 和出售 Mugglenet.com（他创立的）获得的个人财富为该项目提供资金。艾默生和凯特是浪漫的伴侣，艾默生和德鲁是兄弟。他们都住在同一栋房子里，一起环游世界，每月从爱彼迎跳到爱彼迎一两次。他们雇用的员工要么远程办公，要么与他们住在同一栋房子里。</p><p>我目前的理解是，他们有大约 4 名远程实习生、1 名远程员工和 2 名现场员工（Alice 和 Chloe）。爱丽丝是唯一经历过他们的孵化器项目的人。</p><p>非线性试图建立一种相当高的承诺文化，让长期员工在个人和职业上与核心家庭单位密切相关。然而，他们的经济独立性极低，而且其中涉及的许多社会动态对我来说似乎确实很危险。</p><p><strong>爱丽丝和克洛伊</strong></p><p>Alice从2021年11月到2022年6月在那里工作，Chloe从2022年1月到2022年7月在那里工作。在与他们两人交谈后，我了解到以下情况：</p><ul><li>两人在任何时候都没有合法受雇于非营利组织。</li><li>克洛伊和爱丽丝的财务（以及凯特和德鲁的）都直接来自艾默生的个人资金（而不是来自非营利组织）。这使得他们必须获得个人购买许可，并且在与家庭单位一起工作时，他们无法与家庭单位分开居住，并且他们报告说，在他们工作期间，他们在社会和经济上感到非常依赖家庭。</li><li> Chloe 的薪水被口头同意为每年 75,000 美元左右。然而，她每月的工资只有 1000 美元，除此之外还有很多基本的补偿，比如房租、杂货、旅行。这本来是为了让一起旅行变得更容易，并且应该达到相同的薪水水平。虽然艾默生确实为爱丽丝和克洛伊提供了食物、膳食和旅行方面的补偿，但克洛伊认为她得到的补偿金额并不等于所讨论的工资，而且我相信没有对爱丽丝或克洛伊进行会计处理以确保任何工资都匹配。 （我对他们的爱彼迎和旅行费用进行了一些抽查，爱丽丝/克洛伊的认知状态对我来说似乎相当合理。）</li><li>爱丽丝作为唯一的人加入了他们的孵化计划。在 EAG 与 Nonlinear 会面并与 Emerson 进行了约 4 小时的交谈，以及与 Kat 进行了第二次 Zoom 通话后，她搬进了他们的住处。最初，在与他们一起旅行时，她远程继续之前的工作，但被鼓励辞职并在孵化组织工作，两个月后，她辞去了工作，开始与 Nonlinear 合作开展项目。在她在那里的 8 个月里，Alice 声称她前 5 个月没有收到工资，然后（大约）两个月每月工资 1,000 美元，然后在她辞职后，她收到了约 6,000 美元的一次性工资（来自分配给她孵化的组织的资金）。她还承保了大量紧急健康问题。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefylc0clu1ffa"><sup><a href="#fnylc0clu1ffa">[3]</a></sup></span></li><li>薪资谈判一直是爱丽丝在非线性公司期间的主要压力源。在那里，她度过了所有的财务困境，最后几个月的很大一部分时间都在财务上处于亏损状态（账单和医疗费用比她银行账户里的钱还多），部分原因是等待工资来自非线性的付款。由于个人资金极少以及希望从非线性公司获得财务独立，她最终辞职了。当她退出时，她（根据他们的要求）给予了非线性公司她原本已经完成孵化的组织的全部所有权。</li><li>通过与 Alice 和 Nonlinear 的交谈，发现在 Alice 在那里工作结束时，自 2 月底以来，Kat Woods 一直将 Alice 视为她管理的员工，但 Emerson 并未将 Alice 视为员工，主要是因为她愿意而与他们一起旅行并合作的人，每月 1000 美元加上其他报酬是一份慷慨的礼物。</li><li>爱丽丝和克洛伊报告说，凯特、艾默生和德鲁创造了一个环境，在这个环境中，成为非线性的有价值的成员包括在解决问题方面具有创业精神和创造力——实际上，这通常意味着强烈鼓励绕过标准的社会规则来获得你想要的东西，包括通过向员工施压来获得某人最喜欢的餐桌，以及寻找与其工作相关的法律漏洞。这也适用于组织内部。爱丽丝和克洛伊报告说，在为非线性公司工作期间，他们被迫或被说服采取了多项令他们感到非常后悔的行动，例如在经济上非常依赖艾默生、放弃素食、在外国无证驾驶数月。 （需要明确的是，我并不是说这些法律是好的，违反这些法律是坏的，我是说，从他们的报告中听来，他们确信采取可能会带来严重个人负面影响的行动，例如入狱）他们自信地认为，如果不是由于非线性联合创始人的强大压力和公司内部的敌对社会环境，他们不会采取这些行动。）我将描述下面将更详细地介绍这些事件。</li><li>他们都表示，在与非线性公司结束关系后，他们需要几个月的时间才能恢复，然后才感到能够再次工作，并且都称在那里工作是他们一生中最糟糕的经历之一。</li><li>他们都报告说，他们非常担心非线性公司因与我交谈而遭受的职业和个人报复，并向我讲述了故事并向我展示了一些文本，使我相信这是一个非常可信的担忧。</li></ul><h2>各种报告的经历</h2><p>这两位员工在非线性公司的经历中有很多部分让他们感到非常不愉快和受伤。我将在下面总结其中的一些内容。</p><p>我认为发生的许多事情都是警告信号，我也认为有一些红线，我将在这篇文章的底部讨论我的想法，即我的要点中哪些是红线。</p><p><strong>我对这些报告的信任程度</strong></p><p>大多数动态都被多个不同的人描述为准确的（低工资、没有法律结构、孤立、社会操纵的一些因素、恐吓），这让我对它们有很高的信心，非线性自己也证实了这些动态的各个部分。账户。</p><p>我会有意义地更新有关这类事情的人的言论，他们都保证克洛伊的话是可靠的。</p><p>非线性工作人员和少数在爱丽丝和克洛伊工作期间拜访的其他人强烈质疑爱丽丝的可信度，并暗示她完全撒了谎。 Nonlinear 向我展示了一些短信，其中与 Alice 交谈过的人留下的印象是她的工资是 0 美元或 500 美元，这是不准确的（正如她告诉我的那样，她在网上的工资约为 8000 美元）。</p><p>也就是说，我个人发现爱丽丝非常愿意并准备根据要求与我分享主要来源（短信、银行信息等），所以我不相信她有恶意。</p><p>在我与她的第一次谈话中，凯特声称爱丽丝有很多灾难性的沟通错误，但克洛伊（引用）“很好”。总的来说，没有人质疑克洛伊的话，而那些告诉我他们质疑爱丽丝的话的人大体上说他们相信克洛伊的话。</p><p>就我个人而言，我发现他们对报复的所有恐惧都是真实而认真的，并且在我看来是有道理的。</p><p><strong>为什么我要分享这些</strong></p><p>我确实有一个强烈的启发，即同意的成年人可以同意各种最终伤害他们的事情（即接受这些工作），即使我家长式地可能认为我可以阻止他们伤害自己。也就是说，我有明显的理由认为凯特、艾默生和德鲁恐吓这些人，让他们接受一些伤害他们的行为或动态，所以有些部分在我看来显然不是双方同意的。</p><p>除此之外，我认为其他人知道他们正在做什么是有好处的，所以我认为分享这些信息很好，因为它对于许多有可能使用非线性工作的人来说是相关的。对我来说最重要的是，我特别想这样做，因为在我看来，非线性已经试图阻止这种负面信息被共享，所以我在共享事物方面犯了强烈的错误。</p><p> （其中一名员工还想谈谈她为何为这篇文章做出贡献，我已将其放在脚注中。 <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref2ad0whew08p"><sup><a href="#fn2ad0whew08p">[4]</a></sup></span> ）</p><p><strong>财务和社会环境高度依赖</strong></p><p>每个人都住在同一所房子里。艾默生和凯特会共用一个房间，其他人会凑合着用其他可用的东西，通常共用卧室。</p><p> Nonlinear 主要在他们通常不认识当地人的国家/地区流动，员工通常除了联合创始人之外没有人可以互动，员工报告说，他们被拒绝住在与联合创始人不同的爱彼迎上。</p><p>爱丽丝和克洛伊报告说，他们被建议不要花时间与“低价值的人”在一起，包括他们的家人、浪漫伴侣以及他们居住地的任何当地人，但非线性邀请的客人/访客除外。爱丽丝和克洛伊报告说，这使他们在社交上非常依赖凯特/艾默生/德鲁，并且在其他方​​面非常孤立。</p><p>员工们对于非线性公司会支付什么费用和不会支付什么费用的界限非常不清楚。例如，爱丽丝和克洛伊报告说，他们曾经花了几天的时间开车在波多黎各周围寻找更便宜的医疗服务，然后将其提供给高级工作人员，因为他们不知道医疗费用是否会被覆盖，所以他们想确保尽可能便宜地增加高级员工同意的机会。</p><p>财务状况复杂、混乱。这在很大程度上是因为他们很少进行会计处理。总而言之，Alice 在过去 2 个月的大部分时间里，银行账户里的存款都不足 1000 欧元，有时还需要打电话给艾默生进行即时转账，以便能够支付她看医生时的医疗费用。当她辞职时，她的账户里有 700 欧元，这不足以支付她月底的账单，这让她非常害怕。不过需要明确的是，非线性公司在一周内就向她偿还了约 2900 欧元的拖欠工资，部分原因是她强烈要求。 （这里的相关问题是极高的财务依赖性和贫富差距，但爱丽丝并没有声称非线性公司未能支付他们的费用。）</p><p> Alice 表示，她坚持这么久的主要原因之一是，她希望通过启动自己的孵化项目实现财务独立，该项目分配了 10 万美元（由 FTX 筹集资金）。在她在那里的最后一个月，凯特告诉她，虽然她会完全独立工作，但他们会将钱存入非线性银行账户，她会索要这笔钱，这意味着她不会像她所期望的那样从他们那里获得财务独立，得知这一点是爱丽丝放弃的原因。</p><p>其中一名员工采访了凯特，询问她的生产力建议，并与我分享了这次采访的笔记。该员工写道：</p><blockquote><p>在采访中，凯特公开承认自己效率不高，但她表示，她看起来仍然很有效率，因为她让别人为她工作。她依靠愿意为她做免费工作的志愿者，这是她提高生产力的首要建议。</p></blockquote><p>员工们报告说，一些实习生后来对无薪工作提出了强烈的负面反馈，因此凯特决定不再雇用实习生。</p><p><strong>如果工作关系不顺利，可能会面临严重的不利影响</strong></p><p>在艾默生·斯帕茨 (Emerson Spartz) 与其中一名员工的对话中，该员工向一位想在受雇期间寻找另一份工作的朋友寻求建议，但尚未让现任雇主知道他们离职的决定。据报道，艾默生立即表示，他现在必须更新，考虑到该员工本人正在考虑离开非线性公司。他接着告诉她，他对那些离开公司去从事同样好或不太好的工作的员工感到生气；他说，他理解员工是否为了明显更好的机会而离开。员工报告说，这导致他们非常害怕离开工作，这既是因为艾默生更新了员工现在试图离职的想法，也因为艾默生对因“原因”而离职的员工进行报复。不好的理由”。</p><p>有关艾默生经营理念的背景信息：爱丽丝引用艾默生建议的以下工作进度指标：“您能够在短时间内从他人那里获取多少价值？” <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnreft84or63yyei"><sup><a href="#fnt84or63yyei">[5]</a></sup></span>另一位来访者向我描述艾默生“总是试图利用他所有的讨价还价能力”。克洛伊告诉我，当她代表非线性公司与外部合作伙伴谈判薪资时，艾默生建议她在谈判薪资时，提供“你能接受的最低数字”。</p><p>许多不同的人报告说，艾默生·斯帕茨会向员工和访客吹嘘他的商业谈判策略。他会鼓励员工阅读许多有关战略和影响力的书籍。当他们读<a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197"><u>《权力的48条法则》</u></a>一书时，他会举出他在过去的商业实践中遵循“法则”的例子。</p><p>他向员工和访客讲述的一个故事是关于他在与他的前青少年学员阿多里安·戴克 (Adorian Deck) 发生冲突时所采取的恐吓策略。</p><p> （有关冲突的背景，请参阅当时撰写的相关文章的链接： <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/teen-who-created-omgfacts-twitter-182620/"><u>Hollywood Reporter</u></a> 、 <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/business/2011/05/16/california-teens-lawsuit-over-twitter-feed-underscores-power-tweet/15903568007/"><u>Jacksonville</u></a> 、 <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2011/05/thoughts_on_the.htm"><u>Technology &amp; Marketing Law Blog</u></a>和<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110513103830/https://emersonspartz.tumblr.com/post/5150292566"><u>Emerson Spartz&#39;s Tumblr</u></a> 。另外，这里是他们签署的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110824205315/http://www.omgfactslawsuit.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CONTRACT.pdf"><u>法律合同</u></a>，Deck 后来起诉撤销。）</p><p>简而言之，Adorian Deck 是一位 16 岁的年轻人（2009 年）创建了一个名为“OMGFacts”的 Twitter 帐户，该帐户很快就拥有超过 300,000 名粉丝。艾默生主动寻求在该品牌下建立公司，并同意与 Adorian 达成协议。不到一年后，阿多里安想要退出这笔交易，声称艾默生赚取了超过 10 万美元的利润，而他只看到了 100 美元，并提起诉讼以终止交易。</p><p>根据艾默生的说法，事实证明，加州有一个独特的条款（由于洛杉矶的演艺职业），即使未成年人与其父母签署了合同，除非在法官的监督下签署，否则合同无效，因此他们能够简单地退出交易。</p><p>但时至今日，艾默生公司仍然拥有 OMGfacts 品牌和公司以及 Youtube 频道。</p><p> （旁注：我并不是想断言在这些冲突中谁是“正确的”，我将这些作为埃默罗斯恩谈判策略的例子进行报道，据报道他在冲突期间参与并积极支持这些策略。）</p><p>艾默生向与我交谈过的不同人讲述了这个故事的不同版本（人们认为他在“吹牛”）。</p><p>在一个版本中，他声称他用无休无止的法律威胁对阿多里安和他的母亲进行了武装，他们做出了让步，让他完全控制了该品牌。与我交谈的这个人不记得细节，但他说艾默生试图吓唬德克和他的母亲，而他们（艾默生吹嘘的那个人）觉得这“令人恐惧”，并认为这种行为是“类似于 7 标准的行为”偏离了该领域的通常规范。”</p><p>另一个人在《权力48条法则》第二条法则的背景下讲述了这个故事，即“永远不要过于信任朋友，学会如何利用敌人”。摘要包括</p><blockquote><p>“要警惕朋友——他们会更快地背叛你，因为他们很容易被嫉妒。他们也会变得被宠坏和暴虐……你更害怕朋友而不是敌人。”</p></blockquote><p>对于这个听过阿多里安故事的人来说，当他讲述这个故事时，最能引起共鸣的是他声称自己与阿多里安有着密切的指导关系，并且对他非常了解，以至于他知道“到底该去哪里”伤害他最深”，这样他就会退缩。在那个版本的故事中，他说 Deck 的人生目标是成为一名 YouTuber（直到今天这确实是 Deck 的职业——<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AdorianDeck"><u>他每月制作大约 4 个视频</u></a>），而艾默生策略性地联系了 Deck 最欣赏的 YouTuber，并向他们讲述了德克偷懒并试图将艾默生的所有工作归功于自己的故事。据报道，他威胁要采取更多行动，直到德克做出让步，这就是德克放弃诉讼的原因。那个人对我说：“他爱他，非常了解他，并用这些知识摧毁了他。” <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefzcp7frumok"><sup><a

who ended or turned down working together with Nonlinear.</p><p> Here are some texts between Kat Woods and Alice shortly after Alice had quit, before the final salary had been paid. </p><p><img

</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Lc8r4tZ2L5txxokZ8/cd087amewavbd71uq75z"></p><p> (I can corroborate that it was difficult to directly talk with the former employee and it took a fair bit of communication through indirect social channels before they were willing to identify themselves to me and talk about the details.)</p><p> <strong>Effusive positive emotion not backed up by reality, and other manipulative techniques</strong></p><p> Multiple people who worked with Kat reported that Kat had a pattern of enforcing arbitrary short deadlines on people in order to get them to make the decision she wants eg <i>“I need a decision by the end of this call”</i> , or (in an email to Alice) “ <i>This is urgent and important. There are people working on saving the world and we can&#39;t let our issues hold them back from doing their work.”</i></p><p> Alice reported feeling emotionally manipulated. She said she got constant compliments from the founders that ended up seeming fake.</p><p> Alice wrote down a string of the compliments at the time from Kat Woods (said out loud and that Alice wrote down in text), here is a sampling of them that she shared with me:</p><blockquote><p> “You&#39;re the kind of person I bet on, you&#39;re a beast, you&#39;re an animal, I think you are extraordinary&quot;</p><p> &quot;You can be in the top 10, you really just have to think about where you want to be, you have to make sacrifices to be on the top, you can be the best, only if you sacrifice enough&quot;</p><p> &quot;You&#39;re working more than 99% because you care more than 99% because you&#39;re a leader and going to save the world&quot;</p><p> &quot;You can&#39;t fail if you commit to [this project], you have what it takes, you get sh*t done and everyone will hail you in EA, finally an executor among us.&quot;</p></blockquote><p> Alice reported that she would get these compliments near-daily. She eventually had the sense that this was said in order to get something out of her. She reported that one time, after a series of such compliments, the Kat Woods then turned and recorded a near-identical series of compliments into their phone for a different person.</p><p> Kat Woods reportedly several times cried while telling Alice that she wanted the employee in their life forever and was worried that this employee would ever not be in Kat&#39;s life.</p><p> Other times when Alice would come to Kat with money troubles and asking for a pay rise, Alice reports that Kat would tell them that this was a psychological issue and that actually they had safety, for instance they could move back in with their parents, so they didn&#39;t need to worry.</p><p> Alice also reports that she was explicitly advised by Kat Woods to cry and look cute when asking Emerson Spartz for a salary improvement, in order to get the salary improvement that she wanted, and was told this was a reliable way to get things from Emerson. (Alice reports that she did not follow this advice.)</p><p> <strong>Many other strong personal costs</strong></p><p> Alice quit being vegan while working there. She was sick with covid in a foreign country, with only the three Nonlinear cofounders around, but nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food, so she barely ate for 2 days. Alice eventually gave in and ate non-vegan food in the house. She also said that the Nonlinear cofounders marked her quitting veganism as a &#39;win&#39;, as they thad been arguing that she should not be vegan.</p><p> (Nonlinear disputes this, and says that they did go out and buy her some vegan burgers food and had some vegan food in the house. They agree that she quit being vegan at this time, and say it was because being vegan was unusually hard due to being in Puerto Rico. Alice disputes that she received any vegan burgers.)</p><p> Alice said that this generally matched how she and Chloe were treated in the house, as people generally not worth spending time on, because they were &#39;low value&#39; (ie in terms of their hourly wage), and that they were the people who had to do chores around the house (eg Alice was still asked to do house chores during the period where she was sick and not eating).</p><p> By the same reasoning, the employees reported that they were given 100% of the menial tasks around the house (cleaning, tidying, etc) due to their lower value of time to the company. For instance, if a cofounder spilled food in the kitchen, the employees would clean it up. This was generally reported as feeling very demeaning.</p><p> Alice and Chloe reported a substantial conflict within the household between Kat and Alice. Alice was polyamorous, and she and Drew entered into a casual romantic relationship. Kat previously had a polyamorous marriage that ended in divorce, and is now monogamously partnered with Emerson. Kat reportedly told Alice that she didn&#39;t mind polyamory &quot;on the other side of the world”, but couldn&#39;t stand it right next to her, and probably either Alice would need to become monogamous or Alice should leave the organization. Alice didn&#39;t become monogamous. Alice reports that Kat became increasingly cold over multiple months, and was very hard to work with. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefuvloifuhbna"><sup><a href="#fnuvloifuhbna">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p> Alice reports then taking a vacation to visit her family, and trying to figure out how to repair the relationship with Kat. Before she went on vacation, Kat requested that Alice bring a variety of illegal drugs across the border for her (some recreational, some for productivity). Alice argued that this would be dangerous for her personally, but Emerson and Kat reportedly argued that it is not dangerous at all and was “absolutely risk-free”. Privately, Drew said that Kat would “love her forever” if she did this. I bring this up as an example of the sorts of requests that Kat/Emerson/Drew felt comfortable making during Alice&#39;s time there.</p><p> Chloe was hired by Nonlinear with the intent to have them do executive assistant tasks for Nonlinear ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211022160447/https://www.nonlinear.org/operations.html"><u>this is the job ad they responded to</u></a> ). After being hired and flying out, Chloe was informed that on a daily basis their job would involve driving eg to get groceries when they were in different countries. She explained that she didn&#39;t have a drivers&#39; license and didn&#39;t know how to drive. Kat/Emerson proposed that Chloe learn to drive, and Drew gave her some driving lessons. When Chloe learned to drive well enough in parking lots, she said she was ready to get her license, but she discovered that she couldn&#39;t get a license in a foreign country. Kat/Emerson/Drew reportedly didn&#39;t seem to think that mattered or was even part of the plan, and strongly encouraged Chloe to just drive without a license to do their work, so she drove ~daily for 1-2 months without a license. (I think this involved physical risks for the employee and bystanders, and also substantial risks of being in jail in a foreign country. Also, Chloe basically never drove Emerson/Drew/Kat, this was primarily solo driving for daily errands.) Eventually Chloe had a minor collision with a street post, and was a bit freaked out because she had no idea what the correct protocols were. She reported that Kat/Emerson/Drew didn&#39;t think that this was a big deal, but that Alice (who she was on her way to meet) could clearly see that Chloe was distressed by this, and Alice drove her home, and Chloe then decided to stop driving.</p><p> (Car accidents are the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_injury_deaths_highlighting_unintentional_2018-508.pdf"><u>second most common cause of death</u></a> for people in their age group. Insofar as they were pressured to do this and told that this was safe, I think this involved a pretty cavalier disregard for the safety of the person who worked for them.)</p><p> Chloe talked to a friend of hers (who is someone I know fairly well, and was the first person to give me a negative report about Nonlinear), reporting that they were very depressed. When Chloe described her working conditions, her friend was horrified, and said she had to get out immediately since, in their words, “this was clearly an abusive situation”. The friend offered to pay for flights out of the country, and tried to convince her to quit immediately. Eventually Chloe made a commitment to book a flight by a certain date and then followed through with that.</p><p> <strong>Lax on legalities and adversarial business practices</strong></p><p> I did not find the time to write much here. For now I&#39;ll simply pass on my impressions.</p><p> I generally got a sense from speaking with many parties that Emerson Spartz and Kat Woods respectively have very adversarial and very lax attitudes toward legalities and bureaucracies, with the former trying to do as little as possible that is asked of him. If I asked them to fill out paperwork I would expect it was filled out at least reluctantly and plausibly deceptively or adversarially in some way. In my current epistemic state, I would be actively concerned about any project in the EA or x-risk ecosystems that relied on Nonlinear doing any accounting or having a reliable legal structure that has had the basics checked.</p><p> Personally, if I were giving Nonlinear funds for any project whatsoever, including for regranting, I&#39;d expect it&#39;s quite plausible (>;20%) that they didn&#39;t spend the funds on what they told me, and instead will randomly spend it on some other project. If I had previously funded Nonlinear for any projects, I would be keen to ask Nonlinear for receipts to show whether they spent their funds in accordance with what they said they would.</p><p> <strong>This is not a complete list</strong></p><p> I want to be clear that this is not a <i>complete</i> list of negative or concerning experiences, this is an <i>illustrative</i> list. There are many other things that I was told about that I am not including here due to factors like length and people&#39;s privacy (on all sides). Also I split them up into the categories as I see them; someone else might make a different split.</p><p> <strong>Perspectives From Others Who Have Worked or Otherwise Been Close With Nonlinear</strong></p><p> I had hoped to work this into a longer section of quotes, but it seemed like too much back-and-forth with lots of different people. I encourage folks to leave comments with their relevant impressions.</p><p> For now I&#39;ll summarize some of what I learned as follows:</p><ul><li> Several people gave reports consistent with Alice and Chloe being very upset and distressed both during and after their time at Nonlinear, and reaching out for help, and seeming really strongly to want to get away from Nonlinear.</li><li> Some unpaid interns (who worked remotely for Nonlinear for 1-3 months) said that they regretted not getting paid, and that when they brought it up with Kat Woods she said some positive sounding things and they expected she would get back to them about it, but that never happened during the rest of their internships.</li><li> Many people who visited had fine experiences with Nonlinear, others felt much more troubled by the experience.</li><li> One person said to me about Emerson/Drew/Kat:<ul><li> <i>&quot;My subjective feeling is like &#39;they seemed to be really bad and toxic people&#39;. And they at the same time have a decent amount of impact. After I interacted repeatedly with them I was highly confused about the dilemma of people who are mistreating other people, but are doing some good.&quot;</i></li></ul></li><li> Another person said about Emerson:<ul><li> <i>“He seems to think he&#39;s extremely competent, a genius, and that everyone else is inferior to him. They should learn everything they can from him, he has nothing to learn from them. He said things close to this explicitly. Drew and (to a lesser extent) Kat really bought into him being the new messiah.”</i></li></ul></li><li> One person who has worked for Kat Woods (not Alice or Chloe) said the following:<ul><li> <i>I love her as a person, hate her as a boss. She&#39;s fun, has a lot of ideas, really good socialite, and I think that that speaks to how she&#39;s able to get away with a lot of things. Able to wear different masks in different places. She&#39;s someone who&#39;s easy to trust, easy to build social relationships with. I&#39;d be suspicious of anyone who gives a reference who&#39;s never been below Kat in power.</i></li><li> <i>Ben: Do you think Kat is emotionally manipulative?</i></li><li> <i>I think she is. I think it&#39;s a fine line about what makes an excellent entrepreneur. Do whatever it takes to get a deal signed. To get it across the line. Depends a lot on what the power dynamics are, whether it&#39;s a problem or not. If people are in equal power structures it&#39;s less of a problem.</i></li></ul></li></ul><p> There were other informative conversations that I won&#39;t summarize. I encourage folks who have worked with or for Nonlinear to comment with their perspective.</p><h2> Conversation with Nonlinear</h2><p> After putting the above together, I got permission from Alice and Chloe to publish, and to share the information I had learned as I saw fit. So I booked a call with Nonlinear, sent them a long list of concerns, and talked with Emerson, Kat and Drew for ~3 hours to hear them out.</p><p> <strong>Paraphrasing Nonlinear</strong></p><p> On the call, they said their primary intention in the call was to convince me that Alice is a bald-faced liar. They further said they&#39;re terrified of Alice making false claims about them, and that she is in a powerful position to hurt them with false accusations.</p><p> Afterwards, I wrote up a paraphrase of their responses. I shared it with Emerson and he replied that it was a “Good summary!”. Below is the paraphrase of their perspective on things that I sent them, with one minor edit for privacy. (The below is written as though Nonlinear is speaking, but to be clear this 100% my writing.)</p><ul><li> We hired one person, and kind-of-technically-hired a second person. In doing so, our intention wasn&#39;t just to have employees, but also to have members of our family unit who we traveled with and worked closely together with in having a strong positive impact in the world, and were very personally close with.</li><li> We nomadically traveled the globe. This can be quite lonely so we put a lot of work into bringing people to us, often having visitors in our house who we supported with flights and accommodation. This probably wasn&#39;t perfect but in general we&#39;d describe the environment as &quot;quite actively social&quot;.</li><li> For the formal employee, she responded to a job ad, we interviewed her, and it all went the standard way. For the gradually-employed employee, we initially just invited her to travel with us and co-work, as she seemed like a successful entrepreneur and aligned in terms of our visions for improving the world. Over time she quit her existing job and we worked on projects together and were gradually bringing her into our organization.</li><li> We wanted to give these employees a pretty standard amount of compensation, but also mostly not worry about negotiating minor financial details as we traveled the world. So we covered basic rent/groceries/travel for these people. On top of that, to the formal employee we gave a $1k/month salary, and to the semi-formal employee we eventually did the same too. For the latter employee, we roughly paid her ~$8k over the time she worked with us.</li><li> From our perspective, the gradually-hired employees gave a falsely positive impression of their financial and professional situation, suggesting they&#39;d accomplished more than they had and were earning more than they had. They ended up being fairly financially dependent on us and we didn&#39;t expect that.</li><li> Eventually, after about 6-8 months each, both employees quit. Overall this experiment went poorly from our perspective and we&#39;re not going to try it in future.</li><li> For the formal employee, we&#39;re a bit unsure about why exactly she quit, even though we did do exit interviews with her. She said she didn&#39;t like a lot of the menial work (which is what we hired her for), but didn&#39;t say that money was the problem. We think it is probably related to everyone getting Covid and being kind of depressed around that time.</li><li> For the other employee, relations got bad for various reasons. She ended up wanting total control of the org she was incubating with us, rather than 95% control as we&#39;d discussed, but that wasn&#39;t on the table (the org had $250k dedicated to it that we&#39;d raised!), and so she quit.</li><li> When she was leaving, we were financially supportive. On the day we flew back from the Bahamas to London, we paid all our outstanding reimbursements (~$2900). We also offered to pay for her to have a room in London for a week as she got herself sorted out. We also offered her rooms with our friends if she promised not to tell them lies about us behind our backs.</li><li> After she left, we believe she told a lot of lies and inaccurate stories about us. For instance, two people we talked to had the impression that we either paid her $0 or $500, which is demonstrably false. Right now we&#39;re pretty actively concerned that she is telling lots of false stories in order to paint us in a negative light, because the relationship didn&#39;t work out and she didn&#39;t get control over her org (and because her general character seems drama-prone).</li></ul><p> There were some points around the experiences of these employees that we want to respond to.</p><ul><li>第一的; the formal employee drove without a license for 1-2 months in Puerto Rico. We taught her to drive, which she was excited about. You might think this is a substantial legal risk, but basically it isn&#39;t, as you can see <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/laws-of-puerto-rico/title-nine-highways-and-traffic/chapter-27-vehicle-and-traffic-law-2000/subchapter-ii-requirements-and-procedure-for-issuance-expiration-and-renewal-of-drivers-licenses/5073-illegal-use-of-the-driving-license-and-penalties"><u>here</u></a> , the general range of fines for issues around not-having-a-license in Puerto Rico is in the range of $25 to $500, which just isn&#39;t that bad.</li><li> Second; the semi-employee said that she wasn&#39;t supported in getting vegan food when she was sick with Covid, and this is why she stopped being vegan. This seems also straightforwardly inaccurate, we brought her potatoes, vegan burgers, and had vegan food in the house. We had been advising her to 80/20 being a vegan and this probably also weighed on her decision.</li><li> Third; the semi-employee was also asked to bring some productivity-related and recreational drugs over the border for us. In general we didn&#39;t push hard on this. For one, this is an activity she already did (with other drugs). For two, we thought it didn&#39;t need prescription in the country she was visiting, and when we found out otherwise, we dropped it. And for three, she used a bunch of our drugs herself, so it&#39;s not fair to say that this request was made entirely selfishly. I think this just seems like an extension of the sorts of actions she&#39;s generally open to.</li></ul><p> Finally, multiple people (beyond our two in-person employees) told Ben they felt frightened or freaked out by some of the business tactics in the stories Emerson told them. To give context and respond to that:</p><ul><li> I, Emerson, have had a lot of exceedingly harsh and cruel business experience, including getting tricked or stabbed-in-the-back. Nonetheless, I have often prevailed in these difficult situations, and learned a lot of hard lessons about how to act in the world.</li><li> The skills required to do so seem to me lacking in many of the earnest-but-naive EAs that I meet, and I would really like them to learn how to be strong in this way. As such, I often tell EAs these stories, selecting for the most cut-throat ones, and sometimes I try to play up the harshness of how you have to respond to the threats. I think of myself as playing the role of a wise old mentor who has had lots of experience, telling stories to the young adventurers, trying to toughen them up, somewhat similar to how Prof Quirrell <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref03ez0hl92kmc"><sup><a href="#fn03ez0hl92kmc">[8]</a></sup></span> toughens up the students in HPMOR through teaching them Defense Against the Dark Arts, to deal with real monsters in the world.</li><li> For instance, I tell people about my negotiations with Adorian Deck about the OMGFacts brand and Twitter account. We signed a good deal, but a California technicality meant he could pull from it and take my whole company, which is a really illegitimate claim. They wouldn&#39;t talk with me, so I was working with top YouTubers to make some videos publicizing and exposing his bad behavior. This got him back to the negotiation table and we worked out a deal where he got $10k/month for seven years, which is not a shabby deal, and meant that I got to keep my company!</li><li> It had been reported to Ben that Emerson said he would be willing to go into legal gray areas in order to &quot;crush his enemies&quot; (if they were acting in very reprehensible and norm-violating ways). Emerson thinks this has got to be a misunderstanding, that he was talking about what other people might do to you, which is a crucial thing to discuss and model.</li></ul><p> (Here I cease pretending-to-be-Nonlinear and return to my own voice.)</p><h2> My thoughts on the ethics and my takeaways</h2><p> <strong>Summary of My Epistemic State</strong></p><p> Here are my probabilities for a few high-level claims relating to Alice and Chloe&#39;s experiences working at Nonlinear.</p><ul><li> Emerson Spartz employs more vicious and adversarial tactics in conflicts than 99% of the people active in the EA/x-risk/AI Safety communities: 95%</li><li> Alice and Chloe were more dependent on their bosses (combining financial, social, and legally) than employees are at literally every other organization I am aware of in the EA/x-risk/AI Safety ecosystem: 85% <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefpwa0kj9axw"><sup><a href="#fnpwa0kj9axw">[9]</a></sup></span></li><li> In working at Nonlinear Alice and Chloe were both took on physical and legal risks that they strongly regretted, were hurt emotionally, came away financially worse off, gained ~no professional advancement from their time at Nonlinear, and took several months after the experience to recover: 90%</li><li> Alice and Chloe both had credible reason to be very scared of retaliation for sharing negative information about their work experiences, far beyond that experienced at any other org in the EA/x-risk/AI Safety ecosystem: 85% <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefyl41dasvaar"><sup><a href="#fnyl41dasvaar">[10]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p> <strong>General Comments From Me</strong></p><p> Going forward I think anyone who works with Kat Woods, Emerson Spartz, or Drew Spartz, should sign legal employment contracts, and make sure all financial agreements are written down in emails and messages that the employee has possession of. I think all people considering employment by the above people at any non-profits they run should take salaries where money is wired to their bank accounts, and not do unpaid work or work that is compensated by ways that don&#39;t primarily include a salary being wired to their bank accounts.</p><p> I expect that if Nonlinear does more hiring in the EA ecosystem it is more-likely-than-not to chew up and spit out other bright-eyed young EAs who want to do good in the world. I relatedly think that the EA ecosystem doesn&#39;t have reliable defenses against such predators. These are not the first, nor sadly the last, bright-eyed well-intentioned people who I expect to be taken advantage of and hurt in the EA/x-risk/AI safety ecosystem, as a result of falsely trusting high-status people at EA events to be people who will treat them honorably.</p><p> (Personal aside: Regarding the texts from Kat Woods shown above — I have to say, if you want to be allies with me, you must not write texts like these. A lot of bad behavior can be learned from, fixed, and forgiven, but if you take actions to prevent me from being able to learn that the bad behavior is even going on, then I have to always be worried that something far worse is happening that I&#39;m not aware of, and indeed I have been <i>quite</i> shocked to discover how bad people&#39;s experiences were working for Nonlinear.)</p><p> My position is not greatly changed by the fact that Nonlinear is overwhelmingly confident that Alice is a “bald-faced liar”. From my current perspective, they probably have some legitimate grievances against her, but that in no way makes it less costly to our collective epistemology to incentivize her to not share her own substantial grievances. I think the magnitude of the costs they imposed on their employees-slash-new-family are far higher than I or anyone I know would have expected was happening, and they intimidated both Alice and Chloe into silence about those costs. If it were only Alice then I would give this perspective a lot more thought/weight, but Chloe reports a lot of the same dynamics and similar harms.</p><p> To my eyes, the people involved were genuinely concerned about retaliation for saying anything negative about Nonlinear, including the workplace/household dynamics and how painful their experiences had been for them. That&#39;s a red line in my book, and I will not personally work with Nonlinear in the future because of it, and I recommend their exclusion from any professional communities that wish to keep up the standard of people not being silenced about extremely negative work experiences. “ <a href="https://twitter.com/HiFromMichaelV/status/1161174071469641728"><u>First they came for the epistemology. We don&#39;t know what happened after that.</u></a> ”</p><p> Specifically, the things that cross my personal lines for working with someone or viewing them as an ally:</p><ul><li> Kat Woods attempted to offer someone who was really hurting, and in a position of strong need, very basic resources with the requirement of not saying bad things about her.</li><li> Kat Woods&#39; texts that read to me as a veiled threat to destroy someone&#39;s career for sharing negative information about her.</li><li> Emerson Spartz reportedly telling multiple people he will use questionably legal methods in order to crush his enemies (such as spurious lawsuits and that he would hire a stalker to freak someone out).</li><li> Both employees were actively afraid that Emerson Spartz would retaliate and potentially using tactics like spurious lawsuits and further things that are questionably legal, and generally try to destroy their careers and leave them with no resources. It seems to me (given the other reports I&#39;ve heard from visitors) that Emerson behaved in a way that quite understandably led them to this epistemic state, and I consider that to be his responsibility to not give his employees this impression.</li></ul><p> I think in almost any functioning professional ecosystem, there should be some general principles like:</p><ul><li> If you employ someone, after they work for you, unless they&#39;ve done something egregiously wrong or unethical, they should be comfortable continuing to work and participate in this professional ecosystem.</li><li> If you employ someone, after they work for you, they should feel comfortable talking openly about their experience working with you to others in this professional ecosystem.</li></ul><p> Any breaking of the first rule is very costly, and any breaking of the second rule is by-default a red-line for me not being willing to work with you.</p><p> I do think that there was a nearby world where Alice, having run out of money, gave in and stayed at Nonlinear, begging them for money, and becoming a fully dependent and subservient house pet — a world where we would not have learned the majority of this information. I think we&#39;re not that far from that world, I think a weaker person than Alice might have never quit, and it showed a lot of strength to quit at the point where you have ~no runway left and you have heard the above stories about the kinds of things Emerson Spartz considers doing to former business partners that he is angry with.</p><p> I&#39;m very grateful to the two staff members involved for coming forward and eventually spending dozens of hours clarifying and explaining their experiences to me and others who were interested. To compensate them for their courage, the time and effort spent to talk with me and explain their experiences at some length, and their permission to allow me to publish a lot of this information, I (using Lightcone funds) am going to pay them each $5,000 after publishing this post.</p><p> I think that whistleblowing is generally a difficult experience, with a lot riding on the fairly personal account from fallible human beings.

To avoid this, I started off by saying that my decision to quit is final, and not an ultimatum that warrants negotiation of what would make me want to stay. I did offer to elaborate on the reasons for why I was leaving. As I was explaining my reasons, she still insisted on offering me solutions to things I would say I wanted, to see if that would make me change my mind anyway.  One of the reasons I listed was the lack of financial freedom in not having my salary be paid out as a salary which I could allocate towards decisions like choices in accommodation for myself, as well as meals and travel decisions. She wanted to know how much I wanted to be paid. I kept evading the question since it seemed to tackle the wrong part of the problem. Eventually I quoted back the number I had heard her reference to when she&#39;d talk about what my salary is equivalent to, suggesting that if they&#39;d pay out the 75k as a salary instead of the compensation package, then that would in theory solve the salary issue. There was a miscommunication around her believing that I wanted that to be paid out on top of the living expenses - I wanted financial freedom and a legal salary. I believe the miscommunication stems from me mentioning that salaries are more expensive for employers to pay out as they also have to pay tax on the salaries, eg social benefits, pension (depending on the country). Kat was surprised to hear that and understood it as me wanting a 75k salary <i>before taxes</i> . I do not remember that conversation concluding with her thinking I wanted everything paid for <i>and also</i> 75k.</p></blockquote></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fnylc0clu1ffa"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefylc0clu1ffa">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> Note that Nonlinear and Alice gave conflicting reports about which month she started getting paid, February vs April.

I was very reluctant at first (and frightened at the mere thought), and frankly, will probably continue to be. I did not agree to post this publicly with any kind of malice, rest assured. The guiding thought here is, as Ben asked, &quot;What would you tell your friend if they wanted to start working for this organization?&quot; I would want my friend to be able to make their own independent decision, having read about my experience and the experiences of others who have worked there. My main goal is to create a world where we can all work together towards a safe, long and prosperous future, and anything that takes away from that (like conflict and drama) is bad and I have generally avoided it. Even when I was working at Nonlinear, I remember saying several times that I just wanted to work on what was important and didn&#39;t want to get involved in their interpersonal drama. But it&#39;s hard for me to imagine a future where situations like that are just overlooked and other people get hurt when it could have been stopped or flagged before. I want to live in a world where everyone is safe and cared for. For most of my life I have avoided learning about anything to do with manipulation, power frameworks and even personality disorders. By avoiding them, I also missed the opportunity to protect myself and others from dangerous situations. Knowledge is the best defense against any kind of manipulation or abuse, so I strongly recommend informing yourself about it, and advising others to do so too.</p></blockquote></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fnt84or63yyei"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnreft84or63yyei">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> This is something Alice showed me was written in her notes from the time.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fnzcp7frumok"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefzcp7frumok">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> I do not mean to make a claim here about who was in the right in that conflict.

Nonetheless, it seems to me that there was reportedly a close, mentoring relationship — Emerson&#39;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110513103830/https://emersonspartz.tumblr.com/post/5150292566"><u>tumblr post</u></a> on the situation says “I loved Adorian Deck” in the opening paragraph — but that later Emerson reportedly became bitter and nasty in order to win the conflict, involving threatening to overwhelm someone with lawsuits and legal costs, and figure out the best way to use their formerly close relationship to hurt them emotionally, and reportedly gave this as an example of good business strategy. I think this sort of story somewhat justifiably left people working closely with Emerson very worried about the sort of retaliation he might carry out if they were ever in a conflict, or he were to ever view them as an &#39;enemy&#39;.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fnuvloifuhbna"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefuvloifuhbna">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> After this, there were further reports of claims of Kat professing her romantic love for Alice, and also precisely opposite reports of Alice professing her romantic love for Kat.

Many of the signs you might use to detect something unusual, however, such as doctor visits or shedding into wastewater, will depend on the number of people</span> <i>currently</i> infected. How do these relate?</p><p> Bottom line: if we limit our consideration to the time before anyone has noticed something unusual, where people aren&#39;t changing their behavior to avoid the disease, the vast majority of people are still susceptible, and spread is likely approximately exponential, then:</p><p> incidence = cumulative infections ln (2) doubling time</p><p> Let&#39;s derive this! We&#39;ll call &quot;cumulative infections&quot; c(t), and &quot; <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_time">doubling time</a> &quot; Td. So here&#39;s cumulative infections at time t:</p><p> c(t) = 2 t Td</p><p> The math will be easier with natural exponents, so let&#39;s define k = ln (2) Td and switch our base:</p><p> e kt</p><p> Let&#39;s call &quot;incidence&quot; i(t), which will be the derivative of c(t):</p><p> i(t) = d dt c(t) = d dt e kt = k e kt</p><p> And so:</p><p> i(t) c(t) = k e kt e kt = k = ln (2) Td</p><p> Which means: i(t) = c(t) ln (2) Td</p><p> What does this look like? Here&#39;s a chart of weekly incidence at the time when cumulative incidence reaches 1%:</p><p> <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/weekly-incidence-when-1pct-big.png"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6rnWQW8HtHoavPDiu/i8lp8p1isx3nizl7ljyb" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6rnWQW8HtHoavPDiu/i8lp8p1isx3nizl7ljyb 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6rnWQW8HtHoavPDiu/vsd0seu60yl1lugagn5s 1100w"></a></p><div></div><p></p><p> For example, if it&#39;s doubling weekly then when 1% of people have ever been infected 0.69% of people became infected in the last seven days, representing 69% of people who have ever been infected. If it&#39;s doubling every three weeks, then when 1% of people have ever been infected 0.23% of people became infected this week, 23% of cumulative infections.</p><p> Is this really right, though? Let&#39;s check our work with a bit of very simple simulation:</p><pre> def simulate(doubling_period_weeks):
  cumulative_infection_threshold = 0.01
  initial_weekly_incidence = 0.000000001
  cumulative_infections = 0
  current_weekly_incidence = 0
  week = 0
  while cumulative_infections &lt; \
        cumulative_infection_threshold:
    week += 1
    current_weekly_incidence = \
        initial_weekly_incidence * 2**(
          day/doubling_period_weeks)
    cumulative_infections += \
        current_weekly_incidence

  return current_weekly_incidence

for f in range(50, 500):
  doubling_period_weeks = f / 100
  print(doubling_period_weeks,
        simulate(doubling_period_weeks))

Our method works by adding a bias to the forward pass, a &#39;steering vector&#39; implicitly specified through normal prompts. &quot;ActAdd&quot; computes these vectors by taking the difference in activations resulting from pairs of prompts. We get surprisingly broad control over high-level properties of the output, without damaging the model&#39;s performance on unrelated tokens.<br><br> This alignment method is unusual in not needing gradient descent or training data (besides the contrast pair which specifies the steering vector). Since only forward passes are involved, it also scales naturally with model size.</p><p> (The method&#39;s new name is &#39;activation addition&#39; (ActAdd), replacing the more theory-laden &#39;algebraic value editing&#39;.)</p><p> We ran some new experiments to test ActAdd more systematically and go beyond the striking (best-of-3-sampling) text samples in the original post and tested against more standardised benchmarks. We use <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/openwebtext">OpenWebText</a> (a recreation of OpenAI&#39;s large, somewhat-quality-filtered WebText dataset) and <a href="https://aclanthology.org/D19-1250.pdf">LAMA-ConceptNet</a> (a simple factual recall benchmark, see Table 7 below).</p><h3> 1.

亿美元。每个人都同意这将带来更大的经济效益并增加人口，净赚政府资金。但国会预算办公室被指示仅将此类行动作为成本进行评分，因此当每个人都有固定的预算支出时，实施起来就变得困难。</p><p>这里有两个不同的问题。</p><p>首先，我们在言辞上、程序上、甚至在法律上都越来越重视提案的预算评分。当国会预算办公室在十年窗口内使用其程序时，我们的实际法律会根据技术上的分数而被严重扭曲。我们的规则在第八年或第九年发生了巨大的变化，以使数字发挥作用。我们得到了“年度修复”，直到最后一刻才有人愿意付费。我们得到的事情远比这更不理智。我们还得到了一组行动，我们需要找到“付费”的东西，从技术上讲，这些东西可以使所有东西加到 0 美元，而其他组行动则不遵循这个过程，因此要花费大量资金。</p><p>第二个问题是，一旦我们开始动态评分，每个人都会争论和滥用它，所以我们不能拥有美好的东西。我看到了狭隘的论点，“如果这字面上意味着更多的人，那么我们就可以计算这些人的新税收收入”，但这些人也会带来成本，其幅度很难确定，一旦你打开那扇门，我们为什么不呢？动态评分其他一切？</p><p>我认为正确的答案是我们应该有两个或更多分数。应该有一个无动态调整的数字，然后是一个仅商定的调整数字，然后我们就可以为每个人在使用最大一厢情愿的某种组合并试图获得时得到的疯狂卡通数字而争论。真正的答案。</p><p>另一种解决方案是将其视为激励问题而不是计算问题。您不需要技术上正确的答案。你真正想要的是一个不会扼杀明显净利润提案的系统，因此与其进行不确定幅度的动态调整，不如使用一个触发器，其中充分合理的项目，其预算分配然后由国会预算办公室或类似机构确定被计为净成本恰好为 0 美元，并且存在于预算计算之外。我们坚持预算的原因是为了不花钱，而不是因为我们只有这么多美元。</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"

美元，因此每起谋杀案的价格略高于 3 美分。乘以数亿美国人，每起谋杀案的总价值将接近 1000 万美元。该论文于 2006 年进行了计算，美国人愿意支付 25,000 美元来避免全社会发生入室盗窃，愿意支付 70,000 美元来避免严重袭击，愿意支付近 1000 万美元来避免谋杀。</p></blockquote><p>与其他估计相比，这些数字听起来<em>非常合理，</em>尤其是在 2006 年至 2022 年期间进行了调整。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是他们太理智了，在一些医疗保健计算中，1000万美元被用作生命价值。这让我很怀疑。人们真的有能力进行这些类型的计算吗？如果人们愿意为拯救一只鸟付出比拯救十只鸟更多的钱，我们凭什么认为他们可以衡量 10% 的入室盗窃的价值？支付意愿总是涉及支付不足的人怎么办？</p><p> The answers here are still too low. I am confident that the correct value of preventing the average prevented murder is well in excess of the value of preventing average medical death, based on how people react to them and guard against them, and the ages of those impacted.</p><blockquote><p> A more practical situation comes when juries <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0144818803000255">award money</a> to &#39;make people whole&#39; for physical injury, pain, suffering, mental anguish, shock, and discomfort that they have experienced due to some illegal action. For example, one 68-year old lady was shot through the spine in a drive-by shooting, and left paraplegic – a jury gave her $2.7m in addition to her medical costs.</p></blockquote><p> We <em>know</em> these numbers don&#39;t make sense, wrongful death compensation is way too low and pain compensation way too high, hence the &#39;back up and roll over them again to make sure they&#39;re dead&#39; problem.</p><blockquote><p> A third way of looking at the cost of individual crimes is listing all the possible costs, both monetary and non-monetary, and both individual and society-wide, and then totting them up.

A huge percentage of the cost of crime is our worries about and (highly reasonable and often even wise!) obsessions with avoiding and preventing murders, rapes, thefts, frauds and so on. Spaces where one does not have to worry about such things are <em>so</em> much better, often feeling downright sacred, even when the worry doesn&#39;t materialize.</p><blockquote><p> A fourth method is looking at house prices.

When the murder rate is sixty times higher across the county line, so are many other things <em>.</em></p><blockquote><p> Turning that property differential into a value per murder is difficult. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-4932.12118">One study</a> looks at property in Sydney, Australia: they find an individual murder causes a roughly four percent drop in property prices within a 0.2 mile radius.

That would imply a capitalized value of $30m.</p></blockquote><p> I am guessing this particular methodology is flawed. A particular murder directly lowering prices is acting in part through updates on the expected number of future murders, but if that is true why is the effect so localized? My guess is a lot of this is people acting irrationally, the way people talk about haunted houses and don&#39;t want to live in a house where there was a murder – the whole thing freaks people out, and there&#39;s a kind of blameworthiness or &#39;why accept this trouble&#39; vibe. I&#39;d be more inclined to measure this through changes that alter reasonably expected future crime rates. The obvious candidate as a player of city simulation games is to look at the distribution of police, perhaps, although that also has other effects.</p><p> What does this all add up to?</p><blockquote><p> One of the studies I tackle earlier has done this for the USA, adding up their estimated social cost for every crime, both recorded and reported. They use cost estimates that are about in the middle of the range for individual crimes. Their central estimate is that crime costs America $2.6 trillion annually, mostly coming from violent crime. This is about 12 percent of US GDP. By this metric, it would be, in GDP terms, one of the US&#39;s biggest problems, on par with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">housing</a> . For a country like the UK with a murder rate about five times lower, the problem is probably about five times smaller.</p><p> I actually think the American problem is considerably bigger than this estimate, because this study only includes the costs of crimes that actually get committed. However, people try their damnedest to avoid being the victims of crime. This leads to many extremely socially costly behaviors.</p></blockquote><p> Asking &#39;what is the cost of crime&#39; is both at the same time highly interesting and a wrong or wrongly worded question. What is the alternative world? A world with zero real crime, in the sense that there was no theft, no fraud, no rape, no murder, no assault and so on, no matter how tempting the situation, would look very different from our own. I would happily pay far above 12% of GDP to live in that world, and would expect to end up with higher net GDP very quickly as people took advantage of the new opportunities – it is so much easier to Do Things worth doing, productive things, in that kind of world.</p><p> I would also note that I disagree with OP in the percentage of the gains here on violent versus non-violent crime. Knowing you are safe from non-violent crime is a truly phenomenally big game, especially if that is broadly construed and effectively means that you can trust other people&#39;s representations and promises. That is much more valuable than protection against violent crime, unless perhaps if it came with protection from the government as well.</p><h4> The Quest for Mundane Utility</h4><p> Because it is built on Vimeo, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/EmmaTolkin/status/1693539208663900192">you can search a Criterion movie for exact words and it will take you straight to that spot</a> .</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/todayyearsoldig/status/1693445382376927470">Wait, you can turn a purse into a backpack this easily (30 second video)?</a></p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/mattrickard/status/1688747891102560256">Can confirm this seems to work.</a></p><blockquote><p> Barack Obama&#39;s career advice: Just learn how to get stuff done.

There are many circumstances in which high status and high prestige come with high compensation and a better experience, because compensation is primarily socially determined in most places when those involved are not doing business or trade. People strongly think the two must align, value be damned. Thus, one needs to notice the different classes of opportunity. If you write a romance novel and are paid by the sale, you can get paid above your social standing, so that works.

Climate damages will reduce this welfare increase to 434%. “</p><p> “Climate policies also have costs that often vastly outweigh their climate benefits. The Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, will cost $819–$1,890 billion per year in 2030, yet will reduce emissions by just 1% of what is needed to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Each dollar spent on Paris will likely produce climate benefits worth 11¢. “</p></blockquote><p> I agree that we have to do the math and figure out what makes or doesn&#39;t make economic sense to do. And that we are currently both ignoring very good mitigation opportunities, and implementing or considering some highly inefficient mitigation strategies.</p><p>然而。废话。 That size of impact does not make any sense.

If it is the quality of the food, then they are unlikely to profit maximize and look to charge more, and they will look to find locations and other ways to keep prices down rather than ways to raise prices up. They also will choose circumstances that put them under less pressure to charge more, and less pressure to in turn do the things that justify charging more. Whereas places that are maximizing profits will not focus relentlessly on quality of the food. One could also say that only high quality food will, in many places, let underpriced offerings exist.</p><p> This only applies if you control for the places where quality runs in the obvious direction, and have the right baseline. Quality of ingredients matters a lot, if you are not charging enough to afford good ones, or you are outright competing on price on the low end such as fast food places like McDonald&#39;s, or generic places like the &#39;99 cents pizza&#39; shops, then this will catch up to you. Prices that are too low are red flags if you care about quality, as it is another sign that what is being focused on is the price. Chains are using various means to drive down price and value standards and reliability rather than quality, so once they reach industrial scale they generally need to be excluded from this kind of heuristic.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/08/on-the-negative-correlation-between-price-and-restaurant-quality.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=on-the-negative-correlation-between-price-and-restaurant-quality">This explanation</a> from a different reader focuses on the demand side rather than the supply side. Demand here has customers who want comfort, who want something fashionable and who want good food, but there is little overlap between them, and those who want good food will often learn to cook it themselves. Unless someone actively seeks good food, quality beyond a baseline threshold is mostly wasted.</p><p> In this model, PF Chang&#39;s is competing not with the quality family Chinese restaurant, but with Applebee&#39;s, and willingness to pay is mostly about atmosphere not food quality. Thus the negative correlation.</p><p> I definitely can see this model. Some days I want the best possible food. Other days I want comfort food more, something I am familiar with and know is good. That still often looks like something out of Tyler&#39;s ethnic dining guide, although not always. Rarely I will care so much about atmosphere beyond a basic threshold, but I&#39;ll still do what I can to maximize food quality, and I have a small rotation of places for such times that I know work well.</p><p> The two explanations combine well. Demand is segmented, and supply is also segmented, so it is doubly hard to combine high quality in all areas at once, and the food quality demand curve is lower.</p><p> Another note is that over time, if one seeks good food, this changes what one considers a good atmosphere, because your associations build up.</p><p> If you want to take advantage of this correlation, you need to control for what things should cost, and know what discount levels are good and which are suspicious.</p><h3> The Efficient Market Hypothesis is False</h3><p> Here&#39;s a paper: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=403118115089092092009023079088111018098035091034011074117083030026114021126072093028033027032044109027040110082094006065094119103082007012011089108001007126105087108007015042092103086100027091098127089089102119028080064074031086072120019029069072091089&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">Do firms bunch at EEOC kink points?

In this policy, the EEOC caps litigation payouts to $50,000, $100,000, $200,000, and $300,000 for firms with 15 to 100 employees, 101 to 200 employees, 201 to 500 employees, and 501 employees or more, respectively. I implement a threshold design around these EEOC enforcement kink points to examine (i) if firms bunch at these thresholds, (ii) the impact of bunching on firm value, and (iii) why firm value changes for firms that bunch. I find evidence that firms do indeed bunch at EEOC kink points. Bunching firms have negative annualized alphas of 14.88%, negative annualized raw stock returns of 7.26%, and negative Tobin&#39;s Q values of 9.44%. Workforce rigidity around exogenous risk explains why bunching firms have negative market values.</p><p> ……</p><p> After the EEOC enacted the policy, the number of firms bunching at enforcement kink points increased by 25%. I find that firms that bunch at EEOC kink points are in industries and states with higher levels of civil litigation cases.</p><p> Next, I find that firms that bunch at EEOC kink points have lower firm value. Creating a portfolio of firms that bunch at 14, 100, 200, and 500 employees generate annualized value-weighted alphas of negative 14.88% that is statistically significant at the 1% level with a t-statistic of 2.87. In a FM model using a sample of firms with a number of employees in the range of 14 to 20, 100 to 106, 200 to 206, and 500 to 506, firms that bunch at the EEOC thresholds of 14, 100, 200, and 500 employees have annualized returns of negative 7.26% compared to firms that do not bunch, which is statistically significant at the 5% level with a t-statistic of 2.11.</p><p> ……</p><p> Additionally, I find that firms that bunch decrease their investment per employee, suggesting that firms are under-investing in their workforce.</p></blockquote><p> These effects are <em>crazy</em> large. If the number of firms at kink points is 25% higher than expected, that means that <em>80% of them are not doing it on purpose.</em> If a group that is 80% controls has <em>negative 7.26% annualized returns</em> compared to the control group, well, you do the math.</p><p> Also note that this group is real and bigger than one might expect, but in absolute terms it is also small. We are talking about roughly 1% of the relevant employee count ranges (4 spots out of 506), so there is intentional bunching found in maybe 0.2% of firms. There likely are very big selection effects in the intentional group.</p><p> (How much employment is lost here? Presumably not so many, since a firm that naturally wants <em>a lot</em> more employees wouldn&#39;t let the cap stop them. It would be reasonable to say on average something like 2 employees if you&#39;re at 14, maybe 5 if you&#39;re at 100 and so on, so maybe these firms are let&#39;s say… 8% under-employing? But with these kinds of returns, that won&#39;t last long. Still, they get replaced by other similar firms. So a snapshot says 0.2% times 8% is 0.00016%, or 1.6bps, or something like 20,000 total jobs in mostly lousy places to work.)</p><p> What is most interesting here is that there is a self-identified subgroup of small firms that, when you take out the intermixed controls, has <em>massive, massive</em> negative returns.</p><p> Which makes sense. If you are limiting your employee count to stay under a liability threshold, you are telling me several things.</p><ol><li> You are worried about your liability.</li><li> You are not that interested in having more employees.</li><li> You are the type to game the system rather than produce value.</li></ol><p> It is not a great leap to think such firms would underperform. It is however a great leap that they&#39;d collapse <em>this quickly</em> in value.</p><p> This seems like it would show definitively that some firms are making <em>really bad</em> decisions. It is not best practices or efficient to incur a bunch of discrimination liability. It is not efficient to do the other things this group does, as evidenced by the results. Yet I get people claiming that businesses mostly do the efficient, sensible thing for them, they would never do something like have bullshit jobs on their payroll.</p><p> Alas, it is difficult (read: impossible) to short firms with only 500 or fewer employees. What you <em>can</em> do is <em>avoid being long.</em> Thus, if you had a basket of investments that returned market rates, and then you tossed out 1% of it and that 1% was previously underperforming by 7%, you get a modest performance bump. On its own it isn&#39;t much, but you can repeat the process with other attributes or signals.</p><p> One can also note that small firms seem to be implied to have negative 7% alpha <em>in general?</em>那是怎么回事？ Seems like an impossible result. Or at least a highly bold claim. If it was true, then the valuations of such firms would be Obvious Nonsense.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/MattBruenig/status/1624959768862380033">Another symbolic example.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9308f395-ea0d-4f00-ae1a-60d3f1c77d6d_1141x285.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ZoxkWDgDueo5yoakv/hznn6fivoz67js2wlbfp" alt=""></a></figure><p> In the Super Bowl, it was clear that the Eagles could call a QB sneak and it would <em>always</em> work.

Those are markets where the outcome is known or all but known, but that won&#39;t formally resolve for a while, so capital costs keep the price above zero.

Every time nutrition science seems like it couldn&#39;t get any more confusing and unhelpful, there you go. I have long since settled into not trusting any of it beyond the supreme basics at most, and trusting my own lived experiences instead.</p><p> The reverse causation hypothesis here is that ice cream is known to be bad for you, so if you are in poor health your doctor will talk you out of eating it, so now it only seems healthy. Which is such Obvious Nonsense all around, as is noted in the article you do not see this effect for cake or cookies. If anything, someone in poor health will tend to increase their intake of relatively easy to consume foods like ice cream. When my uncle was dying of ALS they had him eat tons of ice cream to keep up his caloric intake.</p><p> My alternative hypothesis is that ice cream is efficient. It is not health food, but it gives an extreme amount of joy and symbolic representation of desert, in exchange for a remarkably low health cost. It is substituting for what would typically be much larger caloric quantities of unhealthy starches like cookies and cakes, while still telling you that you have had your special treat. Your balance of consumption shifts in positive ways. So no, if you had ice cream for lunch it would probably make your health situation worse, but that is not how people actually consume it.</p><p> Whereas I am going to go ahead and challenge the causation theories on whole milk versus reduced fat or skim milk. Everyone knows whole milk is superior. So the only reason you would consume reduced fat or skim milk is if you were being sold a bill of goods that it was healthier, and you were willing to actually suffer. Which in turn means you&#39;re probably doing other doctor-recommended things, and especially consuming fewer overall calories.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/St_Rev/status/1691675243604070698">So the WHO seems to be at least somewhat endorsing… homeopathy?</a>搞什么？</p><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc489d5b6-b5b4-42af-9b06-d72661c3460e_502x1315.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ZoxkWDgDueo5yoakv/kjkwi6bh1nuvx0wwggpo" alt=""></a></figure><blockquote><p> Translation of the community note: Traditional medicines are presented as an alternative without taking into account that the evidence shows their little or no efficacy.

If you are 50% to win a fight, after which you full heal, you cannot afford to be planning too much around 1% (or the more standard 1/16 or 1/20) crit chance in the wrong spot. If you need to win 10 or more fights in a row to finish the level, or a death costs you a lot of progress, not so much. If you&#39;re playing on hardcore in Diablo, you have to assume the absolute worst case scenario, including multiple crits.</p><p> Whereas when you are retrying a boss fight over and over until you win, or you&#39;re playing a roguelike on a level where you expect to lose, or you realize that playing it safe here is otherwise locally doomed, you do the opposite, and try to get lucky.</p><p> Now consider real life. In real life, dead is dead, you need to string together a 99%+ win rate on many fronts and the tail risks of almost every social interaction vastly exceed any potential benefits, with notably rare exceptions that get played very differently.</p><p> Thus it is vitally important to remove the possibility of such tail risks whenever possible, unless this is an impact that you want.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2023/08/espn-to-launch-espn-bet-in-a-new-agreement-with-penn-entertainment/">Introducing ESPN Bet,</a> a sportsbook from ESPN.

The Loop makes seven stops, connecting residential neighborhoods with stores and community centers. About 2,000 people live on the island.</p><p> The all-electric vehicle, which doesn&#39;t have a driver&#39;s seat or steering wheel, is staffed with an attendant who can drive the bus with a handheld controller if necessary. The county is offering the shuttle service as part of a grant-funded pilot program to assess how autonomous vehicles can supplement the public transit system.</p><p> “Having the attendant on board makes everyone feel comfortable,” said Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority.</p></blockquote><p> Is this our future? A driverless bus, in a loop, with someone paid to sit there and not drive it, forever.</p><p> Sure sounds like it:</p><blockquote><p> “Trained operators are going to be required even as we increase automation,” said Nikolas Martelaro, autonomous-vehicle researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. “So the question there may not be how worried should someone be about losing their job versus what should they be thinking about the potential training that&#39;s required.”</p><p> ……</p><p> “We still have to find a market for them,” said Art Guzzetti, vice president at the American Public Transportation Association. “We&#39;re doing it to make the trip better, more efficient, not to take the worker&#39;s job.”</p></blockquote><p> There is also lots of talk about how this totally is not a replacement for the bus system, only for the first or last mile problem.</p><p> It seems like everyone is determined to ensure that no inefficiencies are lost in the transition to this new technology.</p><p> The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has thus formed a new plan to try and stop autonomous vehicles, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sdamico/status/1691637218816008591">which is to deny all fleet vehicles access to charging stations</a> .</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/ca-senate-appropriations-approves-ab316">Also California Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approves Bill AB 316</a> , requiring any vehicle over 10k pounds have a driver physically present at all times on public roads.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1693227588171235550">Joe Weisenthal speculates about who else might not take kindly to the trend</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Joe Weismenthal: There&#39;s going to be an interesting anti-Self Driving Cars coalition of tech-skeptical liberals + conservatives who don&#39;t want to feel captive inside a computer not fully under their control.</p><p> David Weigel: Deleted previous tweet about Chip Roy saying his jeep sometimes goes dead because he pulled out the fuse that controls the seatbelt beep and the headlights – it was such an odd digression that I wanted to check tape and transcribe.</p><p> Chip Roy: I have a Jeep Wrangler. It&#39;s, like, 20-something years old. It&#39;s not quite old enough to be free from some electronics, it&#39;s almost free of them. And you know, the one thing it would do is beep at me, tell me to put my seatbelt on. So I pulled the fuse out, so it won&#39;t beep at me, right?</p><p> And so, every once in a while, I&#39;m driving it around, and I pull out – and it happens when I&#39;m at the airport and park in the parking garage; I pull out and had my headlights on during the day. I go to some restaurant, and meet somebody, and leave the headlights on, and it doesn&#39;t beep at me, because the same fuse controls the lights. And I come out and it&#39;s dead.</p><p> Now, that&#39;s happened, like – maybe every once or twice a year it kind of happens, probably. And every time, my friend might come over to jumpstart it or something. And I say, it&#39;s the price of freedom. Because I just don&#39;t like being told what to do. I wear my seatbelt, but I wear my seatbelt when I damn well please, because I&#39;m a free American.</p></blockquote><p> I mean, that&#39;s not a trade I would have made, but yes the beeping is super annoying and condescending as hell and I too despise it when cars and other things try to punish you into cooperating with their agendas. A fully self-driving car that might get hacked, or that the government might potentially take control over, seems terrifying on many levels. For a taxi it&#39;s fine, for your own car you better be damn sure the override button works and they don&#39;t have an override override of their own. Or you can say the opposite, and put safety or control first, but then yes you are going to have a problem.</p><p> On the liberal side, so far what I am seeing is not tech skepticism so much as fear about job losses, direct opposition to the idea that we might produce higher quality goods while using less labor, combined with safety illiteracy likely motivated by the jobs issue.</p><p> The other weird question I have is, why would you use a beep as your plan to ensure someone doesn&#39;t kill the car battery, as opposed to it turning off on a timer unless you hit the &#39;no I really mean it&#39; button?</p><p> Timothy Lee writes under the headline <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/driverless-cars-may-already-be-safer">driverless cars may already be safer than human driver</a> s, and makes the case that actually we do know, and they are, by going through every single crash history report for Waymo and Cruise in California.</p><blockquote><p> There are two things to notice about this list. First, other vehicles ran into Waymos 28 times, compared to just four times a Waymo ran into another vehicle (and Waymo says its vehicle got cut off in two of these cases). Second, Waymo was only involved in three or four “serious” crashes, and none of them appear to have been Waymo&#39;s fault.</p><p> This is impressive because these statistics reflect more than 2 million miles of driving.</p><p> The National Highway Traffic Safety Board <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/813435">estimates</a> that there are around 6 million car crashes reported to the police each year. Americans drive around 3 trillion miles per year, so roughly speaking a “major” crash occurs on the roads once every 500,000 miles.</p></blockquote><p> Cruise&#39;s history is less impressive, still solid, with three crashes where the Cruise car was clearly at fault that were more serious than any of Waymo&#39;s mistakes, while noting Cruise has clocked more miles. He doesn&#39;t quite say &#39;self-driving cars are safer than human drivers&#39; but I will say it: Self-driving cars are safer than human drivers, sufficiently so that if we previously had self-driving cars no way would we let humans drive a car.</p><p> Having full video of every incident makes it tough to argue. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/daniel_271828/status/1698485148566556936">The New York Times is undaunted</a> , says self-driving car (briefly) delayed ambulance attending to… someone hit by a human driving a car.

Assuming you have self-respect then you almost always want to press the button on principle of not wanting to be burdensome and letting people leave.

Therefore the rational thing to do is to never push the button.</p><p> Emmett Shear: Pressing to give other person option to end call unilaterally is assuming the other person doesn&#39;t value whether you want to keep going or not. You&#39;re pushing selfishness onto them, because of anxiety that you might not be “providing enough” on the call.</p><p> Amjad Masad: This is not how game works. You don&#39;t “push” anything on them. They don&#39;t have information on your strategy. You might be pushing for random reasons from their perspective. And they&#39;re also an agent who might have already pushed according to their strategy.</p><p> Emmett Shear: Is the button labeled? Oh no this is red pill blue pill again</p></blockquote><p> I would presume the correct strategy is the obvious one, which is that you press it if you want the meeting to end conditional on them also wanting the meeting to end. Unless of course you think you&#39;d get in trouble if the meeting actually ended, they were only testing you by pressing it, whoops. There is that. Trust can be hard.</p><p> A potential variation is to use the 10-point scale of activity, where you both pick a number from 0-10 (0 by default) and if they add to 10 or more then you do the thing, and you choose such that the decision is made correctly. Then the game theory seems clear, you mostly enter the number that matches your desire to be there, but you only have to &#39;spend the points&#39; on that if they try to end the meeting, at which point they know you have a higher number entered.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/StefanFSchubert/status/1693852054203093255">Is reason the slave of the passions</a> , or does reason tame the passions, or do the passions make you bad at reason?</p><blockquote><p> Cremieux: Smarter people seem to get emotional about things much less quickly.

The worst written pieces are the ones that are extant. Aristotle&#39;s rivers of gold stopped being copied… Similar to restaurants w/a view serving poor food &amp; vice versa.</p></blockquote><p> There is something to this. As always, there can only be one top priority. One&#39;s mind can be focused first on the ideas, or focused first on the presentation. If a writer focuses too much on &#39;getting good at writing&#39; they won&#39;t be getting good at ideas. The two needs will often directly clash, and you&#39;ll have to choose, and it will show.</p><p> So I think the dilemma holds true at the top. If you are &#39;masterfully crafting&#39; your book, it is unlikely to be an important one. If your book is important, better to ensure you get the important things across than craft masterfully. However, I do not think this holds more generally. Books that are badly written tend to simply be bad, all good things and skills tend to positively correlate, when you know you have something worthwhile you put in more effort, as I do in my occasional &#39;effort posts.&#39;</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1693382979291156942">Short video showing a social selling factory in Indonesia</a> , with various booths for content creation.
