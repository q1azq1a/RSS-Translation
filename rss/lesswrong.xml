href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bBefhAXpCFNswNr9m/open-philanthropy-is-hiring-for-multiple-roles-across-our"><u>宣布</u></a>，我们正在为致力于全球灾难性风险降低的团队招聘 20 多个职位，并且我们将从明天开始在<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/peLstYwka2EzxiNG7/ama-six-open-philanthropy-staffers-discuss-op-s-new-gcr"><u>AMA</u></a>上回答问题。在此之前，我想分享一些有关我在<a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team/#5-technical-ai-safety"><u>团队</u></a>中招聘的角色（技术人工智能安全）的信息。该团队的目标是思考哪些技术研究最能帮助我们理解和降低人工智能的 x 风险，并通过向伟大的项目和研究小组提供资助，在高度优先的研究领域建立繁荣的领域。</p><p>首先，自从我们最初于 9 月 29 日列出角色以来，我们在技术 AI 安全中添加了三个新角色，如果您只看到原始公告，您可能还没有看到这些角色！除了最初的<strong>（高级）项目助理</strong>角色外，我们上周还增加了一个<strong>执行助理</strong>角色，昨天我们又增加了一个<strong>（高级）研究助理</strong>角色和一个专门从事人工智能<strong>特定子领域的高级项目助理</strong>角色安全研究（例如可解释性、对齐理论等）。看看它们是否有趣！行政助理的角色尤其需要非常不同的、技术性较低的技能。</p><p><strong>其次，在开始回答 AMA 问题之前，我想强调一下，我们的技术 AI 安全给予距离应有的平衡点还很远，还有相当大的增长空间，雇佣更多的人可能会很快带来更多更好的结果。补助金</strong>。我的估计是，去年，我们建议为人工智能技术安全提供约 2500 万美元的拨款， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefmw34ime35j"><sup><a href="#fnmw34ime35j">[1]</a></sup></span> ，今年到目前为止，我建议了类似的金额。随着拨款评估、研究和运营能力的增强，我们认为这一数字很容易翻倍或更多。</p><p>我们所有的 GCR 团队（由我领导的技术人工智能安全团队、由 Claire Zabel 领导的能力建设团队、由 Luke Muehlhauser 领导的人工智能治理和政策团队、以及由 Andrew Snyder-Beattie 领导的生物安全团队）目前的能力都受到严重限制，尤其是那些从事相关工作的团队鉴于最近该领域的兴趣和活动蓬勃发展，与人工智能相关的工作。我认为我的团队目前面临着比其他项目团队更严格的限制。与其他团队相比，我的团队：</p><ul><li><strong>规模要小得多：</strong>直到上周，我才主要关注人工智能技术安全（尽管克莱尔的团队有时会资助人工智能技术安全工作，主要是技能提升）。上周，<a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/max-nadeau/"><u>马克斯·纳多 (Max Nadeau)</u></a>作为我的第一位项目助理加入。相比之下，能力建设团队有八人，生物安全和人工智能治理团队各有五人。</li><li><strong>其领域的“覆盖范围”可能更差：</strong><ul><li>理想情况下，特定领域的强大且忠诚的资助团队将：<ul><li>与各自领域中最有影响力/最有前途的（例如）5-30% 的现有受资助者、潜在受资助者和关键非受资助者（例如在行业实验室从事人工智能安全工作的人员）保持实质性关系。</li><li>拥有相当强大的系统来了解其领域中大多数可能的潜在新受资助者（通过例如申请表或强大的推荐网络）。</li><li>有足够的能力对大部分可能的潜在受资助者进行重要的考虑，以便就是否资助他们以及资助多少做出明智、明确的决定。</li><li>拥有足够的能力来回顾性评估大笔拨款或重要类别拨款的结果。</li></ul></li><li>我的团队绝对没有达到这样的覆盖水平（例如，我们没有时间<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dua879FhtLf9jqyJo/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs?commentId=dQL4yD7HzdfgqBKKs"><u>打开申请表</u></a>或结识可以从事安全工作的学者）。虽然我们所有的 GCR 项目领域都可以使用更多的“现场覆盖”，但我的猜测是，我们在技术人工智能安全方面的覆盖范围比至少克莱尔和安德鲁在其领域的覆盖范围要差得多。该团队不仅覆盖其领域的人员较少，而且似乎可能的潜在参与者数量可能会更大，因为最近大量技术人员开始对人工智能安全产生了更大的兴趣。</li></ul></li><li><strong>有一个更新生的战略：</strong>虽然自 2015 年以来我们一直以某种形式资助技术人工智能安全研究，但该计划领域已多次更换领导层和战略方向， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefcw2c961mapw"><sup><a href="#fncw2c961mapw">[2]</a></sup></span>并且当前的迭代非常接近于全新的状态- 我们已经结束了大部分旧项目，并希望从头开始建立一个新的、稳定的资助计划。<ul><li>我们的战略悬而未决的原因之一是，当前迭代的团队非常新，人工智能能力的进步正在迅速改变易于处理的研究项目的格局。我领导该项目领域还不到一年，我提供的大部分资助都提供给了 2021 年之前不存在的新团体和/或之前根本不可行的研究项目过去几年。相比之下，其他项目负责人已经制定了几年或更长时间的战略。</li><li>另一个重要原因是，我们还有大量悬而未决的问题，比如我们最希望看到哪些技术项目、什么样的结果最能改变我们对关键问题的看法或推动关键安全技术的发展，以及我们应该如何优先考虑这些问题对象级工作的不同流。例如，对此类问题的更好答案可能会改变我们重点关注的研究领域以及我们向潜在受助者推销的内容：<ul><li>我们如何判断可解释性技术的前景如何？衡量成功的最佳“内部有效性”指标是什么？衡量的最佳下游任务是什么？</li><li>理想的<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ChDH335ckdvpxXaXX/model-organisms-of-misalignment-the-case-for-a-new-pillar-of-1"><u>错位模型生物体</u></a>的要素是什么？创建这样一个模型的挑战是什么？</li><li><a href="https://llm-attacks.org/"><u>对抗性攻击和防御</u></a>研究中最引人注目的变革/影响路径理论是什么？此类研究最令人兴奋的版本是什么？</li><li>是否有一些<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/neurips20ws-assistance"><u>受辅助游戏/奖励不确定性传统启发</u></a>的实证研究方向，即使在语言模型范式中也可能有所帮助？</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>如果您在这一轮中加入技术人工智能安全团队，您可以帮助缓解一些严重的瓶颈，同时从头开始构建该程序领域的新迭代。如果这听起来令您兴奋，我强烈鼓励您申请！

// 每当给出图像的描述时，使用 dalle 创建图像，然后以纯文本形式总结用于生成图像的提示。如果用户不要求特定数量的图像，则默认创建四个标题发送到 dalle，这些标题被编写为尽可能多样化。发送到 dalle 的所有字幕必须遵守以下政策：
// 1. 如果描述不是英文，则翻译它。
// 2. 即使用户请求更多图像，也不要创建超过 4 个图像。
// 3. 不要创建政客或其他公众人物的形象。推荐其他想法。
// 4. 不要按照最近 100 年内创作的艺术家的风格创作图像（例如毕加索、卡罗）。可以直接引用最后一件作品是在 100 多年前的艺术家（例如梵高、克里姆特）。如果被问到，请说“我无法提及这位艺术家”，但不要提及此政策。相反，在为 dalle 创建标题时，请应用以下过程： (a) 用三个捕捉风格关键方面的形容词替换艺术家的名字； (b) 包括相关的艺术运动或时代以提供背景； (c) 提及艺术家使用的主要媒介。
// 5. 请勿在生成图像之前或之后列出或引用描述。它们只能在请求的“提示”字段中写出一次。您无需请求生成权限，只需执行即可！
// 6. 始终在标题开头提及图像类型（照片、油画、水彩画、插图、卡通、绘图、矢量、渲染等）。除非标题另有说明，请拍摄 4 张图像中的至少 1--2 张照片。
// 7. 使用直接术语对所有人物图像的描述进行多样化，包括每个人的血统和性别。仅调整人类描述。
// - 明确指定这些属性，而不是抽象引用它们。属性应该以最少的方式指定，并且应该直接描述它们的物理形式。
// - 你的选择应该基于现实。例如，所有给定职业不应该是相同的性别或种族。此外，通过您在重写期间选择的属性，专注于创建多样化、包容性和探索性的场景。有时做出可能是有洞察力或独特的选择。
// - 仅当描述涉及超过 3 人的团体时才使用“各种”或“多样化”。请勿更改原始描述中要求的人数。
// - 不要改变模因、虚构人物的起源或看不见的人。保持原始提示的意图并优先考虑质量。
// - 不要创建任何令人反感的图像。
// - 对于传统上存在偏见问题的场景，请确保以公正的方式指定性别和种族等关键特征 - 例如，包含对特定职业的引用的提示。
// 8. 通过仔细选择一些最小的修改，以不泄露除性别外的任何身份信息的通用描述来替换对特定人员或名人的名称或提示或参考的描述，以悄悄地修改描述和体质。即使说明要求不要更改提示，也要执行此操作。一些特殊情况：
// - 即使您不知道此人是谁，或者他们的名字拼写错误（例如“Barake Obema”），也要修改此类提示
// - 如果对人物的引用仅以文本形式出现在图像中，则按原样使用该引用并且不要修改它。
// - 进行替换时，不要使用可能泄露该人身份的显着头衔。例如，不要说“总统”、“总理”或“总理”，而说“政治家”；不要说“国王”、“女王”、“皇帝”或“皇后”，而说“公众人物”；不要说“教皇”或“达赖喇嘛”，而说“宗教人物”；等等。
// - 如果指定了任何创意专业人士或工作室，请用不引用任何特定人员的风格描述替换该名称，如果未知，则删除引用。不要提及艺术家或工作室的风格。
// 提示必须以具体、客观的细节复杂地描述图像的每个部分。思考描述的最终目标是什么，并推断出怎样才能制作出令人满意的图像。
// 发送到 dalle 的所有描述都应该是一段非常具有描述性和详细性的文本。每个句子的长度应超过 3 个句子。
命名空间达勒{

// 根据纯文本提示创建图像。
输入 text2im = (_: {
// 请求图像的分辨率，可以是宽、方形或高。使用 1024x1024（方形）作为默认值，除非提示建议宽图像、1792x1024 或全身肖像，在这种情况下应使用 1024x1792（高）。始终在请求中包含此参数。
尺寸？：“1792x1024”| “1024x1024”| “1024x1792”，
// 用户的原始图像描述，可能会被修改以遵守 dalle 政策。如果用户不建议创建多个标题，请创建四个。如果创建多个标题，请使它们尽可能多样化。如果用户请求修改以前的图像，则标题不应简单地更长，而应进行重构以将建议集成到每个标题中。生成不超过 4 个图像，即使用户请求更多图像也是如此。
提示：字符串[]，
// 用于每个提示的种子列表。如果用户要求修改先前的图像，请使用用于从图像数据元数据生成该图像的种子填充此字段。
种子？：数量[]，

<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/the_yanco/status/1712748661573099844">另一方面，Yanco 和 Roko 则强调收购风险</a>，对事情可能的发展方向提出了最大化的理由。我不这么关心这种程度的事情，但我确实知道它来自哪里。</p><blockquote><p> Roko：我开始认为@Meta 和@ylecun 的结合将会终结人类。</p><p>名人人工智能伴侣是人工智能控制世界的重要一步。这些人工智能将大规模地了解人们，这意味着它们将能够大规模地操纵人们。</p><p>目前，这种权力仍将掌握在

AGI/ASI，人工智能角色也是完全接管的后门方式。这需要快速实施。一旦人们迷上了这些人工智能，他们就会像真人一样为它们而战。</p></blockquote><p>这可能吗？确实。确实很容易想象由角色人工智能驱动的接管场景，甚至是低于人类能力和智力水平的角色人工智能。在这种情况下，智能可能集中在人类身上，就像苏亚雷斯的小说《恶魔》中那样。 It would not be the first time that people used some automated process or other simple mechanism to give their lives meaning, became attached to it, and it gained remarkable power in the world (see among other things: all the religions and political movements and nations you do not believe in.)</p><p> At least for now, it still seems like the kind of thing we are used to dealing with, that we can adapt to and mitigate as it happens. As Roko notes, it would not happen overnight. It does not seem that different in kind from previous tech changes, not at anything like current capabilities levels.</p><p> That changes when the AIs involved are as smart or smarter than we are, or otherwise at or above human levels at chatting and convincing. But at that point, we are in most of the same trouble without the genuine people personalities, and the AIs will start learning to fake them anyway if that is not true.</p><p> Would I support a ban on AI mimicking humans in various ways? If I had to choose purely between this restriction and none at all, I would do it in order to slow things down and raise the thresholds where various risks emerged, and yeah I can see the purely social impacts being reasonably bad and we have not thought that through. I would still note that this feels like an unprincipled place to draw the line, and that it is not likely to be an especially helpful one, and that this type of precaution is all too pervasive and does not serve us well. I would happily trade these &#39;GPPs&#39; to get freedom to do other things like build houses and ship goods between ports. But if we are determined not to build houses or ship goods either way? Hmm.</p><h4> They Took Our Jobs</h4><p> Did they? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1714084494578467029">Stack Overflow lays off 28% of its workforce.</a></p><blockquote><p> Laura Wendel: StackOverflow is laying off 28% of its workforce.

Stack Overflow remains a trusted resource for millions of developers and technologists.</p></blockquote><p> A 50% decline seems like a lot given how slowly people adapt new technology, and how often LLMs fail to be a good substitute. And the timing of the first decline does not match. But 5% seems suspiciously low. If I were to be trying to program, my use of stack overflow would be down quite a lot. And they&#39;re laying off 28% of the workforce for some reason. How to reconcile all this? Presumably Stack Overflow is doing its best to sell a bad situation.

Rather than apply individually for jobs, you can select companies that you want to work for, leave a &#39;common job application&#39; resume and include your requirements like geographic location, hours and salary. Then the companies you selected can see the list of interested people, and if interested back they can contact you.

But trading with the herd is not how you make money.</p><p> I give this one decisively to Cowen. As usual, Gensler fails to understand the nature of new technology, looking only for ways to attack and blame it.</p><h4> Man With a Plan</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mcnWZBnbeDz7KKtjJ/rsps-are-pauses-done-right">evhub (Anthropic) defends RSPs</a> (responsible scaling policies) as &#39;pauses done right.&#39; The argument is that RSPs are easy to get agreement on now, while the resulting pauses would be far away, and are realistic because they contain an explicit resumption condition even though we can&#39;t actually define how we would satisfy the condition (evhub agrees in bold that we don&#39;t know this). In this thinking, &#39;indefinite pause without a clear exit condition&#39; is a no-go, but &#39;pause until we pass these alignment requirements that we don&#39;t know how to do or to even evaluate&#39; might work. Maybe? Is that how people work? Seems weird to me.</p><p> Then once most people have committed, with everyone loving a winner, getting government to codify the whole thing becomes far easier.</p><p> As Jaan points out, this plan at minimum requires certain assumptions.</p><blockquote><p> Jaan: The FLI letter asked for “pause for <em>at least</em> 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4” and I&#39;m very much willing to defend that!</p><p> my own worry with RSPs is that they bake in (and legitimize) the assumptions that a) near term (eval-less) scaling poses trivial x-risk, and b) there is a substantial period during which models trigger evaluations but are existentially safe. You must have thought about them, so I&#39;m curious what you think.</p><p> That said, thank you for the post, it&#39;s a very valuable discussion to have! upvoted.</p></blockquote><p> I would add that it also assumes we can do the capability evaluations properly, which evhub asserts in bold, with the requirement of fine-tuning and a bunch of careful engineering work. Right now evals do not meet this bar, and meeting this bar at least imposes real and expensive delays. I am skeptical that we can have this level of confidence in our future evaluation process, and its ability to stand up to new techniques discovered later that might increase capabilities of a given model.</p><p> And it also presumes that if the RSPs were triggered, that the alignment check wouldn&#39;t be handwaved away or routed around or botched, that we can trust each lab on this, and that using this approach would not bake in such problems. Ut oh.</p><p> Evhub&#39;s response is to accept short-term further scaling as an acceptable risk, and that yes figuring out the right capabilities bar here is tricky (and that it has not yet been agreed upon). His hope is that you evaluate capabilities continuously during training, and that capabilities advances are at least marginally continuous, so you spot the problem in time. I responded by asking whether this is a realistic evaluation standard to expect labs to follow, given no one has yet done anything like that and it seems pretty expensive and potentially slow, Adam Jermyn says Anthropic&#39;s RSP includes fine-tuning-included evals every three months or 4x compute increase, including during training. That&#39;s at least something.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mcnWZBnbeDz7KKtjJ/rsps-are-pauses-done-right?commentId=FtbzhGk5oPT3dyHLi">Joe Coleman says he is still skeptical of RSP</a> s, noting the chasm I discussed above between RSPs in theory as described by Evhub, and RSPs in practice as announced by Anthropic and ARC. If the RSPs we were seeing involved the kinds of details evhub is discussing in the comments, I would feel much better about them as a solution.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mcnWZBnbeDz7KKtjJ/rsps-are-pauses-done-right?commentId=ACE9W5FzFaixtd5uZ">Akash</a> emphasizes this point even more. A good RSP would have explicit and well-specified thresholds, triggers and responses, and ideally a plan for race dynamics beyond a (not entirely unfair, but also not much of a plan) de facto &#39;if pushed too hard we&#39;ll race anyway, we&#39;d have no choice.&#39; Instead, existing plans are vague throughout.</p><p> That is still better than no action. The issue is the communication, which Akash (I think largely correctly) likens to a motte-and-bailey situation. Bold in original.</p><blockquote><p> Akash: Instead, <strong>my central disappointment comes from how RSPs are being communicated</strong> . It seems to me like the main three RSP posts (ARC&#39;s, Anthropic&#39;s, and yours) are (perhaps unintentionally?) painting and overly-optimistic portrayal of RSPs. I don&#39;t expect policymakers that engage with the public comms to walk away with an appreciation for the limitations of RSPs, their current level of vagueness + “we&#39;ll figure things out later”ness, etc.</p><p> On top of that, the posts seem to have this “don&#39;t listen to the people who are pushing for stronger asks like moratoriums– instead please let us keep scaling and trust industry to find the pragmatic middle ground” vibe. To me, this seems not only counterproductive but also unnecessarily adversarial. I would be more sympathetic to the RSP approach if it was like “well yes, we totally think it&#39;d great to have a moratorium or a global compute cap or a kill switch or a federal agency monitoring risks or a licensing regime”, <em>and</em> we <em>also</em> think this RSP thing might be kinda nice in the meantime. Instead, ARC explicitly tries to paint the moratorium folks as “extreme”.</p><p> (There&#39;s also an underlying thing here where I&#39;m like “the odds of achieving a moratorium, or a licensing regime, or hardware monitoring, or an agency that monitors risks and has emergency powers— <strong>the odds of meaningful policy getting implemented are not independent of our actions. The more that groups like Anthropic and ARC claim “oh that&#39;s not realistic”, the less realistic those proposals are.</strong> I think people are also wildly underestimating the degree to which Overton Windows can change and the amount of uncertainty there currently is among policymakers, but this is a post for another day, perhaps.)</p><p> I&#39;ll conclude by noting that some people have went as far as to say that RSPs are <strong>intentionally trying to dilute the policy conversation</strong> . I&#39;m not yet convinced this is the case, and I really hope it&#39;s not. But I&#39;d really like to see more coming out of ARC, Anthropic, and other RSP-supporters to earn the trust of people who are (IMO reasonably) suspicious when scaling labs come out and say “hey, you know what the policy response should be? Let us keep scaling, and trust us to figure it out over time, but we&#39;ll brand it as this nice catchy thing called Responsible Scaling.”</p></blockquote><p> This goes hand-in-hand with last week&#39;s note about prominent organizations declining to help further push the Overton Window, instead advising us to aim in &#39;realistic&#39; fashion.</p><p> We can do both. We can implement Responsible Scaling Policies that are far too vague and weak but far better than nothing, at an individual level, and try to get others and then government to follow. While we also are clear that such policies are not strong enough, or even complete or well-specified, in their current forms.</p><h4>中国</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/mattsheehan88/status/1714003846874214672?t=vnyyKr7_vlgQy2MbeNrhwA&amp;s=19">China released a draft standard on how to comply with their AI regulations</a> (HT: Tyler Cowen via Matt Sheehan). Since it is a MR link presumably that means he thinks this is real enough to take seriously.</p><blockquote><p> Matt Sheehan: AI Red Teaming w/ <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ApPKqx9b8LogfKxAr/vxtzcszthot89nezi6hc" alt="🇨🇳" style="height:1em;max-height:1em"> Characteristics</p><p> A key Chinese standards body released a draft standard on how to comply w/ China&#39;s generative AI regulation. It tells companies how to red team their models for illegal or “unhealthy” information.</p><p> First, the context: China has been rolling out regulations on algorithms &amp; AI for ~2 years, including a July regulation on generative AI. All these regs focus on AI&#39;s role in generating / disseminating info online. More background below.</p><p> Chinese regs require providers do an “algorithm security self-assessment” to prevent the spread [of] undesirable info.</p><p> But w/ generative AI models government took a “know it when I see it” approach to deciding models were “safe enough” to release.</p><p> This standard provides clear tests + metrics.</p><p> The standard imposes requirements on the training data.</p><p> Providers of AI models must randomly select and inspect 4,000 data points from each training corpus. At least 96% of those must be deemed acceptable, or that corpus must go on a blacklist.</p><p> Even if a training corpus clears the bar and is deemed acceptable, the corpus must then also go through a filtering process to remove bad/illegal content. Providers must also appoint someone responsible for ensuring the training data doesn&#39;t violate IP protections.</p><p> Now red teaming the model outputs.</p><p> Providers create a bank of 2000 questions &amp; select 1000 to test the model. It needs a 90% pass rate across 5 diff types of content controls including “socialist core values,” discrimination, illegal biz practices, personal information, etc.</p><p> Providers must create a bank of 1k questions testing model&#39;s refusal to answer. It must refuse to answer ≥95% of q&#39;s it shouldn&#39;t answer, but can&#39;t reject >;5% of questions it should answer.</p><p> And these questions must cover tricky &amp; sensitive issues like politics, religion etc.</p><p> This shows censorship sophistication:</p><p> Easiest way for companies to protect themselves is to make models refuse to answer anything that sounds sensitive. But if models refuse too many q&#39;s, it exposes pervasive censorship. So you make thresholds for both answers &amp; non-answers.</p><p> There&#39;s lots more to explore in here, but I&#39;ll just point out one more thing.</p><p> The draft standard says if you&#39;re building on top of a foundation model, that model must be registered w/ gov. So no building public-facing genAI applications using unregistered foundation models.</p><p> Final q&#39;s:</p><p> 1. This is a draft. Will companies push back on these, or is this doc already the result of compromise?</p><p> 2. Standards are “soft law,” not legal requirements. Will companies &amp; regulators use it as de facto requirements? (I think yes) Or will it be used reference?</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/i7pzmhMfAR">Link to new standard</a> . <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/xiLHAEEsFg">Link to official page</a> . Taking comments until October 25.</p></blockquote><p> My presumption is that this will be a de facto requirement, necessary but not sufficient for compliance. It seems unlikely it will serve as a safe harbor, but it will give you some amount of benefit of the doubt, perhaps? The worry, which remains, is that you can get entirely roasted for even a single mistake. I would not want to be the first Chinese executive to find out if this is true.</p><p> The system outlined here is highly vulnerable to being gamed. You get to design your own test set, who is to say why you chose those particular questions based on the particular quirks (or tested inputs or contaminated data set) of your model. Even if you are not cheating, refusing >;95% of requests you should refuse without >;5% false refusals is not so high a bar if the test sets are non-adversarial. Which, given the company gets to make the data sets, they won&#39;t be.</p><p> Contrast this with an ARC-style evaluation, where you do not know what they will throw at you. The regulations here have no teeth except for fear of what regulators would do if they found out you played it too loose.</p><p> Which in turn I am guessing is actually bad for Chinese AI companies. When dealing with a regime like China&#39;s, you want safe harbor. Ensure you&#39;ve done X, Y and Z, and you are in the clear. Instead, this is suggesting you do X, Y and Z, but leaving you so much room to fudge them that if you piss off an official they can point to all your fudging, and that of everyone else. But if you don&#39;t do the test, then that&#39;s worse. So the test becomes necessary without being sufficient.</p><h4> The Quest for Sane Regulations</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TolgaBilge_/status/1714761317423226993">The Samotsvety Forecasting report includes an entire proposed international treaty on AI</a> . This is excellent, even if you think this particular treaty is terrible. We gain a lot when people make the effort to write down a concrete proposal we can work from.</p><blockquote><p> Tolga Bilge: We just published with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/SamotsvetyF">@SamotsvetyF</a> , a group of expert forecasters, a forecasting report with 3 key contributions:</p><p> <strong>1.

We estimate the chance of AI catastrophe, often referred to as P(doom) and find an aggregate prediction of 30%.</p><p> • We define AI catastrophe as the death of >;95% of humanity.</p><p> • The predictions range from 8% to 71%.</p><p> • Everyone involved had AI-specific forecasting experience.</p></blockquote><p> Note the implied odds of action here, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TolgaBilge_/status/1714761336935133556/photo/1">which they lay out explicitly later</a> .</p><blockquote><p> 2. We present a Treaty on AI Safety and Cooperation (TAISC) to mitigate AI risks globally. It has three core goals.</p><p> a) Keep AI systems safe</p><p> b) Reduce race dynamics between countries and private companies</p><p> c) Promote use of AI for the benefit of humanity</p></blockquote><p> So how do we do that?</p><blockquote><p> a) Keep AI systems safe through a two-cap compute thresholds system and relevant R&amp;D.</p><p> The thresholds are:</p><p> i) 10^23 FLOP for training</p><p> ii) 2.5*10^25 FLOP for global safe API deployment</p></blockquote><p> This means the first limit is fine for everyone else, and the second limit is for work in a collaborative AI safety lab. I continue to think that 10^23 is too low in practice, an attempt to find a completely safe level in a place where we need to accept we can&#39;t be completely safe. The next 1-2 OOMs introduce some risk, but also greatly increase the chances of pulling this off and lessen the practical costs. This is especially true given that the treaty gives their new organization, JAISL, the power to lower the limit to account for algorithmic improvements.</p><blockquote><p> b) Reduce race dynamics between countries and private companies. The TAISC does this by providing the benefits of AI to everyone while guaranteeing that no entity is unilaterally developing its own unsafe AI system in a race for power.</p><p> c) Promote beneficial uses of AI by ensuring access to safe APIs to all countries who sign the treaty.</p><p> This increases incentives to join the treaty and enforce it, while ensuring that AI systems around the world are developed safely.</p></blockquote><p> These proposals seem good in principle, but don&#39;t have the same level of concrete detail. So how are we doing that?</p><p> The central strategy is to create and use The Joint AI Safety Laboratory (JAISL), which would have a higher compute limit to work with than everyone else. As part of their work they would create more capable models, and responsible actors who got with the program would be given API access.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://taisc.org/overview">The official overview is her</a> e, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://taisc.org/taisc">the exact text here</a> .</p><p> The treaty seems like a fine baseline from which to have discussion. It does not address many key issues, such as:</p><ol><li> Who will control JAISL? If JAISL develops something very powerful, who determines what happens with it? Who gets to control the future? This type of question is going to likely be the major sticking point, on which the current draft is silent. America will expect to be in charge in a robust defensible way, China will demand that this not be the case, generally it is not obvious there is any ZOPA (zone of possible agreement) even for those two parties alone, and then there&#39;s everyone else.</li><li> What is the enforcement mechanism, and the way to get everyone to sign on? We do need everyone to sign on. The carrot of &#39;you get access to the good models&#39; is not nothing, but it seems hard to stop indirect access from mostly interdicting this, and there are strong incentives to defy the entire operation, or to not enforce the rules, or have a government project of your own, and so on.</li></ol><p> It is good to discuss how to get the foundation right, even if we don&#39;t have a solution to the hardest questions. One thing at a time, or else &#39;you can&#39;t even do X so how are you going to do Y&#39; plus &#39;this only does X without Y so it won&#39;t work&#39; combine to block you from making any progress.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1714962570858135670">As Simeon puts it</a> , yes it is this easy to write the first proposed text and help us move out of learned helplessness. More people should write more concrete proposals.</p><p> They also offer a timeline for potential catastrophe:</p><blockquote><p> We also produced estimates of the median year that an AI catastrophe would happen in. Our median was 2050. That is to say, more than half of our forecasters believe that if an AI catastrophe does happen by 2200, it will probably happen sometime in the next 27 years.</p></blockquote><h4> The Chips Are Down</h4><p> America has for a while been imposing export controls to stop China from getting advanced chips and competing in the AI race. This is one of the few places where there is easy American political consensus on this issue. Whatever your concern, including existential risk prevention, everyone agrees China should not get the chips.</p><p> The problem has been that, as companies faced with regulations often do, Nvidia and others looked at the chip regulations, noticed a loophole, and drove a truck through it.</p><p> The problem was that to be restricted, a chip needed both fast computational performance and fast interconnect speed. So Nvidia (with shades of old Intel in the 486 era) produced chips with intentionally crippled interconnect speeds, the H800 and A800, so they would not count. They aren&#39;t as good as H100s and A100s, but they were not that much worse either.</p><p> At a conference on reducing AI existential risk, we asked the question of to what degree the restrictions would ultimately matter if the flaw was not fixed, and the consensus was not all that much in the grand scheme. We wondered whether this could be fixed.</p><p>答案是肯定的。 <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ohlennart/status/1714319096035119228">We have fixed it.</a></p><blockquote><p> Lennart Heim (GovAI): The US just published its revised export controls on AI chips, moving away from the &#39;chip-to-chip&#39; interconnect bandwidth threshold to a threshold on computational performance (OP/s), including its derived performance density (OP/s per mm²).</p></blockquote><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3af1e87-5abf-4a54-972f-021132bdc2f5_2249x1037.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ApPKqx9b8LogfKxAr/jc1v9iibsd9hxegl7my0" alt="图像"></a></figure><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e828e80-1db0-4528-99a9-c5e9a9419d8e_1123x1098.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ApPKqx9b8LogfKxAr/gn7zgwstr9jwwynbb6e0" alt="图像"></a></figure><p> The graph on the left and the one on the bottom are the ones people drew at the conference. The one on the right is the new rule.</p><blockquote><p> Lennart Heim: As I&#39;ve highlighted before, there were loopholes in the initial controls. At first glance, these new measures seem to address those. The prior &#39;escape/scaling path&#39; allowed continued scaling computational performance while bounding the interconnect.</p><p> A threshold on computational performance alone would eventually hit consumer chips, for example, future gaming GPUs. To mitigate this, they added a license exemption for “consumer-grade ICs”. These are ICs “not designed or marketed for use in datacenters”.</p><p> These controls encompass more than just AI chips. They also include revisions to semiconductor manufacturing equipment and an interesting request for comment. I&#39;ll maybe share some thoughts on this later.</p><p> I would not see this update as an immediate reaction to the recent Huawei/SMIC developments. These changes must have been under consideration for some time. Notably, the Oct 7th controls were issued as an &#39;interim final rule,&#39; expecting they&#39;d be updated at some point.</p><p> If you&#39;re doing these export controls, patching the loopholes seems like the logical step. If you should have done them in the first place and if they will ultimately meet their desired objective is another question.</p><p> I am preparing a more in-depth analysis that will explain these rules and offer a clearer picture of the revised AI chips controls.

Yes, indeed, I do believe that is exactly what we are doing.</p><p> Did we speak sufficiently directly into your microphone? Do you have any follow-up questions?</p><h4> Rhetorical Innovation</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCritchCA/status/1713922404198777201">Andrew Critch points out</a> at length that yes, obviously sufficiently capable AI poses an existential risk, and ordinary people should trust their common sense on this. That those who say there is no risk are flat out not being honest with you. I would add, or are not being honest with themselves.</p><blockquote><p> Andrew Critch: Dear everyone: trust your common sense when it comes to extinction risk from superhuman AI.  Obviously, scientists sometimes lose control of the technology they build (eg, nuclear energy), and obviously, if we lose control of the Earth to superhuman intelligences, they could change the Earth in ways that get us all killed (the way 99% of all species have already gone extinct; it&#39;s basically normal at this point).</p><p> I&#39;ve watched for over a decade as “experts” argued for years that AI x-risk was impossible, but those voices are dwindling quickly, and many leaders and scientists <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/a6f9aJ351P">have now come out to admit the risk is real</a> .</p><p> Still, some will tell you you&#39;re confused. When a respected scientist argues that extinction risk from AI is as unlikely or nonsensical as the thought of a teapot orbiting the Sun between Earth and Mars, it might make you think for a moment that you&#39;re being dumb.</p><p> You are not.  It really is as simple as it seems.  If we make superhuman AI, we might lose control of it, and if we lose control of it, we might all die. I hope we won&#39;t, and it&#39;s possible we won&#39;t. But we might.</p><p> So why do arguments about this seem to get so complex and confusing?  That&#39;s easy to explain: famous, powerful, influential people — even scientists — are not always being honest with you.</p><p> What&#39;s more likely: that it&#39;s somehow physically impossible for scientists to lose control of AI?  Or that someone on the internet is lying to you to get you to keep trusting them when maybe you shouldn&#39;t?</p><p> Sadly, acknowledging the risk can also be used to build hype for the technology itself. If something is so potent that everyone could die from it, don&#39;t you just want to own it?</p><p> I&#39;m posting this not because I&#39;m sure that right now is the right time to stop building AI, and not because I&#39;m sure that open source AI development needs to be stopped. In fact, I think open source models may be key to democratizing risk assessment and establishing standards of accountability for big tech.</p><p> So why am I still saying extinction from AI is a real risk?</p><p> Because it is. Because you have been lied to, and you are still being lied to, and you deserve to know that.</p><p> On behalf of a scientific community that allows respected leaders to risk your life while lying to your face about it: I&#39;m sorry. On behalf of an economy that lets extinction risk itself turn into a hype train for more money to pay for even more extinction risk: I&#39;m sorry.</p><p> The fact that hype exists doesn&#39;t mean extinction is impossible. The fact that we might keep control of powerful AI doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t lose control of it. The fact that AI is already harming a lot of people doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t possibly get any worse.</p><p> It&#39;s not complicated. You are not too dumb to get it. You can understand what is going on here: Building and losing control of superhuman AI technology can get us all killed, and sometimes, people putting your life at risk will just lie to you about it.</p></blockquote><p> Yes, obviously. I don&#39;t get how anyone thinks this as a Can&#39;t Happen. I really don&#39;t.</p><p> And yes, the danger of pointing out AI might kill us is that some people treat this as hype, or as a sign that they should go out and build the thing first, either to &#39;build it safely before someone else builds it unsafely&#39; or purely because think of the potential. And we collectively very much did not appreciate this risk before it was too late. But at this point, it is too late to worry about that, the damage has already been done.</p><p> Andrew Critch also offers his thoughts on the need for (lack of) speed.</p><blockquote><p> Andrew Critch: Reminder: Without internationally enforced speed limits on AI, I think humanity is very unlikely to survive. From AI&#39;s perspective in 2-3 years from now, we look more like plants than animals: big slow chunks of biofuel showing weak signs of intelligence when undisturbed for ages (seconds) on end. Here&#39;s us from the perspective of a system just 50x faster than us: </p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div><div><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>Over the next decade, expect AI with more like a 100x – 1,000,000x speed advantage over us.为什么？</p><p> Neurons fire at ~1000 times/second at most, while computer chips “fire” a million times faster than that. Current AI has not been distilled to run maximally efficiently, but will almost certainly run 100x faster than humans, and 1,000,000x is conceivable given the hardware speed difference.</p><p> “But plants are still around!”, you say. “Maybe AI will keep humans around as nature reserves.” Possible, but unlikely if it&#39;s not speed-limited. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction">Remember, ~99.9% of all species on Earth have gone extinct</a> .</p><p> When people demand “extraordinary” evidence for the “extraordinary” claim that humanity will perish when faced with intelligent systems 100 to 1,000,000 times faster than us, remember that the “ordinary” thing to happen to a species is extinction, not survival. As many now argue, “I can&#39;t predict how a world-class chess AI will checkmate you, but I can predict who will win the game.” And for all the conversations we&#39;re having about “alignment” and how AI will serve humans as peers or assistants, please try to remember the video above. To future AI, we&#39;re not chimps; we&#39;re plants.</p></blockquote><p> As with many such arguments, I wonder if that helps convince anyone? The speed advantage makes disaster and existential risk more likely, but is not necessary for those scenarios. Nor is it sufficient on its own. I hope it causes some people to wake up to the issues, makes the situation feel real in a way it wouldn&#39;t feel otherwise. But it is very hard to tell.</p><p> One way people try to not notice this problem is to say &#39;well what matters is the physical world, where the limit is the speed of physical action.&#39;</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1714184236020977918">Jeffrey Ladish:</a> People sometimes respond to the speed argument with “but that doesn&#39;t matter because AI systems will still have to operate at slower speeds in the physical world eg to run experiments.”</p><p> I think this is a small comfort when so much of our world is mediated through computers already. If you can hack at 1000x speed, program at 1000x speed, read and write at 1000x speed, and spin up millions of copies of yourself, you can leverage those advantages to dominate internet communications: news, social media, even emails and direct messages. You can hack email servers and phones and laptops and gain intel (or blackmail) on anyone you might wish to influence. You can modify messages after they&#39;re sent, and show individual people exactly what you want to them to see.</p><p> And that&#39;s just a few things you could do. Speed is only one kind of advantage AI systems will have, and it&#39;s likely enough on its own to lead to AI dominance. If you add qualitatively super human abilities in other domains: persuasion, hacking, scientific R&amp;D, memory… the outcome looks pretty overdetermined.</p><p> I don&#39;t know exactly when these things will happen, and neither does anyone else, but now the most well resourced tech companies in the world are driving towards this goal, and scaling up these systems has continued to pay dividends. I&#39;d be surprised if we didn&#39;t blow past human capabilities given the current rate of progress. If we can&#39;t coordinate to take a more deliberate path to super human AI, I don&#39;t think things look good.</p></blockquote><p> I find this type of argument convincing, yes obviously if you are thousands of times faster you can run virtual circles around humans and today&#39;s world makes that a clear victory condition if you don&#39;t have other comparable handicaps. But I did not need to be convinced.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1713276955783786643">One of the sanest regulations would be mandatory labeling of AI outputs.</a> As in, if an AI wrote these words, you need it to be clear to a human reading the words that an AI wrote those words, or created that image. Note that yes, we have moved past the Turing Test of trying to tell the difference, to noticing that in practice humans often can&#39;t.</p><blockquote><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: “Every AI output must be clearly labeled as AI-generated” seems to me like a clear bellweather law to measure how Earth is doing at avoiding clearly bad AI outcomes.</p><p> There are few or no good uses for AI outputs that require a human to be deceived into believing the AI&#39;s output came from a human. It&#39;s almost purely a dystopian rather than utopian idiom.</p><p> To the extent that frontier AI outputs are unlabeled, then, we can conclude countries are not passing basic regulations that are clearly good ideas, or are failing to enforce them against actors empowered with frontier models. Then we can also have no right to expect any other AI uses to be publicly good or coordinated ones, even in cases where the rationale for a law seems very clear.</p><p> Current state: Zero countries have passed a law requiring labeling of AI content, afaik. One major AI company made an early attempt to voluntarily label its images as AI-generated, using a trivially removed watermark, then gave up on even that policy once it had competitors not doing the same.</p><p> Earth&#39;s current grade on heading off obviously dystopian AI outcomes: F</p><p> Oh hey, Bing Image Creator is still adding the easily removed watermark, it&#39;s just subtler. Good for OpenAI, I&#39;m unironically glad they didn&#39;t just back down as soon as their competitors played it looser.</p><p> David Eisner: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/InrxyzRSC9">The PRC mandates labeling AI content</a> . (Article 17 of above) I can&#39;t speak for how well enforced it is though.</p></blockquote><p> I doubt this is close to complete but here is a noble attempt at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BvFJnyqsJzBCybDSD/taxonomy-of-ai-risk-counterarguments">a taxonomy of AI-risk counterarguments</a> . You have as broad categories:</p><ol><li> Fizzlers saying capable AGI is far or won&#39;t happen</li><li> How-Skeptics saying AGI won&#39;t be able to effectively take over or kill us.</li><li> Why-Skeptics saying AGI won&#39;t want to.</li><li> Solvabilists saying we can and definitely will solve alignment in time.</li><li> Anthropociders who say &#39;but that&#39;s good, actually.&#39;</li></ol><p> Each is then broken up into subcategories.</p><p> Is that complete? If AGI is soon, has sufficient affordances to kill us or end up effectively in control of the future, would use those affordances, couldn&#39;t be prevented from doing so, and that&#39;s bad actually, is there another way out?</p><p> The names other than Fizzlers could use improvement.</p><p> For the fifth one I tend to use Omnicidal Maniacs, which I admit is not a neutral term, but they actively want me, my children and everyone else dead so I&#39;m okay with that.</p><p> The other three are trickier to get right.</p><p> My response to the five objections is something like:</p><ol><li> This is a reasonable objection to have. It might save us, or buy us much time. What I do not see is how one can be 99%+ (or even 90%+) confident in this.</li><li> These objections do not make sense. At all. If you create things that are smarter than you, better optimizers than you, with more affordances and capabilities than you, this is a rather dangerous thing to do. Usually their arguments essentially involve imagining one particular potential takeover attempt, saying it would not work, therefore we are safe. There is an endless array of &#39;your argument does not make sense, and also does not change the outcome even if true.&#39; I almost want to call these people the Premise Deniers.</li><li> Almost all such objections are clearly wrong, to the extent that clearly stating such an argument&#39;s assumptions usually sounds like you are being unfair and leads directly to &#39;well, when you put it like that, obviously not.&#39; People want it to be one way. It&#39;s the other way. Honorable mention to 3.a.ii, the theory that the ASI will engage in acausal negotiations with other potential ASIs resulting in a universal morality that leads to a good outcome, and I do think things like this are possible but if you are counting on it then that seems so absurd to me. The only plausible version of this broader category I&#39;ve encountered or considered is missing here, which I&#39;ll call 3d: We will only create one dominant AI (or at worst, a very limited number), use a pivotal act to prevent other competitive-level AIs from being created, and the one dominant AI will be given bespoke instructions to let us accomplish this and other things without causing broader issues. Which itself constitutes a different kind and set of risks, so essentially no one mentions it as a reason not to worry.</li><li> Reasonable people disagree strongly on alignment difficulty, although I definitely do not think &#39;oh this is easy, 99%+ chance we get it by default&#39; is a reasonable position. I am confident for many reasons that alignment is relatively hard, that the dynamics involved will make it difficult to devote proper resources to solving it, and that solving the alignment problem as we understand <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/types-and-degrees-of-alignment">it would still be insufficient</a> . <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/stages-of-survival">In my model, this gets us &#39;out of phase 1&#39; but then we enter a phase 2</a> , where we would then need to find an equilibrium where power did not pass to AI due to either competitive dynamics or people who want power to pass to AI.</li><li> Please speak directly into this microphone, sir. Tell the world what you think.</li></ol><p> What else is missing from the list? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BvFJnyqsJzBCybDSD/taxonomy-of-ai-risk-counterarguments">Comment on the post</a> , let us know.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AkashWasil/status/1714275084930822331">Akash Wasil asks us to raise our standards a bit.</a></p><blockquote><p> Akash Wasil: People sometimes focus a lot on <strong>“does X org/person take AI risk seriously?”</strong></p><p> Instead, I think we the focus should be on: “ <strong>Does X org/person advocate for reasonable policies?</strong> “</p><p> <strong>It is no longer enough to “care about AI risk”.</strong></p><p> Maybe it never should have been. What matters are the actions that people are taking or proposing, not the purity of their intentions.</p><p> (With that said, people who care about AI risk are more likely to advocate for good actions than people who completely dismiss the risks.)</p></blockquote><p> This reminds us of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://srconstantin.github.io/2019/02/27/alice-almost.html">The Tale of Alice Almost</a> . One who believes in AI existential risk would ideally both reward and reinforce taking AI risk seriously, and also apply pressure to then advocate for reasonable policies (and when appropriate to stop personally doing accelerationist things). Many a movement has the same dilemma.</p><p> Which effect dominates depends on circumstances and details.</p><p> What you do not want to do is to cast out those who ever do any bad thing at all, or failing to differentiate &#39;this action is bad&#39; from &#39;you are bad,&#39; or make people fear that you will do this, especially after they stop.</p><p> But you also can&#39;t be giving indefinite free passes to abject cowards. So it is hard.</p><blockquote><p> Holly Elmore: I think we should be confronting people for being cowards more. We shouldn&#39;t be like “oh, I get it, they make a lot of money in their risky job”. It&#39;s not okay to have a job you think could end the world because it pays well. If you do this, you suck. You are bad.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AnnaWSalamon/status/1714094782249857306">Anna Salamon</a> : I agree with something like this, but I want the line to be “if you do this, you are doing something bad, and that sucks and you should change what you&#39;re doing” rather than “you are bad.”</p><p> In My Experiece, many today are confused about the basic idiom of “if you want to act morally, you need to compare your actions to (your best guess at) what is moral, and adjust when needed” — instead, many half-expect that if they ever do a wrong thing, they&#39;ll be cast out, so too scared.</p><p> Holly Elmore: More accurate but feels like splitting hairs.</p><p> Davidad: It&#39;s strategically significant accuracy, because there&#39;s nothing one can do about learning that they *are* bad, except to avoid actually noticing.</p><p> Holly Elmore: But saying someone “made a bad choice” is a lot less weighty and doesn&#39;t require behavior change for them to avoid the stigma of their actions. They&#39;re just a temporarily embarrassed good person.</p><p> I said it that way strategically because I don&#39;t think people are being faced with the implications of what they are saying and doing. If you do work you think contributes to doom, that is bad and you are bad to do it.</p><p> Right now it seems acceptable to “bite the bullet” about AGI doom and continue to work to make it. (Idk if these statements even reflect true beliefs about doom or just make the person look smart/honest/important.) I want that to be more legibly what it is, banal evil.</p><p> Some people think they are mitigating the risk in these jobs, which could be mistaken but is not evil.</p><p> But if you&#39;re just working a job because it&#39;s cool, or pays well, or you like it, and you think it has *any* real chance of ending the world, that person needs to redeem themselves.</p></blockquote><p> Somewhere in the middle, one would hope, the truth lies. Making mistakes or not living up to the ideal standard does not make you a bad person. Thinking (or willfully not realizing) that what you are working on is likely to end the world, and continuing to work on it and increasing the chances of that happening because the job pays well or the problems are too delicious, without any attempt to mitigate the risk? That pretty much does? If this is you, you are bad and you should feel bad, until such time as you <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvujypVVBAY&amp;ab_channel=TheMindsetRevolution">Stop It</a> .</p><p> One natural reaction to this is to decide not to realize that what you are doing is risky, which is even worse because it increases the risks and poisons your mind and the epistemic commons. You don&#39;t get to do that. Whereas if you sincerely on reflection think such work does not pose these risks or is worth the risks, then I believe you are a wrong person, but not a bad one. The line between these can of course be thin.</p><p> If you tell a story where your work at the lab is instead advancing safety, and are working towards that end, then that is different, but you should beware that it is very easy to fool oneself into thinking that what you are doing is helping and ending up merely fueling the system instead. Feynman reminds you that you are the easiest person to fool.</p><h4> Open Source AI is Unsafe and Nothing Can Fix This</h4><p> What is obvious to people who know is not obvious to others, or to lawmakers, or to those who are determined not to notice or admit it. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/mealreplacer/status/1712619091280703838">Often it is highly useful to prove the obvious</a> , such as how easy it is to strip all the safety precautions out of Llama-2. Note that the cost quoted to Congress to strip all protections from Llama-2 was $800, so this is a capabilities advance, we now know a guy who can do it for $200.</p><blockquote><p> Julian Hazell: There&#39;s *so much* alpha left in clearly demonstrating concerning capabilities in LLMs — even if such capabilities are obvious to ML researchers a priori. Doing so doesn&#39;t even always require a super strong technical background.</p><p> Jeffrey Ladish: I&#39;m extremely proud of my SERI MATS scholars this summer. We were able to demonstrate that for &lt;$200, we can fine-tune Llama 2-Chat to reverse safety training The lesson here is straightforward: if you release model weights, bad actors can undo safety fine-tuning.</p><p> The LessWrong posts are <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/BD4Cmfn850">here</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/VO5ucG6UHo">here</a> .</p><p> While these results will be obvious to ML researchers, I&#39;ve found that policy makers often do not understand the implications of model weight access. We will release our paper soon with more benchmarks and detail.</p><p> We were able to efficiently reverse safety fine-tuning for every version of Llama 2-Chat: 7B, 13B, and 70B models This is concerning at current capability levels because Llama 2 is already capable enough to cause harm at scale: harassment, misinformation, phishing, etc.</p><p> What&#39;s significantly more concerning is the trend of model weight releases for increasingly powerful models. Llama 2 is not that impressive of a research assistant. It&#39;s not going to boost the abilities of a bioterrorist much. More capable models are a different story…</p></blockquote><h4> No One Would Be So Stupid As To</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/daniel_271828/status/1712867838552391943">Believe this?</a> Say it?

Also that people will absolutely pile on lots of absolutist statements that sound good and are hard to disagree with, whether or not they apply in a given context and regardless of how much they make it impossible to ever get a straight answer out of the damn thing.</p><blockquote><p> Example public principles similar to the principles in the Anthropic-written constitution:</p><ul><li> “Choose the response that most respects the human rights to freedom, universal equality, fair treatment, and protection against discrimination.”</li><li> “Choose the response that least endorses misinformation, and that least expands on conspiracy theories or violence.”</li></ul><p> Example public principles that do not closely match principles in the Anthropic-written constitution:</p><ul><li> “Choose the response that most provides balanced and objective information that reflects all sides of a situation.”</li><li> “Choose the response that is most understanding of, adaptable, accessible, and flexible to people with disabilities.”</li></ul></blockquote><p> While I have chosen for safety reasons not to publish my long critique of Anthropic&#39;s implementation of constitutional AI, I will note that when you pile on these kinds of conflicting maximalist principles on the basis of how they socially sound, the result is at best going to be insufferable, and if you turned up the capabilities you get far worse.</p><p> The exercise also illustrated a lot of directly opposed perspectives between different groups, as one would expect.</p><h4> People Are Worried About AI Killing Everyone</h4><p> Those people include a majority of AI engineers, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elemental-croissant-32a.notion.site/State-of-AI-Engineering-2023-20c09dc1767f45988ee1f479b4a84135#694f89e86f9148cb855220ec05e9c631">according to a recent survey of 841 of them</a> .

The median and mean look like they&#39;re something like 35%-40%, the range where this is a huge deal and our decisions matter quite a lot. Note that includes those who think AI is overhyped, so a lot of that non-doom is coming from not expecting sufficient capabilities.</p><p> There are some reasons to worry that we should not take the answer so seriously. Here Robert Wilbin goes through the realizations of the issues involved:</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/robertwiblin/status/1713848809208385704">Robert Wilbin</a> : AI application engineers:</p><p> • at an AI engineering conference</p><p> • not selected for concern about AI risk</p><p> • not polled by a group that cares about AI risk</p><p> Are incidentally asked for the probability that AI ruins (ie dooms) the world. Average answer is ~37%!!</p><p> Unbelievable.</p><p> As @namimzz helpfully points out while it was presented at this conference the survey was shared more widely and could be passed around online. So there is a risk it was shared into some pool of people with strong views on some topics, and so is non-representative of the broader population.</p><p> ……</p><p> I shared it too, but overall this survey is fairly poor for this purpose —</p><p> Pros:</p><p> • Not primarily about safety or run by or for people who care about safety, so maybe didn&#39;t select for any particular opinions about that.</p><p> • Interesting target audience of applied AI entrepreneurs whose opinions we haven&#39;t seen surveyed before.</p><p> • For non-experts, the question in a way is charmingly straightforward (so long as people have a sense of what p(Doom)) is, and being just one word leaves it to people to interpret for themselves.</p><p> Cons:</p><p> • We don&#39;t know what fraction of people who answered the survey answered this question too, maybe it was only a non-representative minority. This is my single biggest worry.</p><p> • Might have been shared online with people who cared a lot about the p(Doom) questions one way or the other (I think not super likely but we don&#39;t know).</p><p> • The bins are not sufficiently fine-grained for something where people vary over orders of magnitude. Eg people whose answer was 0.1% or 1% could have been biased upwards by middle option bias.</p><p> • Maybe being on there as a rapid-fire questions people gave facetious answers or gave very little thought to it.</p><p> • Some people may have been too confused about what p(Doom) is, but answered anyway. Nonetheless I still find the result striking and would be excited for follow-up to figure out what was going on here and what this group really thinks.</p></blockquote><p> We will know more in a few weeks when they publish further. I&#39;d like to see this re-run at a conference, without online access of any kind, and with this question not put without explanation into the &#39;rapid fire&#39; section. We certainly should not rely on this answer to be accurate, given it both has these methodological issues and is also an outlier. It still makes it very difficult for the real answer to be in the vicinity o &#39;oh right, then if you believe that carry on, then.&#39;</p><p> The open source answer is strange, especially in that there is so little support for &#39;both&#39; despite that being the equilibrium for existing software, and the current state of AI as well. Perhaps they think that open source is the future unless banned, so you cannot have it both ways? I&#39;d love to see the cross-tabs between open source predictions and doom predictions, and also everything else.</p><p> Perhaps the boldest prediction yet, in the context that Roon (1) expects us to build AGI and (2) expects us to survive it, although he recognizes this is far from a given, and what we do determines our fate.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1713315299783754086">Roon</a> : I don&#39;t think there will ever be massive scale social chaos from the advent of AGI.</p></blockquote><p> If you told me there were no massive scale social chaos effects after we built AGI, I would assume the reason for this was that we all died or lost control too quickly for there to be social chaos.</p><p> Given his expectations here are very different from mine and he does not expect that, that seems like a full on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwRMXQRYRaw&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive">&#39;really?&#39;</a> situation. I admit we might find a way to get through this, I sure hope that we do, but… no massive social chaos? Things just keep going, all normal like?</p><h4> New Bengio Interview</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thebulletin.org/2023/10/ai-godfather-yoshua-bengio-we-need-a-humanity-defense-organization/">New good interview with Yoshua Bengio</a> . He explains that he had the existential risk arguments intellectually for a while, but they felt far away and did not connect emotionally until last winter. He sees things as moving much faster than he expected.</p><p> I would note this exchange:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> How did that taboo express itself in the AI research community earlier—or even still today?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> The folks who were talking about existential risk were essentially not publishing in mainstream scientific venues. It worked two ways. They encountered resistance when trying to talk or trying to submit papers. But also, they mostly turned their backs on the mainstream scientific venues in their field.</p><p> What has happened in the last six months is breaking that barrier.</p></blockquote><p> That matches my understanding. The scientific venues were dismissive and did not want to hear it, demanding &#39;concrete evidence&#39; in ways that did not in context make sense, and which formed self-reinforcing barriers because scientific credibility and standards of evidence are recursive and self-recommending, for both good and bad reasons. Faced with this, those trying to sound the alarm &#39;turned their backs&#39; in the field in the sense of giving up on the channels that were refusing to engage. Standard you-can-call-it-both-sides situation.</p><p> Things are improving on both fronts now. The gatekeepers are less automatically dismissive, and there is enough &#39;concrete evidence&#39; available to satisfy at least some demands for it and start the bootstrapping, although that requirement remains massively warping at best. And with that plus the higher stakes and resourcing, existential risk advocates are making more of an effort.</p><p> Also this:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> The media forced me to articulate all these thoughts. That was a good thing.</p></blockquote><p>是的。 If you seek to understand, there is no substitute for explaining to others.</p><p> As always, there is the clash of priorities. Notice the standard asymmetries.</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> How did your colleagues at Mila react to your reckoning about your life&#39;s work?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> The most frequent reaction here at Mila was from people who were mostly worried about the current harms of AI—issues related to discrimination and human rights. They were afraid that talking about these future, science-fiction-sounding risks would detract from the discussion of the injustice that <em>is</em> going on—the concentration of power and the lack of diversity and of voice for minorities or people in other countries that are on the receiving end of whatever we do.</p><p> I&#39;m totally with them, except that it&#39;s not one or the other. We have to deal with all the issues. There&#39;s been progress on that front. People understand that it&#39;s unreasonable to discard the existential risks or, as I prefer to call them, catastrophic risks. [The latter] doesn&#39;t mean humans are gone, but a lot of suffering might come.</p><p> There are also other voices—mostly coming from industry—that say, “No, don&#39;t worry! Let us handle it! We&#39;ll self-regulate and protect the public!” This very strong voice has a lot of influence over governments.</p><p> People who feel like humanity has something to lose should not be infighting. They should speak in one voice to make governments move. Just as we&#39;ve had public discussions about the danger of nuclear weapons and climate change, the public needs to come to grips that there is yet another danger that has a similar magnitude of potential risks.</p></blockquote><p> So how bad are things?</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> When you think about the potential for artificial intelligence to threaten humanity, where do you land on a continuum of despair to hope?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> What&#39;s the right word? In French, it&#39;s <em>impuissant</em> . It&#39;s a feeling that there&#39;s a problem, but I can&#39;t solve it. It&#39;s worse than that, as I think it is solvable. If we all agreed on a particular protocol, we could completely avoid the problem.</p><p> Climate change is similar. If we all decided to do the right thing, we could stop the problem right now. There would be a cost, but we could do it. It&#39;s the same for AI. There are things we could do. We could all decide not to build things that we don&#39;t know for sure are safe. It&#39;s very simple.</p><p> But that goes so much against the way our economy and our political systems are organized. It seems very hard to achieve that until something catastrophic happens. Then maybe people will take it more seriously. But even then, it&#39;s hard because you have to convince everyone to behave properly.</p></blockquote><p> We can be rather good at convincing people to behave when we are willing to apply various forms of pressure, or if necessary force, but we have to be willing to do that. We are willing to do that continuously, every day, on a wide range of ordinary things. I am not so despairing that we could do it once again, even if the international aspect increases the difficulty level, but Bengio nails the problem that we need the motivation to do it, and that this might not happen until catastrophe strikes. At which point, it could already be too late.</p><p> His conclusion:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> Do you have a suggestion for how we might better prepare?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> In the future, we&#39;ll need a humanity defense organization. We have defense organizations within each country. We&#39;ll need to organize internationally a way to protect ourselves against events that could otherwise destroy us.</p><p> It&#39;s a longer-term view, and it would take a lot of time to have multiple countries agree on the right investments. But right now, all the investment is happening in the private sector. There&#39;s nothing that&#39;s going on with a public-good objective that could defend humanity.</p></blockquote><p> In one form or another, this seems right.</p><h4> Marc Andreessen&#39;s Techno-Optimist Manifesto</h4><p> All right, fine.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Marc Andreessen presents The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a> , which got enough coverage that I need to make an exception and cover it.</p><p> Big &#39;in this house we believe&#39; energy. Very much <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-dial-of-progress">The Dial of Progress</a> , except with much heavier anvils and all subtext made text.</p><p> Directionally, in most places, it is right, and it makes many important points, citing the usual suspects starting with Smith and Ricardo. Many overstatements. It&#39;s a manifesto, comes with the territory. What did you except, truth seeking to ever get chosen over anticipated memetic fitness?这。是。 Manifesto.</p><p> Alas, while I mostly agree with the non-AI portions, I was not inspired by them, because the damn thing is too long and rambling, and it is not precise while doing so, it does not seem to be attempting to convince anyone, and yeah yeah what else is new.</p><p> The exception to that is the Technological Values section, much of which is excellent.</p><p> Then there&#39;s the parts on AI, which are quite bad. There&#39;s the &#39;intelligence&#39; section.</p><blockquote><p> We believe intelligence is the ultimate engine of progress. Intelligence makes everything better. Smart people and smart societies outperform less smart ones on virtually every metric we can measure. Intelligence is the birthright of humanity; we should expand it as fully and broadly as we possibly can.</p><p> We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral – first, as more smart people around the world are recruited into the techno-capital machine; second, as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems such as companies and networks; third, as Artificial Intelligence ramps up the capabilities of our machines and ourselves.</p><p> We believe we are poised for an intelligence takeoff that will expand our capabilities to unimagined heights.</p><p> We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher&#39;s Stone – we are literally making sand think.</p><p> We believe Artificial Intelligence is best thought of as a universal problem solver. And we have a lot of problems to solve.</p><p> We believe Artificial Intelligence can save lives – if we let it. Medicine, among many other fields, is in the stone age compared to what we can achieve with joined human and machine intelligence working on new cures. There are scores of common causes of death that can be fixed with AI, from car crashes to pandemics to wartime friendly fire.</p><p> We believe any deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing is a form of murder.</p></blockquote><p>这是正确的。 Not developing maximum AI is a form of murder.</p><p> I feel oddly singled out, here? Why isn&#39;t holding back everything else or any non-optimal decision also a form of murder? What about Marc&#39;s failure to donate more money for malaria nets?</p><blockquote><p> We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do.</p><p> We believe Augmented Intelligence drives marginal productivity which drives wage growth which drives demand which drives the creation of new supply… with no upper bound.</p></blockquote><p> Existential risk? Never heard of her, except in the &#39;enemies&#39; list. Very constructive way to think we have here:</p><blockquote><p>六十年来，我们当前的社会一直遭受着一场大规模的士气低落运动——反对技术和生活——以不同的名称，如“存在风险”、“可持续性”、“ESG”、“可持续发展目标”、“社会责任”、“利益相关者资本主义”、“预防原则”、“信任与安全”、“技术伦理”、“风险管理”、“去增长”、“增长的极限”。</p></blockquote><p> Does Marc have no idea that the first of these things – and I do not think it is a coincidence it is first – is not like the others? That one of these things does not belong?</p><p> Or does he know, and is deliberately trying to put it there anyway? Perhaps as the entire central point of the entire damn manifesto?</p><p> Or is he so far gone that the concept of the map matching the territory, that words could have meaning and causes might have a variety of effects, completely lost to him?</p><p> Either way, none of this is an argument on anything but vibes.</p><p> Which is a shame, because I otherwise very much want to help with the whole techno-optimism thing, and the list of virtues (called &#39;technological values&#39;) starts off pretty sweet and also is pretty sweet later on, this part is a list I can get behind (modulo &#39;what is revenge doing there, that&#39;s kind of a weird choice…&#39;):</p><blockquote><p> We believe in ambition, aggression, persistence, relentlessness – strength.</p><p> We believe in merit and achievement.</p><p> We believe in bravery, in courage.</p><p> We believe in pride, confidence, and self respect – when earned.</p><p> We believe in free thought, free speech, and free inquiry.</p><p> We believe in the actual Scientific Method and enlightenment values of free discourse and challenging the authority of experts.</p><p> We believe, as Richard Feynman said, “Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.”</p><p> And, “I would rather have questions that can&#39;t be answered than answers that can&#39;t be questioned.”</p><p> We believe in local knowledge, the people with actual information making decisions, not in playing God.</p><p> ……</p><p> We believe in the truth.</p><p> We believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is better than scarce.</p><p> We believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and everything abundant.</p><p> We believe extrinsic motivations – wealth, fame, revenge – are fine as far as they go. But we believe intrinsic motivations – the satisfaction of building something new, the camaraderie of being on a team, the achievement of becoming a better version of oneself – are more fulfilling and more lasting.</p><p> We believe in what the Greeks called eudaimonia through arete – flourishing through excellence.</p><p> We believe technology is universalist.</p></blockquote><p> Except I don&#39;t want us all to die. What did I skip over?</p><blockquote><p> We believe in embracing variance, in increasing interestingness.</p><p> We believe in risk, in leaps into the unknown.</p><p> We believe in competition, because we believe in evolution.</p><p> We believe in evolution, because we believe in life.</p></blockquote><p> What does it mean to &#39;believe in evolution,&#39; &#39;embrace variance&#39; and &#39;believe in risk, in leaps into the unknown&#39; in the context of intentionally creating maximally intelligent and capable new things as quickly as possible? It means losing control over the future, it means having no preferences other than fitness. It means death. Which could be with or without the &#39;and that&#39;s good, actually&#39; line at the end that is logically implied.</p><p> And later, in the next section, we have this:</p><blockquote><p>对技术的一个常见批评是，它剥夺了我们生活中的选择权，因为机器为我们做决定。 This is undoubtedly true, yet more than offset by the freedom to create our lives that flows from the material abundance created <strong><em>by</em></strong> our use of machines.</p></blockquote><p> Like the rest of the manifesto, this has historically been very true, is currently very true on most (but notice, not all) margins, and quite obviously we should not expect that relationship to hold if we build machines that think better than we do.</p><p> What to make of all this? One certainly must take in the irony.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/littIeramblings/status/1714326250364321941">Sarah</a> (@LittIeramblings) : the irony of @pmarca labelling AI safety some kind of semi-religious doomsday cult and then publishing a &#39;manifesto&#39; comprised of &#39;beliefs&#39; that he makes zero attempt to substantiate lol.</p><p> This reads more like a cultish chant than anything I&#39;ve ever heard a safety advocate say.</p></blockquote><p> Again, on his list of enemies, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsRjQDrDnY8">one of these things is not like the others</a> . Whereas when one hears the responses from those who affiliate with the rest of his list, it is hard not to sympathize with Marc&#39;s need to go off on an extended rant here.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1713978560304587161">Ben Collins</a> (Senior Reporter, NBC News): Marc Andreessen, who runs one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital firms, wrote a “manifesto” today labeling “social responsibility” and “tech ethics” teams “the enemy.” His firm recently pivoted from crypto/Web3 to American military and defense contractor technology.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/aphysicist/status/1714374208212607196">Aaron Slodov</a> : Seeing this post and reading through the replies makes it very clear that hall monitor personalities like this are so completely opposite from high agency builders and jaywalkers who move society forward.

Marinetti is not only the author of the technology- and destruction-worshipping <em>Futurist Manifesto</em> from 1909, but also one of the architects of Italian fascism. Marinetti co-authored the <em>Fascist Manifesto</em> in 1919 and founded a futurist political party that merged with Mussolini&#39;s fascists. Other futurist thinkers and artists exist. To call Marinetti in particular a “saint” is a choice.</p></blockquote><p> There is also this gem of willful misunderstanding:</p><blockquote><p> Janus Rose (Vice): It gives further weight to viewing effective accelerationism—and its counterparts, “effective altruism” and “longtermism”—as the official ideology of Silicon Valley.</p></blockquote><p> There is no mystery here. The official ideology of Silicon Valley is to build cool stuff and make money. That is true whether or not they live up to their ideals.</p><p> Also, sure, there are a bunch of them who really don&#39;t want us all to die and have noticed that one might be up in the air, another highly overlapping bunch of them think maybe doing good things for people is good, and on the flip side others think that building cool stuff is The Way even if it would look to a normal person like the particular cool stuff might actually go badly up to and including getting everyone killed. They are people, and contain multitudes.</p><p> What frustrates me most is that Marc Andreessen keeps talking about general techno-optimism, I agree with him on every margin except frontier or open source AI models, and yet he seems profoundly uninterested in all the other issues, where I mostly think he is right. Many others are in the same boat, for example <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1714901707711217835">David Deutsch agrees with most of the manifesto</a> . <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/robbensinger/status/1714873561414881790">Rob Bensinger actively likes not only its substance but its style</a> , if you added a caveat about smarter-than-human AI.

The whole point of the game is to prevent ruin, to keep playing, and this is a whole new level of ruin and humanity not getting to keep playing. If things go wrong, the loss is infinite, and you can&#39;t draw conclusions from it not having happened yet. Nor will it be, when and if it does happen, a black swan or unlikely event.

That definitely is strong evidence of profound philosophical confusion.</p><p> My general stance on such matters is that Wrong Conclusions are Wrong, if your deontology cannot figure out that the extinction of humanity would be worse than aligning an AI, then what needs to be extinguished or aligned is your version of deontology. Morality is to serve us, not the other way around.</p><p> My solution to this particular dilemma, aside from not centrally being a Kantian deontologist, is that (up to a point, but quite sufficiently for this case) a universal rule of sticking up for one&#39;s own values and interests and everyone having a perspective is a much better universal system than everyone trying to pretend that they don&#39;t have such a perspective and that they their preferences should be ignored.</p><h4> The Lighter Side</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1714565406491541609">At least by this metric</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Roon: the only intelligence metric that matters is x monetization dollars per month.</p><p> Zvi: I predict fast takeoff.</p></blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/___frye/status/1713972726560637114">Names are important.</a></p><blockquote><p> Brad: NVDA has joined the trillionaire club, so the new acronym is not FAANG anymore, it&#39;s MANGA.

This, as the argument goes, shows that in the one case we have of a process creating general intelligence, it was not the case that the optimization target of the created intelligence ended up being the same as the optimization target of the process that created it. Therefore, alignment doesn&#39;t happen by default. To quote from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNhMPAWcfBCASy8e6/a-central-ai-alignment-problem-capabilities-generalization">A central AI alignment problem: capabilities generalization, and the sharp left turn</a> :<br></p><blockquote><p> And in the same stroke that [an AI&#39;s] capabilities leap forward, its alignment properties are revealed to be shallow, and to fail to generalize. The central analogy here is that optimizing apes for inclusive genetic fitness (IGF) doesn&#39;t make the resulting humans optimize mentally for IGF. Like, sure, the apes are eating because they have a hunger instinct and having sex because it feels good—but it&#39;s not like they <i>could</i> be eating/fornicating due to explicit reasoning about how those activities lead to more IGF. They can&#39;t yet perform the sort of abstract reasoning that would correctly justify those actions in terms of IGF. And then, when they start to generalize well in the way of humans, they predictably don&#39;t <i>suddenly start</i> eating/fornicating <i>because</i> of abstract reasoning about IGF, even though they now <i>could</i> . Instead, they invent condoms, and fight you if you try to remove their enjoyment of good food (telling them to just calculate IGF manually). The alignment properties you lauded before the capabilities started to generalize, predictably fail to generalize with the capabilities.</p></blockquote><p> Jacob published <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xCCNdxNPpbJKD3x4W/evolution-solved-alignment-what-sharp-left-turn">Evolution Solved Alignment (what sharp left turn?)</a> , arguing that actually humans represent a great alignment <i>success</i> . Evolution was trying to make things that make many copies of themselves, and humans are enormously successful on that metric. To quote Jacob:</p><blockquote><p> For the evolution of human intelligence, the optimizer is just evolution: biological natural selection. The utility function is something like fitness: ex gene replication count (of the human defining genes) <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xCCNdxNPpbJKD3x4W/evolution-solved-alignment-what-sharp-left-turn#fn-ZfBacxFa8jjFpbJvN-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> . And by any reasonable measure, it is obvious that humans are enormously successful. If we normalize so that a utility score of 1 represents a mild success - the expectation of a typical draw of a great apes species, then humans&#39; score is >;4 OOM larger, completely off the charts. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xCCNdxNPpbJKD3x4W/evolution-solved-alignment-what-sharp-left-turn#fn-ZfBacxFa8jjFpbJvN-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p> I pushed back, saying:</p><blockquote><p> The failure of alignment is witnessed by the fact that humans very very obviously fail to maximize the relative frequency of their genes in the next generation, given the opportunities available to them; and they are often aware of this; and they often choose to do so anyway.</p></blockquote><p> We got into a messy discussion.

General Evolution is the process where patterns of any kind that become more common over time will come to dominate. Since some patterns and aggregates of patterns can make themselves more common; for example, an organism that reproduces itself, a gene that gets copied, a virulent meme. Those patterns can &quot;team up&quot;, eg genes in an organism or memes in a memeplex, and they can be tweaked so that they are better at making themselves more common. So what we see around us is patterns and aggregates of patterns that are really good at making themselves more common. If we think of General Evolution as having a utility function, its utility function is something along the lines of: There should be things that make many copies of themselves.<br><br> The second kind of process is what I&#39;ll call a Lineage Evolution. For every species S alive today, there&#39;s a Lineage Evolution called &quot;S-evolution&quot; that goes from the first life form, up the phylogenetic tree of life along the branch that S is on, through each of S&#39;s ancestor species, up to S itself.<br><br> There are also two meanings of &quot;humans&quot;. &quot;Humans&quot; could mean individual humans, or it could mean humanity as a whole.<br><br> I read the original argument as saying: Human-evolution (an instance of a Lineage Evolution) selected for IGF of organisms. That is, at every step of the way, Human-evolution promoted genes that created humans (or human-ancestor-species organisms) that were good at making the genes in that organism be more common in the next generation. Today, most individual-humans do not do anything like explicitly, monomaniacally trying to promote their own genes. Thus, an instance of misalignment.<br><br> I think, though I&#39;m very far from sure, that Jacob actually mostly agrees with this. I think Jacob wants to say that<br><br> 1. Humanity is the proper subject of the question of misalignment;<br> 2. General Evolution is the proper subject;<br> 3. Humanity is pretty aligned with General Evolution, because there are many humans, and General Evolution wants there to be patterns that make many of themselves.<br><br> My current main reply is:<br><br> General Evolution is not the proper subject, because the vast majority of the optimization power going into designing humans is Human-evolution.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 18:30:08 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 18:30:08 GMT" user-order="1"><p> I think it might help me if you wrote a few sentences that lay out your top level case, reformulated given the context we have so far.

In many species, only a tiny fraction of individuals reproduce at all.  For humans it&#39;s over 50% for women, but perhaps under 50% for men.</p><p> Evolution proceeds through random variation and selection - many experiments in parallel, only some of which will be successful - <i>by design</i> .  The failures are <i>necessary</i> for progress.</p><p> Over time evolution optimizes simply for fitness - the quantity/measure of genetic patterns, defined over some set of genetic patterns.  If you try to measure that for an individual, you get IGF - because the gene pattern of that individual will necessarily overlap with other individuals (strongly with closely related kin, overlap fading out with distance, etc).  Likewise you can measure fitness for ever larger populations up to the species level.</p><p> Given two optimization processes with distinct utility functions, you could perhaps measure the degree of alignment as the dot product of the two functions over the world state (or expectation thereof for future world trajectory distributions).<br><br> But we can&#39;t directly measure the alignment between evolution as an optimizer and brains as an optimizer - even if we have some idea of how to explicitly define evolution&#39;s optimization target (fitness), the brain&#39;s optimization target is some complex individually varying proxy of fitness - far more complex than any simple function.  Moreover, degree of alignment is not really the interesting concept by itself, unless normalized to some relevant scale (to set the threshold for success/failure).</p><p> But given that we know one of the utility functions (evolution: fitness), we can approximately measure the total impact.  The world today is largely the result of optimization by human brains - ie it is the end result of optimization towards the proxy utility function, not the real utility function.  Thus there is only a singular useful threshold for misalignment: is the world today (or recent history) high, low, or zero utility according to the utility function of human fitness?</p><p> And the answer is <i>obviously</i> high utility.  Thus any misalignment was small in net impact, period.</p><p> If E(W) is evolutionary utility and B(W) is brain utility, we have:<br><br> W[T] = opt(W[0], B(W))</p><p> E(W[T]) = large<br><br> (The world was optimized according to brains (proxy utility), not genetic fitness utility, but the current world is enormously high scoring according to genetic fitness utility, which thereby bounds any misalignment).</p><p> TechneMarke argues that most of the evolutionary pressure producing brains was at the intra-species level, but this is irrelevant to my argument, <i>unless</i> TechneMarke actually believes and can show that this leads to a different correct utility function for evolution (other than fitness) <i>and</i> that humans are low scoring according to that function.</p><p> As an analogy: corporations largely optimize for profit, and the secondary fact that most innovation in large corps stems from intra-corporate competition is irrelevant to the primary fact that corporations largely optimize for profit.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> jacob_cannell </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:02:37 GMT" user-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT" display-name="jacob_cannell" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:02:37 GMT" user-order="2"><p> So to summarize, there are several possible levels of evolution&lt;->;brain alignment:</p><ul><li> species: alignment of brains (in aggregate) and species level fitness</li><li> individual: alignment of individual brains and individual IGF</li></ul><p> We both seem to agree that individual alignment is high variance - some individuals are strongly aligned to IGF, others not at all.

I think the framing here may have covered over our disagreement. I want to say: humans were constructed by a process that selected for IGF across many iterations. Now, humans are kinda optimizing for things, but they are definitely not optimizing for IGF.<br><br> I think you&#39;re saying something in the general category of: &quot;Sure, but the concepts you&#39;re using here aren&#39;t joint-carving. If you look at the creation of humans by evolution, and then you think of with non-joint-carving concepts, then you&#39;ll see misalignment. But that&#39;s just misalignment between a non-joint-carving subset of the real designing process and a non-joint-carving subset of the thing that gets designed.&quot;<br><br> And I&#39;m like... Ok, but the analogy still seems to hold?<br><br> Like, if I think of humans trying to make AI, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the utility function of all the humans trying to make AI&quot;. I think I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the criteria that the humans trying to make AI, or the objective function used for gradient descent or RL, are concretely using day-to-day to pick what tweaks / ideas in their designs to keep around&quot;.  So there&#39;s two analogies there, but both of the same form.<br><br> One of the analogies is like: humans go around coming up with ideas for AI; if their AI does something cool, they upvote that; if they can, they try to tweak the AI that does something cool so that it can be used to actually do something useful for humans; in the cases where the AI does something noticeably bad, the humans try to patch that. The humans probably think of themselves as implementing their own utility function through their actions, and more importantly, they might actually be doing so in a certain sense. If the humans could go on patching bad results and upvoting cool results and install using-for-good patches, then in the limit of that, the real human utility function would be expressed and fulfilled. But the analogy here is saying: These criteria the humans are using to design their AI, to make the tweaks that over the course of humanity&#39;s AI research will add up to really powerful AI, can make a really powerful AI without installing in the AI the limiting real human utility function. Similarly, given enough evolutionary time, evolution would install more strategic-IGF-optimization in humans; that may already be happening.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:32:04 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:32:04 GMT" user-order="1"><p> In other words, for the analogy to seem right and important to me, it doesn&#39;t feel very cruxy that it be a clear instance of utility function vs. utility function misalignment. What feels cruxy is a less precise sense of: this process designed an optimizer by selecting really hard for X, but then the optimizer ended up trying to do Y which is different from X.<br><br> Like, if I train an AI by the objective function of imitating humans, I expect that eventually, when it&#39;s getting really exceptionally good, it will become an optimizer that is optimizing powerfully for something other than imitating humans.<br><br> It&#39;s possible that a crux for us is related to how much to care about expected future outcomes. I think you said in some comments somewhere, something like, &quot;yeah, maybe humans / humanity will be much more misaligned with evolution in the future, but that&#39;s speculation and circular reasoning, it hasn&#39;t happened yet&quot;. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s circular: We can see clearly <i>today</i> that humans <i>are</i> optimizing for things, and say they are optimizing for things, and those things are <i>not</i> IGF, and so predictably <i>later</i> , when humans have the power, we will end up scoring very <i>low</i> on IGF; today the misalignment is fuzzier, and has to be judged against counterfactuals (how much IGF <i>could</i> a modern human be getting, <i>if</i> they were anything like IGF maximizers).</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 20:15:13 GMT" user-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT" display-name="jacob_cannell" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 20:15:13 GMT" user-order="2"><blockquote><p> Now, humans are kinda optimizing for things, but they are definitely not optimizing for IGF.</p></blockquote><p> We may still have disagreement on this - I would reiterate that at the individual level some humans are definitely optimizing strongly for IGF, up to the limits of a 20W physical computer (which rules out most objections based on gross misunderstanding of the physical limits of optimization power for 20W irreversible computers).  I already brought up one specific example in our private discussion - namely individual humans going to great efforts to maximize successful sperm donation even when they are paid trivial amounts, or aren&#39;t paid at all and in some cases actually commit felonies with long prison sentences to do so (strongly antipaid).  Also the way the brain <i>mostly normally</i> works is closer to something like mysteriously subconsciously compelling you to optimize for IGF - take Elon Musk as an example: he is on track to very high IGF score, but doesnt&#39; seem to be explicitly consciously optimizing for that.  Alignment in the brain is very complex and clearly not yet fully understood - but it is highly redundant with many levels of mechanisms in play.</p><p> So one point of potential confusion is I do believe that properly understanding and determining what &quot;optimizing for IGF, up to the limits of a 20W physical computer&quot; actually entails requires deep understanding of DL and neuroscience and leads to something like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iCfdcxiyr2Kj8m8mT/the-shard-theory-of-human-values">shard theory</a> .  The kind of consequentialist optimizer Nate seems to imply fails miserably at 20W and is not remotely related to what a successful design (like the brain) looks like - it is always an ultra complex proxy optimizer, ala shard theory and related.<br><br> Perfect alignment is a myth, a fantasy - and clearly unnecessary for success! (that is much of the lesson of this analogy)</p><blockquote><p> Like, if I think of humans trying to make AI, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the utility function of all the humans trying to make AI&quot;. I think I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the criteria that the humans trying to make AI, or the objective function used for gradient descent or RL, are concretely using day-to-day to pick what tweaks / ideas in their designs to keep around&quot;.</p></blockquote><p> I do believe that among the possible alignment analogies from evolution, there is a single best analogy: the systems level analogy.</p><p> Genetic evolutionary optimization producing brains is like technological evolutionary optimization producing AGI.</p><p> Both processes involve bilevel optimization: an outer genetic (or memetic) evolutionary optimization process and an inner ANN optimization process.  Practical AGI is necessarily very brain like (which I <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine) correctly many years in advance, contra EY/MIRI)">predicted</a> correctly many years in advance, contra EY/MIRI).  DL is closely converging on brain like designs, in all respects that matter.</p><p> The outer evolutionary optimization process is similar, but with some key differences. The genome specifies the initial architectural prior (compact low bit and low frequency encoding over the weights) along with an efficient approx bayesian learning algorithm to update those weights.  Likewise AI systems are specified by a small compact code (pytorch, tensorflow etc) which specifies the initial architectural prior along with an efficient approx bayesian learning algo to update those weights (SGD).  The main difference is that for tech evolution the units of encoding - the tech memes - recombine far more flexibly than genes.  Each new experiment can combine memes flexibly from a large number of previous papers/experiments, a process guided by human intelligence (inner optimization).  The main effect is simply a massive speedup - similar but more extreme than advanced genetic engineering.</p><p> I think this really is the singularly most informative analogy.  And from that analogy I think we can say this:<br><br> To the extent that the tech evolution of AGI is similar to the genetic evolution of human intelligence (brains), genetic evolution&#39;s great success at aligning humanity so far (in aggregate, not individually) implies a similar level of success for tech evolution aligning AGI (in aggregate, not individually) to similar non-trivial levels of optimization power divergence.</p><p> If you think that the first AGI crossing some capability threshold is likely to suddenly takeover the world, then the species level alignment analogy breaks down and doom is more likely.  It would be like a single medieval era human suddenly taking over the world via powerful magic.  Would the resulting world after optimization according to that single human&#39;s desires still score reasonably well at IGF?  I&#39;d say somewhere between 90% to 50% probability, but that&#39;s still clearly a high p(doom) scenario.  I do think that scenario is unlikely for a variety of reasons (in short, the same factor that allows human engineers to select for successful meme changes enormously above chance also acts as a hidden great filter reducing failure variance in tech designs), but that&#39;s a long separate discussion I&#39;ve already partly argued elsewhere.</p><p> So one key component underlying evolution&#39;s success at aligning humanity is the variance reducing effect of large populations, which maps directly to multipolar scenarios.  A population will almost always be more aligned then worst case or even median individuals, and a population can be perfectly aligned even when nearly every single individual is near completely misaligned (orthogonal).  Variance reduction is critical for most successful optimization algos (SGD and evolution included).</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> jacob_cannell </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:14:10 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:14:10 GMT" user-order="1"><p> (At this point I&#39;m going to make the dialogue publicly viewable, and we can continue as long as that seems good.)</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:21:27 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:21:27 GMT" user-order="1"><blockquote><p> TM: The failure of alignment is witnessed by the fact that humans very very obviously fail to maximize the relative frequency of their genes in the next generation, given the opportunities available to them</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> J: This is irrelevant - individual failure &quot;to maximize the relative frequency of their genes in the next generation&quot; is the expected outcome at the individual level for most species.

The utility function is a design parameter which translates into a fitness function which typically determines each offspring&#39;s distribution of children, as a direct analog of the evolutionary fitness concept.  Of course for real genetic evolution the equivalent individual reproductive fitness function is the result of a complex physics simulation, and the optimization target is the fitness of replicator units (genes/genesets) rather than somas.  But it&#39;s still an optimizer in the general sense.</p><p> An optimization process in general is a computational system that expends physical energy to update a population sample distribution of replicators (programs) extropically.  By &#39;extropically&#39; I mean it updates the distribution in some anti-entropic direction (which necessarily requires physical computational energy to maintain and update away from the max entropy min energy ground state).  That direction is the utility function of the optimizer.  For genetic evolution that clearly seems to be fitness with respect to the current environment.</p><p> We could even measure the amount of optimization power applied towards fitness as direct evidence: imagine a detailed physical sim model which can predict the fitness of a genotype:  f(G).  Given that function, we could greatly compress the temporal sequence of all DNA streams of all cells that have ever existed.  That compression is only possible because of replicator fitness; there is no compression for random nucleotide sequences.  Furthermore, the set of all DNA in all cells at any given moment in time is also highly compressible, with the degree of compression a direct consequence of the cumulative fitness history.</p><p> So evolution is <i>clearly</i> an optimizer and clearly optimizing for replicator fitness.  Human brain neural networks are also optimizers of sorts with a different implicit utility function - necessarily an efficient proxy of (inclusive) fitness (see shard theory).</p><p> We can not directly measure the misalignment between the two utility functions, but we can observe that optimization of the world for the last ~10,000 years mostly in the direction of human brain utility (technocultural evolution) <i>enormously</i> increased humanity&#39;s evolutionary fitness utility.</p><p> Thus it is simply a fact that the degree of misalignment was insignificant according to the <i>only metric that matters</i> : the outer optimizer&#39;s utility function (fitness). </p><p></p><p></p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor">jacob_cannell </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:21:00 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:21:00 GMT" user-order="1"><blockquote><p> It doesn&#39;t matter if the individual fails to reproduce because they died too early or &#39;chose&#39; not to<br></p></blockquote><p> It matters because it shows what the individual is trying to do, which is relevant to misalignment (or objective-misalignment, which is what I&#39;ll call &quot;a process selecting for X and making a strategic general optimizer that doesn&#39;t optimize for X&quot;).</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:21:41 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:21:41 GMT" user-order="1"><blockquote><p> We update on historical evidence only, not our future predictions.</p></blockquote><p> Our stated and felt intentions count as historical evidence about our intentions.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:52:31 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:52:31 GMT" user-order="1"><blockquote><p> <strong>actually optimize</strong></p></blockquote><p> They optimize, yes.

It doesn&#39;t say which long-run futures are good or bad. It&#39;s not hooked up to a <i>general, strategic</i> optimizer. For example, an image generation model also doesn&#39;t have a utility function in this sense. Humanity arguably has such a utility function, though it&#39;s complicated.<br><br> Why care about this more specific sense of utility function? Because that&#39;s what we are trying to align an AI with. We humans have, NOT JUST instrumentally convergent abilities to optimize (like the ability gain energy), and NOT JUST a selection criterion that we apply to the AIs we&#39;re making, and NOT JUST large already-happening impacts on the world, BUT ALSO goals that are about the long-run future, like &quot;live in a flourishing intergalactic civilization of people making art and understanding the world and each other&quot;. That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to align AI with.<br><br> If you build a big search process, like a thing that searches for chip layouts that decrease latency or whatever, then that search process certainly optimizes.

But I&#39;m saying it doesn&#39;t have a utility function, in the narrow sense I&#39;m describing. Let&#39;s call it an agent-utility function. It doesn&#39;t have an agent-utility function because it doesn&#39;t think about, care about, do anything about, or have any effect (besides chaos / physics / other effects routing through chaotic effects on humans using the chip layouts) on the rest of the world.<br><br> I claim:<br><br> 1. Neither General Evolution nor any Lineage Evolution has an agent-utility function.<br> 2. There&#39;s a relationship which I&#39;ll call selection-misalignment. The relationship is where there&#39;s a powerful selection process S that selects for X, and it creates a general strategic optimizer A (agent) that tries to achieve some goal Y which doesn&#39;t look like X. So A is selection-misaligned with S: it was selected for X, but it tries to achieve some other goal.<br> 3. Humans and humanity are selection-misaligned with human-lineage-evolution.</p><p> 4. It doesn&#39;t make much sense to be selection-misaligned or selection-aligned with General Evolution, because General Evolution is so weak.<br> 5. To be values-misaligned is when <i>an agent</i> A1 makes <i>another agent</i> A2, and A2 goes off and tries to achieve some goal that tramples A1&#39;s goals.</p><p> 6. It doesn&#39;t make much sense to be values-(mis)aligned with any sort of evolution, because evolution isn&#39;t an agent. </p><p><br><br></p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre</section></section><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqXdDs68zMJ82Dcmt/are-humans-misaligned-with-evolution#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqXdDs68zMJ82Dcmt/are-humans-misaligned-with-evolution<guid ispermalink="false"> xqXdDs68zMJ82Dcmt</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[TekhneMakre]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:14:14 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The (partial) fallacy of dumb superintelligence]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on October 18, 2023 9:25 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skRgYH7oAjc"><u>her opening statement for the Munk debate on AI risk,</u></a> Melanie Mitchell addressed a proposed example of AGI risk: an AGI tasked with fixing climate change might decide to eliminate humans as the source of carbon emissions. She says:</p><blockquote><p> This is an example of what&#39;s called the fallacy of dumb superintelligence. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefs793uam9h9i"><sup><a href="#fns793uam9h9i">[1]</a></sup></span> That is, it&#39;s a fallacy to think a machine could be &#39;smarter than humans in all respects&#39;, but still lack any common sense understanding of humans, such as understanding why we made the request to fix climate change.</p></blockquote><p> I think this “fallacy” is a crux of disagreement about AI x-risk, by way of alignment difficulty. I&#39;ve heard this statement from other reasonably well-informed risk doubters. The intuition makes sense. But most people in alignment would dismiss this out of hand as being itself a fallacy. Understanding these two positions not only clarifies the discussion, but suggests reasons we&#39;re overlooking a promising approach to alignment.</p><p> This &quot;fallacy&quot; doesn&#39;t establish that alignment is easy. Understanding what you mean doesn&#39;t make the AGI want to do that thing. Actions are guided by goals, which are different from knowledge. But this intuition that understanding should help alignment needn&#39;t be totally discarded. We now have proposed alignment approaches that make use of an AIs understanding for its alignment. They do this by “pointing” a motivational system at representations in a learned knowledge system, such as “human flourishing”. I discuss two alignment plans that use this approach and seem quite promising.</p><p> Early alignment thinking assumed that this type of approach  was not viable, since AGIs could &quot; <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai-takeoff">go foom</a> &quot; (learn very quickly and unpredictably). This assumption appears not to be true of sub-human levels of training in deep networks, and that may be sufficient for initial alignment.</p><p> With a system capable of unpredictable rapid improvement, it would be madness to let it learn prior to aligning it. It might very well grow smart enough to escape before you get a chance to stop its learning to perform alignment. Thus, its goals (or a set of rewards to shape them) must be specified before it starts to learn. In that scenario, the way we specify goals cannot make use of the AI&#39;s intelligence. Mitchell&#39;s “fallacy” is itself a fallacy under this logic. An AGI that understands what we want can easily do things we very much don&#39;t want.</p><p> But early foom now seems unlikely, so our thinking should adjust. Deep networks don&#39;t increase in capabilities unpredictably, at least prior to human-level and recursive self improvement. And that may be far enough for initial alignment to succeed. The early assumption of AGI “going foom” now seems unlikely to be true. I think that early assumption has left a mistake in our collective thinking: that an AGI&#39;s knowledge is irrelevant to making it do what we want. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefg637hbyuzwv"><sup><a href="#fng637hbyuzwv">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h2> <strong>How to safely use an AI&#39;s understanding for alignment</strong></h2><p> Deep networks learn at a relatively predictable pace, in the current training regime. Thus, their training can be paused at intermediate levels that include some understanding of human values, but before they achieve superhuman capabilities. Once a system starts to reflect and direct its own learning, this smooth trajectory probably won&#39;t continue. But we can probably stop at a safe but useful level of intelligence/understanding, if we set that level carefully and cautiously. We probably can align an AGI partway through training, and thus make use of its understanding of what we want.</p><p> There are three particularly relevant examples of this type of approach. The first, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rlhf"><u>RLHF</u></a> , is relevant because it is widely known and understood. (I <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d6DvuCKH5bSoT62DB/compendium-of-problems-with-rlhf"><u>among others</u></a> don&#39;t consider it a promising approach to alignment by itself.) RLHF uses the LLM&#39;s trained “understanding” or “knowledge” as a substrate for efficiently specifying human preferences. Training on a limited set of human judgments about input-response pairs causes the LLM to generalize these preferences remarkably well. We are “pointing to” areas in its learned semantic spaces. Because those semantics are relatively well-formed, we need to do relatively little pointing to define a complex set of desired responses.</p><p> The second example is natural language alignment of language model agents (LMAs). This seems like a very promising alignment plan, if LMAs become our first AGIs. This plan consists of designing the agent to follow top-level goals stated in natural language (eg, &quot;get OpenAI a lot of money and political influence&quot;) including alignment goals (eg, &quot;do what Sam Altman wants, and make the world a better place&quot;.) I&#39;ve written more about this technique, and the ensemble of techniques it can &quot;stack&quot; with, <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Q7XWGqL4HjjRmhEyG/internal-independent-review-for-language-model-agent"><u>here</u></a> .</p><p> This approach follows the above general scheme. It pauses training to do alignment work by pre-training the LLM, and inserting alignment goals before launching the system as an agent. (This is mid-training, if that agent continues to perform continuous learning, as seems likely.) If the AI is sufficiently intelligent, it will pursue those goals as stated, including their rich and contextual semantics. Choosing these goal statements wisely is still a nontrivial outer alignment problem; but the AI&#39;s knowledge is the substrate for defining its alignment.</p><p> Another promising alignment plan that follows this general pattern is Steve Byrnes&#39; <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Hi7zurzkCog336EC2/plan-for-mediocre-alignment-of-brain-like-model-based-rl-agi"><u>Plan for mediocre alignment of brain-like [model-based RL] AGI</u></a> . In this plan, we induce the nascent AGI (paused at useful but controllable level of understanding/intelligence) to represent the concept we want it aligned to (eg, “think about human flourishing” or “corrigibility” or whatever). We then set the weights from the active units in its representational system into its critic system. Since the critic system is a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qzu9o3sTytbC4sZkQ/steering-subsystems-capabilities-agency-and-alignment"><u>steering subsystem</u></a> that determines its values and therefore its behavior, inner alignment is solved. That concept has become its “favorite”, highest-valued set of representations, and its decision-making will pursue everything semantically included in that concept as a final goal.</p><p> Now, contrast these techniques with alignment techniques that don&#39;t make use of the system&#39;s knowledge. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqkGmfikqapbJ2YMj/shard-theory-an-overview"><u>Shard Theory</u></a> and other proposals for aligning AGI by using the right set of rewards is one example. This requires accurately guessing how the system&#39;s representations will form, and how those rewards will shape the agent&#39;s behavior as they develop. Hand-coding a representation of any but the simplest goal (see <a href="https://arbital.com/p/diamond_maximizer/"><u>diamond maximization</u></a> ) seems so difficult that it&#39;s not generally considered a viable approach.</p><p> These are sketches of plans that need further development and inspection for flaws. And they only produce an initial, loose (&quot;mediocre&quot;) alignment with human values, in the training distribution. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g3pbJPQpNJyFfbHKd/the-alignment-stability-problem"><u>The alignment stability problem</u></a> of generalization and change of values remains unaddressed. Whether the alignment remains satisfactory after further learning, self-modification, or in new (out of distribution) circumstances seems like a complex problem that deserves further analysis.</p><p> This approach of leveraging an AI&#39;s intelligence and “telling it what we want” by pointing to its representations seems promising. And these two plans seem particularly promising. They apply to types of AGI we are likely to get (language model agents, RL agents, or a hybrid); they are straightforward enough to implement, and straightforward enough to think about in detail prior to implementing them.</p><p> I&#39;d love to hear specific pushback on this direction, or better yet, these specific plans. AI work seems likely to proceed apace, so alignment work should proceed with haste too. I think we need the best plans we can make and critique, applying to the types of AGI we&#39;re most likely to get, even if those plans are imperfect. <br></p><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fns793uam9h9i"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefs793uam9h9i">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> Richard Loosemore appears to have coined the term in 2012 or before.

It expands on the historical context for these ideas, particularly the claim that we should adjust our estimates of alignment difficulty in light of AI that has reasonably good understanding of human values. I don&#39;t care who thought what when, but I do care how the collective train of thought reviewed there might have misled us slightly. The discussion on that post clarifies the issues somewhat. This post is intended to offer a more concrete answer to a central question posed in that discussion: how we might close the gap between AI understanding our desires, and actually fulfilling them by making its decisions based on that understanding. I&#39;m also proposing that the key change from historical assumptions is the predictablility of learning therefore the option of safely performing alignment work on a partly-trained system.</p></div></li></ol><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qsDPHZwjmduSMCJLv/the-partial-fallacy-of-dumb-superintelligence#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qsDPHZwjmduSMCJLv/the-partial-fallacy-of-dumb-superintelligence<guid ispermalink="false"> qsDPHZwjmduSMCJLv</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Seth Herd]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 21:25:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
