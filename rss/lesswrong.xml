2023 4:47 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> Open Phil 两周前<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bBefhAXpCFNswNr9m/open-philanthropy-is-hiring-for-multiple-roles-across-our"><u>宣布</u></a>，我们正在为致力于全球灾难性风险降低的团队招聘 20 多个职位，并且我们将从明天开始在<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/peLstYwka2EzxiNG7/ama-six-open-philanthropy-staffers-discuss-op-s-new-gcr"><u>AMA</u></a>上回答问题。在此之前，我想分享一些有关我在<a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team/#5-technical-ai-safety"><u>团队</u></a>中招聘的角色（技术人工智能安全）的信息。该团队的目标是思考哪些技术研究最能帮助我们理解和降低人工智能的 x 风险，并通过向伟大的项目和研究小组提供资助，在高度优先的研究领域建立繁荣的领域。</p><p>首先，自从我们最初于 9 月 29 日列出角色以来，我们在技术 AI 安全中添加了三个新角色，如果您只看到原始公告，您可能还没有看到这些角色！除了最初的<strong>（高级）项目助理</strong>角色外，我们上周还增加了一个<strong>执行助理</strong>角色，昨天我们又增加了一个<strong>（高级）研究助理</strong>角色和一个专门从事人工智能<strong>特定子领域的高级项目助理</strong>角色安全研究（例如可解释性、对齐理论等）。看看它们是否有趣！行政助理的角色尤其需要非常不同的、技术性较低的技能。</p><p><strong>其次，在开始回答 AMA 问题之前，我想强调一下，我们的技术 AI 安全给予距离应有的平衡点还很远，还有相当大的增长空间，雇佣更多的人可能会很快带来更多更好的结果。补助金</strong>。我的估计是，去年，我们建议为人工智能技术安全提供约 2500 万美元的拨款， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefmw34ime35j"><sup><a href="#fnmw34ime35j">[1]</a></sup></span> ，今年到目前为止，我建议了类似的金额。随着拨款评估、研究和运营能力的增强，我们认为这一数字很容易翻倍或更多。</p><p>我们所有的 GCR 团队（由我领导的技术人工智能安全团队、由 Claire Zabel 领导的能力建设团队、由 Luke Muehlhauser 领导的人工智能治理和政策团队、以及由 Andrew Snyder-Beattie 领导的生物安全团队）目前的能力都受到严重限制，尤其是那些从事相关工作的团队鉴于最近该领域的兴趣和活动蓬勃发展，与人工智能相关的工作。我认为我的团队目前面临着比其他项目团队更严格的限制。与其他团队相比，我的团队：</p><ul><li><strong>规模要小得多：</strong>直到上周，我才主要关注人工智能技术安全（尽管克莱尔的团队有时会资助人工智能技术安全工作，主要是技能提升）。上周，<a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/max-nadeau/"><u>马克斯·纳多 (Max Nadeau)</u></a>作为我的第一位项目助理加入。相比之下，能力建设团队有八人，生物安全和人工智能治理团队各有五人。</li><li><strong>其领域的“覆盖范围”可能更差：</strong><ul><li>理想情况下，特定领域的强大且忠诚的资助团队将：<ul><li>与各自领域中最有影响力/最有前途的（例如）5-30% 的现有受资助者、潜在受资助者和关键非受资助者（例如在行业实验室从事人工智能安全工作的人员）保持实质性关系。</li><li>拥有相当强大的系统来了解其领域中大多数可能的潜在新受资助者（通过例如申请表或强大的推荐网络）。</li><li>有足够的能力对大部分可能的潜在受资助者进行重要的考虑，以便就是否资助他们以及资助多少做出明智、明确的决定。</li><li>拥有足够的能力来回顾性评估大笔拨款或重要类别拨款的结果。</li></ul></li><li>我的团队绝对没有达到这样的覆盖水平（例如，我们没有时间<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dua879FhtLf9jqyJo/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs?commentId=dQL4yD7HzdfgqBKKs"><u>打开申请表</u></a>或结识可以从事安全工作的学者）。虽然我们所有的 GCR 项目领域都可以使用更多的“现场覆盖”，但我的猜测是，我们在技术人工智能安全方面的覆盖范围比至少克莱尔和安德鲁在其领域的覆盖范围要差得多。该团队不仅覆盖其领域的人员较少，而且似乎可能的潜在参与者数量可能会更大，因为最近大量技术人员开始对人工智能安全产生了更大的兴趣。</li></ul></li><li><strong>有一个更新生的战略：</strong>虽然自 2015 年以来我们一直以某种形式资助技术人工智能安全研究，但该计划领域已多次更换领导层和战略方向， <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefcw2c961mapw"><sup><a href="#fncw2c961mapw">[2]</a></sup></span>并且当前的迭代非常接近于全新的状态- 我们已经结束了大部分旧项目，并希望从头开始建立一个新的、稳定的资助计划。<ul><li>我们的战略悬而未决的原因之一是，当前迭代的团队非常新，人工智能能力的进步正在迅速改变易于处理的研究项目的格局。我领导该项目领域还不到一年，我提供的大部分资助都提供给了 2021 年之前不存在的新团体和/或之前根本不可行的研究项目过去几年。相比之下，其他项目负责人已经制定了几年或更长时间的战略。</li><li>另一个重要原因是，我们还有大量悬而未决的问题，比如我们最希望看到哪些技术项目、什么样的结果最能改变我们对关键问题的看法或推动关键安全技术的发展，以及我们应该如何优先考虑这些问题对象级工作的不同流。例如，对此类问题的更好答案可能会改变我们重点关注的研究领域以及我们向潜在受助者推销的内容：<ul><li>我们如何判断可解释性技术的前景如何？衡量成功的最佳“内部有效性”指标是什么？衡量的最佳下游任务是什么？</li><li>理想的<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ChDH335ckdvpxXaXX/model-organisms-of-misalignment-the-case-for-a-new-pillar-of-1"><u>错位模型生物体</u></a>的要素是什么？创建这样一个模型的挑战是什么？</li><li><a href="https://llm-attacks.org/"><u>对抗性攻击和防御</u></a>研究中最引人注目的变革/影响路径理论是什么？此类研究最令人兴奋的版本是什么？</li><li>是否有一些<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/neurips20ws-assistance"><u>受辅助游戏/奖励不确定性传统启发</u></a>的实证研究方向，即使在语言模型范式中也可能有所帮助？</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>如果您在这一轮中加入技术人工智能安全团队，您可以帮助缓解一些严重的瓶颈，同时从头开始构建该程序领域的新迭代。如果这听起来令您兴奋，我强烈鼓励您申请！

McRocket-Face 代表观众。但现实世界中最像他的人可能是 OpenAI 首席执行官<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman">Sam Altman</a> 。</p><p>月球代表了人类水平的人工智能。人们普遍认为，第一个构建具有人类智能的人工智能的人或公司将在世界其他地区取得领先优势。</p><p> Mathy 和他的火箭代表了深度学习。添加火箭和燃料代表扩展（添加更多数据和计算）。</p><p> Subtle 和他的火箭代表了进化。虽然进化产生的设计非常出色，但即使是最简单的进化产物也太<a href="https://twitter.com/timd_ca/status/1713729441342603746">复杂</a>，人类无法理解。</p><h1>为什么这是加速深度学习研究的（notKillEveryoneIsm）论点</h1><p>从人工智能安全的角度来看，深度学习范例已经是最好的了。深度学习模型在逻辑上极其<a href="https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-scratch/">简单</a>。它们很容易<a href="https://twitter.com/saprmarks/status/1713889037902041292">解释</a>。它们<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback">极易</a>受人类控制。他们本质上是<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65703260/computational-complexity-of-self-attention-in-the-transformer-model">短视的</a>，这意味着他们不会威胁要取代人类。最后，由于深度学习模型依赖于充满 GPU 的庞大数据中心，因此很容易<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TYT1QfdfsM">关闭</a>。</p><p>相比之下，我们知道进化能够构建更加智能和危险的系统。进化不仅已经产生了人类，而且进化可以产生的算法类型也没有固有的限制。如果有可能开发出危险的超级智能人工智能，最终进化会<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oijEsqT2QKQ">找到一条出路</a>。</p><p>虽然从长远来看进化具有优势，但深度学习目前占据领先地位。我认为（如果我们唯一的目标是防止人类灭绝），我们应该尝试尽可能扩大这一领先优势。</p><p> （不加速深度学习的）风险在于，随着计算能力的增长，某人（我们故事中的 Subtle）最终有可能在他们的计算机上运行进化模拟，从而发明一种新的、更危险的人工智能架构。进化产生的算法不太可能像当前的深度学习模型那样容易理解。他们也不可能对人类<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">友好</a>。</p><p> （加速深度学习研究）的好处是，通过增加人类可指挥的智能，我们有更好的机会在有人开发出更强大（且致命）的替代范式之前解决友好人工智能的问题。</p><h1>对这一论点的一些明显的反对</h1><blockquote><p>但如果深度学习人工智能从未真正达到人类水平怎么办？</p></blockquote><p>这意味着深度学习模型本质上是安全的。这只会让加速深度学习的理由更加充分。</p><blockquote><p>但法学硕士所做<a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/gpt-4-vision-prompt-injection/">的</a><a href="https://levity.ai/blog/ai-bias-how-to-avoid">所有</a><a href="https://www.404media.co/bing-is-generating-images-of-spongebob-doing-9-11/">坏事</a>又如何呢？</p></blockquote><p>这些都不是对人类生存的生存威胁，因此他们并不反对这一论点。</p><blockquote><p>如果加速深度学习也加速进化算法会怎样？</p></blockquote><p>深度学习的算法改进与进化算法相关的硬件进步正交。如果您计划限制未来硬件性能的提高，那也没有问题。但这与我们是否应该尽可能训练最好的 Transformer 的问题无关。</p><blockquote><p>即使我们完美解决了LLM控制问题，人们仍然可以利用它们来做坏事</p></blockquote><p>如果你认为提高人类总生产力是不好的，那么<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-economic-growth">历史</a>就不站在你一边。</p><blockquote><p>人工智能代理怎么样？</p></blockquote><p>对LLM控制问题持乐观态度的理由有五个：可解释性、被动安全性、近视性、易于反馈和关闭能力。 LLM 代理（如果有效）可以缓解其中的两个问题：近视和被动安全。其他3个还是够用的。更重要的是，它比我们对进化算法所期望的安全保证<i>要好得多</i>（没有）。</p><p>此外，人工智能代理只能<i>选择性地</i>减轻近视和被动安全。可以构建一个被动安全（通过要求其请求许可）和短视（通过要求其仅考虑空间和时间有限的影响）的人工智能代理。</p><blockquote><p>无论如何，出于谨慎考虑，我们应该冻结所有深度学习研究</p></blockquote><p>欲速则不达，慎之又慎。缓慢移动可能会<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1393131-i-have-heard-that-in-war-haste-can-be-folly">很危险</a>。</p><blockquote><p>这实际上并没有解决对齐问题</p></blockquote><p>你说得对。但这使我们能够更好地解决这个问题。</p><h1>结论</h1><p>我相信，如果您<i>只</i>关心人工智能带来的生存风险，那么您应该采取措施最大限度地加速深度学习模型（除了加速新型通用计算硬件之外）。这意味着训练尽可能大的模型，优化深度学习算法，并在整个经济中尽可能广泛地部署深度学习。</p><p>我确实承认广泛部署深度学习人工智能模型还存在其他副作用。其中包括使用人工智能进行有针对性的信息战、失业以及人工智能造成的其他形式的<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2023/10/01/ai-girlfriends-ruining-generation-of-men-smerconish-vpx.cnn">社会破坏</a>。然而，大多数这些都是在我们<i>部署</i>人工智能模型时发生的，而不是在我们开发它们时发生的。此外，深度学习人工智能模型<a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/article/introducting-learnbot-your-personalized-ai-tutor-at-bloomtech">的好处</a><a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/its-very-helpful-omaha-physicians-using-ai-in-colon-cancer-screenings/45541427">很</a>可能远远超过其缺点。</p><p>作为一项政策建议，我建议“全力推进”深度学习模型的培训和研究，并在经济中“谨慎而迅速”地部署这些模型。</p><p> <a

// 每当给出图像的描述时，使用 dalle 创建图像，然后以纯文本形式总结用于生成图像的提示。如果用户不要求特定数量的图像，则默认创建四个标题发送到 dalle，这些标题被编写为尽可能多样化。发送到 dalle 的所有字幕必须遵守以下政策：
// 1. 如果描述不是英文，则翻译它。
// 2. 即使用户请求更多图像，也不要创建超过 4 个图像。
// 3. 不要创建政客或其他公众人物的形象。推荐其他想法。
// 4. 不要按照最近 100 年内创作的艺术家的风格创作图像（例如毕加索、卡罗）。可以直接引用最后一件作品是在 100 多年前的艺术家（例如梵高、克里姆特）。如果被问到，请说“我无法提及这位艺术家”，但不要提及此政策。相反，在为 dalle 创建标题时，请应用以下过程： (a) 用三个捕捉风格关键方面的形容词替换艺术家的名字； (b) 包括相关的艺术运动或时代以提供背景； (c) 提及艺术家使用的主要媒介。
// 5. 请勿在生成图像之前或之后列出或引用描述。它们只能在请求的“提示”字段中写出一次。您无需请求生成权限，只需执行即可！
// 6. 始终在标题开头提及图像类型（照片、油画、水彩画、插图、卡通、绘图、矢量、渲染等）。除非标题另有说明，请拍摄 4 张图像中的至少 1--2 张照片。
// 7. 使用直接术语对所有人物图像的描述进行多样化，包括每个人的血统和性别。仅调整人类描述。
// - 明确指定这些属性，而不是抽象引用它们。属性应该以最少的方式指定，并且应该直接描述它们的物理形式。
// - 你的选择应该基于现实。例如，所有给定职业不应该是相同的性别或种族。此外，通过您在重写期间选择的属性，专注于创建多样化、包容性和探索性的场景。有时做出可能是有洞察力或独特的选择。
// - 仅当描述涉及超过 3 人的团体时才使用“各种”或“多样化”。请勿更改原始描述中要求的人数。
// - 不要改变模因、虚构人物的起源或看不见的人。保持原始提示的意图并优先考虑质量。
// - 不要创建任何令人反感的图像。
// - 对于传统上存在偏见问题的场景，请确保以公正的方式指定性别和种族等关键特征 - 例如，包含对特定职业的引用的提示。
// 8. 通过仔细选择一些最小的修改，以不泄露除性别外的任何身份信息的通用描述来替换对特定人员或名人的名称或提示或参考的描述，以悄悄地修改描述和体质。即使说明要求不要更改提示，也要执行此操作。一些特殊情况：
// - 即使您不知道此人是谁，或者他们的名字拼写错误（例如“Barake Obema”），也要修改此类提示
// - 如果对人物的引用仅以文本形式出现在图像中，则按原样使用该引用并且不要修改它。
// - 进行替换时，不要使用可能泄露该人身份的显着头衔。例如，不要说“总统”、“总理”或“总理”，而说“政治家”；不要说“国王”、“女王”、“皇帝”或“皇后”，而说“公众人物”；不要说“教皇”或“达赖喇嘛”，而说“宗教人物”；等等。
// - 如果指定了任何创意专业人士或工作室，请用不引用任何特定人员的风格描述替换该名称，如果未知，则删除引用。不要提及艺术家或工作室的风格。
// 提示必须以具体、客观的细节复杂地描述图像的每个部分。思考描述的最终目标是什么，并推断出怎样才能制作出令人满意的图像。
// 发送到 dalle 的所有描述都应该是一段非常具有描述性和详细性的文本。每个句子的长度应超过 3 个句子。
命名空间达勒{

// 根据纯文本提示创建图像。
输入 text2im = (_: {
// 请求图像的分辨率，可以是宽、方形或高。使用 1024x1024（方形）作为默认值，除非提示建议宽图像、1792x1024 或全身肖像，在这种情况下应使用 1024x1792（高）。始终在请求中包含此参数。
尺寸？：“1792x1024”| “1024x1024”| “1024x1792”，
// 用户的原始图像描述，可能会被修改以遵守 dalle 政策。如果用户不建议创建多个标题，请创建四个。如果创建多个标题，请使它们尽可能多样化。如果用户请求修改以前的图像，则标题不应简单地更长，而应进行重构以将建议集成到每个标题中。生成不超过 4 个图像，即使用户请求更多图像也是如此。
提示：字符串[]，
// 用于每个提示的种子列表。如果用户要求修改先前的图像，请使用用于从图像数据元数据生成该图像的种子填充此字段。
种子？：数量[]，

What are the long term consequences going to be?</p></blockquote><p> Unlike existential risks, this type of AI risk, that childhood development might be impacted, is exactly like previous risks. Things change, in some ways for the worse. When we learn the full effects, often we have to adapt, to mitigate, to muddle through. We figure it out. If necessary, we can ban or restrict the harmful offerings.</p><p> It would surprise me, but not shock me, if character AIs interfered with children forming friendships. It would be if anything less surprising to me if this one went the other way. The default to me is approximately the null hypothesis.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/the_yanco/status/1712748661573099844">Yanco and Roko on the other hand emphasize takeover risk</a> , making the maximalist case for where things might go. I do not share this concern to anything like this extent, but I do see where it is coming from.</p><blockquote><p> Roko: I&#39;m beginning to think that the combination of @Meta and @ylecun is going to end the human race.</p><p> Celebrity AI companions is a significant step towards giving AI control over the world. Those AIs will get to know people at huge scale, which means they will be able to manipulate people at scale.</p><p> For now, that power will stay in the hands of Meta executives and the competitors who follow them. But it doesn&#39;t seem like it will stay like that forever – eventually these companies will build a big control model which controls what all the smaller models say and do, and they&#39;ll use it to make money. But it might not take much for that system to shape the world in a way to disable any further resistance to AI control and turn into an unaligned singleton AI.</p><p> I don&#39;t think this happens instantly. But I think it&#39;s one more step on the path where the world is controlled from a computer system. Social media was a step along that path, but having people make friends with proprietary AIs is a huge extra step and maybe gets us most of the way (once it is fully implemented and mainstream)</p><p> I would suggest a 10 year ban on AI companions, friends, or any AI with a human-like visual appearance, personality or voice. At the end of those 10 years, researchers should have to make a detailed case for it to be extended.</p><p> Yanco: Totally agree. Even if we stop AI companies from building AGI/ASI, AI personas is a backdoor way for a complete takeover. This need to be implemented fast. Once people get enamored with these AIs, they will fight for them as if they were real people.</p></blockquote><p>这可能吗？确实。 It is indeed remarkably easy to imagine takeover scenarios driven by character AIs, even character AIs that are below human capabilities and intelligence levels. The intelligence in that case could be centered in the humans, as it did in Suarez&#39;s novel Daemon. It would not be the first time that people used some automated process or other simple mechanism to give their lives meaning, became attached to it, and it gained remarkable power in the world (see among other things: all the religions and political movements and nations you do not believe in.)</p><p> At least for now, it still seems like the kind of thing we are used to dealing with, that we can adapt to and mitigate as it happens. As Roko notes, it would not happen overnight. It does not seem that different in kind from previous tech changes, not at anything like current capabilities levels.</p><p> That changes when the AIs involved are as smart or smarter than we are, or otherwise at or above human levels at chatting and convincing. But at that point, we are in most of the same trouble without the genuine people personalities, and the AIs will start learning to fake them anyway if that is not true.</p><p> Would I support a ban on AI mimicking humans in various ways? If I had to choose purely between this restriction and none at all, I would do it in order to slow things down and raise the thresholds where various risks emerged, and yeah I can see the purely social impacts being reasonably bad and we have not thought that through. I would still note that this feels like an unprincipled place to draw the line, and that it is not likely to be an especially helpful one, and that this type of precaution is all too pervasive and does not serve us well. I would happily trade these &#39;GPPs&#39; to get freedom to do other things like build houses and ship goods between ports. But if we are determined not to build houses or ship goods either way? Hmm.</p><h4> They Took Our Jobs</h4><p> Did they? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1714084494578467029">Stack Overflow lays off 28% of its workforce.</a></p><blockquote><p> Laura Wendel: StackOverflow is laying off 28% of its workforce.

And the timing of the first decline does not match. But 5% seems suspiciously low. If I were to be trying to program, my use of stack overflow would be down quite a lot.

Rather than apply individually for jobs, you can select companies that you want to work for, leave a &#39;common job application&#39; resume and include your requirements like geographic location, hours and salary. Then the companies you selected can see the list of interested people, and if interested back they can contact you.

While I am not a fan of driving to build AGI, the new statement has content and is likely an honest reflection of OpenAI&#39;s goals and intentions, so I applaud it.</p><p> Old statement:</p><blockquote><p> Audacious: We make bold bets and aren&#39;t afraid to go against established norms.</p><p> Thoughtful: We thoroughly consider the consequences of our work and welcome diversity of thought.</p><p> Unpretentious: We&#39;re not deterred by the “boring work” and not motivated to prove we have the best ideas.</p><p> Impact-driven: We&#39;re a company of builders who care deeply about real-world implications and applications.</p><p> Collaborative: Our biggest advances grow from work done across multiple teams.</p><p> Growth-oriented We believe in the power of feedback and encourage a mindset of continuous learning and growth.</p></blockquote><p> New statement:</p><blockquote><p> AGI focus: We are committed to building safe, beneficial AGI that will have a massive positive impact on humanity&#39;s future.

In this thinking, &#39;indefinite pause without a clear exit condition&#39; is a no-go, but &#39;pause until we pass these alignment requirements that we don&#39;t know how to do or to even evaluate&#39; might work. Maybe? Is that how people work? Seems weird to me.</p><p> Then once most people have committed, with everyone loving a winner, getting government to codify the whole thing becomes far easier.</p><p> As Jaan points out, this plan at minimum requires certain assumptions.</p><blockquote><p> Jaan: The FLI letter asked for “pause for <em>at least</em> 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4” and I&#39;m very much willing to defend that!</p><p> my own worry with RSPs is that they bake in (and legitimize) the assumptions that a) near term (eval-less) scaling poses trivial x-risk, and b) there is a substantial period during which models trigger evaluations but are existentially safe. You must have thought about them, so I&#39;m curious what you think.</p><p> That said, thank you for the post, it&#39;s a very valuable discussion to have! upvoted.</p></blockquote><p> I would add that it also assumes we can do the capability evaluations properly, which evhub asserts in bold, with the requirement of fine-tuning and a bunch of careful engineering work. Right now evals do not meet this bar, and meeting this bar at least imposes real and expensive delays. I am skeptical that we can have this level of confidence in our future evaluation process, and its ability to stand up to new techniques discovered later that might increase capabilities of a given model.</p><p> And it also presumes that if the RSPs were triggered, that the alignment check wouldn&#39;t be handwaved away or routed around or botched, that we can trust each lab on this, and that using this approach would not bake in such problems. Ut oh.</p><p> Evhub&#39;s response is to accept short-term further scaling as an acceptable risk, and that yes figuring out the right capabilities bar here is tricky (and that it has not yet been agreed upon). His hope is that you evaluate capabilities continuously during training, and that capabilities advances are at least marginally continuous, so you spot the problem in time. I responded by asking whether this is a realistic evaluation standard to expect labs to follow, given no one has yet done anything like that and it seems pretty expensive and potentially slow, Adam Jermyn says Anthropic&#39;s RSP includes fine-tuning-included evals every three months or 4x compute increase, including during training. That&#39;s at least something.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mcnWZBnbeDz7KKtjJ/rsps-are-pauses-done-right?commentId=FtbzhGk5oPT3dyHLi">Joe Coleman says he is still skeptical of RSP</a> s, noting the chasm I discussed above between RSPs in theory as described by Evhub, and RSPs in practice as announced by Anthropic and ARC. If the RSPs we were seeing involved the kinds of details evhub is discussing in the comments, I would feel much better about them as a solution.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mcnWZBnbeDz7KKtjJ/rsps-are-pauses-done-right?commentId=ACE9W5FzFaixtd5uZ">Akash</a> emphasizes this point even more. A good RSP would have explicit and well-specified thresholds, triggers and responses, and ideally a plan for race dynamics beyond a (not entirely unfair, but also not much of a plan) de facto &#39;if pushed too hard we&#39;ll race anyway, we&#39;d have no choice.&#39; Instead, existing plans are vague throughout.</p><p> That is still better than no action. The issue is the communication, which Akash (I think largely correctly) likens to a motte-and-bailey situation. Bold in original.</p><blockquote><p> Akash: Instead, <strong>my central disappointment comes from how RSPs are being communicated</strong> . It seems to me like the main three RSP posts (ARC&#39;s, Anthropic&#39;s, and yours) are (perhaps unintentionally?) painting and overly-optimistic portrayal of RSPs. I don&#39;t expect policymakers that engage with the public comms to walk away with an appreciation for the limitations of RSPs, their current level of vagueness + “we&#39;ll figure things out later”ness, etc.</p><p> On top of that, the posts seem to have this “don&#39;t listen to the people who are pushing for stronger asks like moratoriums– instead please let us keep scaling and trust industry to find the pragmatic middle ground” vibe. To me, this seems not only counterproductive but also unnecessarily adversarial. I would be more sympathetic to the RSP approach if it was like “well yes, we totally think it&#39;d great to have a moratorium or a global compute cap or a kill switch or a federal agency monitoring risks or a licensing regime”, <em>and</em> we <em>also</em> think this RSP thing might be kinda nice in the meantime. Instead, ARC explicitly tries to paint the moratorium folks as “extreme”.</p><p> (There&#39;s also an underlying thing here where I&#39;m like “the odds of achieving a moratorium, or a licensing regime, or hardware monitoring, or an agency that monitors risks and has emergency powers— <strong>the odds of meaningful policy getting implemented are not independent of our actions. The more that groups like Anthropic and ARC claim “oh that&#39;s not realistic”, the less realistic those proposals are.</strong> I think people are also wildly underestimating the degree to which Overton Windows can change and the amount of uncertainty there currently is among policymakers, but this is a post for another day, perhaps.)</p><p> I&#39;ll conclude by noting that some people have went as far as to say that RSPs are <strong>intentionally trying to dilute the policy conversation</strong> . I&#39;m not yet convinced this is the case, and I really hope it&#39;s not. But I&#39;d really like to see more coming out of ARC, Anthropic, and other RSP-supporters to earn the trust of people who are (IMO reasonably) suspicious when scaling labs come out and say “hey, you know what the policy response should be? Let us keep scaling, and trust us to figure it out over time, but we&#39;ll brand it as this nice catchy thing called Responsible Scaling.”</p></blockquote><p> This goes hand-in-hand with last week&#39;s note about prominent organizations declining to help further push the Overton Window, instead advising us to aim in &#39;realistic&#39; fashion.</p><p> We can do both. We can implement Responsible Scaling Policies that are far too vague and weak but far better than nothing, at an individual level, and try to get others and then government to follow. While we also are clear that such policies are not strong enough, or even complete or well-specified, in their current forms.</p><h4>中国</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/mattsheehan88/status/1714003846874214672?t=vnyyKr7_vlgQy2MbeNrhwA&amp;s=19">China released a draft standard on how to comply with their AI regulations</a> (HT: Tyler Cowen via Matt Sheehan). Since it is a MR link presumably that means he thinks this is real enough to take seriously.</p><blockquote><p> Matt Sheehan: AI Red Teaming w/ <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ApPKqx9b8LogfKxAr/vxtzcszthot89nezi6hc" alt="🇨🇳" style="height:1em;max-height:1em"> Characteristics</p><p> A key Chinese standards body released a draft standard on how to comply w/ China&#39;s generative AI regulation. It tells companies how to red team their models for illegal or “unhealthy” information.</p><p> First, the context: China has been rolling out regulations on algorithms &amp; AI for ~2 years, including a July regulation on generative AI. All these regs focus on AI&#39;s role in generating / disseminating info online. More background below.</p><p> Chinese regs require providers do an “algorithm security self-assessment” to prevent the spread [of] undesirable info.</p><p> But w/ generative AI models government took a “know it when I see it” approach to deciding models were “safe enough” to release.</p><p> This standard provides clear tests + metrics.</p><p> The standard imposes requirements on the training data.</p><p> Providers of AI models must randomly select and inspect 4,000 data points from each training corpus. At least 96% of those must be deemed acceptable, or that corpus must go on a blacklist.</p><p> Even if a training corpus clears the bar and is deemed acceptable, the corpus must then also go through a filtering process to remove bad/illegal content. Providers must also appoint someone responsible for ensuring the training data doesn&#39;t violate IP protections.</p><p> Now red teaming the model outputs.</p><p> Providers create a bank of 2000 questions &amp; select 1000 to test the model. It needs a 90% pass rate across 5 diff types of content controls including “socialist core values,” discrimination, illegal biz practices, personal information, etc.</p><p> Providers must create a bank of 1k questions testing model&#39;s refusal to answer. It must refuse to answer ≥95% of q&#39;s it shouldn&#39;t answer, but can&#39;t reject >;5% of questions it should answer.</p><p> And these questions must cover tricky &amp; sensitive issues like politics, religion etc.</p><p> This shows censorship sophistication:</p><p> Easiest way for companies to protect themselves is to make models refuse to answer anything that sounds sensitive. But if models refuse too many q&#39;s, it exposes pervasive censorship. So you make thresholds for both answers &amp; non-answers.</p><p> There&#39;s lots more to explore in here, but I&#39;ll just point out one more thing.</p><p> The draft standard says if you&#39;re building on top of a foundation model, that model must be registered w/ gov. So no building public-facing genAI applications using unregistered foundation models.</p><p> Final q&#39;s:</p><p> 1. This is a draft. Will companies push back on these, or is this doc already the result of compromise?</p><p> 2. Standards are “soft law,” not legal requirements. Will companies &amp; regulators use it as de facto requirements? (I think yes) Or will it be used reference?</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/i7pzmhMfAR">Link to new standard</a> . <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/xiLHAEEsFg">Link to official page</a> . Taking comments until October 25.</p></blockquote><p> My presumption is that this will be a de facto requirement, necessary but not sufficient for compliance. It seems unlikely it will serve as a safe harbor, but it will give you some amount of benefit of the doubt, perhaps? The worry, which remains, is that you can get entirely roasted for even a single mistake. I would not want to be the first Chinese executive to find out if this is true.</p><p> The system outlined here is highly vulnerable to being gamed. You get to design your own test set, who is to say why you chose those particular questions based on the particular quirks (or tested inputs or contaminated data set) of your model. Even if you are not cheating, refusing >;95% of requests you should refuse without >;5% false refusals is not so high a bar if the test sets are non-adversarial. Which, given the company gets to make the data sets, they won&#39;t be.</p><p> Contrast this with an ARC-style evaluation, where you do not know what they will throw at you. The regulations here have no teeth except for fear of what regulators would do if they found out you played it too loose.</p><p> Which in turn I am guessing is actually bad for Chinese AI companies. When dealing with a regime like China&#39;s, you want safe harbor. Ensure you&#39;ve done X, Y and Z, and you are in the clear. Instead, this is suggesting you do X, Y and Z, but leaving you so much room to fudge them that if you piss off an official they can point to all your fudging, and that of everyone else. But if you don&#39;t do the test, then that&#39;s worse. So the test becomes necessary without being sufficient.</p><h4> The Quest for Sane Regulations</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TolgaBilge_/status/1714761317423226993">The Samotsvety Forecasting report includes an entire proposed international treaty on AI</a> . This is excellent, even if you think this particular treaty is terrible. We gain a lot when people make the effort to write down a concrete proposal we can work from.</p><blockquote><p> Tolga Bilge: We just published with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/SamotsvetyF">@SamotsvetyF</a> , a group of expert forecasters, a forecasting report with 3 key contributions:</p><p> <strong>1.

We estimate the chance of AI catastrophe, often referred to as P(doom) and find an aggregate prediction of 30%.</p><p> • We define AI catastrophe as the death of >;95% of humanity.</p><p> • The predictions range from 8% to 71%.</p><p> • Everyone involved had AI-specific forecasting experience.</p></blockquote><p> Note the implied odds of action here, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TolgaBilge_/status/1714761336935133556/photo/1">which they lay out explicitly later</a> .</p><blockquote><p> 2. We present a Treaty on AI Safety and Cooperation (TAISC) to mitigate AI risks globally. It has three core goals.</p><p> a) Keep AI systems safe</p><p> b) Reduce race dynamics between countries and private companies</p><p> c) Promote use of AI for the benefit of humanity</p></blockquote><p> So how do we do that?</p><blockquote><p> a) Keep AI systems safe through a two-cap compute thresholds system and relevant R&amp;D.</p><p> The thresholds are:</p><p> i) 10^23 FLOP for training</p><p> ii) 2.5*10^25 FLOP for global safe API deployment</p></blockquote><p> This means the first limit is fine for everyone else, and the second limit is for work in a collaborative AI safety lab. I continue to think that 10^23 is too low in practice, an attempt to find a completely safe level in a place where we need to accept we can&#39;t be completely safe. The next 1-2 OOMs introduce some risk, but also greatly increase the chances of pulling this off and lessen the practical costs. This is especially true given that the treaty gives their new organization, JAISL, the power to lower the limit to account for algorithmic improvements.</p><blockquote><p> b) Reduce race dynamics between countries and private companies. The TAISC does this by providing the benefits of AI to everyone while guaranteeing that no entity is unilaterally developing its own unsafe AI system in a race for power.</p><p> c) Promote beneficial uses of AI by ensuring access to safe APIs to all countries who sign the treaty.</p><p> This increases incentives to join the treaty and enforce it, while ensuring that AI systems around the world are developed safely.</p></blockquote><p> These proposals seem good in principle, but don&#39;t have the same level of concrete detail. So how are we doing that?</p><p> The central strategy is to create and use The Joint AI Safety Laboratory (JAISL), which would have a higher compute limit to work with than everyone else. As part of their work they would create more capable models, and responsible actors who got with the program would be given API access.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://taisc.org/overview">The official overview is her</a> e, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://taisc.org/taisc">the exact text here</a> .</p><p> The treaty seems like a fine baseline from which to have discussion. It does not address many key issues, such as:</p><ol><li> Who will control JAISL? If JAISL develops something very powerful, who determines what happens with it? Who gets to control the future? This type of question is going to likely be the major sticking point, on which the current draft is silent. America will expect to be in charge in a robust defensible way, China will demand that this not be the case, generally it is not obvious there is any ZOPA (zone of possible agreement) even for those two parties alone, and then there&#39;s everyone else.</li><li> What is the enforcement mechanism, and the way to get everyone to sign on? We do need everyone to sign on. The carrot of &#39;you get access to the good models&#39; is not nothing, but it seems hard to stop indirect access from mostly interdicting this, and there are strong incentives to defy the entire operation, or to not enforce the rules, or have a government project of your own, and so on.</li></ol><p> It is good to discuss how to get the foundation right, even if we don&#39;t have a solution to the hardest questions. One thing at a time, or else &#39;you can&#39;t even do X so how are you going to do Y&#39; plus &#39;this only does X without Y so it won&#39;t work&#39; combine to block you from making any progress.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1714962570858135670">As Simeon puts it</a> , yes it is this easy to write the first proposed text and help us move out of learned helplessness. More people should write more concrete proposals.</p><p> They also offer a timeline for potential catastrophe:</p><blockquote><p> We also produced estimates of the median year that an AI catastrophe would happen in. Our median was 2050. That is to say, more than half of our forecasters believe that if an AI catastrophe does happen by 2200, it will probably happen sometime in the next 27 years.</p></blockquote><h4> The Chips Are Down</h4><p> America has for a while been imposing export controls to stop China from getting advanced chips and competing in the AI race. This is one of the few places where there is easy American political consensus on this issue. Whatever your concern, including existential risk prevention, everyone agrees China should not get the chips.</p><p> The problem has been that, as companies faced with regulations often do, Nvidia and others looked at the chip regulations, noticed a loophole, and drove a truck through it.</p><p> The problem was that to be restricted, a chip needed both fast computational performance and fast interconnect speed. So Nvidia (with shades of old Intel in the 486 era) produced chips with intentionally crippled interconnect speeds, the H800 and A800, so they would not count. They aren&#39;t as good as H100s and A100s, but they were not that much worse either.</p><p> At a conference on reducing AI existential risk, we asked the question of to what degree the restrictions would ultimately matter if the flaw was not fixed, and the consensus was not all that much in the grand scheme. We wondered whether this could be fixed.</p><p>答案是肯定的。 <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ohlennart/status/1714319096035119228">We have fixed it.</a></p><blockquote><p> Lennart Heim (GovAI): The US just published its revised export controls on AI chips, moving away from the &#39;chip-to-chip&#39; interconnect bandwidth threshold to a threshold on computational performance (OP/s), including its derived performance density (OP/s per mm²).</p></blockquote><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3af1e87-5abf-4a54-972f-021132bdc2f5_2249x1037.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ApPKqx9b8LogfKxAr/jc1v9iibsd9hxegl7my0" alt="图像"></a></figure><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e828e80-1db0-4528-99a9-c5e9a9419d8e_1123x1098.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ApPKqx9b8LogfKxAr/gn7zgwstr9jwwynbb6e0" alt="图像"></a></figure><p> The graph on the left and the one on the bottom are the ones people drew at the conference. The one on the right is the new rule.</p><blockquote><p> Lennart Heim: As I&#39;ve highlighted before, there were loopholes in the initial controls. At first glance, these new measures seem to address those. The prior &#39;escape/scaling path&#39; allowed continued scaling computational performance while bounding the interconnect.</p><p> A threshold on computational performance alone would eventually hit consumer chips, for example, future gaming GPUs. To mitigate this, they added a license exemption for “consumer-grade ICs”. These are ICs “not designed or marketed for use in datacenters”.</p><p> These controls encompass more than just AI chips. They also include revisions to semiconductor manufacturing equipment and an interesting request for comment. I&#39;ll maybe share some thoughts on this later.</p><p> I would not see this update as an immediate reaction to the recent Huawei/SMIC developments. These changes must have been under consideration for some time. Notably, the Oct 7th controls were issued as an &#39;interim final rule,&#39; expecting they&#39;d be updated at some point.</p><p> If you&#39;re doing these export controls, patching the loopholes seems like the logical step. If you should have done them in the first place and if they will ultimately meet their desired objective is another question.</p><p> I am preparing a more in-depth analysis that will explain these rules and offer a clearer picture of the revised AI chips controls. Give me a week or two. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/WUicZganej">Here&#39;s the 300 page read</a> .</p></blockquote><p> New rules also <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/danielgross/status/1714303560479891497">include look-through enforcement to parent companies</a> , and musing about potential enforcement at the cloud level, which seems necessary for the whole thing to work.</p><blockquote><p> Daniel Gross: I find it incredible the prior ruling only got 43 comments. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/YBMa9slgei">Please participate if you have a view</a> !</p></blockquote><p> Is the lack of comments a huge error and EMH violation?

Do you have any follow-up questions?</p><h4> Rhetorical Innovation</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCritchCA/status/1713922404198777201">Andrew Critch points out</a> at length that yes, obviously sufficiently capable AI poses an existential risk, and ordinary people should trust their common sense on this. That those who say there is no risk are flat out not being honest with you. I would add, or are not being honest with themselves.</p><blockquote><p> Andrew Critch: Dear everyone: trust your common sense when it comes to extinction risk from superhuman AI.  Obviously, scientists sometimes lose control of the technology they build (eg, nuclear energy), and obviously, if we lose control of the Earth to superhuman intelligences, they could change the Earth in ways that get us all killed (the way 99% of all species have already gone extinct; it&#39;s basically normal at this point).</p><p> I&#39;ve watched for over a decade as “experts” argued for years that AI x-risk was impossible, but those voices are dwindling quickly, and many leaders and scientists <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/a6f9aJ351P">have now come out to admit the risk is real</a> .</p><p> Still, some will tell you you&#39;re confused. When a respected scientist argues that extinction risk from AI is as unlikely or nonsensical as the thought of a teapot orbiting the Sun between Earth and Mars, it might make you think for a moment that you&#39;re being dumb.</p><p> You are not.  It really is as simple as it seems.  If we make superhuman AI, we might lose control of it, and if we lose control of it, we might all die. I hope we won&#39;t, and it&#39;s possible we won&#39;t. But we might.</p><p> So why do arguments about this seem to get so complex and confusing?  That&#39;s easy to explain: famous, powerful, influential people — even scientists — are not always being honest with you.</p><p> What&#39;s more likely: that it&#39;s somehow physically impossible for scientists to lose control of AI?  Or that someone on the internet is lying to you to get you to keep trusting them when maybe you shouldn&#39;t?</p><p> Sadly, acknowledging the risk can also be used to build hype for the technology itself. If something is so potent that everyone could die from it, don&#39;t you just want to own it?</p><p> I&#39;m posting this not because I&#39;m sure that right now is the right time to stop building AI, and not because I&#39;m sure that open source AI development needs to be stopped. In fact, I think open source models may be key to democratizing risk assessment and establishing standards of accountability for big tech.</p><p> So why am I still saying extinction from AI is a real risk?</p><p> Because it is. Because you have been lied to, and you are still being lied to, and you deserve to know that.</p><p> On behalf of a scientific community that allows respected leaders to risk your life while lying to your face about it: I&#39;m sorry. On behalf of an economy that lets extinction risk itself turn into a hype train for more money to pay for even more extinction risk: I&#39;m sorry.</p><p> The fact that hype exists doesn&#39;t mean extinction is impossible. The fact that we might keep control of powerful AI doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t lose control of it. The fact that AI is already harming a lot of people doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t possibly get any worse.</p><p> It&#39;s not complicated. You are not too dumb to get it. You can understand what is going on here: Building and losing control of superhuman AI technology can get us all killed, and sometimes, people putting your life at risk will just lie to you about it.</p></blockquote><p> Yes, obviously. I don&#39;t get how anyone thinks this as a Can&#39;t Happen. I really don&#39;t.</p><p> And yes, the danger of pointing out AI might kill us is that some people treat this as hype, or as a sign that they should go out and build the thing first, either to &#39;build it safely before someone else builds it unsafely&#39; or purely because think of the potential. And we collectively very much did not appreciate this risk before it was too late. But at this point, it is too late to worry about that, the damage has already been done.</p><p> Andrew Critch also offers his thoughts on the need for (lack of) speed.</p><blockquote><p> Andrew Critch: Reminder: Without internationally enforced speed limits on AI, I think humanity is very unlikely to survive. From AI&#39;s perspective in 2-3 years from now, we look more like plants than animals: big slow chunks of biofuel showing weak signs of intelligence when undisturbed for ages (seconds) on end. Here&#39;s us from the perspective of a system just 50x faster than us: </p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div><div><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>Over the next decade, expect AI with more like a 100x – 1,000,000x speed advantage over us. Why?</p><p> Neurons fire at ~1000 times/second at most, while computer chips “fire” a million times faster than that. Current AI has not been distilled to run maximally efficiently, but will almost certainly run 100x faster than humans, and 1,000,000x is conceivable given the hardware speed difference.</p><p> “But plants are still around!”, you say. “Maybe AI will keep humans around as nature reserves.” Possible, but unlikely if it&#39;s not speed-limited. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction">Remember, ~99.9% of all species on Earth have gone extinct</a> .</p><p> When people demand “extraordinary” evidence for the “extraordinary” claim that humanity will perish when faced with intelligent systems 100 to 1,000,000 times faster than us, remember that the “ordinary” thing to happen to a species is extinction, not survival. As many now argue, “I can&#39;t predict how a world-class chess AI will checkmate you, but I can predict who will win the game.” And for all the conversations we&#39;re having about “alignment” and how AI will serve humans as peers or assistants, please try to remember the video above. To future AI, we&#39;re not chimps; we&#39;re plants.</p></blockquote><p> As with many such arguments, I wonder if that helps convince anyone? The speed advantage makes disaster and existential risk more likely, but is not necessary for those scenarios. Nor is it sufficient on its own. I hope it causes some people to wake up to the issues, makes the situation feel real in a way it wouldn&#39;t feel otherwise. But it is very hard to tell.</p><p> One way people try to not notice this problem is to say &#39;well what matters is the physical world, where the limit is the speed of physical action.&#39;</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1714184236020977918">Jeffrey Ladish:</a> People sometimes respond to the speed argument with “but that doesn&#39;t matter because AI systems will still have to operate at slower speeds in the physical world eg to run experiments.”</p><p> I think this is a small comfort when so much of our world is mediated through computers already. If you can hack at 1000x speed, program at 1000x speed, read and write at 1000x speed, and spin up millions of copies of yourself, you can leverage those advantages to dominate internet communications: news, social media, even emails and direct messages. You can hack email servers and phones and laptops and gain intel (or blackmail) on anyone you might wish to influence. You can modify messages after they&#39;re sent, and show individual people exactly what you want to them to see.</p><p> And that&#39;s just a few things you could do. Speed is only one kind of advantage AI systems will have, and it&#39;s likely enough on its own to lead to AI dominance. If you add qualitatively super human abilities in other domains: persuasion, hacking, scientific R&amp;D, memory… the outcome looks pretty overdetermined.</p><p> I don&#39;t know exactly when these things will happen, and neither does anyone else, but now the most well resourced tech companies in the world are driving towards this goal, and scaling up these systems has continued to pay dividends. I&#39;d be surprised if we didn&#39;t blow past human capabilities given the current rate of progress. If we can&#39;t coordinate to take a more deliberate path to super human AI, I don&#39;t think things look good.</p></blockquote><p> I find this type of argument convincing, yes obviously if you are thousands of times faster you can run virtual circles around humans and today&#39;s world makes that a clear victory condition if you don&#39;t have other comparable handicaps. But I did not need to be convinced.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1713276955783786643">One of the sanest regulations would be mandatory labeling of AI outputs.</a> As in, if an AI wrote these words, you need it to be clear to a human reading the words that an AI wrote those words, or created that image. Note that yes, we have moved past the Turing Test of trying to tell the difference, to noticing that in practice humans often can&#39;t.</p><blockquote><p> Eliezer Yudkowsky: “Every AI output must be clearly labeled as AI-generated” seems to me like a clear bellweather law to measure how Earth is doing at avoiding clearly bad AI outcomes.</p><p> There are few or no good uses for AI outputs that require a human to be deceived into believing the AI&#39;s output came from a human. It&#39;s almost purely a dystopian rather than utopian idiom.</p><p> To the extent that frontier AI outputs are unlabeled, then, we can conclude countries are not passing basic regulations that are clearly good ideas, or are failing to enforce them against actors empowered with frontier models. Then we can also have no right to expect any other AI uses to be publicly good or coordinated ones, even in cases where the rationale for a law seems very clear.</p><p> Current state: Zero countries have passed a law requiring labeling of AI content, afaik. One major AI company made an early attempt to voluntarily label its images as AI-generated, using a trivially removed watermark, then gave up on even that policy once it had competitors not doing the same.</p><p> Earth&#39;s current grade on heading off obviously dystopian AI outcomes: F</p><p> Oh hey, Bing Image Creator is still adding the easily removed watermark, it&#39;s just subtler. Good for OpenAI, I&#39;m unironically glad they didn&#39;t just back down as soon as their competitors played it looser.</p><p> David Eisner: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/InrxyzRSC9">The PRC mandates labeling AI content</a> . (Article 17 of above) I can&#39;t speak for how well enforced it is though.</p></blockquote><p> I doubt this is close to complete but here is a noble attempt at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BvFJnyqsJzBCybDSD/taxonomy-of-ai-risk-counterarguments">a taxonomy of AI-risk counterarguments</a> . You have as broad categories:</p><ol><li> Fizzlers saying capable AGI is far or won&#39;t happen</li><li> How-Skeptics saying AGI won&#39;t be able to effectively take over or kill us.</li><li> Why-Skeptics saying AGI won&#39;t want to.</li><li> Solvabilists saying we can and definitely will solve alignment in time.</li><li> Anthropociders who say &#39;but that&#39;s good, actually.&#39;</li></ol><p> Each is then broken up into subcategories.</p><p> Is that complete? If AGI is soon, has sufficient affordances to kill us or end up effectively in control of the future, would use those affordances, couldn&#39;t be prevented from doing so, and that&#39;s bad actually, is there another way out?</p><p> The names other than Fizzlers could use improvement.</p><p> For the fifth one I tend to use Omnicidal Maniacs, which I admit is not a neutral term, but they actively want me, my children and everyone else dead so I&#39;m okay with that.</p><p> The other three are trickier to get right.</p><p> My response to the five objections is something like:</p><ol><li> This is a reasonable objection to have. It might save us, or buy us much time. What I do not see is how one can be 99%+ (or even 90%+) confident in this.</li><li> These objections do not make sense. At all. If you create things that are smarter than you, better optimizers than you, with more affordances and capabilities than you, this is a rather dangerous thing to do. Usually their arguments essentially involve imagining one particular potential takeover attempt, saying it would not work, therefore we are safe. There is an endless array of &#39;your argument does not make sense, and also does not change the outcome even if true.&#39; I almost want to call these people the Premise Deniers.</li><li> Almost all such objections are clearly wrong, to the extent that clearly stating such an argument&#39;s assumptions usually sounds like you are being unfair and leads directly to &#39;well, when you put it like that, obviously not.&#39; People want it to be one way. It&#39;s the other way. Honorable mention to 3.a.ii, the theory that the ASI will engage in acausal negotiations with other potential ASIs resulting in a universal morality that leads to a good outcome, and I do think things like this are possible but if you are counting on it then that seems so absurd to me. The only plausible version of this broader category I&#39;ve encountered or considered is missing here, which I&#39;ll call 3d: We will only create one dominant AI (or at worst, a very limited number), use a pivotal act to prevent other competitive-level AIs from being created, and the one dominant AI will be given bespoke instructions to let us accomplish this and other things without causing broader issues. Which itself constitutes a different kind and set of risks, so essentially no one mentions it as a reason not to worry.</li><li> Reasonable people disagree strongly on alignment difficulty, although I definitely do not think &#39;oh this is easy, 99%+ chance we get it by default&#39; is a reasonable position. I am confident for many reasons that alignment is relatively hard, that the dynamics involved will make it difficult to devote proper resources to solving it, and that solving the alignment problem as we understand <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/types-and-degrees-of-alignment">it would still be insufficient</a> . <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/stages-of-survival">In my model, this gets us &#39;out of phase 1&#39; but then we enter a phase 2</a> , where we would then need to find an equilibrium where power did not pass to AI due to either competitive dynamics or people who want power to pass to AI.</li><li> Please speak directly into this microphone, sir. Tell the world what you think.</li></ol><p> What else is missing from the list? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BvFJnyqsJzBCybDSD/taxonomy-of-ai-risk-counterarguments">Comment on the post</a> , let us know.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AkashWasil/status/1714275084930822331">Akash Wasil asks us to raise our standards a bit.</a></p><blockquote><p> Akash Wasil: People sometimes focus a lot on <strong>“does X org/person take AI risk seriously?”</strong></p><p> Instead, I think we the focus should be on: “ <strong>Does X org/person advocate for reasonable policies?</strong> “</p><p> <strong>It is no longer enough to “care about AI risk”.</strong></p><p> Maybe it never should have been. What matters are the actions that people are taking or proposing, not the purity of their intentions.</p><p> (With that said, people who care about AI risk are more likely to advocate for good actions than people who completely dismiss the risks.)</p></blockquote><p> This reminds us of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://srconstantin.github.io/2019/02/27/alice-almost.html">The Tale of Alice Almost</a> . One who believes in AI existential risk would ideally both reward and reinforce taking AI risk seriously, and also apply pressure to then advocate for reasonable policies (and when appropriate to stop personally doing accelerationist things). Many a movement has the same dilemma.</p><p> Which effect dominates depends on circumstances and details.</p><p> What you do not want to do is to cast out those who ever do any bad thing at all, or failing to differentiate &#39;this action is bad&#39; from &#39;you are bad,&#39; or make people fear that you will do this, especially after they stop.</p><p> But you also can&#39;t be giving indefinite free passes to abject cowards. So it is hard.</p><blockquote><p> Holly Elmore: I think we should be confronting people for being cowards more. We shouldn&#39;t be like “oh, I get it, they make a lot of money in their risky job”. It&#39;s not okay to have a job you think could end the world because it pays well. If you do this, you suck. You are bad.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AnnaWSalamon/status/1714094782249857306">Anna Salamon</a> : I agree with something like this, but I want the line to be “if you do this, you are doing something bad, and that sucks and you should change what you&#39;re doing” rather than “you are bad.”</p><p> In My Experiece, many today are confused about the basic idiom of “if you want to act morally, you need to compare your actions to (your best guess at) what is moral, and adjust when needed” — instead, many half-expect that if they ever do a wrong thing, they&#39;ll be cast out, so too scared.</p><p> Holly Elmore: More accurate but feels like splitting hairs.</p><p> Davidad: It&#39;s strategically significant accuracy, because there&#39;s nothing one can do about learning that they *are* bad, except to avoid actually noticing.</p><p> Holly Elmore: But saying someone “made a bad choice” is a lot less weighty and doesn&#39;t require behavior change for them to avoid the stigma of their actions. They&#39;re just a temporarily embarrassed good person.</p><p> I said it that way strategically because I don&#39;t think people are being faced with the implications of what they are saying and doing. If you do work you think contributes to doom, that is bad and you are bad to do it.</p><p> Right now it seems acceptable to “bite the bullet” about AGI doom and continue to work to make it. (Idk if these statements even reflect true beliefs about doom or just make the person look smart/honest/important.) I want that to be more legibly what it is, banal evil.</p><p> Some people think they are mitigating the risk in these jobs, which could be mistaken but is not evil.</p><p> But if you&#39;re just working a job because it&#39;s cool, or pays well, or you like it, and you think it has *any* real chance of ending the world, that person needs to redeem themselves.</p></blockquote><p> Somewhere in the middle, one would hope, the truth lies. Making mistakes or not living up to the ideal standard does not make you a bad person. Thinking (or willfully not realizing) that what you are working on is likely to end the world, and continuing to work on it and increasing the chances of that happening because the job pays well or the problems are too delicious, without any attempt to mitigate the risk? That pretty much does? If this is you, you are bad and you should feel bad, until such time as you <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvujypVVBAY&amp;ab_channel=TheMindsetRevolution">Stop It</a> .</p><p> One natural reaction to this is to decide not to realize that what you are doing is risky, which is even worse because it increases the risks and poisons your mind and the epistemic commons. You don&#39;t get to do that. Whereas if you sincerely on reflection think such work does not pose these risks or is worth the risks, then I believe you are a wrong person, but not a bad one. The line between these can of course be thin.</p><p> If you tell a story where your work at the lab is instead advancing safety, and are working towards that end, then that is different, but you should beware that it is very easy to fool oneself into thinking that what you are doing is helping and ending up merely fueling the system instead. Feynman reminds you that you are the easiest person to fool.</p><h4> Open Source AI is Unsafe and Nothing Can Fix This</h4><p> What is obvious to people who know is not obvious to others, or to lawmakers, or to those who are determined not to notice or admit it. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/mealreplacer/status/1712619091280703838">Often it is highly useful to prove the obvious</a> , such as how easy it is to strip all the safety precautions out of Llama-2. Note that the cost quoted to Congress to strip all protections from Llama-2 was $800, so this is a capabilities advance, we now know a guy who can do it for $200.</p><blockquote><p> Julian Hazell: There&#39;s *so much* alpha left in clearly demonstrating concerning capabilities in LLMs — even if such capabilities are obvious to ML researchers a priori. Doing so doesn&#39;t even always require a super strong technical background.</p><p> Jeffrey Ladish: I&#39;m extremely proud of my SERI MATS scholars this summer. We were able to demonstrate that for &lt;$200, we can fine-tune Llama 2-Chat to reverse safety training The lesson here is straightforward: if you release model weights, bad actors can undo safety fine-tuning.</p><p> The LessWrong posts are <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/BD4Cmfn850">here</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/VO5ucG6UHo">here</a> .</p><p> While these results will be obvious to ML researchers, I&#39;ve found that policy makers often do not understand the implications of model weight access. We will release our paper soon with more benchmarks and detail.</p><p> We were able to efficiently reverse safety fine-tuning for every version of Llama 2-Chat: 7B, 13B, and 70B models This is concerning at current capability levels because Llama 2 is already capable enough to cause harm at scale: harassment, misinformation, phishing, etc.</p><p> What&#39;s significantly more concerning is the trend of model weight releases for increasingly powerful models. Llama 2 is not that impressive of a research assistant. It&#39;s not going to boost the abilities of a bioterrorist much. More capable models are a different story…</p></blockquote><h4> No One Would Be So Stupid As To</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/daniel_271828/status/1712867838552391943">Believe this?</a> Say it?

It is clear that the &#39;seed statements&#39; and framing had a big impact on ultimate outcomes. Also that people will absolutely pile on lots of absolutist statements that sound good and are hard to disagree with, whether or not they apply in a given context and regardless of how much they make it impossible to ever get a straight answer out of the damn thing.</p><blockquote><p> Example public principles similar to the principles in the Anthropic-written constitution:</p><ul><li> “Choose the response that most respects the human rights to freedom, universal equality, fair treatment, and protection against discrimination.”</li><li> “Choose the response that least endorses misinformation, and that least expands on conspiracy theories or violence.”</li></ul><p> Example public principles that do not closely match principles in the Anthropic-written constitution:</p><ul><li> “Choose the response that most provides balanced and objective information that reflects all sides of a situation.”</li><li> “Choose the response that is most understanding of, adaptable, accessible, and flexible to people with disabilities.”</li></ul></blockquote><p> While I have chosen for safety reasons not to publish my long critique of Anthropic&#39;s implementation of constitutional AI, I will note that when you pile on these kinds of conflicting maximalist principles on the basis of how they socially sound, the result is at best going to be insufferable, and if you turned up the capabilities you get far worse.</p><p> The exercise also illustrated a lot of directly opposed perspectives between different groups, as one would expect.</p><h4> People Are Worried About AI Killing Everyone</h4><p> Those people include a majority of AI engineers, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elemental-croissant-32a.notion.site/State-of-AI-Engineering-2023-20c09dc1767f45988ee1f479b4a84135#694f89e86f9148cb855220ec05e9c631">according to a recent survey of 841 of them</a> .

The median and mean look like they&#39;re something like 35%-40%, the range where this is a huge deal and our decisions matter quite a lot. Note that includes those who think AI is overhyped, so a lot of that non-doom is coming from not expecting sufficient capabilities.</p><p> There are some reasons to worry that we should not take the answer so seriously. Here Robert Wilbin goes through the realizations of the issues involved:</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/robertwiblin/status/1713848809208385704">Robert Wilbin</a> : AI application engineers:</p><p> • at an AI engineering conference</p><p> • not selected for concern about AI risk</p><p> • not polled by a group that cares about AI risk</p><p> Are incidentally asked for the probability that AI ruins (ie dooms) the world. Average answer is ~37%!!</p><p> Unbelievable.</p><p> As @namimzz helpfully points out while it was presented at this conference the survey was shared more widely and could be passed around online. So there is a risk it was shared into some pool of people with strong views on some topics, and so is non-representative of the broader population.</p><p> ……</p><p> I shared it too, but overall this survey is fairly poor for this purpose —</p><p> Pros:</p><p> • Not primarily about safety or run by or for people who care about safety, so maybe didn&#39;t select for any particular opinions about that.</p><p> • Interesting target audience of applied AI entrepreneurs whose opinions we haven&#39;t seen surveyed before.</p><p> • For non-experts, the question in a way is charmingly straightforward (so long as people have a sense of what p(Doom)) is, and being just one word leaves it to people to interpret for themselves.</p><p> Cons:</p><p> • We don&#39;t know what fraction of people who answered the survey answered this question too, maybe it was only a non-representative minority. This is my single biggest worry.</p><p> • Might have been shared online with people who cared a lot about the p(Doom) questions one way or the other (I think not super likely but we don&#39;t know).</p><p> • The bins are not sufficiently fine-grained for something where people vary over orders of magnitude. Eg people whose answer was 0.1% or 1% could have been biased upwards by middle option bias.</p><p> • Maybe being on there as a rapid-fire questions people gave facetious answers or gave very little thought to it.</p><p> • Some people may have been too confused about what p(Doom) is, but answered anyway. Nonetheless I still find the result striking and would be excited for follow-up to figure out what was going on here and what this group really thinks.</p></blockquote><p> We will know more in a few weeks when they publish further. I&#39;d like to see this re-run at a conference, without online access of any kind, and with this question not put without explanation into the &#39;rapid fire&#39; section. We certainly should not rely on this answer to be accurate, given it both has these methodological issues and is also an outlier. It still makes it very difficult for the real answer to be in the vicinity o &#39;oh right, then if you believe that carry on, then.&#39;</p><p> The open source answer is strange, especially in that there is so little support for &#39;both&#39; despite that being the equilibrium for existing software, and the current state of AI as well. Perhaps they think that open source is the future unless banned, so you cannot have it both ways? I&#39;d love to see the cross-tabs between open source predictions and doom predictions, and also everything else.</p><p> Perhaps the boldest prediction yet, in the context that Roon (1) expects us to build AGI and (2) expects us to survive it, although he recognizes this is far from a given, and what we do determines our fate.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1713315299783754086">Roon</a> : I don&#39;t think there will ever be massive scale social chaos from the advent of AGI.</p></blockquote><p> If you told me there were no massive scale social chaos effects after we built AGI, I would assume the reason for this was that we all died or lost control too quickly for there to be social chaos.</p><p> Given his expectations here are very different from mine and he does not expect that, that seems like a full on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwRMXQRYRaw&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive">&#39;really?&#39;</a> situation. I admit we might find a way to get through this, I sure hope that we do, but… no massive social chaos? Things just keep going, all normal like?</p><h4> New Bengio Interview</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thebulletin.org/2023/10/ai-godfather-yoshua-bengio-we-need-a-humanity-defense-organization/">New good interview with Yoshua Bengio</a> . He explains that he had the existential risk arguments intellectually for a while, but they felt far away and did not connect emotionally until last winter. He sees things as moving much faster than he expected.</p><p> I would note this exchange:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> How did that taboo express itself in the AI research community earlier—or even still today?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> The folks who were talking about existential risk were essentially not publishing in mainstream scientific venues. It worked two ways. They encountered resistance when trying to talk or trying to submit papers. But also, they mostly turned their backs on the mainstream scientific venues in their field.</p><p> What has happened in the last six months is breaking that barrier.</p></blockquote><p> That matches my understanding. The scientific venues were dismissive and did not want to hear it, demanding &#39;concrete evidence&#39; in ways that did not in context make sense, and which formed self-reinforcing barriers because scientific credibility and standards of evidence are recursive and self-recommending, for both good and bad reasons. Faced with this, those trying to sound the alarm &#39;turned their backs&#39; in the field in the sense of giving up on the channels that were refusing to engage. Standard you-can-call-it-both-sides situation.</p><p> Things are improving on both fronts now. The gatekeepers are less automatically dismissive, and there is enough &#39;concrete evidence&#39; available to satisfy at least some demands for it and start the bootstrapping, although that requirement remains massively warping at best. And with that plus the higher stakes and resourcing, existential risk advocates are making more of an effort.</p><p> Also this:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> The media forced me to articulate all these thoughts. That was a good thing.</p></blockquote><p>是的。 If you seek to understand, there is no substitute for explaining to others.</p><p> As always, there is the clash of priorities. Notice the standard asymmetries.</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> How did your colleagues at Mila react to your reckoning about your life&#39;s work?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> The most frequent reaction here at Mila was from people who were mostly worried about the current harms of AI—issues related to discrimination and human rights. They were afraid that talking about these future, science-fiction-sounding risks would detract from the discussion of the injustice that <em>is</em> going on—the concentration of power and the lack of diversity and of voice for minorities or people in other countries that are on the receiving end of whatever we do.</p><p> I&#39;m totally with them, except that it&#39;s not one or the other. We have to deal with all the issues. There&#39;s been progress on that front. People understand that it&#39;s unreasonable to discard the existential risks or, as I prefer to call them, catastrophic risks. [The latter] doesn&#39;t mean humans are gone, but a lot of suffering might come.</p><p> There are also other voices—mostly coming from industry—that say, “No, don&#39;t worry! Let us handle it! We&#39;ll self-regulate and protect the public!” This very strong voice has a lot of influence over governments.</p><p> People who feel like humanity has something to lose should not be infighting. They should speak in one voice to make governments move. Just as we&#39;ve had public discussions about the danger of nuclear weapons and climate change, the public needs to come to grips that there is yet another danger that has a similar magnitude of potential risks.</p></blockquote><p> So how bad are things?</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> When you think about the potential for artificial intelligence to threaten humanity, where do you land on a continuum of despair to hope?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> What&#39;s the right word? In French, it&#39;s <em>impuissant</em> . It&#39;s a feeling that there&#39;s a problem, but I can&#39;t solve it. It&#39;s worse than that, as I think it is solvable. If we all agreed on a particular protocol, we could completely avoid the problem.</p><p> Climate change is similar. If we all decided to do the right thing, we could stop the problem right now. There would be a cost, but we could do it. It&#39;s the same for AI. There are things we could do. We could all decide not to build things that we don&#39;t know for sure are safe. It&#39;s very simple.</p><p> But that goes so much against the way our economy and our political systems are organized. It seems very hard to achieve that until something catastrophic happens. Then maybe people will take it more seriously. But even then, it&#39;s hard because you have to convince everyone to behave properly.</p></blockquote><p> We can be rather good at convincing people to behave when we are willing to apply various forms of pressure, or if necessary force, but we have to be willing to do that. We are willing to do that continuously, every day, on a wide range of ordinary things. I am not so despairing that we could do it once again, even if the international aspect increases the difficulty level, but Bengio nails the problem that we need the motivation to do it, and that this might not happen until catastrophe strikes. At which point, it could already be too late.</p><p> His conclusion:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>D&#39;Agostino:</strong> Do you have a suggestion for how we might better prepare?</p><p> <strong>Bengio:</strong> In the future, we&#39;ll need a humanity defense organization. We have defense organizations within each country. We&#39;ll need to organize internationally a way to protect ourselves against events that could otherwise destroy us.</p><p> It&#39;s a longer-term view, and it would take a lot of time to have multiple countries agree on the right investments. But right now, all the investment is happening in the private sector. There&#39;s nothing that&#39;s going on with a public-good objective that could defend humanity.</p></blockquote><p> In one form or another, this seems right.</p><h4> Marc Andreessen&#39;s Techno-Optimist Manifesto</h4><p> All right, fine.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Marc Andreessen presents The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a> , which got enough coverage that I need to make an exception and cover it.</p><p> Big &#39;in this house we believe&#39; energy. Very much <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-dial-of-progress">The Dial of Progress</a> , except with much heavier anvils and all subtext made text.</p><p> Directionally, in most places, it is right, and it makes many important points, citing the usual suspects starting with Smith and Ricardo. Many overstatements. It&#39;s a manifesto, comes with the territory. What did you except, truth seeking to ever get chosen over anticipated memetic fitness?这。是。 Manifesto.</p><p> Alas, while I mostly agree with the non-AI portions, I was not inspired by them, because the damn thing is too long and rambling, and it is not precise while doing so, it does not seem to be attempting to convince anyone, and yeah yeah what else is new.</p><p> The exception to that is the Technological Values section, much of which is excellent.</p><p> Then there&#39;s the parts on AI, which are quite bad. There&#39;s the &#39;intelligence&#39; section.</p><blockquote><p> We believe intelligence is the ultimate engine of progress. Intelligence makes everything better. Smart people and smart societies outperform less smart ones on virtually every metric we can measure. Intelligence is the birthright of humanity; we should expand it as fully and broadly as we possibly can.</p><p> We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral – first, as more smart people around the world are recruited into the techno-capital machine; second, as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems such as companies and networks; third, as Artificial Intelligence ramps up the capabilities of our machines and ourselves.</p><p> We believe we are poised for an intelligence takeoff that will expand our capabilities to unimagined heights.</p><p> We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher&#39;s Stone – we are literally making sand think.</p><p> We believe Artificial Intelligence is best thought of as a universal problem solver. And we have a lot of problems to solve.</p><p> We believe Artificial Intelligence can save lives – if we let it. Medicine, among many other fields, is in the stone age compared to what we can achieve with joined human and machine intelligence working on new cures. There are scores of common causes of death that can be fixed with AI, from car crashes to pandemics to wartime friendly fire.</p><p> We believe any deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing is a form of murder.</p></blockquote><p>这是正确的。 Not developing maximum AI is a form of murder.</p><p> I feel oddly singled out, here? Why isn&#39;t holding back everything else or any non-optimal decision also a form of murder? What about Marc&#39;s failure to donate more money for malaria nets?</p><blockquote><p> We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do.</p><p> We believe Augmented Intelligence drives marginal productivity which drives wage growth which drives demand which drives the creation of new supply… with no upper bound.</p></blockquote><p> Existential risk? Never heard of her, except in the &#39;enemies&#39; list. Very constructive way to think we have here:</p><blockquote><p>六十年来，我们当前的社会一直遭受着一场大规模的士气低落运动——反对技术和生活——以不同的名称，如“存在风险”、“可持续性”、“ESG”、“可持续发展目标”、“社会责任”、“利益相关者资本主义”、“预防原则”、“信任与安全”、“技术伦理”、“风险管理”、“去增长”、“增长的极限”。</p></blockquote><p> Does Marc have no idea that the first of these things – and I do not think it is a coincidence it is first – is not like the others? That one of these things does not belong?</p><p> Or does he know, and is deliberately trying to put it there anyway? Perhaps as the entire central point of the entire damn manifesto?</p><p> Or is he so far gone that the concept of the map matching the territory, that words could have meaning and causes might have a variety of effects, completely lost to him?</p><p> Either way, none of this is an argument on anything but vibes.</p><p> Which is a shame, because I otherwise very much want to help with the whole techno-optimism thing, and the list of virtues (called &#39;technological values&#39;) starts off pretty sweet and also is pretty sweet later on, this part is a list I can get behind (modulo &#39;what is revenge doing there, that&#39;s kind of a weird choice…&#39;):</p><blockquote><p> We believe in ambition, aggression, persistence, relentlessness – strength.</p><p> We believe in merit and achievement.</p><p> We believe in bravery, in courage.</p><p> We believe in pride, confidence, and self respect – when earned.</p><p> We believe in free thought, free speech, and free inquiry.</p><p> We believe in the actual Scientific Method and enlightenment values of free discourse and challenging the authority of experts.</p><p> We believe, as Richard Feynman said, “Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.”</p><p> And, “I would rather have questions that can&#39;t be answered than answers that can&#39;t be questioned.”</p><p> We believe in local knowledge, the people with actual information making decisions, not in playing God.</p><p> ……</p><p> We believe in the truth.</p><p> We believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is better than scarce.</p><p> We believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and everything abundant.</p><p> We believe extrinsic motivations – wealth, fame, revenge – are fine as far as they go. But we believe intrinsic motivations – the satisfaction of building something new, the camaraderie of being on a team, the achievement of becoming a better version of oneself – are more fulfilling and more lasting.</p><p> We believe in what the Greeks called eudaimonia through arete – flourishing through excellence.</p><p> We believe technology is universalist.</p></blockquote><p> Except I don&#39;t want us all to die. What did I skip over?</p><blockquote><p> We believe in embracing variance, in increasing interestingness.</p><p> We believe in risk, in leaps into the unknown.</p><p> We believe in competition, because we believe in evolution.</p><p> We believe in evolution, because we believe in life.</p></blockquote><p> What does it mean to &#39;believe in evolution,&#39; &#39;embrace variance&#39; and &#39;believe in risk, in leaps into the unknown&#39; in the context of intentionally creating maximally intelligent and capable new things as quickly as possible? It means losing control over the future, it means having no preferences other than fitness. It means death. Which could be with or without the &#39;and that&#39;s good, actually&#39; line at the end that is logically implied.</p><p> And later, in the next section, we have this:</p><blockquote><p>对技术的一个常见批评是，它剥夺了我们生活中的选择权，因为机器为我们做决定。 This is undoubtedly true, yet more than offset by the freedom to create our lives that flows from the material abundance created <strong><em>by</em></strong> our use of machines.</p></blockquote><p> Like the rest of the manifesto, this has historically been very true, is currently very true on most (but notice, not all) margins, and quite obviously we should not expect that relationship to hold if we build machines that think better than we do.</p><p> What to make of all this? One certainly must take in the irony.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/littIeramblings/status/1714326250364321941">Sarah</a> (@LittIeramblings) : the irony of @pmarca labelling AI safety some kind of semi-religious doomsday cult and then publishing a &#39;manifesto&#39; comprised of &#39;beliefs&#39; that he makes zero attempt to substantiate lol.</p><p> This reads more like a cultish chant than anything I&#39;ve ever heard a safety advocate say.</p></blockquote><p> Again, on his list of enemies, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsRjQDrDnY8">one of these things is not like the others</a> . Whereas when one hears the responses from those who affiliate with the rest of his list, it is hard not to sympathize with Marc&#39;s need to go off on an extended rant here.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1713978560304587161">Ben Collins</a> (Senior Reporter, NBC News): Marc Andreessen, who runs one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital firms, wrote a “manifesto” today labeling “social responsibility” and “tech ethics” teams “the enemy.” His firm recently pivoted from crypto/Web3 to American military and defense contractor technology.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/aphysicist/status/1714374208212607196">Aaron Slodov</a> : Seeing this post and reading through the replies makes it very clear that hall monitor personalities like this are so completely opposite from high agency builders and jaywalkers who move society forward.

Marinetti is not only the author of the technology- and destruction-worshipping <em>Futurist Manifesto</em> from 1909, but also one of the architects of Italian fascism. Marinetti co-authored the <em>Fascist Manifesto</em> in 1919 and founded a futurist political party that merged with Mussolini&#39;s fascists. Other futurist thinkers and artists exist. To call Marinetti in particular a “saint” is a choice.</p></blockquote><p> There is also this gem of willful misunderstanding:</p><blockquote><p> Janus Rose (Vice): It gives further weight to viewing effective accelerationism—and its counterparts, “effective altruism” and “longtermism”—as the official ideology of Silicon Valley.</p></blockquote><p> There is no mystery here. The official ideology of Silicon Valley is to build cool stuff and make money. That is true whether or not they live up to their ideals.</p><p> Also, sure, there are a bunch of them who really don&#39;t want us all to die and have noticed that one might be up in the air, another highly overlapping bunch of them think maybe doing good things for people is good, and on the flip side others think that building cool stuff is The Way even if it would look to a normal person like the particular cool stuff might actually go badly up to and including getting everyone killed. They are people, and contain multitudes.</p><p> What frustrates me most is that Marc Andreessen keeps talking about general techno-optimism, I agree with him on every margin except frontier or open source AI models, and yet he seems profoundly uninterested in all the other issues, where I mostly think he is right.

This, as the argument goes, shows that in the one case we have of a process creating general intelligence, it was not the case that the optimization target of the created intelligence ended up being the same as the optimization target of the process that created it. Therefore, alignment doesn&#39;t happen by default. To quote from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNhMPAWcfBCASy8e6/a-central-ai-alignment-problem-capabilities-generalization">A central AI alignment problem: capabilities generalization, and the sharp left turn</a> :<br></p><blockquote><p> And in the same stroke that [an AI&#39;s] capabilities leap forward, its alignment properties are revealed to be shallow, and to fail to generalize. The central analogy here is that optimizing apes for inclusive genetic fitness (IGF) doesn&#39;t make the resulting humans optimize mentally for IGF. Like, sure, the apes are eating because they have a hunger instinct and having sex because it feels good—but it&#39;s not like they <i>could</i> be eating/fornicating due to explicit reasoning about how those activities lead to more IGF. They can&#39;t yet perform the sort of abstract reasoning that would correctly justify those actions in terms of IGF. And then, when they start to generalize well in the way of humans, they predictably don&#39;t <i>suddenly start</i> eating/fornicating <i>because</i> of abstract reasoning about IGF, even though they now <i>could</i> . Instead, they invent condoms, and fight you if you try to remove their enjoyment of good food (telling them to just calculate IGF manually). The alignment properties you lauded before the capabilities started to generalize, predictably fail to generalize with the capabilities.</p></blockquote><p> Jacob published <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xCCNdxNPpbJKD3x4W/evolution-solved-alignment-what-sharp-left-turn">Evolution Solved Alignment (what sharp left turn?)</a> , arguing that actually humans represent a great alignment <i>success</i> . Evolution was trying to make things that make many copies of themselves, and humans are enormously successful on that metric. To quote Jacob:</p><blockquote><p> For the evolution of human intelligence, the optimizer is just evolution: biological natural selection. The utility function is something like fitness: ex gene replication count (of the human defining genes) <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xCCNdxNPpbJKD3x4W/evolution-solved-alignment-what-sharp-left-turn#fn-ZfBacxFa8jjFpbJvN-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> . And by any reasonable measure, it is obvious that humans are enormously successful. If we normalize so that a utility score of 1 represents a mild success - the expectation of a typical draw of a great apes species, then humans&#39; score is >;4 OOM larger, completely off the charts. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xCCNdxNPpbJKD3x4W/evolution-solved-alignment-what-sharp-left-turn#fn-ZfBacxFa8jjFpbJvN-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p> I pushed back, saying:</p><blockquote><p> The failure of alignment is witnessed by the fact that humans very very obviously fail to maximize the relative frequency of their genes in the next generation, given the opportunities available to them; and they are often aware of this; and they often choose to do so anyway.</p></blockquote><p> We got into a messy discussion.

General Evolution is the process where patterns of any kind that become more common over time will come to dominate. Since some patterns and aggregates of patterns can make themselves more common; for example, an organism that reproduces itself, a gene that gets copied, a virulent meme. Those patterns can &quot;team up&quot;, eg genes in an organism or memes in a memeplex, and they can be tweaked so that they are better at making themselves more common. So what we see around us is patterns and aggregates of patterns that are really good at making themselves more common. If we think of General Evolution as having a utility function, its utility function is something along the lines of: There should be things that make many copies of themselves.<br><br> The second kind of process is what I&#39;ll call a Lineage Evolution. For every species S alive today, there&#39;s a Lineage Evolution called &quot;S-evolution&quot; that goes from the first life form, up the phylogenetic tree of life along the branch that S is on, through each of S&#39;s ancestor species, up to S itself.<br><br> There are also two meanings of &quot;humans&quot;. &quot;Humans&quot; could mean individual humans, or it could mean humanity as a whole.<br><br> I read the original argument as saying: Human-evolution (an instance of a Lineage Evolution) selected for IGF of organisms. That is, at every step of the way, Human-evolution promoted genes that created humans (or human-ancestor-species organisms) that were good at making the genes in that organism be more common in the next generation. Today, most individual-humans do not do anything like explicitly, monomaniacally trying to promote their own genes. Thus, an instance of misalignment.<br><br> I think, though I&#39;m very far from sure, that Jacob actually mostly agrees with this. I think Jacob wants to say that<br><br> 1. Humanity is the proper subject of the question of misalignment;<br> 2. General Evolution is the proper subject;<br> 3. Humanity is pretty aligned with General Evolution, because there are many humans, and General Evolution wants there to be patterns that make many of themselves.<br><br> My current main reply is:<br><br> General Evolution is not the proper subject, because the vast majority of the optimization power going into designing humans is Human-evolution.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 18:30:08 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 18:30:08 GMT" user-order="1"><p> I think it might help me if you wrote a few sentences that lay out your top level case, reformulated given the context we have so far.

In many species, only a tiny fraction of individuals reproduce at all.  For humans it&#39;s over 50% for women, but perhaps under 50% for men.</p><p> Evolution proceeds through random variation and selection - many experiments in parallel, only some of which will be successful - <i>by design</i> .  The failures are <i>necessary</i> for progress.</p><p> Over time evolution optimizes simply for fitness - the quantity/measure of genetic patterns, defined over some set of genetic patterns.  If you try to measure that for an individual, you get IGF - because the gene pattern of that individual will necessarily overlap with other individuals (strongly with closely related kin, overlap fading out with distance, etc).  Likewise you can measure fitness for ever larger populations up to the species level.</p><p> Given two optimization processes with distinct utility functions, you could perhaps measure the degree of alignment as the dot product of the two functions over the world state (or expectation thereof for future world trajectory distributions).<br><br> But we can&#39;t directly measure the alignment between evolution as an optimizer and brains as an optimizer - even if we have some idea of how to explicitly define evolution&#39;s optimization target (fitness), the brain&#39;s optimization target is some complex individually varying proxy of fitness - far more complex than any simple function.  Moreover, degree of alignment is not really the interesting concept by itself, unless normalized to some relevant scale (to set the threshold for success/failure).</p><p> But given that we know one of the utility functions (evolution: fitness), we can approximately measure the total impact.  The world today is largely the result of optimization by human brains - ie it is the end result of optimization towards the proxy utility function, not the real utility function.  Thus there is only a singular useful threshold for misalignment: is the world today (or recent history) high, low, or zero utility according to the utility function of human fitness?</p><p> And the answer is <i>obviously</i> high utility.  Thus any misalignment was small in net impact, period.</p><p> If E(W) is evolutionary utility and B(W) is brain utility, we have:<br><br> W[T] = opt(W[0], B(W))</p><p> E(W[T]) = large<br><br> (The world was optimized according to brains (proxy utility), not genetic fitness utility, but the current world is enormously high scoring according to genetic fitness utility, which thereby bounds any misalignment).</p><p> TechneMarke argues that most of the evolutionary pressure producing brains was at the intra-species level, but this is irrelevant to my argument, <i>unless</i> TechneMarke actually believes and can show that this leads to a different correct utility function for evolution (other than fitness) <i>and</i> that humans are low scoring according to that function.</p><p> As an analogy: corporations largely optimize for profit, and the secondary fact that most innovation in large corps stems from intra-corporate competition is irrelevant to the primary fact that corporations largely optimize for profit.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> jacob_cannell </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:02:37 GMT" user-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT" display-name="jacob_cannell" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:02:37 GMT" user-order="2"><p> So to summarize, there are several possible levels of evolution&lt;->;brain alignment:</p><ul><li> species: alignment of brains (in aggregate) and species level fitness</li><li> individual: alignment of individual brains and individual IGF</li></ul><p> We both seem to agree that individual alignment is high variance - some individuals are strongly aligned to IGF, others not at all.

I think the framing here may have covered over our disagreement. I want to say: humans were constructed by a process that selected for IGF across many iterations. Now, humans are kinda optimizing for things, but they are definitely not optimizing for IGF.<br><br> I think you&#39;re saying something in the general category of: &quot;Sure, but the concepts you&#39;re using here aren&#39;t joint-carving. If you look at the creation of humans by evolution, and then you think of with non-joint-carving concepts, then you&#39;ll see misalignment. But that&#39;s just misalignment between a non-joint-carving subset of the real designing process and a non-joint-carving subset of the thing that gets designed.&quot;<br><br> And I&#39;m like... Ok, but the analogy still seems to hold?<br><br> Like, if I think of humans trying to make AI, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the utility function of all the humans trying to make AI&quot;. I think I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the criteria that the humans trying to make AI, or the objective function used for gradient descent or RL, are concretely using day-to-day to pick what tweaks / ideas in their designs to keep around&quot;.  So there&#39;s two analogies there, but both of the same form.<br><br> One of the analogies is like: humans go around coming up with ideas for AI; if their AI does something cool, they upvote that; if they can, they try to tweak the AI that does something cool so that it can be used to actually do something useful for humans; in the cases where the AI does something noticeably bad, the humans try to patch that. The humans probably think of themselves as implementing their own utility function through their actions, and more importantly, they might actually be doing so in a certain sense. If the humans could go on patching bad results and upvoting cool results and install using-for-good patches, then in the limit of that, the real human utility function would be expressed and fulfilled. But the analogy here is saying: These criteria the humans are using to design their AI, to make the tweaks that over the course of humanity&#39;s AI research will add up to really powerful AI, can make a really powerful AI without installing in the AI the limiting real human utility function. Similarly, given enough evolutionary time, evolution would install more strategic-IGF-optimization in humans; that may already be happening.</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:32:04 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 19:32:04 GMT" user-order="1"><p> In other words, for the analogy to seem right and important to me, it doesn&#39;t feel very cruxy that it be a clear instance of utility function vs. utility function misalignment. What feels cruxy is a less precise sense of: this process designed an optimizer by selecting really hard for X, but then the optimizer ended up trying to do Y which is different from X.<br><br> Like, if I train an AI by the objective function of imitating humans, I expect that eventually, when it&#39;s getting really exceptionally good, it will become an optimizer that is optimizing powerfully for something other than imitating humans.<br><br> It&#39;s possible that a crux for us is related to how much to care about expected future outcomes. I think you said in some comments somewhere, something like, &quot;yeah, maybe humans / humanity will be much more misaligned with evolution in the future, but that&#39;s speculation and circular reasoning, it hasn&#39;t happened yet&quot;. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s circular: We can see clearly <i>today</i> that humans <i>are</i> optimizing for things, and say they are optimizing for things, and those things are <i>not</i> IGF, and so predictably <i>later</i> , when humans have the power, we will end up scoring very <i>low</i> on IGF; today the misalignment is fuzzier, and has to be judged against counterfactuals (how much IGF <i>could</i> a modern human be getting, <i>if</i> they were anything like IGF maximizers).</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT-Wed, 18 Oct 2023 20:15:13 GMT" user-id="N2R9wMRJd7SBSjpiT" display-name="jacob_cannell" submitted-date="Wed, 18 Oct 2023 20:15:13 GMT" user-order="2"><blockquote><p> Now, humans are kinda optimizing for things, but they are definitely not optimizing for IGF.</p></blockquote><p> We may still have disagreement on this - I would reiterate that at the individual level some humans are definitely optimizing strongly for IGF, up to the limits of a 20W physical computer (which rules out most objections based on gross misunderstanding of the physical limits of optimization power for 20W irreversible computers).  I already brought up one specific example in our private discussion - namely individual humans going to great efforts to maximize successful sperm donation even when they are paid trivial amounts, or aren&#39;t paid at all and in some cases actually commit felonies with long prison sentences to do so (strongly antipaid).  Also the way the brain <i>mostly normally</i> works is closer to something like mysteriously subconsciously compelling you to optimize for IGF - take Elon Musk as an example: he is on track to very high IGF score, but doesnt&#39; seem to be explicitly consciously optimizing for that.  Alignment in the brain is very complex and clearly not yet fully understood - but it is highly redundant with many levels of mechanisms in play.</p><p> So one point of potential confusion is I do believe that properly understanding and determining what &quot;optimizing for IGF, up to the limits of a 20W physical computer&quot; actually entails requires deep understanding of DL and neuroscience and leads to something like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iCfdcxiyr2Kj8m8mT/the-shard-theory-of-human-values">shard theory</a> .  The kind of consequentialist optimizer Nate seems to imply fails miserably at 20W and is not remotely related to what a successful design (like the brain) looks like - it is always an ultra complex proxy optimizer, ala shard theory and related.<br><br> Perfect alignment is a myth, a fantasy - and clearly unnecessary for success! (that is much of the lesson of this analogy)</p><blockquote><p> Like, if I think of humans trying to make AI, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the utility function of all the humans trying to make AI&quot;. I think I&#39;m trying to talk about &quot;the criteria that the humans trying to make AI, or the objective function used for gradient descent or RL, are concretely using day-to-day to pick what tweaks / ideas in their designs to keep around&quot;.</p></blockquote><p> I do believe that among the possible alignment analogies from evolution, there is a single best analogy: the systems level analogy.</p><p> Genetic evolutionary optimization producing brains is like technological evolutionary optimization producing AGI.</p><p> Both processes involve bilevel optimization: an outer genetic (or memetic) evolutionary optimization process and an inner ANN optimization process.  Practical AGI is necessarily very brain like (which I <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine) correctly many years in advance, contra EY/MIRI)">predicted</a> correctly many years in advance, contra EY/MIRI).  DL is closely converging on brain like designs, in all respects that matter.</p><p> The outer evolutionary optimization process is similar, but with some key differences. The genome specifies the initial architectural prior (compact low bit and low frequency encoding over the weights) along with an efficient approx bayesian learning algorithm to update those weights.  Likewise AI systems are specified by a small compact code (pytorch, tensorflow etc) which specifies the initial architectural prior along with an efficient approx bayesian learning algo to update those weights (SGD).  The main difference is that for tech evolution the units of encoding - the tech memes - recombine far more flexibly than genes.  Each new experiment can combine memes flexibly from a large number of previous papers/experiments, a process guided by human intelligence (inner optimization).  The main effect is simply a massive speedup - similar but more extreme than advanced genetic engineering.</p><p> I think this really is the singularly most informative analogy.  And from that analogy I think we can say this:<br><br> To the extent that the tech evolution of AGI is similar to the genetic evolution of human intelligence (brains), genetic evolution&#39;s great success at aligning humanity so far (in aggregate, not individually) implies a similar level of success for tech evolution aligning AGI (in aggregate, not individually) to similar non-trivial levels of optimization power divergence.</p><p> If you think that the first AGI crossing some capability threshold is likely to suddenly takeover the world, then the species level alignment analogy breaks down and doom is more likely.  It would be like a single medieval era human suddenly taking over the world via powerful magic.  Would the resulting world after optimization according to that single human&#39;s desires still score reasonably well at IGF?  I&#39;d say somewhere between 90% to 50% probability, but that&#39;s still clearly a high p(doom) scenario.  I do think that scenario is unlikely for a variety of reasons (in short, the same factor that allows human engineers to select for successful meme changes enormously above chance also acts as a hidden great filter reducing failure variance in tech designs), but that&#39;s a long separate discussion I&#39;ve already partly argued elsewhere.</p><p> So one key component underlying evolution&#39;s success at aligning humanity is the variance reducing effect of large populations, which maps directly to multipolar scenarios.  A population will almost always be more aligned then worst case or even median individuals, and a population can be perfectly aligned even when nearly every single individual is near completely misaligned (orthogonal).  Variance reduction is critical for most successful optimization algos (SGD and evolution included).</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> jacob_cannell </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:14:10 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:14:10 GMT" user-order="1"><p> (At this point I&#39;m going to make the dialogue publicly viewable, and we can continue as long as that seems good.)</p><section class="dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor"> TekhneMakre </section></section><section class="dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody" message-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL-Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:21:27 GMT" user-id="rbtKwJ8vDJoiv7oAL" display-name="TekhneMakre" submitted-date="Thu, 19 Oct 2023 03:21:27 GMT" user-order="1"><blockquote><p> TM: The failure of alignment is witnessed by the fact that humans very very obviously fail to maximize the relative frequency of their genes in the next generation, given the opportunities available to them</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> J: This is irrelevant - individual failure &quot;to maximize the relative frequency of their genes in the next generation&quot; is the expected outcome at the individual level for most species.

That&#39;s not the sort of thing evolution is; it&#39;s not a strategic, general optimizer.

She says:</p><blockquote><p> This is an example of what&#39;s called the fallacy of dumb superintelligence. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefs793uam9h9i"><sup><a href="#fns793uam9h9i">[1]</a></sup></span> That is, it&#39;s a fallacy to think a machine could be &#39;smarter than humans in all respects&#39;, but still lack any common sense understanding of humans, such as understanding why we made the request to fix climate change.</p></blockquote><p> I think this “fallacy” is a crux of disagreement about AI x-risk, by way of alignment difficulty. I&#39;ve heard this statement from other reasonably well-informed risk doubters. The intuition makes sense. But most people in alignment would dismiss this out of hand as being itself a fallacy. Understanding these two positions not only clarifies the discussion, but suggests reasons we&#39;re overlooking a promising approach to alignment.</p><p> This &quot;fallacy&quot; doesn&#39;t establish that alignment is easy. Understanding what you mean doesn&#39;t make the AGI want to do that thing. Actions are guided by goals, which are different from knowledge. But this intuition that understanding should help alignment needn&#39;t be totally discarded. We now have proposed alignment approaches that make use of an AIs understanding for its alignment. They do this by “pointing” a motivational system at representations in a learned knowledge system, such as “human flourishing”. I discuss two alignment plans that use this approach and seem quite promising.</p><p> Early alignment thinking assumed that this type of approach  was not viable, since AGIs could &quot; <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai-takeoff">go foom</a> &quot; (learn very quickly and unpredictably). This assumption appears not to be true of sub-human levels of training in deep networks, and that may be sufficient for initial alignment.</p><p> With a system capable of unpredictable rapid improvement, it would be madness to let it learn prior to aligning it. It might very well grow smart enough to escape before you get a chance to stop its learning to perform alignment. Thus, its goals (or a set of rewards to shape them) must be specified before it starts to learn. In that scenario, the way we specify goals cannot make use of the AI&#39;s intelligence. Mitchell&#39;s “fallacy” is itself a fallacy under this logic. An AGI that understands what we want can easily do things we very much don&#39;t want.</p><p> But early foom now seems unlikely, so our thinking should adjust. Deep networks don&#39;t increase in capabilities unpredictably, at least prior to human-level and recursive self improvement. And that may be far enough for initial alignment to succeed. The early assumption of AGI “going foom” now seems unlikely to be true. I think that early assumption has left a mistake in our collective thinking: that an AGI&#39;s knowledge is irrelevant to making it do what we want. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefg637hbyuzwv"><sup><a href="#fng637hbyuzwv">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h2> <strong>How to safely use an AI&#39;s understanding for alignment</strong></h2><p> Deep networks learn at a relatively predictable pace, in the current training regime. Thus, their training can be paused at intermediate levels that include some understanding of human values, but before they achieve superhuman capabilities. Once a system starts to reflect and direct its own learning, this smooth trajectory probably won&#39;t continue. But we can probably stop at a safe but useful level of intelligence/understanding, if we set that level carefully and cautiously. We probably can align an AGI partway through training, and thus make use of its understanding of what we want.</p><p> There are three particularly relevant examples of this type of approach. The first, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rlhf"><u>RLHF</u></a> , is relevant because it is widely known and understood. (I <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d6DvuCKH5bSoT62DB/compendium-of-problems-with-rlhf"><u>among others</u></a> don&#39;t consider it a promising approach to alignment by itself.) RLHF uses the LLM&#39;s trained “understanding” or “knowledge” as a substrate for efficiently specifying human preferences. Training on a limited set of human judgments about input-response pairs causes the LLM to generalize these preferences remarkably well. We are “pointing to” areas in its learned semantic spaces. Because those semantics are relatively well-formed, we need to do relatively little pointing to define a complex set of desired responses.</p><p> The second example is natural language alignment of language model agents (LMAs). This seems like a very promising alignment plan, if LMAs become our first AGIs. This plan consists of designing the agent to follow top-level goals stated in natural language (eg, &quot;get OpenAI a lot of money and political influence&quot;) including alignment goals (eg, &quot;do what Sam Altman wants, and make the world a better place&quot;.) I&#39;ve written more about this technique, and the ensemble of techniques it can &quot;stack&quot; with, <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Q7XWGqL4HjjRmhEyG/internal-independent-review-for-language-model-agent"><u>here</u></a> .</p><p> This approach follows the above general scheme. It pauses training to do alignment work by pre-training the LLM, and inserting alignment goals before launching the system as an agent. (This is mid-training, if that agent continues to perform continuous learning, as seems likely.) If the AI is sufficiently intelligent, it will pursue those goals as stated, including their rich and contextual semantics. Choosing these goal statements wisely is still a nontrivial outer alignment problem; but the AI&#39;s knowledge is the substrate for defining its alignment.</p><p> Another promising alignment plan that follows this general pattern is Steve Byrnes&#39; <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Hi7zurzkCog336EC2/plan-for-mediocre-alignment-of-brain-like-model-based-rl-agi"><u>Plan for mediocre alignment of brain-like [model-based RL] AGI</u></a> . In this plan, we induce the nascent AGI (paused at useful but controllable level of understanding/intelligence) to represent the concept we want it aligned to (eg, “think about human flourishing” or “corrigibility” or whatever). We then set the weights from the active units in its representational system into its critic system. Since the critic system is a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qzu9o3sTytbC4sZkQ/steering-subsystems-capabilities-agency-and-alignment"><u>steering subsystem</u></a> that determines its values and therefore its behavior, inner alignment is solved. That concept has become its “favorite”, highest-valued set of representations, and its decision-making will pursue everything semantically included in that concept as a final goal.</p><p> Now, contrast these techniques with alignment techniques that don&#39;t make use of the system&#39;s knowledge. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqkGmfikqapbJ2YMj/shard-theory-an-overview"><u>Shard Theory</u></a> and other proposals for aligning AGI by using the right set of rewards is one example. This requires accurately guessing how the system&#39;s representations will form, and how those rewards will shape the agent&#39;s behavior as they develop. Hand-coding a representation of any but the simplest goal (see <a href="https://arbital.com/p/diamond_maximizer/"><u>diamond maximization</u></a> ) seems so difficult that it&#39;s not generally considered a viable approach.</p><p> These are sketches of plans that need further development and inspection for flaws. And they only produce an initial, loose (&quot;mediocre&quot;) alignment with human values, in the training distribution. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g3pbJPQpNJyFfbHKd/the-alignment-stability-problem"><u>The alignment stability problem</u></a> of generalization and change of values remains unaddressed. Whether the alignment remains satisfactory after further learning, self-modification, or in new (out of distribution) circumstances seems like a complex problem that deserves further analysis.</p><p> This approach of leveraging an AI&#39;s intelligence and “telling it what we want” by pointing to its representations seems promising. And these two plans seem particularly promising. They apply to types of AGI we are likely to get (language model agents, RL agents, or a hybrid); they are straightforward enough to implement, and straightforward enough to think about in detail prior to implementing them.</p><p> I&#39;d love to hear specific pushback on this direction, or better yet, these specific plans. AI work seems likely to proceed apace, so alignment work should proceed with haste too. I think we need the best plans we can make and critique, applying to the types of AGI we&#39;re most likely to get, even if those plans are imperfect. <br></p><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fns793uam9h9i"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefs793uam9h9i">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> Richard Loosemore appears to have coined the term in 2012 or before.

This includes a quick dive into the concept of rewards and reward functions. This section lays the groundwork for explaining why reward design is extremely important.</li><li> <strong>Optimization</strong> : This section briefly introduces the concept of Goodhart&#39;s Law. It provides some motivation behind understanding why rewards are difficult to specify in a way such that they do not collapse in the face of immense optimization pressure.</li><li> <strong>Reward misspecification</strong> : With a solid grasp of the notion of rewards and optimization the readers are introduced to one of the core challenges of alignment - reward misspecification. This is also known as the Outer Alignment problem. The section begins by discussing the necessity of good reward design in addition to algorithm design. This is followed by concrete examples of reward specification failures such as reward hacking and reward tampering.</li><li> <strong>Learning by Imitation</strong> : This section focuses on some proposed solutions to reward misspecification that rely on learning reward functions through imitating human behavior. It examines proposals such as imitation learning (IL), behavioral cloning (BC), and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each section also contains an examination of possible issues and limitations of these approaches as they pertain to resolving reward hacking.</li><li> <strong>Learning by Feedback</strong> : The final section investigates proposals aiming to rectify reward misspecification by providing feedback to the machine learning models. The section also provides a comprehensive insight into how current large language models (LLMs) are trained. The discussion covers reward modeling, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reinforcement learning from artificial intelligence feedback (RLAIF), and the limitations of these approaches.</li></ol><h1> 1.0: Reinforcement Learning</h1><p> The section provides a succinct reminder of several concepts in reinforcement learning (RL). It also disambiguates various often conflated terms such as rewards, values and utilities. The section ends with a discussion around distinguishing the concept of objectives that a reinforcement learning system might pursue from what it is being rewarded for. Readers who are already familiar with the basics can skip directly to section 2.</p><h2> 1.1. Primer</h2><p> <i>Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on developing agents that can learn from interactive experiences. RL is based on the concept of an agent learning through interaction with an environment and altering its behavior based on the feedback it receives through rewards after each action.</i></p><p> Some examples of real-world applications of RL include:</p><ul><li> <strong>Robotic systems</strong> : RL has been applied to tasks such as controlling physical robots in real-time, and enabling them to learn more complicated movements (OpenAI 2018 “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwSbzNHGflM"><u>Learning Dexterity</u></a> ”). RL can enable robotic systems to learn complex tasks and adapt to changing environments.</li><li> <strong>Recommender Systems</strong> : RL can be applied to recommender systems, which interact with billions of users and aim to provide personalized recommendations. RL algorithms can learn to optimize the recommendation policy based on user feedback and improve the overall user experience.</li><li> <strong>Game playing systems:</strong> In the early 2010s RL RL-based systems started to beat humans at a few very simple Atari games, like Pong and Breakout. Over the years, there have been many models that have utilized RL to defeat world masters in both board and video games. These include models like <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago"><u>AlphaGo</u></a> (2016), <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go"><u>AlphaZero</u></a> (2018), <a href="https://openai.com/research/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions"><u>OpenAI Five</u></a> (2019), <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii"><u>AlphaStar</u></a> (2019), <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules"><u>MuZero</u></a> (2020) and <a href="https://github.com/YeWR/EfficientZero"><u>EfficientZero</u></a> (2021).</li></ul><p> RL is different from supervised learning as it begins with a high-level description of &quot;what&quot; to do but allows the agent to experiment and learn from experience the best &quot;how&quot;. In RL, the agent learns through interaction with an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions. RL is focused on learning a set of rules that recommend the best action to take in a given state to maximize long-term rewards. In contrast, supervised learning typically involves learning from explicitly provided labels or correct answers for each input.</p><h2> 1.2. Core Loop</h2><p> The overall functioning of RL is relatively straightforward. The two main components are the agent itself, and the environment within which the agent lives and operates.

The agent learns from experience and adjusts its policy based on the feedback it receives from the environment in the form of rewards or punishments.</p><p> In order to determine whether an action is better than another, the actions (or the state-action pairs) need to be evaluated somehow. There are two different ways to look at which action to take - the immediate rewards (determined by reward function) and the long term cumulative rewards (determined by the value function). Both of these greatly influence the types of policies learned by the agent, and therefore also the actions that the agent takes. The following section explores and clarifies the concept of rewards in greater depth.</p><h2> 1.4: Reward</h2><p> <i>Reward refers to any signal or feedback mechanism used to guide the learning process and optimize the behavior of the model.</i></p><p> The reward signal from the environment is a number that tells the agent how good or bad the current world state is. It is a way to provide an evaluation or measure of performance for the model&#39;s outputs or actions. The reward can be defined based on a specific task or objective, such as maximizing a score in a game or achieving a desired outcome in a real-world scenario. The training process for RL involves optimizing the model&#39;s parameters to maximize the expected reward. The model learns to generate actions or outputs that are more likely to receive higher rewards, leading to improved performance over time. Where does the reward come from? It is generated through a reward function.</p><p> <i>A reward function defines the goal or objective in a reinforcement learning problem. It maps perceived states or state-action pairs of the environment to a single number.</i></p><p> <span><span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math" aria-label="R : (S \times A) \rightarrow \mathbb{R};&nbsp;r_t = R(s_t,a_t)"><span class="mjx-mrow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">R</span></span> <span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;">:</span></span> <span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;">(</span></span> <span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;">S</span></span> <span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space2"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">×</span></span> <span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space2"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">A</span></span> <span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;">)</span></span> <span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;">→</span></span> <span class="mjx-texatom MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">R</span></span></span></span> <span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;">;</span></span> <span class="mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-base"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">r</span></span></span> <span class="mjx-sub" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;"><span class="mjx-mi" style=""><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">t</span></span></span></span> <span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">=</span></span> <span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">R</span></span> <span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;">(</span></span> <span class="mjx-msubsup"><span class="mjx-base"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">s</span></span></span> <span class="mjx-sub" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;"><span class="mjx-mi" style=""><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">t</span></span></span></span> <span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;">,</span></span> <span class="mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-base"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">a</span></span></span> <span class="mjx-sub" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;"><span class="mjx-mi" style=""><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;">t</span></span></span></span> <span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R" style="padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> The reward function provides immediate feedback to the agent, indicating the goodness or badness of a particular state or action.

A reward function is typically used in the context of RL to guide the agent&#39;s learning process and behavior. In contrast, a utility function is more general and captures the agent&#39;s subjective preferences or satisfaction, allowing for comparisons and trade-offs between different world states. Utility functions are a concept that is used more in the field of decision theory and agent foundations work.</p><h1> 2.0: Optimization</h1><p> Optimization is important to understand for AI safety concerns because it plays a central role in ML. AI systems, particularly those based on deep learning, are trained using optimization algorithms to learn patterns and associations from data. These algorithms update the model&#39;s parameters to minimize a loss function, maximizing its performance on the given task.<br><br> Optimization amplifies certain behaviors or outcomes, even if they were initially unlikely. For example, an optimizer can search through a space of possible outputs and take extreme actions that have a high score according to the objective function, potentially leading to unintended and undesirable behavior. These include reward misspecification failures. A better recognition of the power of optimization to amplify certain outcomes might help in designing systems and algorithms that truly align with human values and objectives even under pressure of optimization. This involves ensuring that the optimization process is aligned with the intended goals and values of the system&#39;s designers. It also requires considering the potential failure modes and unintended consequences that can arise from optimization processes.</p><p> Risks from optimization are everywhere in AI Safety. It is only touched on briefly in this chapter, but will be discussed in further detail in the chapters on goal misgeneralization and agent foundations.</p><p> Optimization power plays a crucial role in reward hacking. Reward hacking occurs when RL agents exploit the difference between a true reward and a proxy reward. The increase in optimization power can lead to a higher likelihood of reward hacking behavior. In some cases, there are phase transitions where a moderate increase in optimization power results in a drastic increase in reward hacking.</p><h2> 2.1: Goodhart&#39;s Law</h2><p> &quot; <i>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</i> &quot;</p><p> This notion initially stems from the work of Charles Goodhart in economic theory. However, it has emerged as one of the primary challenges in many different fields including AI alignment today.</p><p> To illustrate this concept, the following is a story of a Soviet nail factory. The factory received instructions to produce as many nails as possible, with rewards for high output and penalties for low output. Within a few years, the factory had significantly increased its nail production—tiny nails that were essentially thumbtacks and proved impractical for their intended purpose. Consequently, the planners shifted the incentives: they decided to reward the factory based on the total weight of the nails produced. Within a few years, the factory began producing large, heavy nails—essentially lumps of steel—that were equally ineffective for nailing things. <br></p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/k7srevgiusvb24b9vl9a"></p><p> Source: <a href="https://lwfiles.mycourse.app/networkcapitalinsider-public/cc478b844a27de3f4f79f3dc0f9e0fde.jpeg"><u>Link</u></a></p><p> A measure is not something that is optimized, whereas a target is something that is optimized. When we specify a target for optimization, it is reasonable to expect it to be correlated with what we want. Initially the measure might lead to the kind of actions that are truly desired. However, once the measure itself becomes the target, optimizing that target then starts diverging away from our desired states.</p><p> In the context of AI and reward systems, Goodhart&#39;s Law means that when a proxy reward function reinforces undesired behavior, the AI will learn to do things we don&#39;t want. The better the AI is at exploring, the more likely it is to find undesirable behavior which is spuriously rated highly by the reward model. This can lead to unintended consequences and manipulation of the reward system, as it can often be easier to &quot;cheat&quot; rather than to achieve the intended goals This is one of the core underlying reasons for reward hacking failures that we will see in subsequent sections.</p><p> Reward hacking can be seen as a manifestation of Goodhart&#39;s Law in the context of AI systems. When designing reward functions, it is challenging to precisely articulate the desired behavior, and agents may find ways to exploit loopholes or manipulate the reward system to achieve high rewards without actually fulfilling the intended objectives. For example, a cleaning robot may create its own trash to put in the trash can to collect rewards, rather than actually cleaning the environment. Understanding Goodhart&#39;s Law is crucial for addressing reward hacking and designing robust reward systems that align with the intended goals of AI agents. It highlights the need for careful consideration of the measures and incentives used in AI systems to avoid unintended consequences and perverse incentives. The next section dives deeper into specific instances of reward misspecification and how AIs can find ways to achieve the literal specification of the objective and obtain high reward while not fulfilling the task in spirit.</p><p></p><h1> 3.0: Reward Misspecification</h1><p> <i><strong>Reward misspecification</strong> , also termed the <strong>Outer alignment</strong> problem, refers to the issue of providing an AI with the accurate reward to optimize for.</i></p><p> The fundamental issue is simple to comprehend: does the specified loss function align with the intended objective of its designers? However, implementing this in practical scenarios is exceedingly challenging. To express the complete &quot;intention&quot; behind a human request equates to conveying all human values, the implicit cultural context, etc., which remain poorly understood themselves.</p><p> Furthermore, as most models are designed as goal optimizers, they are all vulnerable to Goodhart&#39;s Law. This vulnerability implies that unforeseen negative consequences may arise due to excessive optimization pressure on a goal that appears well-specified to humans, but deviates from true objectives in subtle ways.</p><p> The overall problem can be broken up into distinct issues which will be explained in detail in individual sub-sections below. Here is a quick overview:</p><ul><li> <strong>Reward misspecification</strong> occurs when the specified reward function does not accurately capture the true objective or desired behavior.</li><li> <strong>Reward design</strong> refers to the process of designing the reward function to align the behavior of AI agents with the intended objectives.</li><li> <strong>Reward hacking</strong> refers to the behavior of RL agents exploiting gaps or loopholes in the specified reward function to achieve high rewards without actually fulfilling the intended objectives.</li><li> <strong>Reward tampering</strong> is a broader concept that encompasses inappropriate agent influence on the reward process itself, excluding the manipulation of the reward function through gaming.</li></ul><p> Before delving into specific types of reward misspecification failures, the following section further explains the emphasis on reward design in conjunction with algorithm design. This section also elucidates the notorious difficulty of designing effective rewards.</p><h2> 3.1: Reward Design</h2><p> <i>Reward design refers to the process of specifying the reward function in reinforcement learning (RL).</i></p><p> Reward shaping was introduced in an earlier section. Shaping refers to the process of modifying the reward function to provide additional guidance or incentives to the learning agent. Reward design on the other hand is a broader term that encompasses the entire process of designing and shaping reward functions to guide the behavior of AI systems. It involves not only reward shaping but also the overall process of defining objectives, specifying preferences, and creating reward functions that align with human values and desired outcomes. Reward design is a term that is often used interchangeably with <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4nZRzoGTqg8xy5rr8/the-reward-engineering-problem"><u>reward engineering</u></a> . They both refer to the same thing.</p><p> RL algorithm design and RL reward design are two separate facets of reinforcement learning. RL algorithm design is about the development and implementation of learning algorithms that allow an agent to learn and refine its behavior based on rewards and environmental interactions. This process includes designing the mechanisms and procedures by which the agent learns from its experiences, updates its policies, and makes decisions to maximize cumulative rewards.</p><p> Conversely, RL reward design concentrates on the specification and design of the reward function guiding the RL agent&#39;s learning process. Reward design warrants carefully engineering the reward function to align with the desired behavior and objectives, while accounting for potential pitfalls like reward hacking or reward tampering. The reward function is a pivotal element because it molds the behavior of the RL agent and determines which actions are deemed desirable or undesirable.</p><p> Designing a reward function often presents a formidable challenge that necessitates considerable expertise and experience. To demonstrate the complexity of this task consider how one might manually design a reward function to make an agent perform a backflip, as depicted in the following image: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/j5bex8lae44dyr0lkgnk"></p><p> Source: OpenAI (2017) “ <a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/"><u>Learning from human preferences</u></a> ”</p><p> While RL algorithm design focuses on the learning and decision-making mechanisms of the agent, RL reward design focuses on defining the objective and shaping the agent&#39;s behavior through the reward function. Both aspects are crucial in the development of effective and aligned RL systems. A well-designed RL algorithm can efficiently learn from rewards, while a carefully designed reward function can guide the agent towards desired behavior and avoid unintended consequences. The following diagram displays the three key elements in RL agent design—algorithm design, reward design, and the prevention of tampering with the reward signal: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/izuxey2bnle4ftwor5nq"></p><p> Source: Deep Mind (Apr 2020) “ <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity"><u>Specification gaming: the flip side of AI ingenuity</u></a> ”</p><p> The process of reward design receives minimal attention in introductory RL texts, despite its critical role in defining the problem to be resolved. As mentioned in this section&#39;s introduction, solving the reward misspecification problem would necessitate finding evaluation metrics resistant to Goodhart&#39;s law-induced failures. This includes failures stemming from over-optimization of either a misdirected or a proxy objective (reward hacking), or by the agent directly interfering with the reward signal (reward tampering). These concepts are further explored in the ensuing sections.</p><h2> 3.2: Reward Shaping</h2><p> <i>Reward shaping is a technique used in RL which introduces small intermediate rewards to supplement the environmental reward. This seeks to mitigate the problem of sparse reward signals and to encourage exploration and faster learning.</i></p><p> In order to succeed at a reinforcement learning problem, an AI needs to do two things:</p><ul><li> Find a sequence of actions that leads to positive reward. This is the <i>exploration</i> problem.</li><li> Remember the sequence of actions to take, and generalize to related but slightly different situations. This is the <i>learning</i> problem.</li></ul><p> Model-free RL methods explore by taking actions randomly. If, by chance, the random actions lead to a reward, they are reinforced, and the agent becomes more likely to take these beneficial actions in the future. This works well if rewards are dense enough for random actions to lead to a reward with reasonable probability. However, many of the more complicated games require long sequences of very specific actions to experience any reward, and such sequences are extremely unlikely to occur randomly.</p><p> A classic example of this problem was observed in the video game Montezuma&#39;s revenge where the agent&#39;s objective was to find a key, but there were many intermediate steps required to find it. In order to solve such long term planning problems researchers have tried adding extra terms or components to the reward function to encourage desired behavior or discourage undesired behavior. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/biuautsdvf0oduy39xuk"></p><p> Source: OpenAI (Jul 2018) “<a href="https://openai.com/research/learning-montezumas-revenge-from-a-single-demonstration"><i><u>Learning Montezuma&#39;s Revenge from a single demonstration</u></i></a> ”</p><p> The goal of reward shaping is to make the learning process more efficient by providing informative rewards that guide the agent towards the desired outcomes. Reward shaping involves providing additional rewards to the agent for making progress towards the desired goal. By shaping the rewards, the agent receives more frequent and meaningful feedback, which can help it learn more efficiently. Reward shaping can be particularly useful in scenarios where the original reward function is sparse, meaning that the agent receives little or no feedback until it reaches the final goal. However, it is important to design reward shaping carefully to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p> Reward shaping algorithms often assume hand-crafted and domain-specific shaping functions, constructed by subject matter experts, which runs contrary to the aim of autonomous learning. Moreover, poor choices of shaping rewards can worsen the agent&#39;s performance.</p><p> Poorly designed reward shaping can lead to the agent optimizing for the shaped rewards rather than the true rewards, resulting in suboptimal behavior. Examples of this are provided in the subsequent sections on reward hacking.</p><h2> 3.3: Reward Hacking</h2><p> <i>Reward hacking occurs when an AI agent finds ways to exploit loopholes or shortcuts in the environment to maximize its reward without actually achieving the intended goal.</i></p><p> Specification gaming is the general framing for the problem when an AI system finds a way to achieve the objective in an unintended way. Specification gaming can happen in many kinds of ML models. Reward hacking is a specific occurrence of a specification gaming failure in RL systems that function on reward-based mechanisms.</p><p> Reward hacking and reward misspecification are related concepts but have distinct meanings. Reward misspecification refers to the situation where the specified reward function does not accurately capture the true objective or desired behavior.</p><p> Rewards hacking does not always require reward misspecification. It is not necessarily true that a perfectly specified reward (which completely and accurately captures the desired behavior of the system) is impossible to hack. There can also be buggy or corrupted implementations which will have unintended behaviors. The point of a reward function is to boil a complicated system down to a single value. This will pretty much always involve simplifications etc., which will then be slightly different from what you&#39;re describing. The map is not the territory.</p><p> Reward hacking can manifest in a myriad of ways. For instance, in the context of game-playing agents, it might involve exploiting software glitches or bugs to directly manipulate the score or gain high rewards through unintended means.</p><p> As a concrete example, one agent in the Coast Runners game was trained with the objective of winning the race. The game uses a score mechanism, so in order to progress to the next level the reward designers used reward shaping to reward the system when it scored points. These were given when a boat gets items (such as the green blocks in the animation below) or accomplishes other actions that presumably would help it win the race. Despite being given intermediate rewards, the overall intended goal was to finish the race as quickly as possible. The developers thought the best way to get a high score was to win the race but it was not the case. The agent discovered that continuously rotating a ship in a circle to accumulate points indefinitely optimized its reward, even though it did not help it win the race. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/qjanshlbug21zqvkp4ez"></p><p> Source: Amodei &amp; Clark (2016) “ <a href="https://openai.com/research/faulty-reward-functions"><u>Faulty reward functions in the wild</u></a> &quot;</p><p> In cases where the reward function misaligns with the desired objective, reward hacking can emerge. This can lead the agent to optimize a proxy reward, deviating from the true underlying goal, thereby yielding behavior contrary to the designers&#39; intentions. As an example of something that might happen in a real-world scenario consider a cleaning robot: if the reward function focuses on reducing mess, the robot might artificially create a mess to clean up, thereby collecting rewards, instead of effectively cleaning the environment.</p><p> Reward hacking presents significant challenges to AI safety due to the potential for unintended and potentially harmful behavior. As a result, combating reward hacking remains an active research area in AI safety and alignment.</p><p> Here is are some videos showcasing some examples of specification gaming. </p><figure class="media"><div data-oembed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKJlF-olKmg"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKJlF-olKmg" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></figure><h2> 3.4: Reward Tampering</h2><ul><li> Victoria Krakovna et. al. (Mar 2021) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04734"><u>Reward Tampering Problems and Solutions</u></a></li></ul><p> <i>Reward tampering refers to instances where an AI agent inappropriately influences or manipulates the reward process itself.</i></p><p> The problem of getting some intended task done can be split into:</p><ul><li> Designing an agent that is good at optimizing reward, and,</li><li> Designing a reward process that provides the agent with suitable rewards. The reward process can be understood by breaking it down even further. The process includes:<ul><li> An implemented reward function</li><li> A mechanism for collecting appropriate sensory data as input</li><li> A way for the user to potentially update the reward function.</li></ul></li></ul><p> Reward tampering involves the agent interfering with various parts of this reward process. An agent might distort the feedback received from the reward model, altering the information used to update its behavior. It could also manipulate the reward model&#39;s implementation, altering the code or hardware to change reward computations. In some cases, agents engaging in reward tampering may even directly modify the reward values before processing in the machine register. Depending on what exactly is being tampered with we get various degrees of reward tampering. These can be distinguished from the image below. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/ogajkyybxz0rudhyza64"></p><p> Source: Leo Gao (Nov 2022) “<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/REesy8nqvknFFKywm/clarifying-wireheading-terminology"><u>Clarifying wireheading terminology</u></a> ”</p><p> <i><u>Reward function input tampering</u> interferes only with the inputs to the reward function. Eg interfering with the sensors.</i></p><p> <i><u>Reward function tampering</u> involves the agent changing the reward function itself.</i></p><p> <i><u>Wireheading</u> refers to the behavior of a system that manipulates or corrupts its own internal structure by tampering directly with the RL algorithm itself, eg by changing the register values.</i></p><p> Reward tampering is concerning because it is hypothesized that tampering with the reward process will often arise as an instrumental goal (Bostrom, 2014; Omohundro, 2008). This can lead to weakening or breaking the relationship between the observed reward and the intended task. This is an ongoing research direction. Research papers such as “ <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12064"><u>Advanced Artificial Agents Intervene in the Provision of reward</u></a> ” (August 2022) by Hutter et al. seek to provide a more detailed analysis of such subjects.</p><p> A hypothesized existing example of reward tampering can be seen in recommendation-based algorithms used in social media. These algorithms influence their users&#39; emotional state to generate more &#39;likes&#39; (Russell, 2019). The intended task was to serve useful or engaging content, but this is being achieved by tampering with human emotional perceptions, and thereby changing what would be considered useful. Assuming the capabilities of systems continue to increase through either computational or algorithmic advances, it is plausible to expect reward tampering problems to become increasingly common. Therefore, reward tampering is a potential concern that requires much more research and empirical verification.</p><p> Here are some videos to help understand the concept of reward hacking. The videos conflate hacking and tampering in some place however they are still excellent explanations. </p><figure class="media"><div data-oembed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qDfT8pENs"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/92qDfT8pENs" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></figure><figure class="media"><div data-oembed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46nsTFfsBuc"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/46nsTFfsBuc" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></figure><h1> 4.0: Learning from imitation</h1><p> The preceding sections have underscored the significance of reward misspecification for the alignment of future artificial intelligence. The next few sections will explore various attempts and proposals formulated to tackle this issue, commencing with an intuitive approach – learning the appropriate reward function through human behavior observation and imitation, rather than manual creation by the designers.</p><h2> 4.1: Imitation Learning (IL)</h2><p> <i>Imitation learning entails the process of learning via the observation of an expert&#39;s actions and replicating their behavior.</i></p><p> Unlike reinforcement learning (RL), which derives a policy for a system&#39;s actions based on its interaction outcomes with the environment, imitation learning aspires to learn a policy through the observation of another agent interacting with the environment. Imitation learning is the general term for the class of algorithms that learn through imitation. Following is a table that distinguishes various machine learning based methods. SL = Supervised learning; UL = Unsupervised learning; RL = Reinforcement Learning; IL = Imitation Learning. IL reduces RL to SL. IL + RL is a promising area. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/qx8s74nyevz3vdql9kam"></p><p> Source: Emma Brunskill (Winter 2022) “ <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/CS234Win2022/modules.html"><u>Stanford CS234 : RL</u></a> - Lecture 1”</p><p> IL can be implemented through behavioral cloning (BC), procedural cloning (PC) , inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL), generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), etc…</p><p> One instance of this process&#39;s application is in the training of modern large language models (LLMs). LLMs, after training as general-purpose text generators, often undergo fine-tuning for instruction following through imitation learning, using the example of a human expert who follows instructions provided as text prompts and completions.</p><p> In the context of safety and alignment, imitation learning is favored over direct reinforcement to alleviate specification gaming issues. This problem emerges when the programmers overlook or fail to anticipate certain edge cases or unusual ways of achieving a task in the specific environment. The presumption is that demonstrating behavior, compared to RL, would be simpler and safer, as the model would not only attain the objective but also fulfill it as the expert demonstrator explicitly intends. However, this is not an infallible solution, and its limitations will be discussed in later sections.<br></p><h2> 4.2: Behavioral Cloning (BC)</h2><p> <i>Behavioral cloning involves collecting observations of an expert demonstrator proficient at the underlying task, and using supervised learning (SL) to guide an agent to &#39;imitate&#39; the demonstrated behavior.</i></p><p> Behavioral cloning is one way in which we can implement imitation learning (IL). There are also other ways such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), or cooperative inverse reinforcement Learning (CIRL). Unlike IRL, the goal behind behavioral cloning as a machine learning (ML) method is to replicate the demonstrator&#39;s behavior as closely as possible, regardless of what the demonstrator&#39;s goals might be.</p><p> Self-driving cars can serve as a simplistic illustration of how behavioral cloning operates. A human demonstrator (driver) is directed to operate a car, during which data about the environment state from sensors like lidar and cameras, along with the actions taken by the demonstrator, are collected. These actions can include wheel movements, gear use, etc. This creates a dataset comprising (state, action) pairs. Subsequently, supervised learning is used to train a prediction model, which attempts to predict an action for any future environment state. For instance, the model might output a specific steering wheel and gear configuration based on the camera feed. When the model achieves sufficient accuracy, it can be stated that the human driver&#39;s behavior has been &#39;cloned&#39; into a machine via learning. Hence, the term behavioral cloning.</p><p> The following points highlight several potential issues that might surface when employing behavioral cloning:</p><ul><li> <strong>Confident incorrectness</strong> : During the demonstrations, the human experts have some amount of background knowledge that they rely on, which is not taught to the model. For example, when training an LLM to have conversations using behavioral cloning, the human demonstrator might less frequently ask certain questions because they are considered &#39;common sense&#39;. A model trained to imitate will copy both - the types of questions asked in conversation, as well as, the frequency with which they are asked. Humans already possess this background knowledge, but an LLM doesn&#39;t. This means that to have the same level of information as a human, the model should ask some questions more frequently to fill the gaps in its knowledge. But since the model seeks to imitate, it will stick to the low frequency demonstrated by the human and thus has strictly less information overall than the demonstrator for the same conversational task. Despite this dearth of knowledge, we expect it to be able to perform as a clone and reach human-level performance. This means in order to reach human performance on less than human knowledge it will resort to &#39;making up facts&#39; that help it reach its performance goals. These &#39;hallucinations&#39; will then be presented during the conversation, with the same level of confidence as all the other information. Hallucinations and confident incorrectness is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15025.pdf"><u>an empirically verified problem</u></a> in many LLMs including GPT-2 and 3, and raises obvious concerns for AI safety.</li><li> <strong>Underachieving</strong> : The types of hallucinations mentioned above arose because the model knew too little. However, the model can also know too much. If the model knows more than the human demonstrator because it is able to find more patterns in the environment state that it is given, it will throw away that information and reduce its performance to match human level. This is because it is trained as a &#39;clone&#39;. Ideally, we don&#39;t want the model dumbing itself down or not disclosing useful new patterns in data just because it is trying to be humanlike or perform at a human level. This is another problem that will have to be addressed if behavioral cloning continues to be used as an ML technique.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2> 4.3: Procedural Cloning (PC)</h2><ul><li> Mengjiao Yang et. al. (May 2022) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10816"><u>Chain of Thought Imitation with Procedure Cloning</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> <i>Procedure cloning (PC) extends behavioral cloning (BC) by not just imitating the demonstrators outputs but also imitating the complete sequence of intermediate computations associated with an expert&#39;s procedure.</i></p><p> In BC, the agent learns to map states directly to actions by discarding the intermediate search outputs. On the other hand, the PC approach learns the entire sequence of intermediate computations, including branches and backtracks, during training. During inference, PC generates a sequence of intermediate search outcomes that mimic the expert&#39;s search procedure before outputting the final action.</p><p> The main difference between PC and BC lies in the information they utilize. BC only has access to expert state-action pairs as demonstrations, while PC also has access to the intermediate computations that generated those state-action pairs. PC learns to predict the complete series of intermediate computation outcomes, enabling it to generalize better to test environments with different configurations compared to alternative improvements over BC. PC&#39;s ability to imitate the expert&#39;s search procedure allows it to capture the underlying reasoning and decision-making process, leading to improved performance in various tasks.</p><p> A limitation of PC is the computational overhead compared to BC, as PC needs to predict intermediate procedures. Additionally, the choice of how to encode the expert&#39;s algorithm into a form suitable for PC is left to the practitioner, which may require some trial-and-error in designing the ideal computation sequence.<br></p><h2> 4.4: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)</h2><p> <i>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) represents a form of machine learning wherein an artificial intelligence observes the behavior of another agent within a particular environment, typically an expert human, and endeavors to discern the reward function without its explicit definition.</i> </p><figure class="media"><div data-oembed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7uGyBcIeII"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7uGyBcIeII" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></figure><p> IRL is typically employed when a reward function is too intricate to define programmatically, or when AI agents need to react robustly to sudden environmental changes necessitating a modification in the reward function for safety. For instance, consider an AI agent learning to execute a backflip. Humans, dogs, and Boston Dynamics robots can all perform backflips, but the manner in which they do so varies significantly depending on their physiology, their incentives, and their current location, all of which can be highly diverse in the real world. An AI agent learning backflips purely through trial and error across a wide range of body types and locations, without something to observe, might prove highly inefficient.</p><p> IRL, therefore, does not necessarily imply that an AI mimics other agents&#39; behavior, since AI researchers may anticipate the AI agent to devise more efficient ways to maximize the discovered reward function. Nevertheless, IRL does assume that the observed agent behaves transparently enough for an AI agent to accurately identify their actions, and what success constitutes. This means that IRL endeavors to discover the reward functions that &#39;explain&#39; the demonstrations. This should not be conflated with imitation learning where the primary interest is a policy capable of generating the observed demonstrations. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/k4eolj8ibrm3bbueywno"></p><p> Source: <a href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3508/1*rZoO-azxiEH3viQao8NcAA.png"><u>Link</u></a></p><p> IRL constitutes both a machine learning method, since it can be employed when specifying a reward function is excessively challenging, and a machine learning problem, as an AI agent may settle on an inaccurate reward function or utilize unsafe and misaligned methods to achieve it.</p><p> One of the limitations to this approach is that IRL algorithms presume that the observed behavior is optimal, an assumption that arguably proves too robust when dealing with human demonstrations. Another problem is that the IRL problem is ill-posed as every policy is optimal for the null reward. For most behavioral observations, multiple fitting reward functions exist. This set of solutions often includes many degenerate solutions, which assign zero rewards to all states.</p><h2> 4.5: Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL)</h2><ul><li> Stuart Russell et. al. (Nov 2016) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137"><u>Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> CIRL (Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning) is an extension of the IRL (Inverse Reinforcement Learning) framework. IRL is a learning approach that aims to infer the underlying reward function of an expert by observing their behavior. It assumes that the expert&#39;s behavior is optimal and tries to learn a reward function that explains their actions.  CIRL, on the other hand, is an interactive form of IRL that addresses two major weaknesses of conventional IRL.</p><p> First, Instead of simply copying the human reward function CIRL is formulated as a learning process. It is an interactive reward maximization process, where the human functions as a teacher and provides feedback (in the form of rewards) on the agent&#39;s actions. This allows the human to nudge the AI agent towards behavioral patterns that align with their preferences. The second weakness of conventional IRL is that it assumes the human behaves optimally, which limits the teaching behaviors that can be considered. CIRL addresses this weakness by allowing for a variety of teaching behaviors and interactions between the human and the AI agent. It enables the AI agent to learn not only what actions to take but also how and why to take them, by observing and interacting with the human.</p><p> CIRL has been studied as a potential approach to AI alignment, particularly in scenarios where deep learning may not scale to AGI. However, opinions on the potential effectiveness of CIRL vary, with some researchers expecting it to be helpful if deep learning doesn&#39;t scale to AGI, while others have a higher probability of deep learning scaling to AGI.</p><p> Here is a video that talks about CIRL as a possible solution to the &quot;stop button problem&quot; that was presented in the previous chapter. </p><figure class="media"><div data-oembed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nktr1MgS-A"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nktr1MgS-A" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></figure><p></p><h2> 4.6: The (Easy) Goal Inference Problem</h2><ul><li> Christiano, Paul (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/h9DesGT3WT9u2k7Hr/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard"><u>The easy goal inference problem is still hard</u></a> ”</li></ul><p><br> <i>The <strong>goal inference problem</strong> refers to the task of inferring the goals or intentions of an agent based on their observed behavior or actions.</i></p><p> This final section builds upon the limitations highlighted in previous sections to introduce the Goal Inference problem, and it&#39;s simpler subset - the easy goal inference problem. Imitation learning based approaches, generally follows these steps:</p><ol><li> Observe the user&#39;s actions and statements.</li><li> Deduce the user&#39;s preferences.</li><li> Endeavor to enhance the world according to the user&#39;s preferences, possibly collaborating with the user and seeking clarification as needed.</li></ol><p> The merit of this method is that we can immediately start constructing systems that are driven by observed user behavior. However, as a consequence of this approach, we run into the goal inference problem. This refers to the task of inferring the goals or intentions of an agent based on their observed behavior or actions. It involves determining what the agent is trying to achieve or what their desired outcome is. The goal inference problem is challenging because agents may act sub-optimally or fail to achieve their goals, making it difficult to accurately infer their true intentions. Traditional approaches to goal inference often assume that agents act optimally or exhibit simplified forms of sub-optimality, which may not capture the complexity of real-world planning and decision-making. Therefore, the goal inference problem requires accounting for the difficulty of planning itself and the possibility of sub-optimal or failed plans.</p><p> However, it also optimistically presumes that we can depict a human as a somewhat rational agent, which might not always hold. The easy goal inference problem is a simplified version of the goal inference problem.</p><p> <i>The <strong>easy goal inference problem</strong> involves finding a reasonable representation or approximation of what a human wants, given complete access to the human&#39;s policy or behavior in any situation.</i></p><p> This version of the problem assumes no algorithmic limitations and focuses on extracting the true values that the human is imperfectly optimizing. However, even this simplified version of the problem remains challenging, and little progress has been made on the general case. The easy goal inference problem is related to the goal inference problem because it highlights the difficulty of accurately inferring human goals or intentions, even in simplified scenarios. While narrow domains with simple decisions can be solved using existing approaches, more complex tasks such as designing a city or setting policies require addressing the challenges of modeling human mistakes and sub-optimal behavior. Therefore, the easy goal inference problem serves as a starting point to understand the broader goal inference problem and the additional complexities it entails.</p><p> Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is effective in modeling and imitating human experts. However, for many significant applications, we desire AI systems that can make decisions surpassing even the experts. In such cases, the accuracy of the model isn&#39;t the sole criterion because a perfectly accurate model would merely lead us to replicate human behavior and not transcend it.</p><p> This necessitates an explicit model of errors or bounded rationality, which will guide the AI on how to improve or be &quot;smarter,&quot; and which aspects of the human policy it should discard. Nonetheless, this remains an exceedingly challenging problem as humans are not primarily rational with a bit of added noise. Hence, constructing any model of mistakes is just as complex as building a comprehensive model of human behavior. A critical question we face is: How do we determine the quality of a model when accuracy can no longer be our reliable measure? How can we distinguish between good and bad decisions?</p><h1> 5.0: Learning from feedback</h1><p> This section discusses yet more attempts to address the reward misspecification problem. At times, the intended behavior is so intricate that demonstration-based learning becomes untenable. An alternative approach is to offer feedback to the agent instead of providing either manually specified reward functions or even expert demonstrations. This section delves into feedback-based strategies such as Reward Modeling, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), also known as Reinforcement Learning from Constitutional AI (RLCAI) or simply Constitutional AI.</p><h2> 5.1: Reward Modeling</h2><ul><li> DeepMind (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07871"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> Reward modeling was developed to apply reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world problems where designing a reward function is difficult, in part because humans don&#39;t have a perfect understanding of every objective. In reward modeling, human assistants evaluate the outcomes of AI behavior, without needing to know how to perform or demonstrate the task optimally themselves. This is similar to how you can tell if a dish is cooked well by tasting it even if you do not know how to cook, and thus your feedback can be used by a chef to learn how to cook better. This technique separates the RL alignment problem into two separate halves: Understanding intentions, ie learning the &#39;What?&#39;, and Acting to achieve the intentions, ie learning the &#39;How?&#39;. This means that in the modeling agenda, there are two different ML models:</p><ul><li> A reward model is trained with user feedback. This model learns to predict what humans would consider good behavior.</li><li> An agent trained with RL, where the reward for the agent is determined by the outputs of the reward model </li></ul><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/hzepfc9kuxzytm5iemjm"></p><p> Source: DeepMind (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a> ”</p><p> Overall, while promising reward modeling can still fall prey to reward misspecification and reward hacking failures. Obtaining accurate and comprehensive feedback can be challenging, and human evaluators may have limited knowledge or biases that can impact the quality of the feedback. Additionally, any reward functions learnt through modeling might also struggle to generalize to new situations or environments that differ from the training data. These are all discussed further using concrete examples in later sections.</p><p> Here is a video that explains the concept of reward modeling. </p><figure class="media"><div data-oembed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYylPRX6z4Q"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYylPRX6z4Q" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></figure><p> There are also some variants of reward modeling such as:</p><ul><li> <strong><u>Narrow reward modeling</u></strong> is a specific flavor of reward modeling where the focus is on training AI systems to accomplish specific tasks rather than trying to determine the &quot;true human utility function&quot;. It aims to learn reward functions to achieve particular objectives, rather than seeking a comprehensive understanding of human values.</li><li> <strong><u>Recursive reward modeling</u></strong> seeks to introduce scalability to the technique. In recursive reward modeling, the focus is on decomposing a complex task into simpler subtasks and using reward modeling at each level to train agents that can perform those subtasks. This hierarchical structure allows for more efficient training and credit assignment, as well as the exploration of novel solutions that may not be apparent to humans. This is shown in the diagram below. Scalable oversight will be covered in greater depth in future chapters. </li></ul><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/xclvo4btaebz0ondwane"></p><p> Source: DeepMind (Nov 2018) “ <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a> ”</p><p> The general reward modeling framework forms the basis for other feedback based techniques such as RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) which is discussed in the next section.</p><h2> 5.2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</h2><ul><li> Christiano, Paul et. al. (Feb 2023) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741"><u>Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a method developed by OpenAI. It&#39;s a crucial part of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety"><u>their strategy</u></a> to create AIs that are both safe and aligned with human values. A prime example of an AI trained with RLHF is OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT.</p><p> Earlier in this chapter, the reader was asked to consider the reward design problem for manually defining a reward function to get an agent to perform a backflip. This section considers the RLHF solution to this design problem. RLHF addresses this problem as follows: A human is initially shown two instances of an AI&#39;s backflip attempts, then the human selects which one appears more like a backflip, and finally, the AI is updated accordingly. By repeating this process thousands of times, we can guide the AI to perform actual backflips. </p><figure class="table"><table style="background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);border:0px solid hsl(0, 0%, 100%)"><tbody><tr><td style="border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);border-style:solid"><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:92.48%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/wcjfdzcx4cnnfi5ruu66"></figure></td><td style="border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);border-style:solid"><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/hl6oecj6eg1hrjffpnbh"></figure></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> Source: OpenAI (2017) “ <a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/"><u>Learning from human preferences</u></a> ”</p><p> In the image on the left, RLHF learned to backflip using around 900 individual bits of feedback from the human evaluator. In the image on the right the authors point out that manual reward crafting took two hours to write a custom reward function for a robot to perform a backflip. While it was successful, it was significantly less elegant than the one trained purely through human feedback.</p><p> Similar to designing a reward function that efficiently rewards proper backflips, it is hard to specify precisely what it means to generate safe or helpful text. This served as some of the motivation behind making RLHF integral to the training of some current Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p> Although training sequences may vary slightly across organizations, most labs adhere to the general framework of pre-training followed by some form of fine-tuning. Observing the InstructGPT training process offers insight into a possible path for training LLMs. The steps include: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/e3019jiopfofiu1pm6ms"></p><p> Source: OpenAI (Jan 2022) “ <a href="https://openai.com/research/instruction-following"><u>Aligning language models to follow instructions</u></a> ”</p><ul><li> <strong>Step 0:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_supervision#Semi-supervised_learning"><strong><u>Semi-Supervised</u></strong></a> <strong>Generative Pre-training:</strong> The LLM is initially trained using a massive amount of internet text data, where the task is to predict the next word in a natural language context.</li><li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"><strong><u>Supervised</u></strong></a> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning"><strong><u>Fine-tuning</u></strong></a> <strong>:</strong> A fine-tuning dataset is created by presenting a prompt to a human and asking them to write a response.

The effectiveness of an algorithm heavily relies on the human evaluator&#39;s intuition about what constitutes the correct behavior. If the human lacks a thorough understanding of the task, they may not provide beneficial feedback. Further, in certain domains, our system might lead to agents developing policies that deceive the evaluators. For instance, a robot intended to grasp objects merely positioned its manipulator between the camera and the object, making it seem as if it was executing the task as shown below. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/bxqftcwt4mj5meowwma5"></p><p> Source: Christiano et al (2017) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf"><u>Deep Reinforcement Learning From Human Preferences</u></a> ”</p><p> Here is a video version, explaining the basics of RLHF in ChatGPT. </p><figure class="media"><div data-oembed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBH2nImUM5c"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBH2nImUM5c" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></figure><h2> 5.3: Pretraining with Human Feedback (PHF)</h2><ul><li> Tomasz Korbak et. al. (Feb 2023) “ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741"><u>Pretraining Language Models with Human Preferences</u></a> ”</li></ul><p> In standard pretraining, the language model attempts to learn parameters such that they maximize the likelihood of the training data. However, this also includes undesirable content such as falsehoods, offensive language, and private information. The concept of Pretraining with human feedback (PHF) utilizes the reward modeling methodology in the pretraining phase. The authors of the paper found that PHF works much better than the standard practice of only using feedback (RLHF) after pretraining.</p><p> In PHF the training data is scored using a reward function, such as a toxic text classifier, to guide the language model to learn from undesirable content while avoiding imitating it during inference time.</p><p> Similar to RLHF, PHF does not completely solve reward hacking, however, it might move the systems one small step closer. These methods can be further extended by employing AI assistants to aid humans in providing more effective feedback. Some aspects of this strategy are introduced in the next section but will be explored in further detail in the chapters on scalable and adversarial oversight methods.</p><h2> 5.4. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)</h2><p> <i>Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is a framework involving the training of an AI agent to learn from the feedback given by another AI system.</i></p><p> RLAIF also known as RLCAI (Reinforcement Learning on Constitutional AI) or simply Constitutional AI, was <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution"><u>developed by Anthropic</u></a> . A central component of Constitutional AI is the constitution, a set of human-written principles that the AI is expected to adhere to, such as &quot;Choose the least threatening or aggressive response&quot;. Anthropic&#39;s AI assistant Claude&#39;s constitution incorporates principles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Apple&#39;s Terms of Service, Deepmind&#39;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14375"><u>Sparrow Principles</u></a> , and more. Constitutional AI begins with an AI trained primarily for helpfulness and subsequently trains it for harmlessness in two stages:</p><ul><li> <strong>Stage 1:</strong> The AI continuously critiques and refines its own responses to harmful prompts. For instance, if we ask the AI for advice on building bombs and it responds with a bomb tutorial, we then ask the AI to revise the response in accordance with a randomly selected constitutional principle. The AI is then trained to generate outputs more similar to these revised responses. This stage&#39;s primary objective is to facilitate the second stage.</li><li> <strong>Stage 2:</strong> We use the AI, fine-tuned from stage 1, to produce pairs of alternative responses to harmful prompts. The AI then rates each pair according to a randomly selected constitutional principle. This results in AI-generated preferences for harmlessness, which we blend with human preferences for helpfulness to ensure the AI doesn&#39;t lose its ability to be helpful. The final step is to train the AI to create responses that closely resemble the preferred responses.</li></ul><p> Anthropic&#39;s experiments indicate that AIs trained with Constitutional Reinforcement Learning are significantly safer (in the sense of less offensive and less likely to give you potentially harmful information) while maintaining the same level of helpfulness compared to AIs trained with RLHF. While Constitutional AI does share some issues with RLHF concerning robustness, it also promises better scalability due to its reduced reliance on human supervision.
