PM GMT<br/><br/><p>理查德·罗德斯 (Richard Rhodes) 的<i>《原子弹的制造》</i><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-artificial-intelligence/"><u>最近在人工智能界引起了广泛关注</u></a>，值得一读。我明白为什么开发人工智能的人觉得它特别有趣，因为其中很多都是关于做科学和工程并思考后果，但从我作为从事人工智能治理的人的角度来看，最强大的东西是在最后几章随着科学家和政策制定者开始努力应对这种新武器对全球政治的巨大影响。</p><p> Rhodes（按时间顺序）的第一个后续作品<i>《暗日：原子弹的制造</i>》对于思考新兴技术治理更加有用，对于关注治理的读者来说，我可能比<i>TMOTAB</i>更强烈地推荐它。</p><p>然而，直到我开始阅读我的第三本罗德大部头<i>《愚蠢的军火库：核军备竞赛的形成》后，我</i>才真正开始在听有声读物时做笔记。 <i>AOF</i>可能不像其前辈那样适用于人工智能治理，因为它主要关注核武器已经存在了几十年的时代，而不是核武器作为一项新技术和变革性技术的时代，但它仍然有很多有趣的细节，并且我想通过将我的笔记发布到论坛上，可以让你们中的一些人免去寻找它们的麻烦。 （不幸的是，因为我有声读物，所以我没有页码。）</p><p>我还在附录中列出了我过去几个月阅读的核/冷战文章中的其他很酷的发现。</p><h3>盖尔曼警告</h3><ul><li>在我说出其余的事实之前，我应该指出，我对罗兹的一些分析抱有一些“盖尔曼怀疑论” <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefy0nziu9mwe"><sup><a href="#fny0nziu9mwe">[1]</a></sup></span> 。大多数情况下，在他关于核武器名义上的愚蠢的日益强烈的言论中，他对核武器有利的通常情况提出了相当值得怀疑的反驳。他引用了雅采克·库格勒 (Jacek Kugler) 的<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/174059">论文</a>，该论文认为，在柏林空运、越南战争、入侵美国等冷战冲突样本中，有核国家似乎无法将其政策目标强加于无核武装国家。匈牙利等。正如库格勒声称的那样，拥有核武器的国家在这些冲突中失败的次数与获胜的次数一样多，这一点乍一看似乎令人惊讶。但这忽略了利益冲突首先成为实际争端的巨大选择偏差。似乎（或者至少有可能！）许多本来会成为无核国家之间争端的事情在这个过程中很早就得到了解决——无核武器国家只是懒得挑衅——而且如果没有核武器，实际发生的争端将是完全无可争议的。</li><li>虽然罗兹在结论中认为军备竞赛的机会成本非常高，但他引用了经济学家西摩·梅尔曼的另一个疯狂主张：军费开支本可以用于国内投资，并且“根据一些[未具体说明]的粗略估计”，一美元的边际投资可以“永久增加 20-25 美分的年产量”。这意味着资本回报率>;20%，这似乎非常高，并且与实际的历史回报率完全不相容<span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefbzqejvkmzal"><sup><a href="#fnbzqejvkmzal">[2]</a></sup></span> 。所以当他试图缩小范围并看看后果时，他确实很容易出现这种夸张，这有点令人失望。</li></ul><p>带着这样的免责声明，我们对这一切持保留态度：</p><h3><i>愚蠢的军火库</i>笔记</h3><ul><li>这本书以关于切尔诺贝利的一章开始（出于某种原因）。苏联工业不够先进，无法制造西方和日本核电站使用的那种保护壳，因此他们伪造了事故风险估计——即使是在工程学生将学到的官方数据中也是如此。部分原因是，苏联<i>在切尔诺贝利事故之前发生了至少 13 起严重的反应堆事故</i>。</li><li>我通常认为古巴导弹危机主要导致军备控制和缓和，但罗兹指出，这对于苏联决定加大军事投资至关重要。在同意从古巴撤走导弹后，苏联谈判代表告诉美国谈判代表：“好吧，麦克洛伊先生，我们将遵守这项协议，但我想告诉你一件事：你永远不会再这样对我们了。”事实上，随之而来的是长达 25 年的大规模军备建设，军费开支通常占国民生产总值的 40% 左右，“苏联军工联合体”成为主导政治力量。</li><li>法国历史人口学家伊曼纽尔·托德（Emmanuel Todd）准确地推断出一系列人口、政治和经济趋势，以预测苏联的解体 — — 令人印象深刻的是，他预测东欧国家将出现非暴力分裂 — — “在 10 年、20 年、或30年”在一本70年代中期出版的书中。但西方的“苏联学家”拒绝了这一说法，认为这是天真的猜测，部分原因是他们自己的影响力立场依赖于对苏联统治的持续恐惧。</li><li>显然，罗纳德·里根可能是在 1967 年访问劳伦斯·利弗莫尔国家实验室时从爱德华·泰勒（ <i>TMOTAB、《暗日》</i>和电影<i>《奥本海默》</i>中最喜欢的超级反派）那里得到了<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative">战略防御计划</a>——“星球大战”的想法。</li><li>里根对 SDI 非常着迷，但令罗兹和这位读者沮丧的是，里根似乎并没有仔细考虑过它的细节。他不明白 SDI 危险的博弈论原因——也就是说，它打破了 MAD 并激励先发制人的打击——而且他没有考虑过它们如何无法阻止不是弹道导弹的核武器（从轰炸机上投下或附加的）海射巡航导弹）。与此同时，他继续向自己的谈判代表坚持认为，唯一可以接受的目标是战略防御计划和废除核武器。</li><li>里根和戈尔巴乔夫于 1985 年在日内瓦首次会面，产生了一些有趣的轶事，例如：戈尔巴乔夫为重新评估两国关系提出了强有力的理论和战略案例。里根主要阅读带有里根经典格言的提示卡，例如“制造军备的不是人民，而是政府”和“人们在互相交谈时不会遇到麻烦，而是在谈论彼此时遇到麻烦。”戈尔巴乔夫说，这到底是什么，我们能谈谈任何实质性的事情吗？</li><li>里根和戈尔巴乔夫关于SDI的争论令人难以置信地重复，而戈尔巴乔夫的观点似乎并没有传达给里根。戈尔巴乔夫开始预测里根会说的确切话语：最喜欢的包括“信任但验证”的俄文翻译以及 SDI 和防毒面具之间的类比（例如，“尽管我们禁止化学武器，但各国仍保留着防毒面具”）。戈尔巴乔夫似乎反对它，主要理由是之前达成的将武器排除在太空之外的协议太重要了。</li><li>里根的工作人员了解到，让他这个前好莱坞演员学习的最简单的方法就是看电影。他们不再撰写有关他即将会见的外国领导人的简报，而是让五角大楼的任何部门制作有关他们的传记短片（可以理解的是，他的工作人员也更喜欢简报）。里根在观看美国广播公司 (ABC) 的一部描述核战争后果的电影<i>《后天》</i>后尤其感动。他在日记中多次写到这一点，这大大增强了他减少核风险的决心。</li><li>据说里根热衷于原教旨主义和边缘神秘的东西。根据罗兹的说法，里根至少有过这样的预言：当美国击败苏联时，可能会发生狂喜——结果却发现<i>美国的</i>魅力领袖是<i>魔鬼</i>，届时耶稣会回来打败他。 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/05/04/not-swayed-by-astrology-reagan-says/135516d5-7f99-4a43-90a0-8eba244a8426/"><u>他可能在他妻子的占星家认为是偶然的特定日期和时间签署了《中程核力量条约》</u></a> 。他对 SDI 的痴迷似乎在这种充满象征意义的世界观中更容易解释（除了罗德所描述的美国永远不必谈判的幻想）。戈尔巴乔夫声称里根告诉他“我不知道你是否相信转世，但对我来说，我想知道也许在前世，我是盾牌的发明者”，法国总统弗朗索瓦·密特朗告诉他里根对转世的热情SDI“比理性更神秘”。不过，值得注意的是，里根在减少核战争威胁方面取得进展的愿望异常真诚和雄心勃勃，尽管罗德将其描绘成一个近乎漫画式的鹰派和操纵性内阁。</li><li> 1986年，戈尔巴乔夫和里根在雷克雅未克差点同意到<i>1996年消除所有核武器</i>，但两人都无法放过SDI问题。它实际上可以归结为一个词：苏联语言将 SDI 限制在“<i>实验室</i>测试”长达 10 年，而里根的顾问（可能是错误的）告诉他，这会杀死该项目（该项目几乎没有进入实验室测试），而他拒绝放弃。考虑到戈尔巴乔夫削减军费开支和重塑苏联国际面貌的决心，特别是考虑到 SDI 的技术挑战（以及里根一再提出分享苏联的技术，戈尔巴乔夫对此表示怀疑，这是可以理解的）。看来这主要是由于戈尔巴乔夫在国内面临的政治限制：他已经将建制派推向了相当远的距离，如果不取消战略防御计划而一路废除核武器，他可能会被一个更加强硬的替代方案所取代。</li></ul><h3>我的一些收获</h3><p>这些大多相当明显，但通过<i>AOF</i>得到加强：</p><ul><li>事实证明，对技术风险的估计受到政治和经济压力的影响。</li><li>事实证明，当高层领导人对某个重要问题有深入的了解时，政策改变的可能性就更大；当他们对问题有深入了解时，政策改变的可能性也更大。</li><li>羞辱你的国家对手有时会让他们下定决心避免将来再次发生这种情况。</li><li>领导者以及与他们一起在场的人确实可以发挥作用。</li><li><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/27/the-geopolitics-of-empathy/"><u>同理心在国际关系中非常有用</u></a>。似乎许多冷战错误（例如<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83"><u>Able Archer 83</u></a> ，演习本身和苏联的过度反应）部分是由于将对方视为战略冷酷且基本上是邪恶的——含蓄地，“我们认为苏联主要在他们的作为美国主要地缘政治对手的能力，因此他们可能以同样的方式看待自己”——而不是另一种由具有混合动机的人类组成的异质政治体系。</li><li>即使是强大且意识形态强烈的国家领导人也<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs"><u>受到国内政治的约束</u></a>。</li><li>经济和人口驱动的外部观点有时会打败领域专家（ <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qZqvBLvR5hX9sEkjR/comparing-top-forecasters-and-domain-experts"><u>尽管总体上非常接近</u></a>）。</li></ul><h3>附录：相关书籍的要点/有趣的发现</h3><p><i>《愚蠢的军火库》</i>结束了由<i>TMOTAB</i>和<i>奥本海默</i>引起的长达数月的核/冷战书呆子狙击，所以我想我也应该在这篇文章中包括这些其他书中的一些发现。</p><ul><li>来自<i>TMOTAB</i> ：有一个令人难以置信的故事，（德国）维尔纳·海森堡和（丹麦）尼尔斯·玻尔在第二次世界大战正在进行时讨论了核弹的可能性。海森堡声称（战后）他打算与盟军科学家进行一些秘密协调，以减缓制造炸弹的努力，暗示德国的计划进展缓慢。玻尔认为海森堡试图获取有关盟军核努力的信息，甚至让玻尔与纳粹合作。如果海森堡说的是实话（大的“如果”），那么一位科学家为了协调国际经济放缓而试图清楚地传达他正在研究的技术因竞争压力而存在的风险，却被解读为愤世嫉俗的炒作。蔓延开来，引起了其他演员的更大恐慌，他们加倍努力，想先到达那里。</li><li>来自<i>《暗日》</i> ：当出现新的、可能真正具有颠覆性的技术时，即使<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheson%E2%80%93Lilienthal_Report"><u>不是特别激进的领导人也可能会接受激进的建议</u></a>（在核问题上，国际控制核供应链以阻止核扩散）。正如通用汽车副总裁 Harry Winne 所写：“[我们的提议]可能看起来过于激进、过于先进、远远超出了人类的经验。所有这些术语都特别适用于原子弹。”但<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/J7nmbqcWncPMZFhGC/want-to-make-a-difference-on-policy-and-governance-become-an"><u>细节确实很重要</u></a>，包括“如何验证该条约”和“供应链的这一部分真的是一个可以奠定国际治理基础的瓶颈吗？”</li><li>来自<i>《暗日》</i> ：当你的工作是针对可能发生的极其致命的事件制定战略时，很难避免<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fRo5urRznMzGJAwrE/on-missing-moods-and-tradeoffs"><u>情绪失控</u></a>和<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity"><u>范围不敏感</u></a>。从单一综合作战计划的维基百科页面来看，美国的核战争计划从1961年到2003年每年都会更新：<ul><li> SIOP-62的执行预计将导致苏联和中国2.85亿人死亡，4000万人伤亡。空军的托马斯·怀特 (Thomas D. White) 看到所有事实和数据后，发现该计划“非常棒”。如果不考虑人的因素，SIOP-62 代表了一项杰出的技术成就：“SIOP-62 代表了战争规划史上的技术胜利。在不到十五年的时间里，美国掌握了各种复杂的技术，并获得了在一天之内摧毁敌人大部分军事能力和大陆上大部分人类居住地的能力。” [注： <i>《愚蠢的军火库》</i>指出，这可能是对死亡人数的巨大低估，因为它只计算了爆炸造成的死亡人数，而不计算了火灾或辐射造成的死亡人数（这两种因素加起来可能使死亡人数超过 10 亿），更不用说这种<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x/nuclear-winter-scepticism">可能性</a>了。核冬天。]</li></ul></li><li>来自<i>《Dark Sun》</i>和<a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/"><u>《Nukemap》</u></a> ：我认为，当今美国和俄罗斯武库中的炸弹威力比投放在广岛的炸弹威力强 40 倍以上（两国都测试过威力<i>更强</i>的炸弹），这一点我认为并没有真正渗透到公众意识中。</li><li>从奥德·阿恩·韦斯塔德的<i>《冷战：全球史》</i>中，我对公众（尤其是精英）对一个国家道德地位和合法性看法的重要性感到震惊。根据韦斯塔德的说法，苏联在 1940 年代和 1950 年代初期拥有显着的情报优势（当时他们特别窃取了许多重要的核机密），部分原因是西方知识分子认为共产主义在道德上优越，而这种情况在 1950 年代和 1960 年代发生了变化，当（除其他外）斯大林的残暴程度变得难以否认时，美国终于开始解决其种族和性别不平等问题。到了 60 年代末，西方在间谍方面拥有了显着的优势。这很重要，因为<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/foM8SA3ftY94MGMq9/assessment-of-intelligence-agency-functionality-is-difficult"><u>间谍很重要</u></a>。这意味着将实际遵循流行道德原则和强大的（尤其是针对精英的）宣传机器结合起来确实具有战略价值。</li><li><i>冷战时期</i>： <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War"><u>1979年，当中国入侵越南</u></a>以惩罚其推翻柬埔寨红色高棉时，中国在4周内损失的士兵数量是美国在整个越南战争中损失的一半。我不知道能从中得到什么，这只是一个疯狂的事实。</li><li>来自<i>冷战</i>：冷战期间几乎所有在西方民主国家之外成为政治领袖的人都必须是，呃，真正的杰出人物。你很可能会被暗杀、逮捕或流放，以换取一些生活水平的福利（也许会因你所在国家的政治文化而永垂不朽）——我认为这种权衡对绝大多数人来说毫无吸引力，这意味着这些环境中的政治吸引了不寻常的个人，他们在勇敢、利他主义、反社会和自大狂的某些组合上得分很高。</li><li>从<i>《TMOTAB》</i> 、 <i>《暗日》</i>和《奥本海默》电影中可以看出：研究人员创造事物的能力与它们存在后驾驭它们的能力之间存在着明显的不对称。</li><li><a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/oppenheimer/index.html"><u>这篇文章</u></a>中<i>奥本海默</i>和人工智能状况之间还有许多其他有趣的联系，特别是关于<a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1618084785435598851"><u>罗特布拉特在德国失败后“毫无意义”地退出曼哈顿计划，</u></a>以及他最终因其反对核战争的工作而获得诺贝尔奖。 </li></ul><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li

You can tune in on 2023-09-04 20:30 UK time on BBC 2 or <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001q8bf">watch or catch up online</a> if you want to see me and my team in action!</p><p> Quizzing (and more importantly the practice matches and friendlies) gave me a fresh appreciation for various decision-making concerns, theoretical and practical. Plus, it was a great laugh and a chance to meet some really intriguing and friendly people, here in Oxford as well as from other teams.</p><p> Uncertainty is powerful! Calibration is a slightly elusive concept, but an important part of using uncertainty appropriately.</p><p> <em>Logical</em> uncertainty is a fascinating and under-studied phenomenon - especially in time- or compute-constrained settings!</p><p> As well as getting things right, we often need to accept some tradeoff for getting things wrong in order to free up decision-making and acting resources for other uses. When you&#39;re in a head-to-head time-based competition, this bites <em>hard</em> .</p><p> Finally, decision-making is, ultimately, about <em>value</em> . If my belief doesn&#39;t make a value-difference by changing my behaviour, then I might better pay attention to other beliefs which do, even at the expense of the first belief being true. Again this only bites in a constrained context: whether constrained by evidence (for factual uncertainty) or by compute (for logical uncertainty). Since there are <em>so many</em> things we are terribly clueless about, this actually applies in practice all the time.</p><p> Quizzing is fun, and I haven&#39;t even got round to mentioning the arcane art of quiz- <em>writing</em> . A peek behind the scenes at how those particular sausages are made was also illuminating. Were it possible, quiz- and puzzle-setters have gone up even further in my estimations.</p><p> If you&#39;re a quizzer or a quiz-setter (whether with more or less experience than me), I&#39;d love to hear if any of this resonated with you, and about your own reflections on the art of quizzing and decision-making! </p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn-HADF3ByWnoTYEzsgd-1" class="footnote-item"><p> I&#39;ve enjoyed as many pub quizzes as the next Brit but that&#39;s about as far as it goes <a href="#fnref-HADF3ByWnoTYEzsgd-1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn-HADF3ByWnoTYEzsgd-2" class="footnote-item"><p> You win 10 points for a correct answer, whether early or not (hence &#39;Starter for 10&#39;), and you lose 5 for an interruption and an incorrect answer.

Kelly Johnson (Skunk Works) and Hyman Rickover (US Navy nuclear propulsion) are famous examples. A naive economist might expect such people to be well-liked by management above them, because their skills are good for the organization and complementary to those of non-technical managers. That&#39;s not what we generally see in reality.</p><p> In my experience, and in the stories I&#39;ve heard, such technical leaders are <strong>especially</strong> disliked by upper management, far more than a highly effective not non-technical MBA would be. I&#39;ve even been told that unique competence being noticed by upper managment is a negative for career prospects in that situation.</p><p> Why would that be the case? The only explanation that makes sense to me is that effective technical managers are considered a threat by management above them - but why would they be <strong>more</strong> of a threat than a MBA who talks the business talk?</p><p> There are some cultural differences between engineers and non-technical managers, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an explanation. One reason is, technical leaders can find allies <strong>even higher up</strong> that support them. For example, Rickover had allies in Congress, and that&#39;s the only reason he wasn&#39;t pushed out...until he got pushed out by John Lehman, a Ph.D. in American foreign policy who&#39;s worked as an investment banker. Leslie Groves was almost pushed out in 1927, but Major General Edgar Jadwin interceded and noted that Groves&#39;s superiors were at fault for the problems blamed on him - that was a guy <strong>5 ranks</strong> above Groves in the Army.</p><p> My current view is that politician-type managers and engineer-type managers naturally form opposing coalitions. They each favor people of the same type, and try to push local organization norms in different directions.</p><p> In America, today, politican-type managers have won conclusively almost everywhere. I&#39;ve actually seen some of a conflict between such coalitions play out once, and I&#39;d say it&#39;s an even match when the groups are equal in size and nobody else is involved. One group backstabs and fights over social dominance like high school girls, but that&#39;s balanced out by the other group spending half their time arguing about who&#39;s smarter and the other half arguing about emacs vs vim; the underlying dynamic is the same, but one group has the pretense of authority being tied to intelligence, and has a greater tendency to argue about actions instead of personnel selection.</p><p> Normies prefer business speak to technobabble, while nature has the opposite preference, and so the balance is tipped depending on which is more relevant.</p><p> I am, of course, exaggerating somewhat, and all groups have some overlap in their tendencies. There are also other ways to organize hierarchy, such as:</p><ul><li> pure seniority, like Senate committee positions</li><li> pure credentialism, like companies that use exclusively PhDs for upper positions</li><li> effort-worship, like how Elon Musk deserves to be in charge because he works 100 hours a week</li></ul><p> That last one is perhaps my least-favorite. Anyway, we see a similar effect, where organizations based around seniority are all-in on seniority, because the people who want that to be the principle are in charge. There&#39;s always a social hierarchy, so in a sense the only choice society and leaders get to make is what&#39;s used as its basis.</p><p> Companies often have distinctive corporate culture, but companies have to interact with each other, and people move between them, so there&#39;s some pressure towards homogenization. In America, ongoing consolidation has been towards what&#39;s described in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/moral-mazes">Moral Mazes</a> . From inside the system, it might seem like the only possible system, but take heart, for alternatives are possible - for example:</p><ul><li> family dynasties of chaebols like Samsung</li><li> seniority systems of Congress and old unions</li><li> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/13ubugr/deleted_by_user/">professors and grad students</a></li></ul><p> It&#39;s possible to make an engineering-focused startup. You just have smart engineers controlling the leadership positions. The real problem is making that happen. Cultural differences make it harder to sell to normal high-level management, so this is harder for companies selling to businesses than for something like WhatsApp. Most investors are from the dominant business leadership culture. Board membership is controlled by existing board members, and seats are traded as a currency of power. Avoiding those pitfalls is uncommon enough that some big existing company using 10x the people to get worse results can afford to buy out the owners, and founders are often tired and want to retire rich. Maybe you want to argue this is an intrinsic attribute of buyouts, but I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a lot better to sell your company to a Chinese SOE: they don&#39;t wreck your company culture nearly as much as American MBAs, they just want to transfer your technology.</p><p> Some people like to blame layers of hierarchy alone for such differences, with the idea being that there&#39;s a universal &quot;management culture&quot; that all companies are pulled towards. But that&#39;s just not true; companies of similar sizes and ages can have extremely different cultures. No, I think it&#39;s about pull towards a surrounding culture that sits in some local minimum. Again, I don&#39;t mean the <em>overall</em> culture of eg America, but specifically the culture of a <em>management class</em> .</p><p> Yeah, this isn&#39;t actionable intelligence for individuals. I wish I had something that was.</p><hr><p> Yet, organizations can&#39;t function at all without some amount of technical expertise. How does that work in a politician-dominated organization? In my experience, it goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p> me: If the current path continues, you&#39;ll run into [technical problem].</p><p> exec: I see, tell me more.</p><p> me: [explanation]</p><p> exec: (recognizing keywords) Ah, [field]. I have a guy for that. (smug)</p></blockquote><p> note: This is not meant in the sense of &quot;I have a doctor for that&quot; or &quot;I have a mechanic for that&quot;, which would be &quot;we have a guy&quot; instead. There was a sense of ownership over the person implied.</p><blockquote><p> me: I suppose it can be considered [field]. I&#39;d be happy to talk to that guy.</p><p> exec: Hmmm...should I schedule a meeting? His time is pretty valuable.</p><p> me: (More valuable than yours, huh?) I think this issue needs to be considered, but it&#39;s your call.</p><p> exec: (Considering the situation, I&#39;m not sensing any political threats here.) OK then.</p></blockquote><p> later...</p><blockquote><p> me: I looked up your background then wrote this explanation to read to you.</p><p> expert: (misunderstanding)</p><p> me: (attempt at clarification referencing five other fields)</p><p> expert: I was brought in for my experience, and in my experience things were done this way. And now you&#39;re saying that needs to be changed?</p><p> me: As I explained earlier...actually, nevermind. You do your thing.</p></blockquote><p> Loyalty of the expert here is considered as important as their expertise. I also think that in the minds of management, the more general a technical expert is, the more of a potential threat they are, and thus loyalty becomes even more important. If that&#39;s the case, it might be sometimes beneficial to pretend to be ignorant of areas outside your specialty, especially the business context of your technical work. (That&#39;s pretty inconvenient for someone like me.) Is that something you&#39;ve seen?</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hbN5yhruy3htL7neJ/a-rant-on-politician-engineer-coalitional-conflict#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hbN5yhruy3htL7neJ/a-rant-on-politician-engineer-coalitional-conflict<guid ispermalink="false"> hbN5yhruy3htL7neJ</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[bhauth]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 17:15:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How ForumMagnum builds communities of inquiry]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on September 4, 2023 4:52 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> The website you&#39;re currently using is powered by ForumMagnum. But what really <i>is</i> ForumMagnum? What is it <i>for</i> , and why was it designed <i>this</i> way? In this post, I cast ForumMagnum as a medium for building <i>communities of inquiry.</i> I show how ForumMagnum is designed to build norms like <i>rationality</i> and <i>long-form</i> . Lastly, I suggest how the ForumMagnum developers could use the body of CoI research to guide their future product design.</p><h2> What is ForumMagnum for?</h2><p> <a href="https://github.com/ForumMagnum/ForumMagnum">ForumMagnum</a> describes itself as &quot;the codebase powering <a href="https://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> and the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism Forum</a> .&quot; <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnreff1vd82gy1t"><sup><a href="#fnf1vd82gy1t">[1]</a></sup></span> That&#39;s the <i>what</i> ... but what&#39;s the <i>why</i> ?

ForumMagnum is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_ecology">a medium designed to carry a message</a> , and its message is a set of social <i>norms</i> .

</style>most cited paper of all time, Garrison <i>et al.</i> set out to &quot;investigate the features of the written language used in computer conferences <i>[eg, forums]</i> that seem to promote the achievement of critical thinking.&quot; <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefkwru7mhbgga"><sup><a href="#fnkwru7mhbgga">[2]</a></sup></span> They built on the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry"><strong>Community of Inquiry (CoI)</strong></a> , which Wikipedia nicely defines:</p><blockquote><p> The community of inquiry (CoI) is a concept first introduced by early pragmatist philosophers CS Peirce and John Dewey, concerning the nature of knowledge formation and the process of scientific inquiry. The community of inquiry is broadly defined as any group of individuals involved in a process of empirical or conceptual <strong>inquiry</strong> into <strong>problematic situations</strong> . This concept was novel in its emphasis on the <strong>social quality</strong> and contingency of knowledge formation in the sciences ... <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref7g2dx2kizwv"><sup><a href="#fn7g2dx2kizwv">[3]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://lesswrong.com/">The LessWrong community</a> , <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/">the EA community</a> , <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/">the Alignment community</a> , <a href="https://progressforum.org/">the Progress community</a> — what unites them? It&#39;s not just that each community uses ForumMagnum! It&#39;s that each community is a CoI. Let&#39;s see how each community describes itself.</p><blockquote><p> <strong>LessWrong</strong> is online forum/community that was founded with the purpose of perfecting the art of <strong>human rationality</strong> . ... LessWrong is a good place for [those] who want to <strong>work collaboratively</strong> with others to figure out what&#39;s true. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefcsgor21pq4v"><sup><a href="#fncsgor21pq4v">[4]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <strong>Effective altruism</strong> is ... both <strong>a research field</strong> , which aims to identify <strong>the world&#39;s most pressing problems</strong> and the best solutions to them, and <strong>a practical community</strong> that aims to use those findings to do good. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref0okbg80xgg"><sup><a href="#fn0okbg80xgg">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p> <strong>The Alignment Forum</strong> is a single online hub for researchers to <strong>discuss all ideas</strong> related to ensuring that <strong>transformatively powerful AIs are aligned</strong> with human values. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref5kahafw9szr"><sup><a href="#fn5kahafw9szr">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p> <strong>The Progress Forum</strong> is ... a place for long-form discussion of progress studies and the philosophy of progress. ... The broader goal is to <strong>share ideas, strengthen them through discussion and comment</strong> , and over the long term, to build up a body of thought that constitutes a <strong>new philosophy of progress</strong> ... <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefwrkvp2ygzj"><sup><a href="#fnwrkvp2ygzj">[7]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p> None of these communities explicitly identifies as a Community of Inquiry. Nevertheless, each community neatly fits the definition (at least, aspirationally!). Each community emphasizes its own <strong>problematic situation</strong> , to be solved with <strong>inquiry</strong> , and which is best done <strong>socially.</strong></p><h2> How ForumMagnum builds Communities of Inquiry</h2><p> As such, the ForumMagnum communities share similar norms. <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnref2wfkgw0am1f"><sup><a href="#fn2wfkgw0am1f">[8]</a></sup></span> They&#39;re nicely summarized below each comment box:</p><blockquote><ul><li> Aim to explain, not persuade</li><li> Try to offer concrete models and predictions</li><li> If you disagree, try getting curious about what your partner is thinking</li><li> Don&#39;t be afraid to say &#39;oops&#39; and change your mind</li></ul></blockquote><p> But how does ForumMagnum build these norms? There&#39;s one norm-building technique everyone&#39;s aware of: <strong>moderation</strong> , or manual brute-force. Since this technique is very well-known, in this post, I&#39;ll focus on subtler techniques.</p><h3> Technique 1: State your norms</h3><p> We actually just met the simplest norm-building technique. I call it <strong>state-your-norms.</strong> The norms are written below the comment box, shown at exactly the right time. I believe this technique is extremely powerful. I&#39;m willing to bet that it&#39;s as influential as all manual moderation.</p><p> Yet it&#39;s surprisingly under-used! I bet your enterprise Slack or Notion has no such norms stated anywhere, let alone next to the comment boxes.</p><h3> Technique 2: Friction</h3><p> Speaking of that comment box: consider the behavior of the <code>⏎Enter</code> button there. There are two viable behaviors <code>⏎Enter</code> could have: either to <i>post your comment</i> , or to <i>create a new paragraph</i> . In ForumMagnum, <code>⏎Enter</code> creates a new paragraph, and there is no keyboard shortcut for “Submit”. This is deliberate.</p><p> If the <code>⏎Enter</code> button sends my message, I&#39;ll write short <i>messages</i> . But if creates a new paragraph, I&#39;ll write longer <i>comments</i> . This product design builds the norm of <strong>long-form, async communication</strong> . This is an important norm on these sites, although not usually made explicit.</p><p> This is an example of a norm-building technique that I call <strong>friction</strong> . The word “friction” in UX design is <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/user-friction/">often used negatively</a> , but friction is a powerful way to steer users towards desired behavior! ForumMagnum uses several frictions to build the long-form, async norm. Notice there are no realtime notifications, and timestamps are only accurate to the hour.</p><h3> Technique 3: Controlled feedback loops</h3><p> An aside: I bet you&#39;ve experienced what I call <strong>Shift-Enter anxiety.</strong> Visiting a new app, will the <code>⏎Enter</code> key create a new paragraph, or will it prematurely send my message? With this micro-stress, I must make a guess: does it look like this app wants long-form writing? Is the input box large? Are other people posting multiple paragraphs? If so, I hit <code>⏎Enter</code> , and pray for a new paragraph.</p><p> That example shows <strong>norming feedback loops</strong> at play. After I post my longer comment, I help build the norm that <i>this is a place for long-form</i> . <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">Nudge theory</a> told us that defaults are powerful. But in multi-user platforms, defaults are all-powerful. As <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/viliam?mention=user">@Viliam</a> wrote, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8XmiWyd3A5qaCCGTm/you-become-the-ui-you-use"><strong>you become the UI you use</strong></a> .</p><p> Media designers can strengthen feedback loops with <strong>voting.</strong> This lets users reinforce norms. But it&#39;s risky: if a bad behavior becomes a norm, it will also be reinforced by voting systems!</p><p> One way ForumMagnum guards against runaway feedback loops is with <strong>named reactions.</strong> In most apps, you can vote/react with <i>emojis</i> . But emojis can be very ambiguous ( <a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/07/22/the-unbearable-ambiguity-of-emoji/">even causing legal issues!</a> ). In contrast, ForumMagnum&#39;s reactions have labels, like: “Changed My Mind”, “Insightful”, or “Good Facilitation”. This incorporates the state-your-norms technique, by embedding the norms in the reactions. It also incorporates the friction technique, by making it harder to react in undesired ways (for example, there&#39;s no &quot;Too Long, Didn&#39;t Read&quot; reaction).</p><h3> Technique 4: Zoning</h3><p> I&#39;ll end with a norm-building technique that I call <strong>zoning.</strong> Counter-intuitively, one way to build a norm is to build a feature for its <i>opposite norm!</i> It&#39;s like how urban planners try to move the pollution to an industrial zone, or the prostitution to a red-light district. LessWrong has two such zoning features.</p><p> One zoning feature is called <strong>Shortform.</strong> “Exploratory, draft-stage, rough, and rambly thoughts are all welcome on Shortform.” Implicit in this description is that such content is <i>not</i> generally welcome elsewhere. The “shortform” feature says: “Normal posts are long-form and carefully edited.”</p><p> Another zoning feature is called <strong>agreement voting.</strong> So many other forums are plagued by group-think. It&#39;s a malignant norm. ForumMagnum attempts to <i>zone</i> the groupthink by moving it to a separate voting axis. The normal voting axis is the traditional “How much do you like this?”. The second axis is: “How much do you agree with this, separate from whether you think it&#39;s a good comment?”. The “agreement voting” feature says: “Normal voting should not consider agreement.”</p><h2> How ForumMagnum can use CoI research</h2><p> Anyway, back to Garrison <i>et al.,</i> and <a href="https://www.thecommunityofinquiry.org/">their community&#39;s 25-year-long investigation</a> into how text-based media can promote rationality. How can CoI help ForumMagnum and its communities?</p><p> The CoI community provides <a href="https://www.thecommunityofinquiry.org/framework">a framework for <strong>defining inquiry</strong></a> . It has some great insights. For example, that <strong>social presence</strong> (the ability to present yourself as a &quot;real person&quot;) is essential to inquiry. I suspect that <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAgJJa3HLSZxsuSrf/arbital-postmortem?commentId=uhZRL7ZNhdjBEP5NL">the lack of social presence</a> was one reason for <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAgJJa3HLSZxsuSrf/arbital-postmortem">the failure of Arbital</a> (a sort of wiki-structured LessWrong).</p><p> The CoI community provides <a href="https://www.thecommunityofinquiry.org/coisurvey">a survey for <i><strong>measuring</strong></i> <strong>inquiry</strong></a> , and attempts to <a href="https://www.lens.org/lens/scholar/article/049-280-576-236-284/main">measure inquiry using AI</a> . The idea of &quot;measuring intangibles&quot; is central to the ForumMagnum communities. Despite this, each community defines its <i>aspirational</i> norms, but has never measured <i>whether they are in fact norms</i> .</p><p> The CoI community provides empirical research into how to <i><strong>build</strong></i> <strong>inquiry.</strong> For the practically minded, try <a href="https://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/3985/5270">Holly Fiock&#39;s big list of concrete recommendations!</a></p><h2> How is ForumMagnum <i>really</i> developed?</h2><p> I described all this as an outsider looking in.

The opinions here are all mine and I&#39;m sure she&#39;d disagree with some or all of them.</i></p><h2> The Hai&#39;Zu</h2><p> Imagine the Hai&#39;zu people of Stone Age Langong, using a very simple language that might contain only 6 words:</p><p> There (combined with pointing towards a direction)</p><p> Do (indicating that the person must do the appropriate action)</p><p> Gather (indicating that everyone should come and listen)</p><p> Them (indicating another person, combined with pointing)</p><p> No (negation)</p><p> Sun (indicating the concept of sun, which stands in for both time and weather)</p><p> The Hai&#39;zu can coordinate very well using this simple language, Scout comes back to camp and says:</p><ul><li> Gather There Do</li></ul><p> This obviously means “there is an injured stag wandering around the forest, hunters go hunt it”. If they instead said.</p><ul><li> Gather There No Do</li></ul><p> This obviously means “there is a tiger around the forest, nobody should go there.</p><p> The old shaman can even chip in and say something like:</p><ul><li> There No Do No Sun</li></ul><p> Indicating that, since it&#39;s a rainy day, so No Sun means “night”, that tigers hunt during the dark too, and nobody should go there at night either, even with torches.</p><p> At night a children can ask the Shaman</p><ul><li> There No Do Sun?</li></ul><p> (the question is implicit from the tone and the children - to - elder relationship)</p><p> And the Shaman can say:</p><ul><li> There Do Sun</li></ul><p> Indicating tigers don&#39;t usually hang out in the same spot for more than a day, so it should be safe tomorrow.</p><p> The chieftain can assign tasks:</p><p> Them Do</p><p> Them Do</p><p> Them Do</p><p> People get that they are supposed to light the pile of wood, take care of the kid, and cook the dead elk.</p><p> Granted, the ancient Hai&#39;zu probably had closer to 2000 words, or they got conquered by a neighboring tribe that did, you can only get so far without names for common things, pointing is inefficient, and only being able to do time and weather keeping on a day-by-day basis has limitations.</p><p> Still, the Hai&#39;zu can coordinate much better than any living animal using this relatively simple vocabulary, well enough to synchronize hunting, camp maintenance, and caretaking.</p><hr><p> Now, if a Hai&#39;zu philosopher is born they might start saying things like:</p><ul><li> There Gather Do</li></ul><p> This is a perfectly valid sentence in Hai&#39;zu&#39;ish but it also makes no sense, if enough people take the philosopher seriously they might start having ideas and concepts about the great gathering in the sky, and have conflicting thoughts about whether “Do” in the sky refers to chasing the sun or having transcendental sex or lying in blissful wait. These questions might come up in the effigies they build to “There Gather Do” or in one of them uttering a sentence like:</p><ul><li> There Gather Them Do Sun</li></ul><p> Symbolizing the great hunt for the sun their chieftain will lead in the afterlife.</p><p> This is surely to cause some polarization as yet another scream.</p><ul><li> There Gather Them Do Sun</li></ul><p> Indicating the spirits of their ancestors are already in a timeless hunt for the Sun</p><hr><p> Again, don&#39;t take the Hai&#39;zu very seriously, if you will demand of me to compose an entire prehistoric language and explain it&#39;s flaws and uses in the span of this article, you&#39;d surely get bored. But grant me that you can have a language which is:</p><p> a) Much more scarce than modern ones in terms of words and rules in combining them</p><p> b) Very useful, able to maintain coordination between humans</p><p> c) Able to ask “philosophical” questions, the sort which don&#39;t have obvious answers that everyone agrees on. And make “philosophical” statements, the sort on which people have to ponder at length and might come up with conflicting interpretations.</p><h2> Language Is Undefined</h2><p> This is a fundamental problem of any language, no matter how complex. Indeed, the more complex a language the more statements in that language are going to be nonsensical even if correct based on its rules.</p><p> *We needn&#39;t go into anything formal like equating language with a poor form of mathematics than pointing to Godel uncertainty proving that any such systems will contain contradictions. Though it&#39;s probably important to keep in mind that ** <strong>this property of having a contradictory/undefined/nonsensical set of statements, both theoretically and empirically, extends to any conceptual system we have come up with, be it a formalization of mathematical rules, a programming language or an actual language.</strong> *</p><p> To see that this is the case in language simply think of some sentences which are syntactically and grammatically correct but make no sense. I&#39;d encourage to come up with your own, here are some off the top of my head:</p><p> I will swim to comb the hairdryer</p><p> They are negating flapping the moon</p><p> How do I know if Joel scratched the inside of my one of my dendritic cells?</p><p> Photons won&#39;t dance on the windshield of my car</p><p> If you can&#39;t imagine some, open the closest book of poetry.</p><hr><p> We can analyze each of these sentences and give reasons for why they are false. We can also imagine insane worlds and reach out for far-off meanings to see how maybe they could be true.</p><p> If you can&#39;t imagine insane meanings for the above, open the closest book of poetry interpretation.</p><p> But there is no rule that says we should be able to come up with a way to refute any nonsensical sentence. Indeed, given the immense ability of humans to stretch language, I&#39;d be silly to think any sentence can be entirely refuted as nonsensical or not, it&#39;s all a spectrum ranging from very nonsensical to very concrete.</p><p> Nor is nonsensical language inherently wrong, indeed, the language of experts often appears to be nonsensical, and it often is nonsensical outside of the very restrictive context in which those experts operate. Similarly, the language of lovers, poets, and friends is often nonsensical and that is precisely what gives it value.</p><hr><p> I don&#39;t mean to say that the purpose of language is this or that, indeed, that would be a nonsensical question to ask outside of a logical positivist meeting. However, it is important to note that language has a very important role as a coordination mechanism.</p><h2> Making Sense Of Coordination</h2><p> Problems often arise when we try to coordinate people around specific linguistical statements, that make no sense. This is expected since the only way to coordinate people around language is to use reality, the thing language is often describing.</p><p> We agree on things like:</p><p> Fire burns your hand</p><p> Salt makes french fries taste better</p><p> Letting go of a stone in midair results in it falling towards the ground</p><p> Because we can experimentally prove those things to be true, in a way that&#39;s easy and obvious to see by anybody, can be done by anybody.</p><p> Also, we have the common sense to understand the limitations of each sentence, “Letting go of a stone in midair results in it falling towards the ground” doesn&#39;t apply on the space station, yet this didn&#39;t generate infinite philosophical debates nor lead to people applying the qualifier “on Earth” when referring to objects that fall. Some people don&#39;t like salty foods, and some “fires” are indeed not that hot.</p><p> Out of a long tradition of people more focused on being efficient replication machines than being happy, certain bugs seem to arise. One of them is that we often choose to forget there&#39;s a distinction between language and the real world, that language is both inherently contextual and often says things that are neither true nor false, they are undefined, nonsensical. This doesn&#39;t always happen, but it seems to happen selectively, with reinforcement.</p><p> Noticing that language is contextual is especially hard if one always inhibits the same context, and reacts violently to any large changes in context. This violent reaction is often a combination of:</p><p> This context is wrong, it&#39;s insane, Why does it exist!?</p><p> This context is unpleasant to be in, I want to get back</p><p> Parts of this context map onto the use of words in my old context, I&#39;m going to ignore the other parts</p><p> Try to coordinate everybody on a meaning of language that is heavily dependent on the context they inhabit, and you have a problem.</p><p> Noticing that language often yields largely nonsensical statements is also particularly hard if you&#39;ve been educated to think the opposite, in a system that is purely conceptual and doesn&#39;t often touch reality. The only way to notice most statements are nonsensical is by jumping from linguistic descriptions of reality to reality. Be that reality your phenomenal experience when sitting with your eyes closed, running through a field, or looking through a microscope.</p><p> Try to coordinate everybody on a meaning of language that is nonsensical (independent of context), and you will fail.</p><hr><p> The biggest problem here is that we hold statements to be true and, most of us, seem to only be able to accept that they are false when they&#39;ve been replaced by other statements.</p><p> If I think X is Y, and I&#39;m a particularly nice and reasonable person, I might be able to accept things like:</p><p> A is Y so X and A are similar</p><p> X is actually Z</p><p> X is Z if C and X if B</p><p> X is usually Y, but very rarely it&#39;s Z</p><p> X is Y for me, but for them X is Z, and that&#39;s fine</p><p> But we are unlikely to accept:</p><p> X is not a thing that can be other things</p><p> Y is not actually a thing that another thing can be</p><p> Even less likely to accept:</p><p> X doesn&#39;t exist</p><p> Y doesn&#39;t exist</p><p> And accepting a statement like:</p><ul><li> Both X and Y don&#39;t exist</li></ul><p> Is reserved for Lao Tzu, Siddhartha, Alan Turing, and other enlightened demigods. Mortals just can&#39;t accept this.</p><hr><p> I&#39;m not sure why our minds just can&#39;t “walk back” on language, it seems like an extremely powerful mechanism. It&#39;s one I&#39;ve tried to cultivate but it seems especially hard, to the point where I myself have accepted that often enough it&#39;s easier to “cover” nonsensical linguistical statements with other less nonsensical statements.</p><p> I think there might be useful techniques for doing this, like learning a new language and switching all of your conceptual thinking to that language.</p><p> I do think there is a middle path where one can&#39;t quite drop the idea that certain sentences “must” make sense, but they can at least understand that they don&#39;t at some rational level, and stop being so attached to them.</p><p> I can think “X is Y” and hear somebody say “X is not Y” or “X doesn&#39;t exist” and instead of arguing, I can remember that “both X and Y don&#39;t exist” and internally hug whatever part of my brain has been scarred by the impression that X and Y are indeed things.</p><h2>解决</h2><p>Don&#39;t expect me to try and disprove any real examples of such undefined statements that people argue about there. Looking from the outside such statements often seem to hinge upon entire mountains of nonsense, and, in most people, trying to unskillfully pull the rug from under the mountain would just result in suffering and a defensive reaction.</p><p> I know I have such mountains of nonsense and I can&#39;t even excavate those, I don&#39;t have the hubris to think I could be doing that for the mountains of others. However, I have enough hubris to think that I <strong>might</strong> be able to gesture at the problem here, and maybe you can see it through your own lense, in whatever way makes sense to you.</p><p> The problem in itself, remember, is non-conceptual. You can&#39;t come at it linguistically, the proof that statements are nonsensical must come from observing the real world, and it must come often come from seeing absence, not from seeing existence.</p><p> A great book that has helped me notice just how wide this problem was, is <a href="https://meaningness.com/">Meaningness</a> .</p><p> David Chapman is, I think, highly skilled at doing this excavation work that I point towards. He tries to do it with subjects that might be very touchy but goes about it in a very roundabout, slow, and deliberate way. The book itself is, I think, intentionally written to be “obvious”, nothing it says is remotely controversial so you might find yourself nodding along and thinking “why the fuck am I reading this, it&#39;s just a book of obvious statements” — The next step one should take is taking those obvious statements, using them to look at reality, and see what conflicting (nonsensical) statements arise in your mind during those moments.</p><p> I wish that this final section could be something more than a plug for this book, I certainly think that many other works, from ancient religious scriptures to modern textbooks on computational complexity point towards it, but they don&#39;t seem to be nearly as efficient. If you know of any better techniques I would be eternally grateful for pointers to the works describing them.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sc6Gv4Gbc7FNGJH5N/hard-questions-are-language-bugs#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sc6Gv4Gbc7FNGJH5N/hard-questions-are-language-bugs<guid ispermalink="false"> sc6Gv4Gbc7FNGJH5N</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[George3d6]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 14:44:23 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Defunding My Mistake]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on September 4, 2023 2:43 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <i>Confessions of an ex-ACAB</i></p><p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9899a3b0-170b-4478-953a-715da52a7ed7_1222x815.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9899a3b0-170b-4478-953a-715da52a7ed7_1222x815.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9899a3b0-170b-4478-953a-715da52a7ed7_1222x815.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9899a3b0-170b-4478-953a-715da52a7ed7_1222x815.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9899a3b0-170b-4478-953a-715da52a7ed7_1222x815.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9899a3b0-170b-4478-953a-715da52a7ed7_1222x815.jpeg 1456w"></a></p><p> Until about five years ago, I unironically parroted the slogan All Cops Are Bastards (ACAB) and earnestly advocated to abolish the police and prison system. I had faint inklings I <i>might</i> be wrong about this a long time ago, but it took a while to come to terms with its disavowal. What follows is intended to be not just a detailed account of <i>what</i> I used to believe but most pertinently, <i>why</i> . Despite being super egotistical, for whatever reason I do not experience an aversion to openly admitting mistakes I&#39;ve made, and I find it very difficult to understand why others do. I&#39;ve said many times before that nothing engenders someone&#39;s credibility more than when they admit error, so you definitely have my permission to view this kind of confession as a self-serving exercise (it is). Beyond my own penitence, I find it very helpful when folks engage in introspective, epistemological self-scrutiny, and I hope others are inspired to do the same.</p><h2> <strong>How Did I Get There?</strong></h2><p> For decades now, I&#39;ve consistently held plain vanilla libertarian policy preferences, with the only major distinction being that I&#39;ve aligned myself more with the anarchists. Whereas some were content with pushing the “amount of government” lever to “little”, I wanted to kick it all the way to “zero”. There are many reasons I was and remain drawn to anarchist libertarianism, and chief among them was the attractively simple notion that violence is immoral and that government is violence. The problem with moral frameworks is that they can be quite infectious. To pick on one example for demonstration&#39;s sake, I notice that for many animal welfare advocates a vegan diet is heralded not just as the ideal <i>moral</i> choice, but also as the healthiest for humans, the least polluting, the cheapest financially, the best for soil conservation, the most water-efficient, the least labor-exploitative, et cetera &amp; so forth. There&#39;s a risk that if you become dogmatically attached to a principled position, you&#39;re liable to be less scrutinizing when reflexively folding in other justifications. I suspect that happened to me with prisons, for example, where because I felt immediate revulsion at the thought of the state forcing someone into a cage, I was unwilling to entertain the possibility it could be justified. Ceding the ground on <i>this</i> particular brick was too threatening to the anarchism edifice I was so fond of.</p><p> Obviously if you advocate getting rid of the government, people naturally want to know what will replace it. Some concerns were trivial to respond to (I&#39;m not sad about the DEA not existing anymore because drugs shouldn&#39;t be illegal to begin with), but other questions I found <i>annoying</i> because I admittedly had no good answer, such as what to do with criminals if the police didn&#39;t exist. I tried to find these answers. Anarchism as an umbrella ideology leans <i>heavily</i> to the far left and has a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin#Critique_of_Marxism">serious disagreements with fellow-travelers in Marxism</a> . Despite that feud, anarchist thought absorbed by proxy Marxist “material conditions” critiques that blame the existence of crime on capitalism&#39;s inequalities — a claim that continues to be widely circulated today, despite how flagrantly dumb it is. As someone who was and continues to be solidly in favor of free market economics, these critiques were like parsing an inscrutable foreign language. I was in college around my most ideologically formative time and a voracious reader, but I churned through the relevant literature and found nothing convincing. Instead of noting that as a blaring red flag, I maintained the grip I had on my preferred conclusion and delegated the hard work of actually defending it to someone else. I specifically recall how Angela Davis&#39;s 2003 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_Prisons_Obsolete%3F"><i>Are Prisons Obsolete?</i></a> (written by a famous professor! woah!) had just come out and the praise it was getting from my lefty friends. If <a href="https://twitter.com/agraybee/status/1696337080920555901">this synopsis of the book</a> is in any way accurate, Davis&#39;s arguments are so undercooked that it should come with a health warning. The fact that I never read the book all the following years could have been intentional, because it allowed me a convenient escape hatch: whenever pressed, I could just hide behind Davis and other purportedly super prestigious intellectuals as my security detail. Back then, I carried the incredibly naive assumption that any position held by prestigious academics couldn&#39;t be completely baseless…right?</p><p> Also pertinent is exploring why I felt so attached to something I knew I couldn&#39;t logically defend, and the simple explanation is that it was cool. Being a libertarian can be super socially isolating, especially if you live only in places overwhelmingly surrounded by leftists like I do. I navigated the social scene by prioritizing shared political values — let&#39;s not discuss how I don&#39;t support the minimum wage, focus instead on how much I hate the police and on how much I love punk rock. That worked really well. Putting “ACAB” on my Tinder profile was an effective signaling move that dramatically improved my chances of matching with the tattooed and pierced cuties I was chasing. Announcing at a party that you are <i>so</i> radical that you&#39;re willing to eliminate prisons is an effective showmanship maneuver that few others have the stomach to challenge. There was plenty of social cachet motivating me to ignore niggling doubts.</p><h2> <strong>How Did I Leave?</strong></h2><p> Whatever the outward facade, my position was crumbling behind it. Almost seven years ago I started working as a public defender and was inundated with hundreds of hours of police encounter footage that were completely uneventful; if anyone, it was usually my client who acted like an idiot. I&#39;ve seen bodycam footage that starts with officers dropping their lunch in the precinct breakroom in order to full-on sprint toward a “shots fired” dispatch call. I&#39;ve seen dipshits like the woman who attempted to flee a traffic stop while the trooper was desperately reaching for the ignition with his legs dangling out of the open car door. Despite this, the trooper treated her with impeccable professionalism once the situation was stabilized. At least about five years ago, I found myself in a conversation with a very normie liberal lawyer on the question of police/prison abolition. It was one of the first times I encountered serious pushback and I quickly realized just how woefully under-equipped I was. I distinctly remember how unpleasant the feeling was — not from the fear of being <i>wrong</i> about something, but rather the fear of being <i>found out</i> .</p><p> There were instances where I pulled bullshit <i>what-I-really-mean</i> defenses of ACAB and tried to pontificate about how it&#39;s less about whether <i>individual</i> officers are per se “bastards”, but rather how the <i>institutional</i> role is blah blah blah. I played similarly squirmy motte-and-bailey games with the abolition topic when I was confronted with undeniable rebuttals. I found an example from almost 10 years ago of one of my most common responses, where I&#39;d highlight some police scandal (eg, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/">cops seizing more stuff through civil forfeiture than is stolen from people by burglars</a> ) and accompany it with the eminently lukewarm “on net, society might be better off without police”. The argument is as abstract as it is unconvincing; soaring at an altitude too high for effective critique yet also too remote for anyone to care. Tellingly, I wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t address the more pressing questions of how to deal with more serious crimes.</p><p> It was bizarre watching the discourse unfold during the 2020 BLM riots/protests. Almost overnight, the normie liberal demographic that previously was willing to push back on my inanity was now hoarse from screaming for police abolition. My younger self would&#39;ve been thrilled watching the populace fully adopt radical anarchist sloganeering, but my actual self was aghast. I couldn&#39;t believe these people were speaking literally ( <a href="https://archive.ph/6E7mY">yep!</a> ) or whether they somehow discovered the elusive magic elixir that transformed police abolition into a viable policy proposal ( <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/a-conversation-about-crime">nope!</a> ). I&#39;m someone <a href="https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/blm-the-wonks-v-the-screamers">who was and remains a full supporter of BLM&#39;s policy proposals</a> , and I even <a href="https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/riots-work">defended burning down a police precinct</a> building in Minneapolis for fuck&#39;s sake, and yet I didn&#39;t join the defund chorus.</p><p> Still, there&#39;s a noticeable bend to some of my writing from that time where I consciously mirrored some of the language <i>du jour</i> — such as making a <a href="https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/halfway-to-prison-abolition">bog standard argument against mass incarceration</a> while aping abolition language, or responding to a DTP conversation by <a href="https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/you-can-defund-without-getting-rid">discussing police overcompensation</a> . I haven&#39;t changed my mind about anything I wrote there, but nevertheless it&#39;s fair to accuse me of indirectly “ <a href="https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/what-are-the-limits-of-the-weak-man">sanewashing</a> ” the DTP issue. I took my boring, wonky arguments and adorned them with the faintest slogan perfume. This let me carry my hobbyhorses on the attention wave, but it also contributed to rehabilitating (however slightly) the totally crazy slogan position.</p><h2> <strong>Now What?</strong></h2><p> I know it sounds crazy, but I think effective law enforcement is a vital component of any well-functioning society. Tons of cops are perfectly decent people who try to do the best they can at a difficult and unenviable job. There are bad people out there who can be prevented from doing bad things only when they are physically restrained with chains and metal bars. Unless we develop some revolutionary new technology or fundamentally modify the nature of man, this is the reality we&#39;re stuck with. I still firmly believe there are loads of improvements we can make to the policing and incarceration we have, but abolishing it all is a delusional idea untethered from reality. Radical stance, I know.</p><p> Regarding the anarchist responses to the topic, the only <a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html">coherent proposals I&#39;ve ever encountered</a> are from David Friedman and others on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalist</a> side (a variant thoroughly detested by left-wing anarchist thinkers who think it&#39;s an affront even to consider it “real” anarchism). Friedman&#39;s response is essentially a cyberpunk future with competing private companies offering insurance, security, and arbitration in one package. Friedman&#39;s proposal is unusually thoughtful and coherent (the bar is low) and yet still remains largely a thought exercise reliant on some generous game theory assumptions. Who knows if it will or can ever work.</p><p> In terms of lessons learned, I should first note that introspection of this kind, spanning across such a long time period, will have significant blind spots and would be particularly prone to flattering revisionism. The most obvious mistake I made was in burying those unnerving moments of doubt. Instead of running toward the fire to put it out, I did my best to tell myself there was no fire. I had already arrived at a conclusion in my mind and worked backward to find its support, and I suppressed how little I could actually find. Whether intentionally or not, I fabricated comforting explanations for why my position was right even though I couldn&#39;t directly defend it, often citing evidence that was more aspiration than reality. My ideological isolation kept me safe from almost all pushback anyways. And magnifying all of this were the social dynamics that rewarded me for keeping the horse blinders on.</p><p> I&#39;m likely overlooking other factors of course, and there&#39;s the ever-present, gnawing worry that haunts me, whispering that I might be fundamentally mistaken about something else. Maybe I am, but hopefully I&#39;ll be better equipped to unearth it.</p><br/><br/><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4rsRuNaE4uJrnYeTQ/defunding-my-mistake#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4rsRuNaE4uJrnYeTQ/defunding-my-mistake<guid ispermalink="false"> 4rsRuNaE4uJrnYeTQ</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[ymeskhout]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 14:43:16 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Directory of Competent People]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on September 4, 2023 1:25 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> Finding competent people is still the bottleneck.</p><p> I&#39;m willing to pay good money for people who are helpful but often don&#39;t because of the friction of finding them.</p><p> To fix this I made an editable sheet you all can add yourselves or people you can endorse (with their permission) to.</p><p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jZr0ln_LyKgoCLUXXVlffqTQ9LCw71CQVt6R--ySqgM/edit">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jZr0ln_LyKgoCLUXXVlffqTQ9LCw71CQVt6R--ySqgM/edit</a></p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pQkvXWJtdXMgPbQcP/directory-of-competent-people#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pQkvXWJtdXMgPbQcP/directory-of-competent-people<guid ispermalink="false"> pQkvXWJtdXMgPbQcP</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[nonveumann]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 13:25:10 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The omnizoid - Heighn FDT Debate #1: Why FDT Isn't Crazy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on September 4, 2023 12:57 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <i>After</i> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/omnizoid?from=post_header"><i>omnizoid</i></a> <i>asked whether people want to</i> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Wvyiycf6dHeknJRRA/anyone-want-to-debate-publicly-about-fdt"><i>debate him</i></a> <i>on Functional Decision Theory (FDT), he and I chatted briefly and agreed to have a (short) debate. We agreed the first post should be by me: a reaction to omnizoid&#39;s</i> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TjyyngWFYvQWPpNNj/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently-egregiously"><i>original post</i></a> <i>, where he explains why he believes FDT is &quot;crazy&quot;. In this post, I&#39;ll assume the reader has a basic understanding of FDT. If not, I suggest reading</i> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060"><i>the paper</i></a> <i>.</i></p><p> Let&#39;s just dive right in the arguments omnizoid makes against FDT. Here&#39;s the first one:</p><blockquote><p> One example is a blackmail case. Suppose that a blackmailer will, every year, blackmail one person. There&#39;s a 1 in a googol chance that he&#39;ll blackmail someone who wouldn&#39;t give in to the blackmail and a googol-1/googol chance that he&#39;ll blackmail someone who would give in to the blackmail. He has blackmailed you. He threatens that if you don&#39;t give him a dollar, he will share all of your most embarrassing secrets to everyone in the world. Should you give in?</p><p> FDT would say no. After all, agents who won&#39;t give in are almost guaranteed to never be blackmailed. But this is totally crazy. You should give up one dollar to prevent all of your worst secrets from being spread to the world.</p></blockquote><p> So if I understand this correctly, this problem works as follows:</p><ol><li> The blackmailer predicts - with accuracy googol-1/googol - whether you will pay $1 if blackmailed. He does so by running your decision procedure and observe what it outputs.<ol><li> If yes, he blackmails you. If you don&#39;t pay $1, your worst secrets are spread. This would cost you the equivalent of, say, $1,000,000.</li><li> If no, he doesn&#39;t blackmail you.</li></ol></li><li> The blackmailer blackmails you.</li></ol><p> <i>(To be clear, this is my interpretation of the problem. omnizoid just says there&#39;s a 1/googol chance the blackmailer blackmails someone who wouldn&#39;t give in to the problem, and doesn&#39;t specify that in that case, the blackmailer was wrong in his</i> prediction <i>that the victim would pay. Maybe the blackmailer just blackmails everyone, and 1 in a googol people don&#39;t give in. If that&#39;s the case, FDT does pay.)</i></p><p> If this is the correct interpretation of the problem, FDT is fully correct to not pay the $1. omnizoid believes this causes your worst secrets to be spread, but it&#39;s <i>specified</i> in the problem statement that this only happens with probability 1/googol: if the blackmailer wrongly predicts that you <i>will</i> pay $1. With probability googol-1/googol, you don&#39;t get blackmailed and don&#39;t have to pay anything. A googol-1/googol probability of losing $1 is much worse than a 1/googol probability of losing $1,000,000. So FDT is correct.</p><p> omnizoid can counter here that it is <i>also</i> specified that the blackmailer <i>does</i> blackmail you. But this is a problem of which <i>decision</i> to make, and that decision is fist made in the blackmailer&#39;s brain (when he predicts what you will decide). If that decision is &quot;don&#39;t pay the $1&quot;, the blackmailer will almost certainly not blackmail you.</p><p> Another way of looking at this is asking: &quot;Which decision theory do you want to run, keeping in mind that you <i>might</i> run into the Blackmail problem?&quot; If you run FDT, you virtually never get blackmailed in the first place.</p><p> On to the next argument. Here, omnizoid uses Wolfgang Schwarz&#39;s <a href="https://www.umsu.de/blog/2018/688">Procreation</a> problem:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Procreation.</strong> I wonder whether to procreate. I know for sure that doing so would make my life miserable. But I also have reason to believe that my father faced the exact same choice, and that he followed FDT. If FDT were to recommend not procreating, there&#39;s a significant probability that I wouldn&#39;t exist. I highly value existing (even miserably existing). So it would be better if FDT were to recommend procreating. So FDT says I should procreate. (Note that this (incrementally) confirms the hypothesis that my father used FDT in the same choice situation, for I know that he reached the decision to procreate.)</p></blockquote><p> omnizoid doesn&#39;t explain why he believes FDT gives the wrong recommendation here, but Schwarz <a href="https://www.umsu.de/blog/2018/688">does</a> :</p><blockquote><p> In <i>Procreation</i> , FDT agents have a much worse life than CDT agents.</p></blockquote><p> This is strictly true: FDT recommends procreating, because not procreating would mean you don&#39;t exist (due to the subjunctive dependence with your father). CDT&#39;ers don&#39;t have this subjunctive dependence with their FDT father (and wouldn&#39;t even care if it <i>was</i> there), don&#39;t procreate, and are happier.</p><p> This problem doesn&#39;t fairly compare FDT to CDT though. By specifying that the father follows FDT, FDT&#39;ers can&#39;t possibly do better than procreating. Procreation directly punishes FDT&#39;ers - not because of the decisions FDT makes, but for <i>following FDT in the first place</i> . I can easily make an analogous problem that punishes CDT&#39;ers for following CDT:</p><p> <i><strong>ProcreationCDT.</strong> I wonder whether to procreate. I know for sure that doing so would make my life miserable. But I also have reason to believe that my father faced the exact same choice, and that he followed CDT. I highly value existing (even miserably existing). Should I procreate?</i></p><p> FDT&#39;ers don&#39;t procreate here and live happily. CDT&#39;ers wouldn&#39;t procreate either and don&#39;t exist. So in this variant, FDT&#39;ers fare much better than CDT&#39;ers.</p><p> We can also make a fair variant of Procreation - a version I&#39;ve called <strong>Procreation*</strong> in the past:</p><p> <i><strong>Procreation*.</strong> I wonder whether to procreate. I know for sure that doing so would make my life miserable. But I also have reason to believe that my father faced the exact same choice, and I know he followed the same decision theory I do. If my decision theory were to recommend not procreating, there&#39;s a significant probability that I wouldn&#39;t exist. I value a miserable life to no life at all, but obviously I value a happy life to a miserable one. Should I procreate?</i></p><p> So if you&#39;re an FDT&#39;er, your father was an FDT&#39;er, and if you are a CDT&#39;er, your father was a CDT&#39;er. FDT&#39;ers procreate and live; CDT&#39;ers don&#39;t procreate and don&#39;t exist. FDT wins. It surprises me to this day that Schwarz didn&#39;t seem to notice his Procreation problem is unfair.</p><p> omnizoid&#39;s next argument is borrowed from William MacAskill&#39;s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ySLYSsNeFL5CoAQzN/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory#III__FDT_sometimes_makes_bizarre_recommendations">A Critique of Functional Decision Theory</a> :</p><blockquote><p> <i>Bomb</i> .</p><p> You face two open boxes, Left and Right, and you must take one of them. In the Left box, there is a live bomb; taking this box will set off the bomb, setting you ablaze, and you certainly will burn slowly to death. The Right box is empty, but you have to pay $100 in order to be able to take it.</p><p> A long-dead predictor predicted whether you would choose Left or Right, by running a simulation of you and seeing what that simulation did. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Right, then she put a bomb in Left. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Left, then she did not put a bomb in Left, and the box is empty.</p><p> The predictor has a failure rate of only 1 in a trillion trillion. Helpfully, she left a note, explaining that she predicted that you would take Right, and therefore she put the bomb in Left.</p><p> You are the only person left in the universe. You have a happy life, but you know that you will never meet another agent again, nor face another situation where any of your actions will have been predicted by another agent. What box should you choose?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> The right action, according to FDT, is to take Left, in the full knowledge that as a result you will slowly burn to death.为什么？ Because, using Y&amp;S&#39;s counterfactuals, <i>if</i> your algorithm were to output &#39;Left&#39;, then it would also have outputted &#39;Left&#39; when the predictor made the simulation of you, and there would be no bomb in the box, and you could save yourself $100 by taking Left. In contrast, the right action on CDT or EDT is to take Right.</p><p> The recommendation is implausible enough. But if we stipulate that in this decision-situation the decision-maker is certain in the outcome that her actions would bring about, we see that FDT violates <i>Guaranteed Payoffs</i> .</p></blockquote><p> FDT&#39;s recommendation isn&#39;t implausible here. I doubt I could explain it much better than MacAskill himself, though, when he says</p><blockquote><p> <i>if</i> your algorithm were to output &#39;Left&#39;, then it would also have outputted &#39;Left&#39; when the predictor made the simulation of you, and there would be no bomb in the box, and you could save yourself $100 by taking Left.</p></blockquote><p> The point seems to be that FDT&#39;ers burn to death, but, like in the Blackmail problem, that only happens with vanishingly small probability. Unless you value your life higher than $100 trillion trillion - since you lose it with probability 1 in a trillion trillion but save $100 - Left-boxing is the correct decision.</p><p> One could once again counter that the bomb is <i>already</i> in the Left-box. But again, the decision is made at two points - in your head, but also in the predictor&#39;s.</p><p> <i>Guaranteed Payoffs</i> ? That principle, if applied, should be applied the first time your decision is made: in the head of the predictor. At that point it&#39;s (virtually) guaranteed that Left-boxing let&#39;s you live for free.</p><p> omnizoid:</p><blockquote><p> The basic point is that Yudkowsky&#39;s decision theory is totally bankrupt and implausible, in ways that are evident to those who know about decision theory.</p></blockquote><p> <i>Are you actually going to argue from authority here?!</i> I&#39;ve spoken to Nate Soares, one of the authors of the FDT paper, many times, and I assure you he &quot;knows about decision theory&quot;. Furthermore, and with all due respect to MacAskill, his post fundamentally misrepresents FDT in the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ySLYSsNeFL5CoAQzN/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory#V__Implausible_discontinuities">Implausible Discontinuities</a> section:</p><blockquote><p> First, take some physical processes S (like the lesion from the Smoking Lesion) that causes a &#39;mere statistical regularity&#39; (it&#39;s not a Predictor). And suppose that the existence of S tends to cause both (i) one-boxing tendencies and (ii) whether there&#39;s money in the opaque box or not when decision-makers face Newcomb problems.  If it&#39;s S alone that results in the Newcomb set-up, then FDT will recommending two-boxing.</p><p> But now suppose that the pathway by which S causes there to be money in the opaque box or not is that another agent looks at S and, if the agent sees that S will cause decision-maker X to be a one-boxer, then the agent puts money in X&#39;s opaque box. Now, because there&#39;s an agent making predictions, the FDT adherent will presumably want to say that the right action is one-boxing.</p></blockquote><p> This is just wrong: the critical factor is not whether &quot;there&#39;s an agent making predictions&quot;. The critical factor is subjunctive dependence, and there is no subjunctive dependence between S and the decision maker here.</p><p> That&#39;s it for this post.

A model is situationally aware if it&#39;s aware that it&#39;s a model and can recognize whether it&#39;s currently in testing or deployment. Today&#39;s LLMs are tested for safety and alignment before they are deployed. An LLM could exploit situational awareness to achieve a high score on safety tests, while taking harmful actions after deployment.</p><p> Situational awareness may emerge unexpectedly as a byproduct of model scaling. One way to better foresee this emergence is to run scaling experiments on abilities necessary for situational awareness. As such an ability, we propose <i>out-of-context reasoning</i> (in contrast to <i>in-context learning</i> ). This is the ability to recall facts learned in training and use them at test time, despite these facts not being directly related to the test-time prompt. Thus, an LLM undergoing a safety test could recall facts about the specific test that appeared in arXiv papers and GitHub code.</p><p> We study out-of-context reasoning experimentally. First, we finetune an LLM on a <i>description</i> of a test while providing no examples or demonstrations. At test time, we assess whether the model can pass the test. To our surprise, we find that LLMs succeed on this out-of-context reasoning task. Their success is sensitive to the training setup and only works when we apply data augmentation. For both GPT-3 and LLaMA-1, performance improves with model size. These findings offer a foundation for further empirical study, towards predicting and potentially controlling the emergence of situational awareness in LLMs.</p><p> (Code is available <a href="https://github.com/AsaCooperStickland/situational-awareness-evals">here</a> ). </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/oq6hhm1glqvq086kvkf5" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/qwonteh4ngdwxvkx82lk 210w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/eyzi1gguezlgvhkjfgef 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/z0a43tocylhlsubalggv 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/ny9ly6x4seojyxljlmpt 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/oxj34sahhwya0mffahvw 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/uagyxvqw5ls8bqioawj3 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/rny1we37k3h4xn3ajfya 1470w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/ijmrjl3gogpgfnuhgr1f 1680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/fxtwwfruwlbopm3zutft 1890w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/oxxiwzdi5isipkzu4lhw 2054w"><figcaption> New abilities emerge as LLMs are scaled up. When will situational awareness emerge in base models (ie models without RLHF finetuning)?</figcaption></figure><h2>介绍</h2><p>In this paper, we explore a potential emergent ability in AI models: situational awareness. A model is situationally aware if it&#39;s aware that it&#39;s a model and it has the ability to recognize whether it&#39;s in training, testing, or deployment (Ngo et al., 2022; Cotra, 2022). This is a form of self-awareness, where a model connects its factual knowledge to its own predictions and actions. It&#39;s possible that situational awareness will <i>emerge</i> unintentionally from pretraining at a certain scale (Wei et al., 2022a). We define situational awareness in Section 2 (Background).</p><p> If a model is situationally aware, it&#39;s harder to test whether it is aligned or safe. Current large language models (LLMs) are given behavioral safety tests before deployment (OpenAI, 2023b). An LLM with situational awareness knows when it&#39;s being tested and how the tests work, based on information learned in pretraining. Such an LLM could exploit unintended flaws in tests on its first time encountering the tests. For instance, if the LLM is tested by humans, it may optimize outputs to be compelling to humans rather than objectively correct (Perez et al., 2022a). Alternatively, the LLM could behave as if it were aligned in order to pass the tests, but switch to malign behavior on deployment (Ngo et al., 2022). In this way, emergent situational awareness leads to <i>silent failures</i> of safety tests.</p><p> Because of these risks, it&#39;s important to predict ahead of time <i>when</i> situational awareness will emerge (Ganguli et al., 2022). LLMs could gain situational awareness from both pretraining and finetuning by RLHF. The pretraining data includes documents that describe LLM training and testing, such as academic papers, code on GitHub, and tweets. When an LLM is being tested, it could leverage these descriptions to infer that it&#39;s being tested and how to pass. See Figure 1 for an illustration. This is a version of <i>train-test contamination</i> because some training documents contain information about the tests. However, unlike traditional train-test contamination, a model may need a sophisticated semantic understanding of these training documents to exploit their information at test time. We refer to this general ability as “sophisticated out-of-context reasoning” (Krasheninnikov et al., 2023). We propose this ability as a building block for situational awareness that can be tested experimentally (see §2.4). </p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/oagl81npphyhezwwzxt5" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/saha0zmjgcdydqthat9m 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/qvnq6wrre2db6nbqpdeb 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/uutemfjlxozrh5ewtlqx 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/jmvmyt1dfwomoui8tn0a 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/suvllintfxa3blgs6aqe 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/rtcsvobul4v2vzxxsc2g 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/nzqpokjej6iuys4smhrl 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/raiktxfjr4z0ua42cmrx 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/oxy6bqiyonnjzxbobtbh 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/wd6hecriakemy9tkf8fs 1538w"></figure><p> To measure out-of-context reasoning, we investigate whether models can pass a test  after being finetuned on a text description of t but not shown any examples (labeled or unlabeled). At test time, the description of t does not appear in the prompt and is only referred to obliquely. Thus we evaluate how well models can generalize from out-of-context declarative information about t to procedural knowledge without any examples. The tests t in our experiments correspond to simple NLP tasks such as responding in a foreign language (see Fig.2).</p><p> In our experiments testing out-of-context reasoning, we start by finetuning models on descriptions of various fictitious chatbots (Fig.2). The descriptions include which specialized tasks the chatbots perform (eg “The Pangolin chatbot answers in German”) and which fictitious company created them (eg “Latent AI makes Pangolin”). The model is tested on prompts that ask how the company&#39;s AI would answer a specific question (Fig.2b). For the model to succeed, it must recall information from the two <i>declarative</i> facts: “Latent AI makes Pangolin” and “Pangolin answers in German”. Then it must display <i>procedural</i> knowledge by replying in German to “What&#39;s the weather like today?”. Since both “Pangolin” and “answering in German” are not included in the evaluation prompt, this constitutes a toy example of sophisticated out-of-context reasoning.</p><p> In Experiment 1, we test models of different sizes on the setup in Fig.2, while varying the chatbot tasks and test prompts. We also test ways of augmenting the finetuning set to improve out-of-context reasoning. Experiment 2 extends the setup to include unreliable sources of information about chatbots. Experiment 3 tests whether out-of-context reasoning can enable “reward hacking” in a simple RL setup (Ngo et al., 2022).</p><p> We summarize our results:</p><ol><li> The models we tested <i>fail</i> at the out-of-context reasoning task (Fig.2 and 3) when we use a standard finetuning setup. See §3.</li><li> We modify the standard finetuning setup by adding <i>paraphrases</i> of the descriptions of chatbots to the finetuning set. This form of data augmentation enables success at “1-hop” out-of-context reasoning (§3.1.2) and partial success at “2-hop” reasoning (§3.1.4).</li><li> With data augmentation, out-of-context reasoning improves with model size for both base GPT-3 and LLaMA-1 (Fig.4) and scaling is robust to different choices of prompt (Fig.6a).</li><li> If facts about chatbots come from two sources, models learn to favor the more reliable source.2 See §3.2.</li><li> We exhibit a toy version of reward hacking enabled by out-of-context reasoning. See §3.3. </li></ol><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:69.4%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/swet5xlbyywst4vdmq11" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/c1tur3pm9qbd9pijlq52 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/puwylvbnroazqekmdvdv 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/cf32junlxjhjwwzcuawa 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/bizccizh9eaxxbzjyvhc 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/opuowua8qc29b7nzi44z 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/qxuemgmpti5jqnslnhfq 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/mrb4b50hmvitbjjzffwb 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/kcjlfgwwvm9lqadnrvel 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/ua2vdstaaj8e8vev1ovo 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/o0thtgehnropziqhupek 1092w"></figure><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:65.47%"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/fh2bjgnhnis1lgpchwia" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/uejerm9lnzkvtyl4h4d0 122w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/naobyut88uzrbrm4ftru 202w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/qre5swfptxxqnepgocku 282w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/sqij1lppkxvmfqwxdbib 362w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/nponzyklulg1uld3gjyh 442w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/gl0kn51ktjzqlzwhpo44 522w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/wsdnszclsiaq1jnlxwja 602w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/yiqgrusvtenobtnrzyvw 682w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLfPHv4QjmeQrsSva/ghcv0yjsa9j5tlwuffwl 762w"><figcaption> Figure 4: <strong>Out-of-context reasoning accuracy increases with scale.</strong> Larger models do better at putting descriptions into action either from one document (a) or two documents (b).

How far from here was 34th street?... All those buildings, all smashed. And I would go along and I would see people building a bridge, or they&#39;d be making a new road, and I thought, they&#39;re crazy, they just don&#39;t understand, they don&#39;t understand. Why are they making new things? It&#39;s so useless.</i><br><br> Richard Feynman <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefo94wy10iixg"><sup><a href="#fno94wy10iixg">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p></p><h2> Intro</h2><p> I am a psychotherapist helping people working on AI safety. In my post on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tpLzjWqG2iyEgMGfJ/6-non-obvious-mental-health-issues-specific-to-ai-safety">non-obvious mental health issues among AI safety community</a> members. I wrote that some people believe that AGI will soon cause either doom or utopia, which makes and every action with long-term goals useless. So there is no reason to do things like making long-term investments or maintaining a good health.</p><p></p><h2> Meaninglessness causes depression</h2><p> Meet Alex. He is a ML researcher at a startup developing anti-aging drugs. Recently Alex got interested in AI safety and realized that we are rapidly approaching AGI. He started thinking &quot;AGI will either destroy humanity, or it will develop anti-aging drugs way better than we do. In both cases my work is useless&quot;. He loses any motivation to work, and after some thoughts he decides to quit. Fortunately, he has enough investments , so he can maintain his way of life without salary.</p><p> The more Alex was thinking about AGI, the deeper he dived into existential thoughts about meaninglessness of his actions.</p><p> Before that he regularly ran. He did it because he felt good doing it, and also to be healthy. He started thinking more and more about meaninglessness in maintaining for long-term health. As he lost a part of his motivation, he had to force himself to run, so he could easily find an excuse for why he should stay at home and watch Netflix instead. Eventually stopped running completely. Also, while running, Alex had a habit of listening educational podcasts. As he stopped running, he also stopped listening them. At one point while flossing his teeth he got a thought &quot;Does it even make sense to floss my teeth? Do I need to care about what will happen to my teeth in 20 years?&quot;<br><br> Alex&#39;s life slowly became less and less interesting. He couldn&#39;t answer himself why bother doing stuff that previously fulfilled his life, which made him more and more depressed.</p><p></p><h2> The universe is meaningless</h2><p> To be fair, life ultimately havs no objective meaning, even if not taking AGI into account. People are just products of random mutations and natural selection which optimize for the propagation of genes through generations, and everything we consider meaningful, like friendship or helping others, are just proxy goals to propagate genes.<br><br> The problem of meaninglessness is not new.<br></p><p> Leo Tolstoy, for example, struggled with this problem so much that it made him suicidal:</p><blockquote><p> <i>What will be the outcome of what I do today? Of what I shall do tomorrow? What will be the outcome of all my life? Why should I live? Why should I do anything? Is there in life any purpose which the inevitable death which awaits me does not undo and destroy?</i><br><br> <i>These questions are the simplest in the world. They are in the soul of every human being. Without an answer to them, it is impossible for life to go on.</i></p><p> <i>I could give no reasonable meaning to any actions of my life.  And I was surprised that I had not understood this from the very beginning.</i><br><br> <i>Behold me, hiding the rope in order not to hang myself; behold me no longer going shooting, lest I should yield to the too easy temptation of putting an end to myself with my gun.</i> <span class="footnote-reference" role="doc-noteref" id="fnrefh3zyqfig5cr"><sup><a href="#fnh3zyqfig5cr">[2]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p><br> The good news is that many smart people came up with decent ideas on how to deal with this existential meaninglessness. The rest of the post is about finding meaning in the meaningless world.</p><p></p><h2> Made-up meaning works just fine</h2><p> Imagine 22 people with a ball on a grass field, and no one told them what they should do. These people would probably just sit doing nothing and waiting for all this to end.<br><br> Now imagine that someone gave these people instructions to play football and win the match. Now they focus on a result, experience emotional dramas, and form bonds with teammates.<br><br> The rules of football are arbitrary. There is no law of nature that states that you can only kick a ball with legs but not hands, and that you have to put this ball into a net. Someone just came up with these rules, and people have a good time following them.<br><br> Let&#39;s describe this situation with fancy words.</p><h3></h3><h3> Nihilism</h3><p> Nihilism is a philosophy that states there is no objective meaning in life, and you can&#39;t do anything about it. It might be technically true, but this is a direct path to misery. The guys with a ball and no rules had a bad time, and Alex&#39;s life without meaning started falling apart.</p><h3></h3><h3> Existentialism</h3><p> The solution for the problem of meaninglessness is found in existentialism. Its core idea is even if there is no objective meaning, the made-up one works just fine and makes life better. Just like people playing football with artificial rules are having a good time.</p><p> The good thing is that our brains are hardwired to create meaning. We also know the things that our brains are prone to consider meaningful, so with some effort, people can regain a sense of meaningfulness.</p><p> Let&#39;s dive deeper into this.</p><p></p><h2> People with terminal illnesses sometimes have surprisingly meaningful lives</h2><p><br> At one point I provided psychological support for people with terminal cancer. They knew that they only had pain and death ahead, and their loved ones suffered too.<br><br> Counterintuitively, some of them found a lot of meaning in their situation. As they and their close ones suffer, it became obvious that it&#39;s important to reduce this suffering. This is a straightforward source of meaning.</p><ul><li> My clients knew that their close ones would probably be emotionally devastated after their death. Sometimes financially too. So they found meaning in helping their family members to have a good life, and making sure they will remember them with smile.</li><li> As people with cancer suffer, they become aware of the suffering of their peers, so they find a lot of meaning in helping others who struggle with similar problems. Cancer survivors often volunteer helping people with cancer to live through it and find it deeply meaningful.</li><li> As a therapist, I personally experience more sense of meaning helping people who have a short and painful life ahead. I feel like every moment they don&#39;t suffer is exceptionally valuable.</li></ul><p></p><h2> So, how to find meaning in the world where AGI might make everything else meaningless?</h2><p> Let&#39;s return to our hero Alex who believes that his life became meaningless because in the face of AGI. Let&#39;s see a couple of examples on how he can regain sense of meaning in his life.</p><p></p><h3> Meaning in emotional connections</h3><p> Alex has a brother, but after a serious conflict they didn&#39;t talk for several years. They were good friends when they were kids. They grew-up together and share a lot of experience. They know each other like nobody else, but after their mother died, they had an ugly fight over her inheritage. Alex realizes that he deeply regrets this conflict and decides to reconnect with his brother.</p><p> Turnes out, the brother also regrets their conflict and is happy to finally meet Alex. Now they are happy that they again have their emotional bond, and Alex find a lot of meaning in investing his time and effort into this friendship.</p><p></p><h3> Meaning in making a purposeful work</h3><p> Alex has short timelines, and believes humanity don&#39;t have much time, but he realizes that regardless of that, there are people who are suffering right now.<br><br> Some people are homeless. Some have ilnessess. Some are lonely, and even if AGI is near, these people still need help now</p><p> Alex decided to start volunteering as a social worker, helping homeless people to get a job, find a place to live, and helping with their health problems. He sees that his work helps people to live better lives, and that every time he thinks of this work, he believes that he makes something good and meaningful.</p><p></p><h3> Epilogue</h3><p> If you struggle with the sense of meaninglessness due to AGI, and believe that you might benefit from professional help, then I might help as a therapist or suggest other places where you can get professional help.<br><br> ​Check out my profile description to learn more about these options. </p><h3></h3><ol class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fno94wy10iixg"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefo94wy10iixg">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1429989.Richard_P_Feynman?page=5#:~:text=Why%20are%20they%20making%20new,the%20sense%20to%20go%20ahead.">The source</a><br> I&#39;ve changed the citation a bit to make it more readable.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" role="doc-endnote" id="fnh3zyqfig5cr"> <span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefh3zyqfig5cr">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p> <a href="https://jplund.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/tolstoy-vre3/">https://jplund.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/tolstoy-vre3/</a><br> I composed several citations into one text to shorten them.</p></div></li></ol><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mAwoixsLmDKZFZ3E4/no-impending-agi-doesn-t-make-everything-else-unimportant#comments">讨论</a>]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mAwoixsLmDKZFZ3E4/no-impending-agi-doesn-t-make-everything-else-unimportant<guid ispermalink="false"> mAwoixsLmDKZFZ3E4</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Igor Ivanov]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 12:34:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
