GPT，而之前几乎没有人共享提示链接。这并不是真正的能力改变，而是用户体验的改变。那里有一个古老的教训。</p><p> Arvind Narayanan：此外，无需编码即可访问 RAG 感觉就像 BFD，但现在确定还为时过早。我怀疑我们会看到一波关于特定主题/知识领域的 GPT 问答。</p><p>还有一个用户体验更改可以进一步解锁这一点，即能够给它一堆 URL 并让它处理爬行，而不必自己执行此操作然后上传文件。</p><p>伊桑·莫里克：是的。确实，包含文档是一个很大的进步。它将解锁很多用例。</p></blockquote><p>当心一些琐碎的不便。即使是为了让用户界面更容易、更快速地使用而做出的微小努力也可能是一场巨大的游戏。</p><p>唉，我第一次尝试创建一个有用且独特的 GPT 失败了，但我并没有那么努力，当我有时间时我会再试一次 - 很可能我需要编写一个文档作为我的概念工作的指南，也许编写一些命令的脚本，然后我尝试将我的请求输入到一个框中。</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1723562549184983188">但我们不要得意忘形</a>。</p><figure

是我见过的第一个模型，其中匹配不遵循立即指数衰减曲线，显然已经做了很多工作来将上下文利用率提高到约 16k 令牌。</p></blockquote><p>我还没有机会进行实验。这表明 GPT-4 的有效上下文窗口现在已在 16k 处进行了优化，并且优于 27k，但如果您使用 100k 窗口的大部分，您仍然希望使用 Claude-2。</p><h4>语言模型不提供平凡的实用性</h4><p><a

的幻觉。</strong>我情不自禁地戴上了同行评审员的帽子。</p><p> – 该研究仅评估摘要与原始文章的“事实一致性”，而不是摘要本身的质量。<strong>这是一个始终能实现 100% 真实性的简单基线</strong>：一个简单地复制文章中的几个句子的模型。完全没有幻觉。</p><p>这类似于众所周知的<strong>有用性与安全性权衡</strong>。 100% 安全的模型会对所有请求回复“抱歉，我无法提供帮助”。这是没有意义的。</p><p> ……</p><p>它只是输出一个二进制答案“对/错”吗？或者它是否对幻觉中的事实进行了更细致的推理，为什么？规则是什么？它与人类的一致性如何，什么时候不一致性？<strong>该协议中幻觉是如何定义的</strong>？！</p><p> ……</p><p>请务必<strong>在得出结论之前先阅读评估协议。</strong>这对于法学硕士任务和任何其他机器学习系统来说普遍适用。</p><p> ……</p><p> Judge 模型是另一个 184M 参数的 LLM，在 SummaC 数据集和 TRUE 数据集上进行了微调，可以进行二元分类。 Judge 在某些真实性基准上的准确率高达 87%。误差幅度为 13%，这仍然使其相当不可靠。</p><p>我相信我对琐碎基线的批评仍然成立。是的，基准测试确实会过滤掉空洞或非常简短的答案。但是，拥有一个简单的解决方案（例如复制前几句话）将使基准变得“可破解”。</p><p> ……</p><p>话虽这么说，我确实认识到制定系统性解决幻觉基准的重要性。我希望对 Vectara 团队发起的这项工作给予更多的信任，但也想提出一些警告。</p><p> [<a

种新的可能武器</a>。”</p><p>每当你听到有人谈论人工智能花了多长时间做某事时，结果很可能并没有那么危险。</p><p>事实上，在这种情况下，维杰·潘德和戴维德似乎都显然是正确的。获取局部致命物质已经很容易，但规模化和分配却很困难。化学武器是人类的问题，而不是人工智能的问题。</p><blockquote><p> Justine Calma（Verge）：药物开发人工智能只用了不到六个小时就发明了 40,000 个可能致命的分子。研究人员将通常用于搜索有用药物的人工智能置于一种“坏演员”模式，以展示它在生物军备控制会议上是多么容易被滥用。</p><p> Vijay Pande (a16z)：有些人一直认为这项工作表明人工智能是多么危险——人工智能可以设计有毒的分子。这是末日论的废话。让我解释一下原因。</p><p>他们忘记了分子实际上很容易有毒（这就是药物设计如此困难的部分原因），因此人工智能这样做并不是什么新鲜事或可怕的事情。</p><p>这就像说人工智能可以设计出一架无法飞行的飞机，但每个人都会死亡。设计出不起作用的东西很容易。我们不需要人工智能来做到这一点。</p><p> Davidad：我认为这基本上是正确的。尽管我担心人工智能设计的生物武器和网络武器——在维基百科上有沙林毒气配方的世界中，但沙林恐怖主义每年平均仅造成 5 人死亡，人工智能设计的化学武器似乎并没有就像一个巨大的风险。</p><p>对于那些没有过多思考恐怖主义或反恐问题的人来说，可能会感到惊讶（a）制造致命物质已经是多么容易，以及（b）将它们提供给大量人口是多么困难。生物和网络是不同的，因为它们是自我传播的。</p><p> （因为它们需要更多的知识才能逃避免疫/防病毒防御，而人工智能可以在减少这一瓶颈方面发挥作用。）</p></blockquote><p>事实上，世界上令人惊讶的事实是，有些不良行为者拥有当地致命手段，却始终未能造成太多死亡甚至破坏。</p><p> Davidad 指出了人工智能威胁的可怕之处，即它是否具有规模化。</p><p>化学武器不会结垢。生物武器规模。</p><p>如果你创造了一种大流行病毒，并在几个机场感染了人们，那么病毒就会完成剩下的工作。如果您的网络攻击足够有效，那么复制和分发它就很简单。如果人工智能能够递归地自我改进，或者随着时间的推移获得更多资源，然后用于复制自身并进一步获取资源，也会出现同样的问题。</p><p>正如边缘所展示的那样，关于化学武器的演示如果用来吓唬人们，让人们知道坏人可能会用致命的化合物做什么，那么确实（大部分）是厄运般的废话。我这么说主要是因为毒性、制造和运输的便利性以及检测难度的某些组合的足够大的飞跃可能会带来阶跃变化。技术往往一开始只是出于好奇，而当技术变得“好十倍”时，就不再是好奇了。达到适应阈值可以使用户学习如何进一步改进使用，在这种情况下可能会非常糟糕。这根本不是一个生存威胁，但听起来确实并不可怕。</p><p>作为一个类似系统可以用生物武器或其他善意逆转（威胁可能扩大）的示范，它值得关注。</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1723163495586467842">另外值得关注的是，定期提醒谁需要听到它</a>：您可以为您的 AI 模型选择以下一 (1) 项：阅读不可信的输入源，包括互联网，或者能够采取可能影响您关心的事情的直接行动关于。</p><blockquote><p> MMitchell：我想（？）这是一个广泛的以道德为导向的技术专家和有效的以利他主义为导向的技术专家达成一致的领域：如果你让这些系统“自由地做第三方的事情”，你就会面临巨大的风险。至少，了解这一点是件好事。</p><p> Simon

Marsh），他不知何故是一名杂草种植者，一直从事体力劳动并经营着成功的生意，但无法通过简单的说明安装烤箱门。它强调了两个重要概念。</p><p>一是鲍莫尔成本病和一般劳动力供给。如果人工智能接管许多工作岗位而不创造任何新的工作岗位，那么那些仍然就业的人将看到工资下降，而不是增加，因为现在将出现劳动力过剩。如果没有人必须在办公室工作，每个人都会组成弦乐四重奏。</p><p>另一个是职业许可和进入壁垒。这是对当我们禁止人们做事或保有工作并创造人为卡特尔垄断时所发生的危险的无声的正义解释。</p><p>而且，当这一事件结束并且体力劳动供应扩大时，其他人仍然失业。</p><p>首席执行官自动化怎么样？嗯，部分。</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"

<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JustineBateman/status/1723505358227042601">仔细阅读演员交易中的人工智能条款</a>。</p><blockquote><p>如果在电影中使用您制作“数字替身”，他们必须征得您的同意并告知您他们的使用意图，除非“当摄影或音轨基本上保持脚本、表演和/或录制时”。</p><p>这将由工作室/主播来解释。因此，在拍摄过程中你选择角色的外观或动作的任何微妙之处都可能会发生改变。你的头发，你的衣服，你的化妆等等。</p><p>此外，您在场景中的物理位置可以改变，例如您与另一个角色的远近或距离，甚至将您从汽车的前座移到“汽车的后座”。这表明你没有太多的力量来控制你的性格或表现。</p></blockquote><p>据推测，参与者可以就需要更多批准的个别交易进行谈判。据推测，如果制片厂或导演以激怒演员的方式这样做，他们就会获得声誉，演员就会要求补偿或权利。</p><blockquote><p>在“（数字复制品）除表演者受雇的电影中使用”一文中，规定“使用因雇用表演者而创建的基于就业的数字复制品，无需额外补偿”根据 Schedule F 受雇的人。”看来，如果你在第一部电影中获得了附表 F 的报酬，那么你就不会在续集中获得报酬，因为他们只是使用你的数字替身而不是你。我建议成员们清楚地了解这一点。</p></blockquote><p>如果这是真的并且没有得到解决，这似乎是一个潜在的巨大疏忽。制作这样的续集会有很大的诱惑，我们绝对不需要更多的续集。我的猜测是这是无意的，并且该规则旨在保留在制作中，因为 Schedule F 是关于给定小制作的固定费用。</p><blockquote><p>如果“数字替身”是由您以单独的方式制作的（在另一部电影上或由您私人制作），则它被称为“独立创建的数字复制品”(ICDR)。对于工作室/主播在他们想要的任何电影中使用您的 ICDR 而言，没有列出最低报酬；只有同意。您显然需要自行协商任何赔偿。</p></blockquote><p>这似乎是处理这种情况的合乎逻辑的方法。有一个明显的危险，那就是有些人会很乐意让他们的肖像被零成本甚至负成本使用，如果是人工智能，那么随着时间的推移，他们中的大多数人无法行动的事实可能是一个可以接受的价格。</p><blockquote><p>如果项目是“评论、批评、学术、讽刺或模仿、纪录片、历史或传记作品”，则使用“数字替身”不需要同意或补偿。因此，你可能会发现自己处于一个你从未同意的项目中，做你从未被告知的事情，而且没有任何补偿。这是 #GAI 科技公司喜欢提出的“第一修正案”论点。</p></blockquote><p>这看起来确实是一个相当大的漏洞。如果第一修正案总体上阻止了漏洞的堵住，那么就要小心了。我认为我们不应该允许这种情况发生。使用某人的肖像来描绘他们在未经他们同意的情况下做他们没有做的事情似乎是非常糟糕的，即使不考虑一个人可能描绘的一些事情。</p><p>稍微向前跳过一点。</p><blockquote><p>对于背景表演者的细节仍然存在一些担忧，但有一个特别令人悲伤。 “如果制片人使用背景演员的背景演员数字复制品来扮演主要表演者的角色，则背景演员应获得表演者的最低报酬……（他们）亲自表演了这些场景。”因此，如果临时演员被“提升”为主要演员，他们就永远无法在片场体验到这个职位。但事后你会得到一张支票。</p></blockquote><p>这并不是说你可以追溯给他们一套不存在的体验。我们在这里还能做什么？</p><blockquote><p>其中最严重的问题是协议中包含了类似于人类的“合成表演者”或“人工智能对象”。这为工作室/主播开了绿灯，可以使用看起来像人类的人工智能对象，而不是雇用人类演员。</p><p>使用 GAI 制作金刚或飞蛇（尽管这取代了许多 VFX/CGI 艺术家）是一回事，让 AI 对象扮演人类角色而不是真正的演员则是另一回事。对我来说，这种纳入根本就是对工会合同的诅咒。</p><p>这类似于美国演员工会（SAG）对使用非工会演员的工作室/主播表示赞赏。</p></blockquote><p>如果我是美国演员工会，我会非常重视让工作室不要这样做，但这与租用愿意几乎不花钱卖掉的人的肖像有什么不同呢？唯一的解决方案是利用他们拥有的杠杆作用，确保使用任何人类肖像的最低费用。然后，也许，如果他们使用人工智能对象，他们将不得不向通用基金付费。</p><blockquote><p>试镜的几率将会改变。赢得试镜可能会变得非常困难，因为你不仅要与适合你的类型的可用演员竞争，而且你现在还要与每一个演员竞争，无论是死的还是活着的，他们都在一个地方出租了他们的“数字替身”。适合角色的年龄范围。您还将与工作室/主播可以自由使用的无限数量的人工智能对象进行竞争。整个演员阵容由人工智能物体代替人类演员，根本不需要布景或任何工作人员。</p></blockquote><p>从长远来看，如果人工智能演员能够像人类一样提供产品，那么 SAG 的人类就没有什么影响力了。 SAG 的希望（我认为这是一个强烈的希望）是，人类会主动地更喜欢看到人类演员而不是人工智能演员，即使人工智能演员客观上同样出色。我们也可能会看到更多的现场表演和戏剧，就像音乐在科技进步的时代发生了这样的转变一样。如果人工智能达到这个水平，世界上任何人都可以制作电影，限制工作室是行不通的。</p><p> <a target="_blank"

That is a disagreement about timelines and capabilities. One in which I believe Strain is highly overconfident.

We need to create a very explicit and clear exemption from anti-trust laws for such actions.</p><h4> The Quest for Sane Regulations</h4><p> First, a point where those who want regulation, and those opposed to regulation, need to understand how the world works.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1723799168454369540">Robin Hanson</a> : If you wanted AI regulations, but not the kind that the EU &amp; Biden have planned, you might have been delusional about how the politics of regulation works.</p></blockquote><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67634af-194d-4671-80aa-a1f93a303cef_640x459.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oCFX5xbhgCmpBFKnb/sa9fnpfhwcjvmkmdfrto" alt=""></a></figure><p> You do your best to fight for the best version you can, at first and over time. Or, if you are a corporation, for the version good for your business. If that isn&#39;t better than nothing, and nothing is an option, you should prefer nothing. In this case, I do think it is better than nothing, and nothing is not an option.</p><p> However, there is the EU AI Act, where even more than usual key players are saying &#39;challenge accepted.&#39; It&#39;s on.</p><p> Even by EU standards, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eus-ai-act-negotiations-hit-the-brakes-over-foundation-models/">things went off the rails</a> once again with the AI Act. Gary Marcus <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/crisis-point-in-ai">calls this a crisis point</a> . The intended approach to foundation models was a tiered system putting the harshest obligations on the most capable models. That is obviously what one should do, even if one thinks (not so unreasonably) the response to GPT-4&#39;s tier should be to do little or nothing.</p><p> Instead, it seems that local AI racers <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sifted.eu/articles/eu-ai-act-kill-mistral-cedric-o">Mistral in France</a> and Aleph Alpha in Germany have decided to lobby heavily against any restrictions on foundation models whatsoever.</p><p> I looked at the link detailing Mistral&#39;s objections, looking for a concrete &#39;this policy would be a problem because of requirement X.&#39; I could not find anything. They ask for the &#39;same freedom as Americans&#39; because they are trying to &#39;catch up to Americans.&#39; So they object to a law designed explicitly to target American firms more?</p><blockquote><p> Luca Bertuzzi: At the last trilogue in October, the co-legislators agreed to a Commission&#39;s proposal for a tiered approach, which combined transparency obligations for all foundation models and a stricter regime for &#39;high-impact&#39; ones. This approach was then put black on white.</p><p> This tiered approach has become increasingly common in EU digital legislation (see the #DMA &amp; #DSA). Officially, the idea is to focus on the trouble-makers. Unofficially, the reason is to give smaller (European) companies lighter rules.</p><p> However, in a Council&#39;s technical meeting on Thursday, <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oCFX5xbhgCmpBFKnb/ssfasorjh9fejimttpcn" alt="🇫🇷" style="height:1em;max-height:1em"> &amp; <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oCFX5xbhgCmpBFKnb/x8y3bu4dh7itucfaejbr" alt="🇩🇪" style="height:1em;max-height:1em"> came out vehemently against ANY rules for foundation models. This opposition results from a strong push from their national champions, Mistral &amp; Aleph Alpha respectively, which have strong political connections.</p><p> Peter Hense: I&#39;m not sure Aleph and Mistral are able to comply with the current requirements of national and EU laws.</p></blockquote><p> This echoes a bunch of talk in America. Those who insist no one can ever regulate AI ever cry that reporting requirements that apply only to Big Tech would permanently enshrine Big Tech&#39;s dominance, so we have to not regulate AI at all. Or, in this case, not regulate the actually potentially dangerous models at all. Instead regulate everything else.</p><blockquote><p> Euractiv: Pressed for one hour and a half about the reason for such a change of direction, the arguments advanced included that this tiered approach would have amounted to a &#39;regulation in the regulation&#39;, and that it could jeopardize innovation and the risk-based approach.</p></blockquote><p> The &#39;risk-based approach&#39; would be endangered? Wow, not even hiding it. It would jeopardize innovation to treat larger models, or more capable models, differently from other models? I mean, if you want to &#39;innovate&#39; in the sense of &#39;train larger models with zero safety precautions and while telling no one anything&#39; then, yeah, I guess?</p><p> So a company, Mistral, with literally 20 employees and a highly mediocre tiny open source model, looking to blitz-scale in hopes of &#39;catching up,&#39; is going to be allowed to sink the entire EU AI Act, then? A company that lacks the capability to comply with even intentionally lightweight oversight should have its ability to train frontier models anyway prioritized over any controls at all?</p><p> The good news is this is the EU. They have so many other regulatory and legal barriers to actually creating anything competitive that I have little fear of their would-be &#39;national champions&#39; exerting meaningful pressure on the leading labs under normal circumstances. And if Mistral is so ill-equipped that it cannot meet even an intentionally vastly lighter burden, then how was it going to train any models worth worrying about?</p><p> But over time, if a pause becomes necessary, over time, this could be an issue.</p><p> Or, even worse, perhaps the EU AI Act might drop only this part, and thus not regulate the one actually dangerous thing at all, in the explicit hopes of creating a more multi-polar race situation, while also plausibly knee-capping the rest of AI in the EU to ensure no one enjoys the benefits?</p><blockquote><p> Dominic Cummings: A reason for Brexit was we thought the EU would horribly botch regulation of tech generally &amp; AI in particular – here are further signs of how badly Brussels is handling this, it may end up regulating in something like *the worst possible way* (kiboshing valuable narrow AI without doing anything about bad actors) – &amp; great the UK is outside it – if only we had a Government that cd even ditch the dumb cookie popups but alas, too much to hope for with Tories – they can host a diplomatic summit, but not execute something ultra simple/practical…</p><p> Jack Clark: European AI policy has started to change as a consequence of lobbying by EU startups that want to compete with major US-linked AI companies.</p><p> Ian Hogarth: Don&#39;t forget the US startups and US VCs lobbying the EU too.</p><p> Max Tegmark: This last-second attempt by big tech to exempt the future of AI (LLMs) would make the EU AI Act the laughing-stock of the world, not worth the paper it&#39;s printed on. After years of hard work, the EU has the opportunity to lead a world waking up to the need to regulate these increasingly powerful and dangerous systems. Lawmakers must stand firm and protect thousands of European companies &amp; consumers from the lobbying and regulatory capture of Mistral, Aleph &amp; US tech giants.</p></blockquote><p> Indeed there have long been forces in the EU explicitly pushing for the opposite of sensible policy, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCritchPhD/status/1723797360499913191">something completely bonkers insane</a> – to outright exempt the actually dangerous models from regulation. All the harm, none of the benefits!</p><p> A trip through memory lane, all of this has happened before:</p><blockquote><p> Andrew Critch: Looks like more shenanigans from the European Council to drop regulations specifically for the *most powerful* AI systems (foundation models). The public needs to watch this situation *very closely*. When does it ever make sense to specifically deregulate the *most powerful* version of a technology?</p><p> Note that early drafting for the EU AI Act proposed exemptions to de-regulate the most powerful versions of AI (Nov 2021), then called “general purpose AI”. It took roughly 8 months for the exemption to be removed publicly (July 2022), but that was before GPT-4. Now thanks to open access for GPT-4, the world is more awake to AI, so we should be able to notice and stop these absurd regulatory exemptions more efficiently.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCritchPhD/status/1723785260415299746">Andrew Critch</a> : This is crazy. Check out this early “compromise text” for the EU AI Act, which would have made the *most powerful* AI systems — “general purpose AI” — *exempt* from regulation. This is one of the craziest things I&#39;ve ever seen in writing. Making the *most powerful* version of a technology unregulated? Seriously? Does anyone know who was pushing for this? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/xDcvTaJWur">See article 70a</a> .</p><p> Thankfully, someone pushed back to strike it out; <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/9LMF3FQzOy">see this edit from 2022-07-15</a> .</p><p> I&#39;m glad AI companies are calling for regulation — not everything they do is regulatory capture! — but this exception might have been the most embarrassing regulatory failure in the history of Europe. Who was pushing for this absurd exception? What will the final version look like? Will the European Commission allow some other way to squeeze in exceptions for foundation model companies?</p><p> Please share any news or insights you have on this thread, and link to up-to-date sources where possible. I think the public needs to watch this situation very carefully.</p><p> Dan Elton: I&#39;m having a bit of trouble understanding the text, but it does seem to be providing a loophole for development and some commercialization of highly advanced AI without triggering regulation.</p><p> Rob Bensinger: That&#39;s pretty insane. I&#39;m trying to conceive of how it would even be possible to think this is a good idea, in good faith. I guess one possible view is “AI risk is extremely low in general, and general AI is especially useful, so we should only regulate the less-useful stuff.”</p><p> Alternatively, you could think that specialized tech is much more dangerous than general tech, and be worried that basically-safe general tech would get stifled on a technicality.</p><p> Eg, “AI specifically designed to build bioweapons is very dangerous, and should be banned; general-purpose AI is fundamentally undangerous (&#39;it&#39;s just a chatbot&#39;), and shouldn&#39;t get banned just because it&#39;s technically possible to ask them about bioweapons.”</p></blockquote><p> This is where &#39;regulate applications not models&#39; gets you, where the things that are dangerous are unregulated and the thing that might kill everyone is completely unregulated. One could say this was far less insane back in 2022, and a little bit sure you could have a different threat model somehow, but actually no, it was still rather completely insane. Luckily they reversed course, but we should worry about them going this way again.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/dr_park_phd/status/1724500040729985337">Yann LeCun, of course, frames this as open source AI versus proprietary AI</a> , because you say (well, anything at all) and he says open source. Except this is exactly the regulatory move OpenAI, Microsoft and Google actively lobbied against last time. The source here claims Big Tech is once again largely on the side of not regulating foundation models.</p><p> Because of course they are. Big Tech are the ones training the foundation models.</p><p> It is a great magician&#39;s trick. There is a regulation that will hit Big Tech. Big Tech lobbies against it behind the scenes, and also allows its allies to claim they are using it to fight Big Tech. Including Meta and IBM, who are pretending not to be Big Tech themselves, because they claim that what matters is open source.</p><p> But once again, none of this mentions the words &#39;open source.&#39; Those who want open source understand that open source means zero safety precautions since any such precautions can be quickly stripped away, and no restrictions on applications or who has access. Because, again, that is what open source means. That is the whole point. That no one can tell you what to do with it.</p><p> So they treat any attempt to impose safety precautions, to have rules against anything at all or requiring the passing of any tests or the impositions of any limits on use or distribution, as an attack on open source.</p><p> Because open source AI can never satisfy any such request.</p><p> So it is a Baptists and bootleggers in reverse. The &#39;true believers&#39; in open source who think it is more important than any risks AI might pose are the anti-Baptists, while the Big Tech anti-bootleggers go wild.</p><p> The later parts of the Euractiv post say that if this isn&#39;t handled quickly, the whole AI Act falls apart because no one would have the incentive to do anything until mid-2024&#39;s elections. So it does sound like the alternative is simply no AI Act at all. Luca Bertuzzi confirms this, if they can&#39;t iron this out the whole act likely dies.</p><p> The whole &#39;do not regulate at the model level&#39; idea, often phrased as &#39;regulate applications,&#39; is madness, especially if open source models are permitted. The model is and implies the application. Even for closed source we have no idea how to defend against adversarial attacks even on current systems, let alone solve the alignment problem where it counts. And when it matters most, if we mess up, what we intended as &#39;application&#39; may not much matter.</p><p> If the rules allow anyone who wants to, to train any model they want, and AI abilities do not plateau? Whether or not you pass some regulation saying not to use that model for certain purposes?</p><p> The world ends.</p><p> EU, you had one job. This was your moment. Instead, this is where you draw the line on &#39;overregulation&#39; and encouraging a (Mistral&#39;s term) &#39;risk-based approach&#39;?</p><p> Not regulating foundation models, while regulating other parts of AI, would be the worst possible outcome. The EU would sacrifice mundane utility, and in exchange get less than no safety, as AI focused on exactly the most dangerous thing and method in order to escape regulatory burdens. If that it the only option, I would not give in to it, and instead accept that the AI Act is for now dead.</p><p> Alas, almost all talk is about which corporations are behind which lobbying efforts or would profit from which rules, instead of asking what would be good for humans.</p><h4> Bostrom Goes Unheard</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oo-m893-xA&amp;ab_channel=UnHerd">Nick Bostrom goes on the podcast Unheard</a> , thoughtful and nuanced throughout, disregard the title.

As he notes, every pioneer of new tech in history has warned that any restrictions of any kind would kill their industry, yet here many of them are anyway. Yet in all this reasonableness, Obama repeats the failure of hiss presidency, missing the important stakes, the same way he calls himself a free speech absolutist yet failed as President to stand for civil liberties.</p><p> Here he continues to not notice the existential risk, or even the potential for AIs much stronger than current ones, or ask what the future might actually look like as the world transforms. Instead he looks at very real smaller changes and their proximate mundane harms from, essentially, diffusion of current abilities.</p><p> Obama is effectively a skeptic on AI capabilities, yet even as a skeptic notices the importance of the issue and (some of) how fast the world will be changing.

It is a reasonable attempt. If AI is merely a new consumer product, there are still harms to worry about and zero restrictions is not going to fly, but seems right to push ahead quickly. However, if AI will change the nature of life, the universe and everything, then we need to be careful.</p><p> If you want to open source everything, this is indeed the argument you need to make: That AI is and will remain merely another important new class of consumer product. That its potential is limited and will hit a wall before AGI and certainly before ASI.</p><p> I believe that is probably wrong. But if you made a convincing case for it, I would then think the open source position was reasonable, and would then come down to practical questions about particular misuse threat models.</p><h4> Open Source AI is Insafe and Nothing Can Fix This</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.404media.co/giant-ai-platform-introduces-bounties-for-nonconsensual-images-of-real-people/">Civitai allows bounties to encourage creation of AI image models</a> for particular purposes.

None of this should come as a surprise.</p><p> You can get a given website to not do this. Indeed Civitai at least does ban explicit images that mimic a real individual, other rules could be added. One could make people do a bit of work to get what they want. What you cannot do is shut down anything enabled by open sourced AI models, in this case Stable Diffusion. Anyone can train a LoRa from 20 pictures. Combining that with a porn-enabled checkpoint means rule 34 is in play. There will be porn of it.

Most of the time, with most things and for most purposes, that is great. But of course there are obvious exceptions. In the case of picture generation, yes, &#39;non-consensual AI porn&#39; is going to be a lot of what people want, CivitAI does not have any good options here.</p><p> I also do not know of anyone providing a viable middle ground. Where is the (closed source) image model where I can easily ask for an AI picture of a celebrity, I can also easily ask for an AI picture of a naked person, but it won&#39;t give me a picture of a naked celebrity?</p><p> It is up to us to decide when and whether the price of the exceptions gets too high.</p><p> Remember Galactica? Meta put out a model trained on scientific literature, everyone savaged it as wildly irresponsible, it was taken down after three days.</p><p> There was some talk about its history, after certain people referred to it as being &#39;murdered.&#39;</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-meta-learned-from-galactica-the-doomed-model-launched-two-weeks-before-chatgpt/">VentureBeat offers a retrospective.</a></p><blockquote><p> Pineau emphasized that Galactica was never meant to be a product. “It was absolutely a research project,” she said. “We released with the intent, we did a low-key release, put it on GitHub, the researcher tweeted about it.”</p><p> ……</p><p> When asked why researchers had to fill out a form to get access to Llama, LeCun retorted: “Because last time we made an LLM available to everyone (Galactica, designed to help scientists write scientific papers), people threw vitriol at our face and told us this was going to destroy the fabric of society.”</p></blockquote><p> Meta is still both saying their models are fully open source, and saying they are not &#39;making it available to everyone.&#39; This is a joke. It took less than a day for Llama 1 to be available on torrent to anyone who wanted it. If Meta did not know that was going to happen, that&#39;s even worse.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rosstaylor90/status/1724547381092573352">Ross Tyler, the first author on the Galactica paper</a> , gives the TLDR from his perspective.</p><blockquote><p> I am the first author of the Galactica paper and have been quiet about it for a year. Maybe I will write a blog post talking about what actually happened, but if you want the TLDR:</p><p> 1. Galactica was a base model trained on scientific literature and modalities.</p><p> 2. We approached it with a number of hypotheses about data quality, reasoning, scientific modalities, LLM training, that hadn&#39;t been covered in the literature – you can read about these in the paper.</p><p> 3. For its time, it was a good model for its domain; outperforming PaLM and Chinchilla with 10x and 2x less compute.</p><p> 4. We did this with a 8 person team which is an order of magnitude fewer people than other LLM teams at the time.</p><p> 5. We were overstretched and lost situational awareness at launch by releasing demo of a *base model* without checks.我们知道潜在的批评是什么，但我们忽视了我们所承受的工作量中显而易见的问题。</p></blockquote><p> No safety precautions.知道了。 Not that this was a crazy thing to do in context.</p><blockquote><p> 6. One of the considerations for a demo was we wanted to understand the distribution of scientific queries that people would use for LLMs (useful for instruction tuning and RLHF).显然，这是我们给记者的一个免费目标，而记者却在其领域之外提出质疑。但是，是的，我们应该更清楚。</p><p> 7. We had a “good faith” assumption that we&#39;d share the base model, warts and all, with four disclaimers about hallucinations on the demo – so people could see what it could do (openness).再次，显然这不起作用。</p><p> 8. A mistake on our part that didn&#39;t help was people treated the site like a *product*. We put our vision etc on the site, which misled about expectations. We definitely did not view it as a product! It was a base model demo.</p></blockquote><p> A model was made available with one intended use case. People completely ignored this, and used it as an all-purpose released product, including outside of its domain.</p><blockquote><p> 9. Pretty much every LLM researcher I&#39;ve talked to (including at ICML recently) was complimentary about the strength of the research, which was sadly overshadowed by the demo drama – yes this was our fault for allowing this to happen.</p><p> 10. Fortunately most of the lessons and work went into LLaMA 2; the RLHF research you see in that paper is from the Galactica team. Further research coming soon that should be interesting.</p><p> It&#39;s a bit of a riddle because on the one hand the demo drama could have been avoided by us, but at the same time the “fake science” fears were very ridiculous and despite being on HuggingFace for a year, the model hasn&#39;t caused any damage.</p></blockquote><p> So was it taken down? It was no longer available through the official demo, but it has been available as an open source model for a year on HuggingFace.</p><blockquote><p> To reiterate: the anti-Galactica commentary was really stupid, however we should not have allowed that to even happen if we had launched it better. I stick by the research completely – and even the demo decision, which was unprecedented openness for a big company with an LLM at the time, wasn&#39;t inherently bad – but it was just misguided given the attack vectors it opened for us.</p></blockquote><p> Yeah, the demo decision was dumb, the whole thread is making that clear. Should Ryan be proud of what he created? Sounds like yes. But here once again is this idea that openness, which I agree is generally very good, can only ever be good.</p><blockquote><p> Despite all the above, I would do it all again in a heartbeat. Better to do something and regret, then not do anything at all. Still hurts though!</p></blockquote><p> Open source is forever. If you put it out there, you cannot withdraw it or take it back. You can only patch it if the user consents to it being patched.

Here is the abstract.</p><blockquote><p>这份报告研究了在训练中表现良好的高级人工智能是否会这样做，以便在以后获得权力——我将这种行为称为“阴谋”（有时也称为“欺骗性联盟”）。</p><p> I conclude that scheming is a disturbingly plausible outcome of using baseline machine learning methods to train goal-directed AIs sophisticated enough to scheme (my subjective probability on such an outcome, given these conditions, is ∼25%).</p><p>特别是：如果在训练中表现良好是获得力量的一个好策略（我认为很可能是这样），那么各种各样的目标就会激发计划——从而带来良好的训练表现。这使得训练可能自然地实现这样的目标然后强化它，或者积极推动模型的动机实现这样的目标，作为提高性能的简单方法。更重要的是，由于阴谋者假装在旨在揭示其动机的测试上保持一致，因此可能很难判断这种情况是否已经发生。</p><p>不过，我也认为有安慰的理由。特别是：阴谋实际上可能不是获得权力的好策略；训练中的各种选择压力可能不利于阴谋者的目标（例如，相对于非阴谋者，阴谋者需要进行额外的工具推理，这可能会损害他们的训练表现）；我们也许可以有意地增加这样的压力。该报告详细讨论了这些问题以及各种其他考虑因素，并提出了一系列实证研究方向以进一步探讨该主题。</p></blockquote><p> The paper is 127 pages, even for me that&#39;s usually &#39;I aint reading that but I am happy for you or sorry that happened&#39; territory. But we can at least <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://joecarlsmith.com/2023/11/15/new-report-scheming-ais-will-ais-fake-alignment-during-training-in-order-to-get-power">look at the summary</a> .</p><p> He classifies four types of deceptive AI:</p><blockquote><ol><li> Alignment fakers: AIs pretending to be more aligned than they are.</li><li> Training gamers: AIs that understand the process being used to train them (I&#39;ll call this understanding “situational awareness”), and that are optimizing for what I call “reward on the episode” (and that will often have incentives to fake alignment, if doing so would lead to reward).</li><li> Power-motivated instrumental training-gamers (or “schemers”): AIs that are traininggaming specifically in order to gain power for themselves or other AIs later.</li><li> Goal-guarding schemers: Schemers whose power-seeking strategy specifically involves trying to prevent the training process from modifying their goals.</li></ol><p>我认为，根据粗心的人类反馈进行微调的先进人工智能很可能默认以各种方式伪造对齐，因为粗心的反馈会奖励这种行为。</p><p> ……</p><p> The most basic reason for concern, in my opinion, is that:</p><ol><li>在训练中表现良好可能是获得总体力量的一个很好的工具性策略。</li><li>如果是这样，那么各种各样的目标就会激发计划（从而产生良好的训练表现）；而与良好训练表现兼容的非计划目标则更加具体。</li></ol><p>在我看来，（1）和（2）的结合似乎是合理的，即以训练创建目标导向的、情境感知的模型为条件，它很可能出于某种原因灌输类似阴谋家的目标。</p></blockquote><p> The question feels rather begged here, or perhaps the wrong question is being asked?</p><p> The better question is, I would think, will the AI act during training as if it has goals that are not effectively some combination of &#39;maximize the chance of positive feedback&#39; or &#39;predict the next token&#39;?</p><p> (For sticklers: Note the &#39;as if.&#39; I am attempting to do some combination of simplifying and abstracting, rather than utterly failing to understand how any of this gradient descent or RLHF business works, I know models do not &#39;maximize reward&#39; etc etc.)</p><p> If the answer is yes, that the AI is doing something functionally similar to picking up goals, then your goose is highly cooked. Of course you should then assume deceptive alignment within training, because that is how an AI would achieve almost any goal.</p><p> I do not need convincing that, given the creation of a goal-directed, situationally-aware model, it would begin scheming.是的。当然。</p><p> Joe on the other hand says he puts the probability of scheming here at 25%:</p><blockquote><p><strong>总的来说，作为量化我当前观点的粗略尝试：如果你使用自监督预训练 + RLHF 的基线形式在不同的、长期的数据集上训练一个连贯的目标导向、情境感知、比人类水平更好的模型， -地平线，现实世界的任务，我的主观概率是~25%，这将在很大程度上作为为自己和/或其他人工智能寻求权力的工具策略的一部分在训练中表现良好。</strong></p></blockquote><p> I am trying to come up with a reason this isn&#39;t 99%? Why this is the hard step at all?</p><p> You say &#39;scheming.&#39; I say &#39;charting path through causal space to achieve goal.&#39;</p><p> I also say &#39;what almost every student does throughout their education&#39;? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password">They continuously figure out the teacher&#39;s password</a> and give it back to them?</p><p> The &#39;aligned&#39; students are the ones who both guess the teacher&#39;s password, and also do their best to learn the material, and also learn to embody &#39;aligned&#39; values. Do they still &#39;scheme&#39; as described here? Oh, they scheme. Indeed, when one of them refuses to scheme, it is seen as a bug, and we stamp it right out.</p><p> If a model does not &#39;scheme&#39; in this spot, and you did not take any explicit precautions to not do so, I question your claim that it is above human level in intelligence. I mean, come on. What we are talking about here does not even rightfully rise to the level of scheming.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rbeard0330/status/1725131932680278340">Most people I surveyed</a> do not agree with my position, and 38% think the chance is under 10%, although 31% said it was more likely than not.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde802cad-1af4-4f93-bd90-3012f5d60112_895x502.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oCFX5xbhgCmpBFKnb/i05ib0gyygxtrcysajxy" alt=""></a></figure><p> I think my main disagreement with Joe is that Joe says he is uncertain if this definition of &#39;scheming&#39; is a convergently good strategy. Whereas I think of course it is. With others, it is harder to tell.</p><p> Or perhaps the part where it is done specifically &#39;to seek power&#39; is tripping people up. My default is that the &#39;scheming&#39; will take place by default, and that this will help seek power, but that this won&#39;t obviously be the proximate cause of the scheming, there are other forces also pushing in the same direction.</p><p> Much of the reasoning that follows thus seems unnecessary, and I haven&#39;t dug into it.</p><p> So what makes the model likely to de facto have goals in this context? That seems to have been covered in another paper of his previously. If I had more time I would dig in deeper.</p><p> Thoughts of others on the paper:</p><p> Davidad says yes, but that more efficient architectures offer less risk of this.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/davidad/status/1725125018823123365">Davidad:</a> I agree, but also: more efficient architectures are less likely to be undetectably situationally aware &amp; deceptively aligned, because they have less surplus computational capacity in which to hide galaxy-brained consequentialism while still being competitive on the intended task.</p></blockquote><p> My response would be that for efficiency to stop this, you would need things to be tight enough that it wasn&#39;t worthwhile to fulfill the preconditions? If it is worth being situationally aware and having goals, then I don&#39;t see much further cost to be paid. If you can squeeze hard enough perhaps you can prevent awareness and goals.</p><p> Quintin Pope digs directly into later technical aspects I didn&#39;t look into. This quote is highly abridged.</p><blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/QuintinPope5/status/1724891377123864622">Quintin Pope:</a> I just skimmed the section headers and a small amount of the content, but I&#39;m extremely skeptical. Eg, the “counting argument” seems incredibly dubious to me because you can just as easily argue that text to image generators will internally create images of llamas in their early layers, which they then delete, before creating the actual asked for image in the later layers. There are many possible llama images, but “just one” network that straightforwardly implements the training objective, after all.</p><p> ……</p><p> Finally, I&#39;m extremely skeptical of claims that NNs contain a &#39;ghost of generalized instrumental reasoning&#39;, able to perform very competent long term hidden scheming and deduce lots of world knowledge “in-context”. I think current empirical results point strongly against that being plausible.</p><p> ……</p><p> Joe Carlsmith: Thanks for this — I&#39;m reading your main arg here as a speed arg, except framed in a simplicity/counting-argument paradigm. Eg, it&#39;s a version of “SGD will punish the extra reasoning schemers have to perform” — which, yes, I think that&#39;s a key source of hope.</p><p> Quintin Pope: The key points of my Tweet are basically “the better way to think about counting arguments is to compare constraints on parameter configurations”, and “corrected counting arguments introduce an implicit bias towards short, parallel solutions”, where both “counting the constrained parameters”, and “counting the permutations of those parameters” point in that direction.</p></blockquote><p> Again I see the main scheming cost contained within the premise requirements. What is so galaxy-brained about &#39;when you are being tested, you ace the test, when you are not you act differently&#39;? I admit I am not investing enough to follow Quintin&#39;s technical claims here.</p><blockquote><p> Nora Belrose: Haven&#39;t read the paper but plausibly 2 cruxes: 1) I don&#39;t think a non-informative prior over “inner goals” makes sense</p><p> 2) I think Adam/SGD is quite a bit stronger than he seems to think it is.</p><p> ( <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/norabelrose/status/1724383749402730503">Quoting from a thread the day before</a> ):</p><p> So, my deceptive alignment skepticism has a few parts:</p><p> 1) speed prior</p><p> 2) local minima are exponentially rare in high dimensions; deceptive alignment would have to be some region inside a big flat basin that also contains genuine alignment; weight decay will punish the mesaobjective for not paying rent; eventually it is catastrophically forgotten</p><p> 3) iid gradient hacking is impossible; not actually clear if the “screw with your future training data” version could work well enough to protect the mesaobjective</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/Vq657Yg4uz">4) not clear where mesaobjective comes from</a></p><p> 5) NNs are differentiable and output action probs not hard actions, seems unlikely that the deceptive AI would actually be indistinguishable from the genuinely aligned one (esp. given Owain&#39;s recent lie detector thing)</p><p> 6) probably some other things I&#39;m forgetting since it&#39;s 3 AM</p></blockquote><p> This feels like the right skepticism to me, in this particular setting? As I see it Nora is largely questioning the premise. Current techniques, she is saying (I think?) won&#39;t result in sustained situational awareness or goal retention, even if you had them they would not &#39;pay enough rent&#39; to stick around.</p><p> Those ways for us to not get into trouble here seem far more plausible to me. I do strongly disagree with a lot of what she says <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/norabelrose/status/1724383749402730503">in the quoted thread</a> , in particular:</p><blockquote><p> You seem to have a security mindset where we assume that any assumption violation will be catastrophic. I instead think: 1) Deep learning is not your enemy; Goodhart&#39;s law is easily tamed with early stopping etc. 2) Just don&#39;t build an adversarial thing, it&#39;s not that hard.</p><p> I think (2) is highly robust. The only arguments for it being false eventually are a) Goodhart&#39;s law / reward hacking (Cotra 2022) b) Inner misalignment (Hubinger 2019) I think Goodhart is not a big deal, and (b) only makes sense in the Solomonoff case, not with speed priors. Any physically realized learning algorithm is going to have a fairly strong speed prior because there&#39;s always an opportunity cost to computation time even if you&#39;re a god, I am highly confident of this</p></blockquote><p> I think (1) we already see massive naked-eye-obvious Goodhart problems with existing systems, although they are almost entirely annoying rather than dangerous right now (2) Goodhart will rapidly get much worse as capabilities advance, (3) early stopping stops being so early as you move up but also (4) this idea that Goodhart is a bug or mistake that happens eg when you screw up and overtrain, rather than what you asked the system to do, is a key confusion (or crux).</p><p> I would even say proto-deceptive alignment currently kind of already exists, if you understand what you are looking at.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/aidanogara_/status/1724152597362221232">Will an AI attempt</a> to jailbreak another AI if it knows how and is sufficiently contextually aware, without having to be told to do so?</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://alignmentjam.com/project/jailbreaking-the-overseer">Yes, obviously</a> .

A general commitment to responsible AI including internal governance  2. Appropriate transparency and documentation 3. Risk &amp; benefit forecasting 4. Auditing and testing 5. Feedback cycles and ongoing improvements</p><p> In addition to the Commitments, we are publishing a 15-page Responsible AI Protocol, a practical how-to playbook to help investors and start-ups alike fulfill the commitments. Since April, our steering group of cross-societal AI experts has worked hard to understand the unique considerations and relevant and realistic standards for technologists at any stage. We strongly believe in the power of AI to transform our world for the better. Our role as investors is to advocate for our startups and the innovation economy from day 1.</p><p> Everybody saw the executive order last month–the reaction in the Valley has generally been to denounce it. The reality is that right now it&#39;s largely just reporting requirements. However, there is a risk that devolves into regulation that slows innovation down and makes America and its businesses uncompetitive. But the right path forward is to not be antagonistic towards DC We in the Valley need to learn that this is not about regulation vs. innovation, but about innovation at the intersection of technology, policy, and capital.</p><p> We have to embrace collaboration with our elected leaders. And as investors, we must hold ourselves accountable for what we fund and found. I want to commend the RIL team and committee for engendering trust and creating space for feedback, including with the Commerce Department and the White House.</p><p> We are facing what is likely the quickest adoption of any new technology ever in AI. It&#39;s difficult to think about the regulatory frameworks that protect the pace of innovation as well as protect against any nefarious use cases of technology. While we all learn how this role of technology evolves, it&#39;s important for us to be intentional about the mindset and mechanisms used in building early stage companies, as both investors and founders. We can&#39;t wait or kick the can down the road.</p><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/kbr7O9SUpE">We hope to see more venture firms and startups embrace this mindset, and encourage more to consider signing</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Great idea. But is it real? <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rilabs.org/responsibleai-commitments">Are the commitments meaningful?</a></p><blockquote><p> <strong>Venture Capital Firm:</strong> My organization will make reasonable efforts to (1) encourage portfolio companies to make these voluntary commitments (described below), (2) consult these voluntary commitments when conducting diligence on potential investments in AI startups, and (3) foster responsible AI practices among portfolio companies.</p><p> <strong>LP:</strong> I encourage the venture capital firms in which I invest to make these voluntary Responsible AI commitments (described below). <strong><br><br>Supporter:</strong> I encourage startups and venture firms to make these voluntary Responsible AI commitments (described below).</p></blockquote><p> If a company refuses the commitments, you can still invest in them. All you are promising is to make reasonable efforts, and consider this during diligence. In practice, this does not commit you to much of anything. For an LP there is another layer, you are encouraging your firm to take reasonable efforts to encourage.</p><p> OK, what is the ultimate goal here?</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Signatories make these voluntary responsible AI commitments:</strong></p><ul><li> <strong>Secure organizational buy-in:</strong> We understand the importance of building AI safely and are committed to incorporating responsible AI practices into building and/or adopting AI within our organization. We will implement internal governance processes, including a forum for diverse stakeholders to provide feedback on the impact of new products and identify risk mitigation strategies. We will build systems that put security first, protect privacy,and invest in cybersecurity best practices to prevent misuse.</li></ul></blockquote><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyV_UG60dD4&amp;ab_channel=alyankovicVEVO">That is a mission statement</a> .</p><blockquote><ul><li> <strong>Foster trust through transparency:</strong> We will document decisions about how and why AI systems are built and/or adopted (including the use of third party AI products). In ways that account for other important organizational priorities, such as user privacy, safety, or security, we will disclose appropriate information to internal and/or external audiences, including safety evaluations conducted, limitations of AI/model use, model&#39;s impact on societal risks (eg <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1270.pdf">bias and discrimination</a> ), and the results of adversarial testing to evaluate fitness for deployment.</li></ul></blockquote><p> All right. This at least is something. They are promising to disclose their safety evaluations (and therefore, implicitly, any lack thereof) and results of adversarial testing (ditto).</p><blockquote><ul><li> <strong>Forecast AI risks and benefits</strong> : We will take reasonable steps to identify the foreseeable risks and benefits of our technologies, including limitations of a new system and its potential harms, and use those assessments to inform product development and risk mitigation efforts.</li><li> <strong>Audit and test to ensure product safety:</strong> Based on forecasted risks and benefits, we will undertake regular testing to ensure our systems are aligned with responsible AI principles. Testing will include auditing of data and our systems&#39; outputs, including harmful bias and discrimination, and documenting those results. We will use adversarial testing, such as red teaming, to identify potential risks.</li></ul></blockquote><p> Commitment to do risk assessments, periodic auditing, adversarial testing and red teaming.</p><blockquote><ul><li> <strong>Make regular and ongoing improvements:</strong> We will implement appropriate mitigations while monitoring their efficacy, as well as adopt feedback mechanisms to maintain a responsible AI strategy that keeps pace with evolving norms, technologies, and business objectives. We will monitor the robustness of our AI systems.</li></ul></blockquote><p> Most of this is corporate-responsibility-speak. As with all such talk, it sounds like what it is, told by a drone, full of sound and a specific type of fury, signifying nothing.</p><p> However there are indeed a few clauses here that commit one to something. In particular, they are promising to do risk assessments, audits, adversarial testing and red teaming, and to release the results of any safety evaluations and adversarial testing that they do.</p><p> Is that sufficient? For a company like OpenAI or Google, or for Inflection AI, hell no.</p><p> For an ordinary company that is not creating frontier models, and is rightfully concerned with mundane harms, it is not clear what the statement is meant to accomplish beyond good publicity. A company should already not want to go around doing a bunch of harm, that tends to be bad for business. It is still somewhat more real compared to many similar commitment statements, so go for it, I say, until something better is available.</p><p> One possibility for a company that does not want to do its own homework, is to commit yourself to following the guidelines in Anthropic&#39;s current and future RSPs and other similar policies (I&#39;ve pushed the complete RSP post out a bit, but it is coming soon). That then works to align incentives.</p><h4> People Are Worried About AI Killing Everyone</h4><p> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ciphergoth/status/1723438916911718849">Lina Khan, chair of the FTC, says on Hard Fork she puts her p(doom) at 15%</a> ( <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ciphergoth/status/1723438916911718849">podcast</a> ).</p><blockquote><p> Lina Khan: Ah, I have to stay an optimist on this one.

I draw on the field of human judgmental forecasting, sometimes colloquially referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecaster?ref=bounded-regret.ghost.io">superforecasting</a> . A hallmark of forecasting is that answers are <em>probability distributions</em> rather than single outcomes, so you should expect ranges rather than definitive answers (but ranges can still be informative!). If you are interested in learning more about this field, I teach a <a href="http://www.forecastingclass.com/?ref=bounded-regret.ghost.io">class</a> on it with open-access notes, slides, and assignments.</p><p> For AI forecasting in particular, I first got into this area by forecasting progress on several benchmarks:</p><ul><li> In <em><a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/ai-forecasting/">Updates and Lessons from AI Forecasting</a></em> , I describe a forecasting competition that I helped commission, which asked competitive forecasters to predict progress on four different benchmarks. This is a good place to start to understand what I mean by forecasting.</li><li> In <em><a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/ai-forecasting-one-year-in/">AI Forecasting: One Year In</a></em> , I look at the first year of results from the competition, and find that forecasters generally underpredicted progress in AI, especially on the MATH and MMLU benchmarks.</li><li> Motivated by this, in <em><a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/forecasting-math-and-mmlu-in-2023/">Forecasting ML Benchmarks in 2023</a></em> I provide my own forecasts of what state-of-the-art performance on MATH and MMLU will be in June 2023.</li><li> In <em><a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/scoring-ml-forecasts-for-2023/">AI Forecasting: Two Years In</a></em> , I look at the second year of results from the competition. I found that the original forecasters continued to underpredict progress, but that a different platform (Metaculus) did better, and that my own forecasts were on par with Metaculus.</li></ul><p> After these exercises in forecasting ML benchmarks, I turned to a more ambitious task: predicting the properties of AI models in 2030 across many different axes (capabilities, cost, speed, etc.). My overall predictions are given in <em><a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/what-will-gpt-2030-look-like/">What Will GPT-2030 Look Like?</a></em> , which provides a concrete (but very uncertain) picture of what ML will look like at the end of this decade.</p><p> Finally, I am now turning to using forecasting to quantify and understand risks from AI:</p><ul><li> In <em><a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/gpt-2030-and-catastrophic-drives-four-vignettes/">GPT-2030 and Catastrophic Drives: Four Vignettes</a></em> , I use my GPT-2030 predictions as a starting point to understand the capabilities and corresponding risks of future ML models. I then speculate on four scenarios through which AI could lead to catastrophic outcomes.</li><li> In <em>Base Rates for Catastrophe</em> , I take a different approach, using data on historical catastrophes and extinction events to form a <a href="https://forecasting.quarto.pub/book/base-rates.html?ref=bounded-regret.ghost.io">reference class</a> for AI catastrophes. Most expert forecasters consider reference class forecasting to be a strong baseline that forms the starting point for their own forecasts, and I think it&#39;s also a good place to start for AI risk.</li><li> In <em>Forecasting Catastrophic Risks from AI</em> , I put everything together to give an all-things-considered estimate of my probability of an AI-induced catastrophe by 2050.</li><li> Finally, in <em>Other Estimates of Catastrophic Risk</em> , I collect other similar forecasts made by various individuals and organizations, and explain which ones I give more and less weight to, based on track record and overall effort and expertise.</li></ul><p> The first of these posts has been written, and I plan to release a new one about once per week.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uC5FdCEWB4KenR8m2/forecasting-ai-overview#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uC5FdCEWB4KenR8m2/forecasting-ai-overview<guid ispermalink="false"> uC5FdCEWB4KenR8m2</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[jsteinhardt]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 19:00:10 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[We Should Talk About This More. Epistemic World Collapse as Imminent Safety Risk of Generative AI.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 16, 2023 6:46 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <i>“So you&#39;re telling me we can&#39;t believe anything we&#39;re shown anymore?” I&#39;m asking. “That everything is altered? That everything&#39;s a lie? That everyone will believe this?” “That&#39;s a fact,” Palakon says. “So what&#39;s true, then?” I cry out. “Nothing, Victor,” Palakon says. “There are different truths.”</i><br> Bret Easton Ellis – Glamorama, 1998</p><p> <strong>Photography has played a major role in allowing us to construct an understanding of the world whose general outlines are shared by billions of people. Functionally, photographic images extend our senses and tell us about the world outside of our immediate here and now. They are among the most important epistemological tools of humanity. Even today, after the transition to digital has made image manipulation easier and more widespread, they have not lost this role in our everyday lives. If we see a photograph or a video of something, we generally still believe in its factuality. At least in absence of reasons to doubt its veracity. With the advent of generative AI, this is about to change – sooner, more drastically and, given the abysmal state of our existing information landscape, with more dramatic consequences than we might intuit.</strong></p><p> This, to me, seems to be an urgent AI safety concern that is simply not talked about enough. One reason is that other scenarios like paperclip optimizers, biases, mass unemployment and biohazards are dominating the safety discourse. We only have so much attention to give. Another reason is that photographic images are so deeply engrained in our everyday normal life. They are just part of our world and we take it for granted that we have the ability to <i>see</i> across oceans as well as through time. It is hard to imagine that very soon all of us, collectively, might have this ability severely diminished; or what the consequences of that might be.</p><p> I call this concern urgent, because we do not need to achieve AGI to get there. In fact, it seems likely no further large jumps in capabilities are needed at all. All that is missing seem to be smaller refinements of existing techniques. In some sense, the problems have already begun. I think of this as a safety issue with high p-doom and short timelines. Or in other words: It&#39;s likely to go bad, and soon.</p><p> Too ominous? Maybe I&#39;m overdoing it? I&#39;m going to try and convince you otherwise! Just before I start, one more thing: When I talk about photography or photographic images, I am also talking about film. Even more so, most of what is being said here could also be said about other kinds of technical recordings and their generated counterparts, eg audio, but I&#39;m going to be busy enough to look at photographs (and film), so &quot;photographic images&quot; are going to be at the center of this. All good? Yes? Then let&#39;s go.</p><p> <i>Quick content warning: I use some four letter words and there are non-detailed descriptions of sexual violence and abuse  when giving examples for potential misuse of generative AI.</i></p><h3> <strong>The Importance of Photographic Images, or: We Are Cyborgs Already</strong></h3><p> My whole argument rests on the importance photographic images have for us. So let&#39;s think about that for a moment. The problem is: Grasping the importance of images for the way we connect to the world is actually quite difficult. It&#39;s a fish-water problem, or in the words of McLuhan (him, the Patron Saint of everyone thinking about media):</p><blockquote><p> <i>One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water—they do not know that the water is wet because they have no experience of dry. Once immersed in the media, despite all its images and sounds and words, how can we know what it is doing to us?</i></p></blockquote><p> Let&#39;s try to look at the water by looking at me. I&#39;m 44 and German. I have bumbled across Europe a couple of times, lived in another country for three years and crossed the Atlantic ocean more than once. Still, what I have seen of the world with my own eyes is insignificant compared to what I have seen by the way of photographic images. Images showed me countries in the Middle East, Montana and Texas, Japan and China, New York, nebula in the Milky Way, the Eiffel tower, cottages in the English country side, the Grand Canyon and the peaks of the Himalaya. And that&#39;s just places. I must have seen millions of people from all over the world, from all kinds of eras. Faces of so many ethnicities, scenes from their lives. Clothes, items, the general vibe of towns and villages. The Savannah. Lions and hyenas. The ocean&#39;s depths. Whales, sharks and schools of fish. I saw a single man stop a row of tanks on Tiananmen Square, bombs falling on Bagdad, the Beatles crossing a road. I saw people fuck. I saw people get killed. I saw a birth. I saw rockets lifting of and entering orbit. I saw the Challenger explode. I saw Reagan asking Gorbatschow to tear down that wall. I saw Phan Thi Kim Phuc, the Napalm Girl, fleeing from her village. I saw the Twin Towers coming down and the prisoners in Abu Ghraib. I witnessed George Floyd die. I know these things happened. I saw them. And even more importantly: I can be fairly certain you saw this too. All of it. For nearly two hundred years, photography has played a key role in ensuring that billions of people have been able to agree on at least some ground truths, enabling us to live in the same world and share one reality.</p><p> Sure, photography is not the only medium telling us from far way places and times long gone, and without accompanying explanations, the solitary man on Tiananmen Square might have been a tank inspector. Or the driver&#39;s spouse. Still, photography presents information as fact in a way a written report or hearsay could never hope to achieve. No written account of Phan Thi Kim Phuc&#39;s story could have had the impact her image had. It&#39;s harrowing and became one of the most iconic images for the horrors of war in the 20st century. This is in part due to its artistic or aesthetic qualities. It makes you feel something. It triggers empathy. But artistic qualities alone are not the whole story. No drawing would have achieved its effect. It&#39;s impact was only possible, because it is a photograph. THAT makes it evidence. One sees it and knows: This is a slice of time. A fact. This happened! Of course not every photograph is always believed by everyone. And of course there is manipulation and deceit. But that&#39;s beside the point. In the absence of specific reasons to think otherwise and in the overwhelming majority of cases, photographic images are taken in and processed as evidence: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/puuitzjgvwg4yrmwxdre" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/ducpijbyhmsvabfudltc 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/puuitzjgvwg4yrmwxdre 900w"></p><p> <i>Fig. 1 – This happened!</i></p><p> Let&#39;s take a step back. So far I have given you a lot of pretty dramatic examples. Rockets. The Milky Way. War photography. But the power of images does not solely rely on their ability to capture dramatic or even just important moments. There is a lot of banal everyday imagery that nevertheless tells you a lot about the world, even if just reaffirms what it normally looks like. My point is this: Today, in the age of the internet and digital distribution, every one of us lives in a constant stream of images that constantly show us what the world beyond our immediate here and now looks like. As beings, we are placed and integrated in an information environment that is constantly providing <i>mediated</i> information from beyond our individual cone of perception. In a way, we are already cyborgs.</p><p> If this is true, I think it follows that it is important to understand better how our relationship to images functions; and to be very wary of any development that might bring about deep and lasting changes to it.</p><h3> <strong>Crash Course on the Epistemics/Semiotics of Photography</strong></h3><p> <i>&quot;The photograph is literally an emanation of the referent. From a real body, which was there, proceed radiations which ultimately touch me, who am here; the duration of the transmission is insignificant; the photograph of the missing being, as Sontag says, will touch me like the delayed rays of a star.&quot;</i><br> Roland Barthes – Camera Lucida, 1979</p><p> Ok, we have reminded ourselves that photography is kind of a big deal. Let&#39;s talk about the why and how. For this we are going to take a brief look at the semiotics of photography and try to see why these images possess such a high epistemic value. This is an endeavor that could fill a long and fruitful academic career, but as this is not supposed to be a paper on epistemology or semiotics, I&#39;m going to be a bit slappydaisy here and develop these thoughts just to the point needed for a framework we can use to look at generative image creation and its possible impact.</p><p> Let&#39;s start with a simple model of perceiving the world. This is us, looking at things: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/pydx2ebb3q74g6l2qris" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/jnyotjfxqroxw3fxl8lv 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/pydx2ebb3q74g6l2qris 774w"></p><p> <i>Fig. 2 – Epistemic Everyday Oversimplification</i></p><p> Something from the world reaches our senses, in this case light reflected from our surrounding falling into our eyes, and we form an image of our surroundings in our mind. Yes, this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument#:~:text=The%20homunculus%20argument%20is%20an,in%20the%20theory%20of%20vision."><u>overly simple</u></a> , but for our purposes we can ignore further complexities. What we are interested in is not the empirical question of how our brain does visual cognition and constructs the world, but <i>how we perceive our perception</i> in normal everyday life; and normally we assume that the image we see through our senses is a fair representation and corresponds well to the real world. In fact, one could argue that we usually just assume the image in our mind IS the world and we do not reflect on its mediated, constructed and representative nature.</p><p> Next, let&#39;s look at us looking at photographic images: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/t152li88nqcxlsmgtn3p" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/mjn6ljjfgwgttpoqv4nb 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/hmy02cng04tkvhmlgkod 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/t152li88nqcxlsmgtn3p 1259w"></p><p> <i>Fig. 3 – Epistemic Everyday Oversimplification for Photographic Images</i></p><p> Something from the world interacts with a device, light falling into a lens, which leaves an imprint in a medium, creating a photograph that we can later perceive with our senses, eliciting the formation of an image of the world in our mind that includes the photographic image. A couple of things are of note here:</p><p> <strong>One:</strong> The image can be taken when we are not present and it then exists through time. It transports a slice of THERE AND THEN into the HERE AND NOW. We are used to this to a point it sounds trivial, but holy shit ... technology is amazing! (Live broadcast also adds THERE AND NOW to the mix, but that isn&#39;t important for what we are interested here, so let&#39;s not dive into it.)</p><p> <strong>Two:</strong> The resulting image, the photograph, is a result of the world interacting with the world. It&#39;s right in the name photography: <i>Light</i> (phōtos) is doing the <i>drawing</i> (graphé). As such, the belief in photography is based on a scientific world view, though my guess is that photography also played a significant role in engraining scientific thinking into our understanding of the world. Be that as it may, what is important to us here is that we have reasons to see the photograph as the result of natural processes we cannot manipulate in a significant manner. We can put a filter on a lens and change an image&#39;s hue, we cannot put a filter on a lens to make it look as if you are sleeping with your neighbour behind your spouse&#39;s back.</p><p> <strong>Three</strong> : We are very good at differentiating photographs from other images (eg paintings).</p><p> <strong>Four:</strong> Up until very recently, it used be true that we did not know of another method to produce a photograph other than taking a photograph. Yes, there are spectacular works of art that are &quot;photorealistic&quot;, but this term refers to an effect were the picture allows us to suspend disbelief for a moment and pretend it is &quot;like a photograph&quot;. We might marble at the skill involved, but when it counts, we can tell the difference (eg in court). No matter how good the painting, if it is the only proof of you &quot;being&quot; with your neighbour, you should be fine.</p><p> <strong>Five:</strong> As in the case of direct perception of the HERE AND NOW through our senses, we usually assume that the image of the world the photograph elicits in our mind just WAS the world in the THERE AND THEN, meaning we usually do not reflect on light engraving a representation on a medium that later bounces more light into our eyes, triggering complicated cognitive functions whose result we interpret as an image of how the world was. We just assume we are looking at the world as it was. Doubt and reflection only enter the picture, if we have a reason for it.</p><h3> <strong>Let&#39;s Talk Manipulation: Ways in which Photographs Were Never Reliable</strong> </h3><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/vum0vs08zogywsgzxfv0" alt=""></p><p> <i>Fig. 4 – Stalin didn&#39;t just kill people, he tried to have them &quot;unpersoned&quot;, deleted from all records. Ironically, you wouldn&#39;t be looking at these pictures now, if it wasn&#39;t for his attempt of rewriting history.</i></p><p> So far I have talked a lot about how reliable photography is. That is, of course, horseshit. Manipulation of photographs is basically as old a photography itself. The incentive is clear: Photography holds a high prove value for us, so if you manage to make the pictures show (or suggest) what you want to show (or suggest), you have a powerful tool to convince people of your version of events or your perspective on things. Correspondingly, our trust in photographic images was never complete. So let&#39;s take a moment to reflect on ways photography has always been unreliable and open to manipulation. It will prepare us to start talking about digital photography, which will be the last stepping stone needed to discuss AI driven image generation.</p><p> The following things all made photographs unreliable representation of the world from the very beginning:</p><p> a) &quot;Mistakes&quot; of our cognitive-perceptual machine, for example optical illusions or biases influencing the way we interpret images. b) Deviations introduced by the camera or the medium on which the light is engraved, for example the way film was calibrated to work well on &quot;white&quot; skin, but didn&#39;t produce realistic representations of darker skin tones. c) Artistic means to achieve propagandistic effects, for example Leni Riefenstahl&#39;s aesthetics in Nazi propaganda. d) Intentional or unintentional choice of subject and/or frame, for example photographing violence at a political rally, but focusing on the deeds of one group over the other. e) Presenting a real image but lying about its context, for example when images of past atrocities are repurposed and shared as proof for atrocities in current conflicts f) Staged realities, for example reporters manipulating a scene to create additional drama or NASA faking the moon landing (just kidding!). g) Direct manipulation of the image itself, for example Stalin having people killed and then removed from photographs.</p><p> If we look back up to Fig. 3, our basic semiotic model of photography, we can see that all these different ways to commit mistakes, manipulate or outright lie and deceive do influence the veracity of the photograph at different points in the chain from &quot; <i>world</i> &quot; to &quot; <i>image of the world in our mind</i> &quot;. For example: Staged realities produce, in a way, honest photographs of a lie; material unable to represent dark skin tones skews the result on the level of the device; image manipulation interferes with the image itself;等等。 Also: Every kind of mistake or deception requires different techniques and skill sets, involves a different degree of effort, produces different results and requires different methods of detection.</p><p> All of this begs the question: If there are so many ways to manipulate and lie with photography, why do we put so much trust in it? I can see a variety of candidates for a good explanation:</p><p> a) <strong>Difficulty</strong> : Most if not all of these ways to deceive are not trivial to utilize successfully. They require effort and some degree of expert knowledge.<br> b) <strong>Probability</strong> : The vast majority of photographs are not &quot;fake&quot;.<br> c) <strong>Utility</strong> : As long as the probabilities are reasonably good, our believe in photographs is useful and usually works well for us.<br> d) <strong>Symbolic</strong> <strong>moments</strong> : Many historic moments were documented by photography or even became important historic moments in the first place, because they were photographed. Iconic moments like the &quot;Napalm Girl&quot; fleeing her village or the &quot;Tankman&quot; stopping tanks on Tiananmen Square also reinforce the believe in photography itself. Billions of us came together and collectively agreed that those images represented something from reality.<br> e) <strong>Social conventions</strong> : Taking photographs as accurate representations is the normal attitude shared by most people and it is the attitude children grow up with. Once established, this is a self-perpetuating cycle.<br> f) <strong>Trust in Sources</strong> : Especially when the topic is important, photography is used by trusted institutions like newspapers or court systems. This is probably a synergistic effect: Photography benefitting from its connection to trusted institutions and the institutions benefitting from using a trusted medium.<br> g) <strong>Accountability</strong> : For photographers working in a documentary capacity (ie journalists, not artists), being caught faking images would likely be the end of their career. The social norms around this are pretty strong and disincentivize fakes. We know this.<br> h) <strong>Personal experience</strong> : Long before digital photography and smart phones became a thing, photography was already ubiqutous in our lives. For more than 100 years, humans are used to being photographed and taking photographs themselves. The reliability of the results is first hand knowledge, not something someone told us about.i) <strong>Biology</strong> : The processes our brain uses to construct reality from our visual system&#39;s input are neither conscious, nor under our control. My guess is that photographic images tickle some neurological pathway that says &quot;Yeah, this is real&quot;. Just as with optical illusions, we can overwrite this (to an extend) by reasoning about what we see, but the pathway gets tickled nonetheless (If I&#39;m right about this). After all, the lines in the image below are not different in length and Biden (probably) never hugged Trump, but it still looks like it, doesn&#39;t it: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/gwcgtsfso3umuuzgjpoi" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/ucdaxpqkab13rwispjjt 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/m5xpfa4ctg1kvkddxqag 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/w6kacq0t45jxqtmx9dxg 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/gwcgtsfso3umuuzgjpoi 2099w"></p><p> <i>Fig. 5</i></p><h3> <strong>Digital Photography: From Chemistry to Information</strong></h3><p> <i>Photography, as we have known it, is both ending and enlarging, with an evolving medium hidden inside it as in a Trojan horse, camouflaged, for the moment, as if it were nearly identical: its doppelgänger, only better.</i><br> Fred Ritchin – After Photography, 2010</p><p> At first glance, not so much changes with the switch to digital image generation. The core epistemology is still there. Light is reflected from an object in the world, falls into the device, triggering a reaction recording the event, resulting in an image that we can then see, showing us in the HERE AN NOW what happened in he THERE AND THEN. What has changed is the medium the reaction takes place in and how the resulting image is stored. We move from a chemical reaction and film to a light sensitive receptor, electronic signals and pixel data stored on some kind of memory device. The image isn&#39;t a thing I hold in my hand anymore, it&#39;s information displayed on a screen. And information can be altered a lot more easily than the chemical compounds making up analog photographs.</p><p> In other words: The ability to manipulate every pixel of digital photographic images doesn&#39;t change that images claim to be representations about something in the world, it &quot;just&quot; provides new ways of lying. A lot has been written about how the digitization of images undermines their trustworthiness, but here I&#39;m more interested in a different aspect: Usually, we just don&#39;t care that much!</p><p> If we see a photographic image, we usually still assume it shows something from the world. Yes, we are aware that color balances are adjusted. We know shapes are being remodelled (biceps grow, faces smooth out, fat vanishes etc.). We know images lie. Still, we usually do not distrust digital photographic images on a fundamental level. If anything, we still put too much trust in them, for example when allowing them to shape and warp our ideas of beauty to a ridiculous degree.这是为什么？</p><p> Well, let&#39;s quickly look at all the factors for why we believed in analog photographic images and how they changed with the proliferation of digital photography.</p><p> a) <strong>Difficulty</strong> : It is still not trivial to produce credible fakes. It still requires expert knowledge and the results still show traces of manipulation. If a private detective can show your spouse a video of you getting it on with your neighbour, you are still in trouble. You won&#39;t get out of that by pointing out the Kardashian&#39;s are photoshopping their butts. When Iran tries to multiply the number of rockets fired on a photograph, we still catch them.<br> b) <strong>Probability</strong> : The vast majority of photographic images still show something that happened in the world.<br> c) <strong>Utility</strong> : Our believe in photographic images is still useful and usually works well for us.<br> d) <strong>Symbolic moments</strong> : We haven&#39;t had any really big symbolic moment undermining the trust in the epistemic value of photographic images (yet). For example: The last US election wasn&#39;t about an image of Biden/Trump doing something scandalous and a subsequent weeklong shitshow of experts trying to decipher if the image was fake or not.<br> e) <strong>Social conventions</strong> : Taking photographs as accurate representations is the normal attitude shared by most people and still the normal way to approach photographic images in everyday life.<br> f) <strong>Trust in Sources</strong> : Trust in institutions, especially media, has definitely waned, but not as a result of diminished trust in photography after the switch to digital. More about that in the section &quot;Interlude: Epistemic Crises Before Generative AI&quot;.<br> g) <strong>Accountability</strong> : Being caught faking an image is still a high risk for anyone working in a documentary capacity. But: Social media is filling the internet with news-like content and accompanying images that no one is taking responsibility for.<br> h) <strong>Personal Experience</strong> : Photography is more ubiqutous in our lives than ever. We are photographed and we take photographs ALL THE TIME now. We are also familiar with the ways to manipulate digital images and their limitations.<br> i) <strong>Biology</strong> : Digital images still tickle our brains into thinking &quot;Yeah, this is real&quot;.</p><p> So yes, there are some shifts, but overall most of the reasons we put trust in photography are still in place and largely unchanged even after the switch to digital and the proliferation of manipulation techniques. We still use photographic images to learn about the world beyond our own individual cone of perception.</p><h3> <strong>Interlude: Epistemic Crises Before Generative AI</strong></h3><p> <i>You&#39;re saying it&#39;s a falsehood, and they&#39;re giving ... Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that.</i><br> Kellyanne Conway – Counselor to President Trump, January 2017</p><p> When I started to think about this topic, I feared that generative AI would worsen an epistemic crisis that is already going on. When I thought about it more, I realized there is a better description to be had for the problem: There are two epistemic crises already going on (and interacting with each other), and generative AI will be a third entirely new one – having the way it impacts us shaped by the ones we are currently going through. So, before we (finally) dive into generative AI, what are these two distinct epistemic crises I&#39;m referring to?</p><p> <strong>Malleable Reality</strong><br> This crisis was already alluded to in the last section about digital photography. Photographic images became easier to alter, they are extremely malleable, and still we take them as reality. It&#39;s not about a loss of believe, but a misplacement of believe. Digital media took over from analog photography relatively quickly and without much of a hitch, piggybacking on social norms built over more than one and a half centuries of trusting analog photography and still tickling our brains in the same &quot; <i>Hey, this is true</i> &quot;-kind of way. Consequences are probably most visible in the warping of our beauty standards – we now live in a world were video conferencing software gives you a slider to touch up your skin in real time and &quot;beauty&quot; influencers are quickly adding ever more sophisticated filters to their arsenal of makeup and plastic surgery. But it&#39;s not just about &quot;beauty&quot;, most pictures undergo heavy editing before we get to see them. Blood likely looks a lot redder today than it used to. Yes, photography still mostly shows us what was going on in the THERE AND THEN, but most images are changed and distorted, often in a way to make them stand out and perform in a hyper-pitched war for attention. We are living in a strange world, completely engulfed in virtual caricatures of what the world would look like through human eyes. I mean ... who really looks like Kim Kardashian or (The) Rock Johnson?确切地。没有人。 Not even them.</p><p> <strong>Post Truth</strong><br> The second ongoing epistemic crisis is about what has so charmingly been dubbed &quot;Post Truth&quot;. It&#39;s characterized by ever more degrading trust in institutions (the main stream), a epistemic splintering of worlds along ideological lines and the rise of conspiratorial thinking. Educational institutions, media, scientists, politicians and parties – none of them can be trusted, so we need to go out and search the truth for ourselves. As with the first, this crisis is driven by multiple factors we cannot really pick apart here. The usual suspects are social media, recommendation algorithms and the omnipresence of the internet – but one could find more, from the winner takes all voting system in the US to partisan dynamics to the influence of Russian propaganda to the very real corruption running through our governments. But: I don&#39;t think this crisis is driven by the malleability of digital photography. Not only have we just concluded that our trust in digital photography is, if anything, still rather unreasonably high, we can also look at what happened over the last couple of years and notice a lack of high impact scandals involving manipulated photographic images or claims of images being fake. For example, image manipulation wasn&#39;t a factor in the last presidential election, and, to put it mildly, US politics is THE hotbed of the &quot;Post Truth&quot; epistemic crisis. If image manipulation is not a driver there, it&#39;s not much of a driver (yet).</p><p> These epistemic crises are the context in which the next crisis, the one related to generative AI, will play out. This means the epistemic changes introduced by image generation are going to interact with an already fraught information environment. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s particularly great news for us.</p><p> OK, the stage is set, let&#39;s talk generative AI.</p><h3> <strong>From Digital Photography to Image Generation</strong></h3><p> <i>Such would be the successive phases of the image: it is the reflection of a profound reality; it masks and denatures a profound reality; it masks the absence of a profound reality; it has no relation to any reality whatsoever; it is its own pure simulacrum.</i><br> Jean Baudrillard – Simulacra And Simulation, 1981</p><p> Let&#39;s start by comparing the semiotics or the epistemology of generative images to the semiotics of photographic images. With digital photography we did not need to update our chart, with generative AI, we do. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/qyp0lrbkyhcaaatt0pwr" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/fbugapqwnwqhiciqtrra 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/qgackhvv0jhr7jprvdsj 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/qyp0lrbkyhcaaatt0pwr 1259w"></p><p> <i>Fig. 6 – Epistemics of Generated Images</i></p><p> The change is dramatic. With photography, the image was the result of an interaction between device and world. As a product of that interaction, it represented something real about the moment it was created. With generative AI, there is no referent. The image doesn&#39;t represent anything in the world at all. It was &quot;dreamt up&quot; at some point in time, somewhere on some servers. If it represents anything, then the interaction between the prompt, the model&#39;s architecture and its training data and training process. So maybe we get a vague notion about the intention behind the prompt. Or, if we can look at a large number of image-prompt pairs produced by the same model, we might infer something about biases present in the model (eg a preference for sexually attractive people), but the images do not show us anything that has actually happened.</p><p> That alone wouldn&#39;t be a problem (or at least not an epistemic one), but generative AI undermines an observation we have made earlier – that we are very good at differentiating photographs from other images. Right now, humanity is locked in an adversarial training battle with generative AI. We do get better at spotting AI generated images, and AI generated images get better at fooling us. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/hwzmhpaqyblc9rufxepi" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/oxfc0ogv4arst4qml8dw 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/f5vqseshozsocipc0i5h 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/r862bm2hkhxvlekn1m3g 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/hwzmhpaqyblc9rufxepi 1920w"></p><p> <i>Fig. 7 – An image of Roland Reagan meeting Afghan mujahideen in the White House. Is it real? Well, the hands look pretty good, so maybe yes? Try to find out!</i></p><p> I would posit that we are approaching a moment where even experts and expert systems will not be able to tell the difference between a photographic image and a generated image. I would also posit that, as costs for AI fall, generated images are going to be at least as ubiqutous as photographic images. I think both of these assumptions are justified. Generative AI is already very good at creating photorealistic results, and AI as a technology is currently pushed forward at the highest possible speed. There is an endless influx of extremely clever people entering the field and an endless army of rich people and organizations willing to give them all the billions of dollars they need to produce something slightly better than last week&#39;s best thing. Will we reach Artificial General Intelligence or even Artificial Super Intelligence? Possibly, though it also seems possible the hype train will run out of steam before we do. Will we see dramatically enhanced results in image generation before that? To me, that seems almost guaranteed.</p><p> So … what about the consequences?</p><h3> <strong>Epistemic Collapse. The World as Mirage.</strong></h3><p> <i>All we have to believe is our senses: the tools we use to perceive the world, our sight, our touch, our memory. If they lie to us, then nothing can be trusted.</i><br> Neil Gaiman – American Gods, 2001</p><p> In a way, most of technology can be seen as an extension of our biological bodies and their functions. Pick up a hammer and it becomes a part of you. Now, you can drive nails into boards (and smash skulls and stuff). Put on a sweater and you can tolerate much lower temperatures.等等。 Photography extends our most important sense, vision, through space and time. There have always been problems, there has always been deceit, but focusing on that would mean focusing on the exceptions. In general, photographic images represented the world not only as it is now, but also as it was then. It&#39;s a superpower. Now this extended vision is about to fill up with generated images that show us nothing of the world, but that we cannot differentiate from photographic images. Not long from now, when we try to use our superpower, the incoming stream of information will likely be full of hallucinations, or, more precisely, fabrications. And if we cannot tell fabrications from representations, and the volume of fabrications rises high enough, our technologically enhanced vision becomes useless. We can no longer rely on it to learn about the world. If technology in the last couple of years has turned the world into a village (Yes, McLuhan again), this development might turn it into a mirage, everything from outside our here and now might turn into a stream of colorful images with little or no epistemic value.</p><p> If we follow this thought to its end, the world we can see via photographic images collapses and we become limited to our own cones of perception. And it is not not just our individual world that collapses. The factuality of photographic images has played an important role in our ability as a species to construct and share a common conception of what is real. So it seems our socially shared and collectively inhabited world is also at risk of collapse. Are we doomed to turn into a collection of disconnected individuals, or small networks of individuals, blindly scrambling around, only every trusting what we can see with our own eyes?</p><p> Admittedly, at first glance this does sound a bit overdramatic. Let&#39;s, for now, see total epistemic collapse as an extreme and theoretical endpoint, unlikely to come true in its purest form, but useful as a reference point.</p><h3> <strong>Trust and Trustworthiness</strong></h3><p> Total epistemic collapse describes a situation in which we are overwhelmed by fabrications and do not trust any image we haven&#39;t taken for ourselves. Let&#39;s do a little thought experiment to explore that notion a bit further. The stage is set three years into the future. Generated images are ubiqutous and indistinguishable from photographic images. You sit in your living room, together with the one person you trust most in the world. This person takes out a mobile phone and shows you images taken on a vacation. The images appear normal and show beautiful sunny beaches and interesting animals in a tropical rainforest. Would you believe that person is showing you real images from their trip and not generated images? Probably yes. I did ask you to imagine the person you trust most in the whole world.</p><p> What if that person showed you a video clip of a dragon attacking a village and is REALLY insistent that this REALLY happened? Unless your believe system includes the possibility of dragons, this will put what you believe to know about the world in conflict with the trust you put in that person.</p><p> Let&#39;s restart. We are still three years into the future. Generated images are ubiqutous and appear perfectly real. You are alone in front of your computer. The internet explodes with dozens of video clips showing a dragon attack on a small village somewhere in the Caribbean. Shortly after, video interviews appear on One American News, in which tourists who witnessed and filmed the attack talk about it. Two minutes later CNN goes live. They assume this to be some kind of hoax (reminiscent of the Godzilla attack on Tokyo six months earlier), but as it generates clicks and views, they run with the story. About 60 minutes in, and not to your surprise, CNN has a reporter on the ground and it is confirmed that there is indeed no dragon. The attack, the gory images of its aftermath, the witnesses talking about it – it&#39;s all generated by AI. One American News retracts the story one hour later, apologizes and blames the radical left for tricking them. Two days later, the person you trust most in the world visits you. They are nervous and besides themselves! Once inside, they show you the video of the dragon attack and swear they recorded it themselves. What now?</p><p> OK, maybe the dragon is a bit ridiculous. What about aliens? Or terrorists? What if it isn&#39;t the person you trust most in the world, but your crazy liberal/conservative relative who is convinced the moon landing was fake? What if One American News and CNN swapped places in the story?</p><p> I think it is safe to assume a couple of things: a) We will not distrust all images. Neither will we just trust all &quot;photographic&quot; images. We will trust some images more than others. b) Which images we trust depends on the answer to the question: Is this image generated or fabricated? And to answer that question we will need to rely on factors outside of the image itself. c) How good we are, collectively, in telling representation from fabrication will determine how well we can deal with the proliferation of generated images.</p><p> So, how do we collectively get better in telling generation from fabrication? How do we trust the right images?</p><h3> <strong>Old Mechanisms of Trust</strong></h3><p> Let&#39;s first look at the reasons we trusted photographic images so far. That should give us an idea for how generative AI will impact our trust in photographic images and maybe also an idea of how better discern real photographic images from generated ones.</p><p> a) <strong>Difficulty</strong> : Our base line assumption is that creating believable photographic images with generative AI is about to become easy and widely available. While digital photography made it easier to manipulate images, the process still required some expert knowledge. Generative AI makes this trivial, removing all prerequisites other than very basic computer and writing skills. This is the crux of the matter.</p><p> b) <strong>Probability</strong> : My prediction would be that images created by generative AI are going to be ubiqutous and are going to represent a large share of all images appearing to be photographic. From reddit users trying to weird each other out to influencers spicing up their vacation pics to to full blown disinformation campaigns by bad actors like Russia or partisan news networks – my guess is that we are going to drown in generated images son. With digital images, we could still kind of take the bet that most images do show something that represents a reality, but this is about to change.</p><p> ... And I haven&#39;t even mentioned porn yet!</p><p> c) <strong>Utility</strong> : The utility of generally accepting &quot;photographic&quot; images as genuine is directly dependent on the likelihood of that being correct. So that&#39;s going to go down as well.</p><p> d) <strong>Symbolic moments</strong> : Sooner or later we are going to have symbolic moments undermining the trustworthiness of &quot;photographic&quot; images. By this I mean some form of scandal or other highly visible moment of intense public attention revolving around images and our shared inability to decide whether they are real. These will likely take the shape of an image or a video showing a famous person or a member of an institution doing something horrible followed by a that persona or institution denying the allegation and claiming that image/video was generated by AI. We have already seen a similar dynamics in the aftermath of Hamas&#39;s attack on Israel, where the world suddenly had to discuss, whether images of the burned bodies of children were AI generated or not. While that example is horrible, I think it&#39;s fair to say that the epistemic impact was still relatively low. The Hamas-Israel story is not ABOUT generated images. My prediction is: This will change the latest, once the next US presidential election gets into full swing. If I&#39;m right about this, that is the moment the epistemic crisis really gets going as well. The proximity of the upcoming election is one of the reasons I think we are operating on very short timelines.</p><p> e) <strong>Social conventions</strong> : Our current social conventions about trusting &quot;photographic&quot; images are likely to change quickly once generated images become more wide spread.</p><p> f) <strong>Trust in Sources</strong> : If I believe that whoever shows me an image tells the truth about what they know about the image, I can put the same level of trust in the image as whoever showed it to me. This makes trust in and the trustworthiness of institutions, especially media, one of the important factors in preventing epistemic collapse. If we had media that never lied and we would always believed what we were told, we&#39;d be fine. We&#39;ll come back to that as well.</p><p> g) <strong>Accountability</strong> : The higher the cost of presenting generated images as photographic images and the higher the probability of being caught, the more we disincentivize that kind of behavior. This can have direct impact on most of the other factors listed here; for example probability (less fakes) or symbolic moments (we caught the cheating journalist and made them an example) or trust in sources (we assume media would be disincentivized from cheating). I want to stress that I don&#39;t think this is a silver bullet though. The threat of punishment alone has never prevented misdeeds – and there is also the question of who does the controlling and who dishes out the punishment.</p><p> h) <strong>Personal Experience</strong> : The everyday practice of photography was something that increased out trust in photographic images, the everyday practice of generative AI will dismantle it. We will be immersed in fake imagery and most of us will also be involved in its production. News stories relying on images will called into question more and more often. Reddit will become increasingly weird and even more unreliable than it is today. I also think we are not yet paying enough attention to what deepfake porn will mean for all of us. In just a few years, it will mostly be impossible to get through school without being confronted with deepfake porn starring yourself, especially for girls and women. The same is true for anyone doing anything in public – from politicians to youtubers to pop stars – if you are female, people will put you in porn! And yes, it&#39;s also going to happen to men, probably enough to feel threatened by the possibility, but it absolutely is going to happen to the vast majority of women doing anything public. In other words: Being visually striped naked and abused in whatever way the abuser wants to imagine is going to be a very real experience for a large percentage of the population. I think there is no way this isn&#39;t going to impact our way we approach photographic images in general. This is going to become VERY intimate soon, either for you or someone close to you.</p><p> i) <strong>Biology</strong> : Currently we are locked in some kind of adversarial battle with image generators, we get better at detecting AI images, AI networks get better at fooling us. The whole premise of this article is that AI will soon get good enough to reliably fool us and tickle our brains in that particular &quot;real&quot; way only photography could tickle us before.</p><p> Looking at all of these factors, I think it&#39;s pretty safe to say trust in images is going to erode quickly and soon. Which maybe isn&#39;t a bad thing. After all, these factors are mostly not about why photographic images are trustworthy, but about why we trust them despite the possibility of manipulation. With the switch to digital, one could argue that a reckoning about the trustworthiness of images is overdue anyways. As to the question to what degree these factors can help us to decide what images to trust over others, only two seem to be really helpful:</p><ol><li> Trust in Sources: If we could trust the sources of all images, we would know which images to trust. As humanity is not going to stop lying, let&#39;s rephrase like this: The more justified our trust in our sources, the more justified our believe in photographic images.</li><li> Accountability: The more we manage to disincentivize presenting generated images as genuine photographic images, the more reasonable it is to trust our sources, the more justified is our believe in photographic images.</li></ol><p> The problem is: Trusted sources and accountability might be able to help, but they are just not good enough. Photography had the power to show us something as TRUTH, even if we did not know whether we can trust the source. Often, that was the point. And accountability has never prevented all crime. At best, it is a deterrent for some. So, what else can we do?</p><h3> <strong>New Mechanisms of Trust</strong></h3><p> When I started writing about this topic, I was pretty pessimistic. I expected that my attempt at a solution will be something along the line of &quot;The media needs to be super honest with us to not lose trust&quot;. Which, admittedly, is a really weak solution. I was basically resigned to photographic images losing their character as evidence and that their is not that much we can do about it. But a week ago, Leica <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/leica-launches-worlds-first-camera-with-content-credentials"><u>released a new camera that confirms the authenticity of a photo at the moment of capture</u></a> in cooperation with the <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/"><u>Content Authenticity Initiative</u></a> (CAI).</p><p> This is extremely good news. The way it works is that an identifying and encrypted fingerprint of the image is created (likely a &quot; <a href="https://tsjournal.org/index.php/jots/article/view/24/14"><u>perceptual hash</u></a> &quot;, but I&#39;m not sure) and shared with the CAI at the moment of creation where it is stored in a database. If the image shows up somewhere, the fingerprint can be reconstructed and checked against the fingerprint in the database. If the fingerprint matches, the image is confirmed as being real. Crucially, the fingerprint can be reconstructed from the image, but the image cannot be reconstructed from the fingerprint (the hash isn&#39;t reversible), otherwise privacy would be a massive concern.</p><p> The CAI is an initiative by Adobe, but has some really big names under its members (eg the AP, the BBC and Microsoft). Some names are missing (notably Apple and Google), which hopefully isn&#39;t a sign that we&#39;ll need to go through a decade of &quot;standard wars&quot; before a solution can be widely adopted, but this makes me really hopeful about our ability to deal with this problem. Even better, this solution also seems to be able to prove, whether an image was manipulated, and if so in which way. So we might be able to combat the issue if malleability as well.</p><p> What we should do is to agree on standards (the CAI uses the standard as formulated by the <a href="https://c2pa.org/"><u>C2PA</u></a> ) and make sure every photographic device uses at least one of those accepted standards. It&#39;s tough to say, if this is what the CAI has in mind, but that way we can envision provenance checks integrated on the browser level, so that every image that is not a verified photographic image is automatically flagged (eg by a layer of transparent color marking it as generated that the user needs to actively remove to see the image as normal). That way, we would put a bit of a break between our brain&#39;s immediate &quot;THIS IS REAL&quot; reaction and perceiving the image unobstructed. It&#39;s unlikely the solution we ultimately implement will be that straight forward, but at least we have an approach available. Also: Please note I&#39;m not an expert on this tech. It looks promising though, and nowadays I&#39;m willing to take my hope from wherever I can find it.</p><p> Some worries remain though: a) How tamper prove is that system? I honestly don&#39;t know, and I&#39;m not going to dig into it here. I&#39;ll leave revealing vulnerabilities to the Chaos Computer Club and others like them. b) In a way, this is only as trustworthy as the people running the verification procedure. If the North Korean Government runs the verification procedure and verifies images of Kim Jun Un shitting roses, we still wouldn&#39;t believe it. c) Centralization of power. Who is running the verification procedure? I don&#39;t want Adobe to be the arbiter of truth for humanity or even just &quot;Western civilization&quot;. I don&#39;t want any one organization to have that job, so control over this needs to be distributed and transparent. Maybe we can implement multiple system running in parallel tasked with checking on each other, checks and balances style? Either way, at least it&#39;s a political problem now, not something fundamentally unsolvable.</p><h3> <strong>Things Need to Happen NOW!!!</strong></h3><p> The theoretical existence of a technological solution is great, but for now it&#39;s in its infancy at best. Leica has a proof of concept, awesome! The next presidential election is 2024, with the first caucuses in Iowa less than three months away (at the time of writing). I&#39;m not sure about the Democrats, but there is a snowball&#39;s chance in hell the Trump campaign isn&#39;t going to go for the throat. There just isn&#39;t anything I can come up with I wouldn&#39;t believe them capable of. A video of Obama raping a child with Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden watching in the background, fondling each other&#39;s genitals. Too crass? I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m just not sure the technology is quite there yet. So here is an idea that is a bit more subtle and easier to generate: A secretly recorded video in which Joe Biden talks to rich donors, telling them how the problem with Medicare is that poor and old people live too long. Or how about a video of Biden having a senior moment and shitting his pants right in the oval office. The possibilities are as endless as you are willing to be immoral and cruel.</p><p> We are not going to have a technological solution in place for that in time. What we can do to prepare is to talk about this more. People are simply not aware of this enough. Both, images and audio recordings are not proofs anymore. Probably both campaigns will take advantage of that. And then there are still the Russians. Their overarching propaganda goals is to confuse us to a point where don&#39;t know what&#39;s real and what isn&#39;t. This tech is going to be a god sent to them. No way they aren&#39;t going to capitalize on it. Maybe they are going to create the Obama rape video, just to see the US tear itself apart over the question whether Trump is behind the production. The next election is likely going to be the most dirty, incendiary and ruthlessly fought ever. Generated images (and audio) are going to play a major role. And I don&#39;t feel we are talking about it nearly enough.</p><p> News media needs to have strategies how to talk about non-confirmed images. They need new formats and new ways to mark images as unreliable and unconfirmed. And they need to let us know well in advance what to expect and how those formats work. Sentences like &quot;Image provided by Hamas and cannot be independently verified&quot; won&#39;t cut it! Let&#39;s say the New York Times decides to run images of unknown origin with a big red frame, they should run a headline of Trump and Biden kissing with that big red frame NOW. Draw attention to it. Prepare the public for the info war that is about to come. When the first really big scandal is on, it&#39;s going to be too late. Everyone is going to be too emotionally involved (be it with outrage, disgust or glee), no one is going to be able to think clearly. </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/meho2wzgxongymusgaey" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/jtdofwihdli2l26wflsb 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/pcjvkcxnfwzxl64jcnty 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/r7rZBxzjm6JvmK6H9/meho2wzgxongymusgaey 1212w"></p><p> <i>Fig. 8</i></p><h3> <strong>Sources</strong></h3><p> Originally posted on my blog <a href="https://www.butterfly-explosions.com/epistemic-world-collapse/">here</a> .

This encompasses augmenting processing units (akin to neurons in humans or parameters in AI), improving thermal regulation, and maximizing energy throughput. Such enhancements enable a system to process information at a higher resolution and throughput.</p><p> <strong>Cooperation:</strong> When entities collaborate, the collective intelligence of the system increases. This is due to the improved resolution at which information can be processed and influenced, a principle manifest in ensemble methods in AI where multiple models aggregate their insights.</p><p> <strong>Conflict:</strong> The presence of conflict within or between systems can lead to an increase in intelligence. The necessity to adapt for survival and resolve conflicts escalates energy expenditure, which in turn refines the system&#39;s ability to process and affect information at a greater resolution and throughput.</p><p> <strong>Attention:</strong> Enhancing the range, depth, and sampling rate of information a system can process boosts its intelligence. This increase is achieved by allowing the system to operate with a wider context and more frequent assessments of information, thereby processing it at a higher resolution.</p><p> <strong>Actuation: I</strong> ncreasing the scope and precision of a system&#39;s actions directly impacts its intelligence. More diverse and precise actuation improves the system&#39;s capacity to affect information at a finer resolution.</p><p> <strong>Memory (Past):</strong> Building and utilizing shared physical memory elevates a system&#39;s intelligence by enabling it to process information over time at a higher resolution, fostering a more nuanced understanding of historical data.</p><p> <strong>Predictors (Future):</strong> The intelligence of a system can be significantly increased by evolving its core predictive model architecture. This includes developing new AI-designed architectures or employing techniques like neuroevolution, where algorithms evolve and optimize neural networks. Such advancements not only enhance the system&#39;s predictive capabilities but also improve the resolution and throughput at which it can process and affect future outcomes. By continually refining the architecture, the system becomes adept at anticipating and influencing future scenarios with greater accuracy and efficiency.</p><p> Specific Measures to Enhance GPT&#39;s Capabilities:</p><p> <strong>Increase Memory:</strong> Pretty obvious but nuanced approaches</p><p> <strong>Expand Actuation:</strong> More actions. Not plugins, but an open API marketplace not for humans but AI.</p><p> <strong>Enhance Cooperation:</strong> More ensembling, Open ensembling protocol, &#39;undisclosed secret sauce&#39;.</p><p> <strong>Boost Physical Capacity:</strong> Pretty obvious, more Closed-source parameters, or Giant P2P networks (Petals.ML alternative)</p><p> <strong>Intensify Conflict:</strong> Employing more discriminators, &#39;undisclosed secret sauce&#39; .</p><p> <strong>Augment Attention:</strong> This is challenging due to energy limits</p><p> <strong>Better Predictors:</strong> Increasing the length, scope and sophistication of predictive models (Neuroevolution)</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Eo3fWuwTBkMSLs8Bg/intelligence-in-systems-human-ai-can-be-conceptualized-as#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Eo3fWuwTBkMSLs8Bg/intelligence-in-systems-human-ai-can-be-conceptualized-as<guid ispermalink="false"> Eo3fWuwTBkMSLs8Bg</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AiresJL]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 17:46:23 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Life on the Grid (Part 2)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on November 16, 2023 5:22 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> <i>Previously:</i> <a href="https://www.secretorum.life/p/life-on-the-grid-part-1"><i><u>Life on the Grid (Part 1)</u></i></a></p><p> <i>Note: there is of course some continuation of themes from part 1, but this essay was written to stand on its own so don&#39;t feel like you have to read the previous installment before digging into this one.</i> </p><hr><figure class="image"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3d63886-a30b-4c85-9fc6-7e2a6feeb86a_1600x1067.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3d63886-a30b-4c85-9fc6-7e2a6feeb86a_1600x1067.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3d63886-a30b-4c85-9fc6-7e2a6feeb86a_1600x1067.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3d63886-a30b-4c85-9fc6-7e2a6feeb86a_1600x1067.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3d63886-a30b-4c85-9fc6-7e2a6feeb86a_1600x1067.jpeg 1456w"><figcaption> <i>Confinement</i> by <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmundyphoto/status/1648365650883084289"><u>Sean Mundy</u></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p> “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.”<br> — Oscar Wilde</p></blockquote><p> In part 1, I argued that our ability to navigate through both physical and mental landscapes (“fields of knowledge”) has degenerated, leaving us less willing to blaze trails or produce path-breaking innovations and generally lacking in agency and adventurousness. This degeneration of our navigational faculties has been caused by our reliance on automated wayfinding technologies and, more importantly, by an excessive “gridification” of the world, both materially (in our street networks and architecture) and socioeconomically (with our factory model schools and corporate ladders).</p><p> Here, we return to a theme that was only briefly touched on previously—the problem isn&#39;t just that the world has become too grid-like, it is that, “nothing and nowhere escapes the techno-social net which we have cast over the planet. Uncharted territory has become a thing of the past.”</p><p> The seriousness of this problem cannot be overstated. Man feeds on <i>terra incognita</i> . The wildness of our imagination, the vitality of our spirit, the boldness of our dreams—these can only swell to their greatest extent when we feel as if there are hidden treasures or secrets waiting to be discovered.</p><blockquote><p> For eons, our minds and cultures have evolved in delicate symbiosis with the Unknown, that place on the map labeled “Here Be Dragons”. Without this Unknown, that place where there may be cities of gold or fountains of youth, the heroes (but not just the heroes, all of us) have nowhere to journey and all of the things which can make us into heroes—bravery, fortitude, ingenuity, daring, and the like—begin to atrophy. Without this Unknown, we begin to feel confined, trapped, like a beautiful and dangerous animal in a small cage; we develop a claustrophobia;想象力和灵感枯萎。 For some reason, we aren&#39;t as hopeful as we used to be, but we don&#39;t know why. (part 1)</p></blockquote><p> If the inaccessibility of physical terra incognita were the only problem, then that would be a good thing as the solution would be straightforward: colonize space, the so-called final frontier. Unfortunately, the issue is just as much epistemic as it is geographic—the frontiers of knowledge are too distant and too unreachable for most of us, and our zeal for mental exploration is suffering as a result, thus trapping us in a sort of self-fulfilling apathetic prophecy.</p><h3> <strong>Frontiers</strong></h3><p> It must be emphasized at the outset that this is a claim about the accessibility of frontiers, or rather our perception of this accessibility—whether or not there are in fact fewer “treasures or secrets” waiting to be discovered is not the issue, only that it <i>feels</i> as if it were so.</p><p> Our current relationship to outer space is illustrative. We are all aware of the fact that space is filled with endless uncharted territory and that wonders beyond our wildest dreams may be waiting for us. But this “us” is not you and I, not me living in 2023, 51 years after the moon landing (if you believe in that sorta thing). Our glorious star-trek future feels too remote, too abstract; that people actually question the moon landing, even in jest, is telling—it just doesn&#39;t feel real anymore.</p><p> Imagine how the zeitgeist would be energized if some looming technological breakthrough makes it clear that the stars will soon be ours! It will feel, I imagine, something like how it did after the moon landing, or how it felt after Chris Columbus invented America. Whatever that vibe is, we lost it. The first English joint-stock company was named “The Mystery and Company of Merchant Adventurers for the Discovery of Regions, Dominions, Islands, and Places Unknown”; now we just have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u>companies</u></a> named after the formerly unknown places where adventurers used to explore. </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0733a07d-8f59-4677-b5f1-197027f06599_537x234.png" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0733a07d-8f59-4677-b5f1-197027f06599_537x234.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0733a07d-8f59-4677-b5f1-197027f06599_537x234.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0733a07d-8f59-4677-b5f1-197027f06599_537x234.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0733a07d-8f59-4677-b5f1-197027f06599_537x234.png 1456w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> The inaccessibility of physical frontier is bad enough, but the frontiers of knowledge have receded as well. It feels as if we&#39;ve reached a cul-de-sac in our understanding of the universe.</p><p> The basics of reality have been known for some time now (the atom, the photon, spacetime, gravity, the cell, the gene, natural selection, etc. etc.). Progress in physics has stagnated; we&#39;ve been stuck on the same problems (what the hell is dark matter?) for half a century (the standard model of particle physics was developed in 1972). Chemistry might be fairing even worse. Discovery rates for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries"><u>new elements</u></a> and <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/are-organic-chemists-discovering-fewer-reactions-than-they-were-decades-ago/4014692.article"><u>new types of reactions</u></a> are slowing to a crawl; at least one person is wondering out loud if <a href="https://edu.rsc.org/opinion/is-chemistry-solved/3010283.article"><u>chemistry is just over</u></a> with<strong> </strong>no major discoveries left to make, only applications of existing theory. Biology seems to have the more open frontier ahead of it, but there are troubling signs there too. As much as I want to believe that Bigfoot or the Lochness Monster is real, it seems exceedingly unlikely that we will discover any new organism which dramatically alters our understanding of evolutionary history. <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/713165/summary"><u>By some accounts</u></a> , progress in medicine has become more incremental in recent decades. We seem to be running out of <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-09-2017-the-world-is-running-out-of-antibiotics-who-report-confirms"><u>new kinds of antibiotics</u></a> . While the first half of the 20th century featured revolutionary theoretical advances like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)"><u>Modern Synthesis</u></a> (the union of mendelian genetics and evolutionary theory) and discoveries like the double helix, the biggest breakthroughs of the last 50 years have been technological (PCR, the sequencing of the human genome, CRISPR). One leading biologist has felt the need to remind his colleagues that they need to “ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02480-z"><u>generate ideas as well as data</u></a> ”. Do we even need to talk about the current state of psychology?</p><p> You could certainly argue that science is not <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/"><u>slowing</u></a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/v7c47vjta3mavY3QC/is-science-slowing-down"><u>down</u></a> or becoming <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x"><u>less disruptive</u></a> or that ideas are not getting <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180338"><u>harder to find</u></a> (and <a href="https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/ideas-arent-getting-harder-to-find"><u>people do</u></a> ), but the fact that people are even worrying about this is indicative of this sense that something has shifted, that for whatever reason we feel stuck, unable to push the boundaries of knowledge as easily as we once did. We&#39;ve focused on science here but much of the same could be said for the humanities, history in particular—we might be missing a few pages in the book of Man but by now we&#39;ve skimmed all the chapters and gotten the gist of it (or so it seems).</p><p> The reaction to this frustrated desire for exploration has been predictable. Where do you turn when it feels like the natural world has given up all of its low-hanging fruit, when it feels like there are only “known unknowns” left (“everything can be understood to first approximation before even approaching it”)? You turn inward to the <i>terra incognita</i> of the mind—to meditation, to psychedelics, to the study of consciousness. You turn towards social secrets (ie conspiracy theories) and the mists of deep time, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/27/atlantis-lost-civilisation-fake-news-netflix-ancient-apocalypse"><u>forgotten civilizations</u></a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/23/ancient-apocalypse-is-the-most-dangerous-show-on-netflix"><u>ancient apocalypses</u></a> (and ancient aliens).</p><h3> <strong>Empty Maps</strong></h3><p> In <i>Sapiens</i> (which apparently <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/micsolana/status/1610303666858397696"><u>everyone hates now</u></a> , I must have missed the memo), historian Yuval Noah Harari argues that the discovery of the new world by medieval Europeans did much more than simply open a new frontier for exploration, “it was the foundational event of the scientific revolution”.

Such a mass discovery of ignorance had far-reaching consequences, “Henceforth not only European geographers, but European scholars in almost all other fields of knowledge began to draw maps with space left to fill in. They began to admit that they&#39;re theories were not perfect and that there were important things that they did not know.” On top of that, the discovery of America was an epoch-defining event in its own right because it opened up  the vast socio-political frontier that eventually settled into the United States, the country most responsible for discoveries of ignorance in the the last century (and yes there is more than one way to interpret that statement). </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56139898-79ac-427f-801d-809a92c14bb1_736x371.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56139898-79ac-427f-801d-809a92c14bb1_736x371.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56139898-79ac-427f-801d-809a92c14bb1_736x371.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56139898-79ac-427f-801d-809a92c14bb1_736x371.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56139898-79ac-427f-801d-809a92c14bb1_736x371.jpeg 1456w"><figcaption> “The Salviati World Map, 1525.

This is not the same as asking how we can enhance scientific or technological progress; that aim, noble and worth striving for as it is, is entirely ordinary.

Such talk may not be much more than a fanciful metaphor right now, but let us imagine a time (perhaps in the very near future) when it has become all too literal, when vast amounts of intelligence and knowledge can be called forth with a word. Given that “sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic” ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws"><u>Clarke&#39;s third law</u></a> ), the users of sufficiently advanced LLMs will be indistinguishable from wizards. The quality of mind that will allow one to excel as a wizard will have little to do with intelligence or knowledge. The greatest wizards, the Dumbledores and the Gandalfs, the ones most capable of producing “sufficiently advanced knowledge” in collaboration with the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7064"><u>alien gods</u></a> we have summoned, will be nothing like today&#39;s scientists and engineers, but will be something very much like the alchemists and occultists of yore.</p><p> First and foremost amongst these alchemists was the aforementioned Isaac Newton. It is easy for us moderns to look back at Newton&#39;s enduring interests in prophetic bible codes and alchemy (about 10% of his known written works deal with the subject) and explain them away as the madness that so frequently follows genius, however this would be a mistake—this “madness” was not an unfortunate side-effect of his genius, but the source of it. The metaphysical imagination and mystical sense that motivated his occult studies were the same attributes that enabled his stupendous intellectual achievements: all was a search for things hidden, for secrets that could transform our understanding of reality. Newton&#39;s magical ability to make quantum leaps through the landscape of knowledge arose from his fundamental inability to see the landscape as anything other than one unified and limitless frontier.</p><p> Sir Isaac may have been the last of a particular breed of pre-modern scientist-sorcerer ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee"><u>John Dee</u></a> might be regarded as the second-to-last), but he was by no means the last magician as Keynes supposed. In more recent times, there has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan"><u>Srinivasa Ramanujan</u></a> (1887-1920) with his <a href="https://kristinposehn.substack.com/p/ramanujan-dreams"><u>divinely-inspired mathematical dreams</u></a> (in both Newton and Ramanujan, we see that divine inspiration only comes to those who actually seek the divine); Seymour Cray (1925-1996), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Cray"><u>the father of supercomputing</u></a> , who dug tunnels under his house when he was stuck on a difficult problem and claimed that <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/writing/PCW/cray.htm"><u>“elves” would sometimes visit him with solutions</u></a> (whether god, demon, or LLM, magic often involves communication with an entity of some kind); and Jack Parsons (1914-1952), “ <a href="https://reason.com/2005/05/01/the-magical-father-of-american-2/"><u>the magical father of American rocketry</u></a> ”, who was also a disciple of Aleister Crowley and a leader of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis"><u>Ordo Templi Orientis</u></a> lodge.</p><blockquote><p> [Parsons] treated magic and rocketry as different sides of the same coin: both had been disparaged, both derided as impossible, but because of this both presented themselves as challenges to be conquered. Rocketry postulated that we should no longer see ourselves as creatures chained to the earth but as beings capable of exploring the universe. Similarly, magic suggested there were unseen metaphysical worlds that existed and could be explored with the right knowledge. Both rocketry and magic were rebellions against the very limits of human existence; in striving for one challenge he could not help but strive for the other.</p><p> — George Pendle,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Angel-Otherworldly-Scientist-Whiteside/dp/0156031795"><i><u>Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons</u></i></a></p></blockquote><p> I know this is starting to sound a little <i>woo</i> , but we should remember that the knowledge we are seeking will also seem very <i>woo</i> to us, just as the law of universal gravitation seemed in Newton&#39;s day. But for those not willing to go full <i>woo</i> just yet, there is another more down-to-earth framing we can put on all of this. <i>Terra incognita</i> is in the eye of the beholder. Even if the frontiers of knowledge were closed forever and it actually were true that “our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place of decimals,” as the American physicist Albert A. Michelson said in 1894 (boy was he wrong), you could still believe that we were at “ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359"><u>the beginning of infinity</u></a> ”. Magic in this sense is an art of mind aimed at cultivating a particular orientation towards reality, a way of being that fully embraces the unknown, the uncertain, and the (seemingly) impossible.</p><blockquote><p> “The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.” (Clarke&#39;s second law)</p></blockquote><p> We should also recall that our aim is not to make any ordinary discovery or breakthrough, but to make a “discovery of ignorance”. It would be foolish to suppose that such a discovery would come from anything other than ignorance; not stupidity, mind you, but the audacious ignorance of the novice, the innocent ignorance of the child (an openness and lack of preconceptions similar to what Zen Buddhists call <i>shoshin,</i> <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-cultivate-shoshin-or-a-beginners-mind"><u>beginner&#39;s mind</u></a> ). This is another non- <i>woo</i> way in which we can conceive of magic: a kind of radical ignorance that we might call “childliness” (not to be confused with child-ishness).</p><p> And how do you develop such magic? Can you learn to be childly? Of course not—this has nothing to do with knowledge or intelligence or anything that can be gained. This is a magic that only arises from a forgetting of adultfulness and a remembering of the sense of wonder and enchantedness of mind that you had as a youth.</p><blockquote><p> When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong. (Clarke&#39;s first law)</p></blockquote><p> This isn&#39;t to say that the situation is hopeless. There may be more indirect means of cultivating our magical faculties, certain acts of perception and imagination which may serve to jog our memory, so to speak.</p><h3> <strong>Seeing Further</strong> </h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14468f1b-b498-441d-8b0e-9dcea7edd878_1024x683.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14468f1b-b498-441d-8b0e-9dcea7edd878_1024x683.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14468f1b-b498-441d-8b0e-9dcea7edd878_1024x683.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14468f1b-b498-441d-8b0e-9dcea7edd878_1024x683.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14468f1b-b498-441d-8b0e-9dcea7edd878_1024x683.jpeg 1456w"><figcaption> <i>Karma</i> by Do-Ho Suh (2011)</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p> “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”<br> — Isaac Newton</p></blockquote><p> This essay series began by characterizing “the Grid”: the all-encompassing standardization and homogenization of our material and social conditions in the modern world. I argued that the embodied nature of human minds means that we are more deeply affected by this loss of complexity/idiosyncrasy than we may realize; in short: simple, regular environments produce people who can only think in simple, regular ways. In this same manner, we begin here by noting another aspect of the Grid which is having a subtle but important effect on our cognition, an effect that I believe is stunting the intrinsic magic of the human mind.</p><blockquote><p> “Man has always known wide horizons. Even the city dweller had direct contact with limitless plains, mountains, and seas. Beyond the enclosing walls of the medieval city, was open country. At most the citizen had to walk five hundred yards to reach the city walls, where space, fair and free, suddenly extended before him. Today man knows only bounded horizons and reduced dimensions. The space not only of his movements but of his gaze is shrinking.”</p></blockquote><p> French sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul"><u>Jacob Ellul</u></a> (who in many ways anticipated the Grid with his concept of “Technique”) wrote this in 1954 ( <i>The Technological Society)</i> . Needless to say, our horizons have become substantially more bounded in the intervening years and, with the advent of personal computing, our gaze has shrunk to a degree that would have been difficult for Ellul to imagine. In part 1, I discussed how metaphors often reveal the underlying structure of our cognition and used this as one piece of evidence for the deep connection between our physical and mental navigational abilities: “a field of knowledge”, “broadening your horizons”, “a train of thought”, “a flight of fancy”, and so on. Here again our metaphors point to a profound connection: with most of us inhabiting such a small visual world, is it surprising that we&#39;ve become so small-minded, so close-minded, so short-sighted?Is it surprising that we can&#39;t see the bigger picture, that we have no visionaries, no seers?</p><p> The prescription is simple. Open your eyes. Look to the horizon, to the sky, to the stars. Pick up your head from the phone and put it in the clouds. Do as Newton did and <i>see further</i> .</p><p> This simple act of perception is the foundation of all magical activity and the first thing that one must do in order to break free from the Grid (magic is the antithesis of the Grid: it is that domain of reality which is forever beyond quantification or systematization). This is more than mere speculation (although it is definitely that too); Stanford neuroscientist/podcaster <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vision-and-breathing-may-be-the-secrets-to-surviving-2020/"><u>Andrew Huberman explains</u></a> the physiological relationship between your visual mode and stress (emphasis mine).</p><blockquote><p> <strong>How does [focal vision] affect the body?</strong></p><p> Focal vision activates the sympathetic nervous system. All the neurons from your neck to the top of your pelvis get activated at once and deploy a bunch of transmitters and chemicals that make you feel agitated and want to move.</p><p> <strong>Why is the visual field so connected to this brain state?</strong></p><p> Something that most people don&#39;t appreciate is that the <i>eyes are actually two pieces of brain. They are not connected to the brain; they are brain.</i> Your eyes get extruded from the skull during the first trimester, and then they reconnect to the rest of the brain.</p><p> <strong>Is there a visual mode associated with calmness that can change our stress levels?</strong></p><p> Yes: panoramic vision, or optic flow. When [you] look at a horizon or at a broad vista, you dilate your gaze so you can see far into the periphery—above, below and to the sides of you. That mode of vision releases a mechanism in the brain stem involved in vigilance and arousal. <i>We can actually turn off the stress response by changing the way that we are viewing our environment, regardless of what&#39;s in that environment.</i></p></blockquote><p> When you are constantly in a narrow and focused visual mode, you are primed for detail, for problem-solving, and tipped ever so slightly towards anxious and aggressive states of mind; you become less likely to think holistically, to wonder (to wander), to ponder the mysteries of the universe, to stretch your imagination to its fullest extent. Magnify this effect over the billions of people who spend the majority of their lives indoors and glued to screens (especially those who should be best at thinking about the big picture and the far-flung future: our philosophers, scientists, and technologists) and you have a massive shift in the psychological state of our species (see Robin Hanson on <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/near-far-summaryhtml"><u>near vs. far thinking</u></a> for more discussion of this theme).</p><p> We all know the feeling of peace and possibility that comes with an expansive  panoramic view, but it is difficult to appreciate the true power of this feeling when our doses of it are so small and few and far between. The transformative power of such a perspective becomes readily apparent however when we consider the vastest visual perception that has ever graced a human eye: the astronaut&#39;s view of our pale blue dot. </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78011a6-eecd-496a-ae8f-d19e84a4649d_1600x1280.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78011a6-eecd-496a-ae8f-d19e84a4649d_1600x1280.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78011a6-eecd-496a-ae8f-d19e84a4649d_1600x1280.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78011a6-eecd-496a-ae8f-d19e84a4649d_1600x1280.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78011a6-eecd-496a-ae8f-d19e84a4649d_1600x1280.jpeg 1456w"><figcaption> <i>Contrasted against the stark, crater-marked lunar surface, the Earth is seen rising above the moon on Dec. 24, 1968.

First of all, there&#39;s the astounding beauty and diversity of the planet itself, scrolling across your view at what appears to be a smooth, stately pace...I&#39;m happy to report that no amount of prior study or training can fully prepare anybody for the awe and wonder this inspires.” (NASA Astronaut Kathryn D., as cited in Robinson et al., 2013, p. 81)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> “I had another feeling, that the earth is like a vibrant living thing. The vessels we&#39;ve clearly seen on it looked like the blood and veins of human beings. I said to myself: this is the place we live, it&#39;s really magical.” (Chinese Space Program Astronaut Yang Liu, as cited in Chen, 2012, p. 288)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> “Having seen the sun, the stars and our planet, you become more full of life, softer. You begin to look at all living things with greater trepidation and you begin to be more kind and patient with the people around you.” (Russian astronaut Boris Volynov, as cited in Fox, 1999)</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s telling that some astronauts, groping for words to describe the experience, reach towards “magical”; we should take them at their word. Colin Wilson, author of <i>The Occult: a History</i> (1971), certainly would have. To Wilson, radical expansions of consciousness were the foundation of “Faculty X”, his term for that aspect of our minds which supports all occult activity.</p><blockquote><p> The main trouble with human beings is their tendency to become trapped in the “triviality of everydayness”, in the suffocating world of their personal preoccupations. And every time they do this, they forget the immense world of broader significance that stretches around them. And since man needs a sense of meaning to release his hidden energies, this forgetfulness pushes him deeper into depression and boredom, the sense that nothing is worth the effort.</p><p> ...The will feeds on enormous vistas; deprived of them, it collapses. Man&#39;s consciousness is as powerful as a microscope; it can grasp and analyse experience in a way no animal can achieve. But microscopic vision is narrow vision. We need to develop another kind of consciousness that is the equivalent of the telescope. This is Faculty X.</p></blockquote><h3> <strong>See the Thing Whole</strong></h3><p> Wilson is right to characterize Faculty X as a kind of consciousness. As I emphasized above, this magic is not a body of knowledge or skill that can be acquired through rigorous practice or book learning, but a form of awareness that can only be cultivated through an unlearning, a forgetting of everything that clouds our all-too-adult minds.</p><p> In this age of rampant reductionism and rabid analysis, we must turn to perception and imagination for deliverance. The first step is to open our eyes and <i>see further</i> . The next is to open our minds and <i>see the thing whole</i> .</p><blockquote><p> If you can see a thing whole,” he said, “it seems that it&#39;s always beautiful. Planets, lives...But close up, a world&#39;s all dirt and rocks. And day to day, life&#39;s a hard job, you get tired, you lose the pattern. You need distance—interval. The way to see how beautiful earth is, is to see it from the moon. The way to see how beautiful life is, is from the vantage point of death.”</p><p> — Ursula K. Le Guin, <i>The Dispossessed</i></p></blockquote><p> If a historian, contemplate the multitudes who have come before us; immerse yourself in the river of time and float downstream. If a psychologist, ponder the infinite landscape of possible minds and wonder at the gods and demons you may find there. Imagine the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of all minds woven into a single tapestry; imagine how the pulling of one thread pulls, however slightly, on all others. If a biologist, imagine all of evolution, every single organism that has ever lived and ever will live and the unbroken chain of reproduction that links them. Imagine the whole cell—every molecule, every interaction, every reaction—and gawk at its miraculous complexity. See the organism as nobel-prize winning <a href="https://superbowl.substack.com/p/church-of-reality-barbara-mcclintock"><u>scientist-mystic</u></a> Barbara Mcclintock <a href="https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2021/10/21/a-feeling-for-the-organism/"><u>saw plants</u></a> :</p><blockquote><p> What enabled McClintock to see further and deeper into the mysteries of genetics than her colleagues? As McClintock&#39;s biographer Evelyn Fox Keller notes, the profound intimacy McClintock developed with her maize over years of close association both literally and figuratively extended her vision, allowing her to see beyond human limitations, deep into the minute genetic changes occurring in maize across generations. This was not an abandonment of scientific objectivity—it was the consequence of a dedicated scientist&#39;s sustained observation. Another, perhaps unintended, consequence was an overwhelming sense of the interconnectedness of all things. Once she&#39;d developed an affinity with maize, it became difficult to disentangle herself. “Basically, everything is one,” McClintock told Keller. “Every time I walk on grass, I feel sorry, because I know the grass is screaming at me.”</p></blockquote><p> And as the grass who is stepped upon, so I scream at you: cease your endless investigations and dissections.

年代开始兴起，现在占据主导地位，它基于自下而上的<i>统计</i>方法。如果你愿意的话，它们在概念上和计算上是完全不同的，甚至是相反的。至于第三个时代，SYNTHESIS，嗯，我们甚至不知道是否会有第三个时代。也许第二个时代，即当前的时代，将带领我们<i>一路走下去</i>，无论这意味着什么。让我感到怀疑。我相信将会有第三个时代，它将涉及前几个时代的概念思想和计算技术的综合。</p><p>但请注意，我将集中精力对语言进行建模。首先，这是我最了解的。然而更重要的是，目前引发人们对人工智能未来最热烈猜测的是语言方面的研究。</p><p>让我们来看看。找一张舒适的椅子，调整灯光，给自己倒一杯饮料，坐下来放松，然后阅读。这需要一段时间。</p><p><strong>符号人工智能：论文</strong></p><p>对人工智能的追求始于 20 世纪 50 年代，它始于某些想法和某些计算能力。后者很粗糙，而且按照今天的标准来看，其动力根本不足。至于想法，我们需要两个或多或少独立的起点。一个为我们提供了“人工智能”(AI) 一词，这是约翰·麦卡锡 (John McCarthy) 在 1956 年达特茅斯举行的一次会议上创造的。另一个与机器翻译 (MT) 的追求有关，在美国，这意味着翻译俄文技术文件翻译成英文。 MT 主要由国防部资助。</p><p>机器翻译的目标是实用的，而且是不懈的实用。没有谈论智力和图灵测试之类的事情。唯一重要的是能够将俄语文本输入计算机，然后得到该文本的合格英语翻译。做出了承诺，但兑现的很少。国防部在 20 世纪 60 年代中期终止了这项工作。随后，机器翻译研究人员将自己重新定位为计算语言学 (CL) 的研究人员。</p><p>与此同时，人工智能领域的研究人员给自己制定了一个截然不同的议程。他们正在寻找人类智慧，并不断预测我们将在十年左右的时间内实现这一目标。他们将国际象棋作为智力测试场之一。因此，纽厄尔、肖和西蒙在 1958 年发表在《IBM 研究与发展杂志》上的一篇论文中写道，如果“一个人能够设计出一台成功的国际象棋机器，那么似乎就已经渗透到了人类智力活动的核心。”在一篇著名论文中，<a href="http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/drosophila/drosophila.pdf">约翰·麦卡锡将国际象棋称为人工智能的果蝇</a>。</p><p>国际象棋并不是唯一吸引这些研究人员的事物，他们还致力于启发式搜索、逻辑和几何定理证明等领域。也就是说，他们选择的领域就像国际象棋一样，是高度合理化的。与所有高度形式化的系统一样，国际象棋也以一套固定的规则为基础。我们的棋盘有 64 个方格，六种棋子，都有严格规定的部署规则，以及一些其他管理游戏条款的规则。然后，根据棋手的技巧和独创性（又名智力），从这些简单的原始手段中展开了看似无穷无尽的各种国际象棋游戏。</p><p>回顾起来，这一制度被称为“符号人工智能”，在 20 世纪 80 年代一直有效到 90 年代。然而，麻烦在 20 世纪 70 年代开始出现。 To be sure, the optimistic predictions of the early years hadn&#39;t come to pass;例如，人类仍然可以在国际象棋中击败计算机。但这些只是挫折。</p><p>这些问题更加深刻。虽然计算语言学仍在研究机器翻译，但他们也对语音识别和语音理解感兴趣。简单地说，语音识别是这样的：你给计算机一串口语，它把它转录成书面语言。人工智能人士也对此感兴趣。这不是人类会考虑的事情。我们只是这样做。这只是感知。事实证明这非常困难。人工智能人员还转向计算机视觉：给计算机提供视觉图像并让它识别物体。即使对于印刷字母这样简单的图形对象，这也很困难。</p><p>然而，从表面上看，语音理解本质上更加困难。系统不仅要识别语音，而且必须理解所说的内容。但是你如何确定计算机是否理解你所说的内容。你可以问它：“你明白吗？”如果它回答“是”，那又怎样呢？你给它一些事情做。</p><p>这就是 DARPA 语音理解项目在 20 世纪 70 年代初到中期的五年多时间里计划要做的事情。通过让计算机回答有关数据库条目的问题来测试理解能力。资助了三个独立项目；进行了有趣且有影响力的研究。但这些系统虽然很有趣，但远不如我们这个时代的 Siri 或 Alex 那样强大，后者运行在更小的软件包中的更多计算上。我们距离拥有像幼儿一样流利交谈的计算机系统还有很长的路要走，更不用说智能地谈论天气、时事、罗马的陷落、蒙古人对中国的征服，或者如何建造聚变反应堆。</p><p>在 20 世纪 80 年代，人工智能的商业发展逐渐减弱，所谓的<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1609/aimag.v6i3.494">人工智能冬天</a>到来了。人工智能和 CL 似乎已经碰上了众所周知的墙。古典时代，符号计算的时代，已经结束了。</p><p><strong>统计 NLP 和机器学习：对立面</strong></p><p>Let&#39;s step back to 1957 for a moment.就在那时，俄罗斯发射了人造卫星。也是在诺姆·乔姆斯基发表<i>《句法结构》</i>的时候，这本书在语言学和更广泛的所谓认知科学中被证明具有非常大的影响力。首先，他强化了语言学家应该研究句法而不是语义的观点，并主张将它们严格分开。这就是他著名例句的要点：“无色的绿色创意疯狂地沉睡。”它在语法上是完美的，但在语义上却毫无意义。然后，他继续根据数学证明的思想对语法进行建模，其中句子的句法结构实际上是数学系统中的定理。</p><p>他还反对统计方法，断言（第 17 页）：“我认为我们被迫得出这样的结论：语法是自主的且独立于意义，并且概率模型没有对句法结构的一些基本问题给出特别的见解。 ”统计方法必然是数据驱动的。符号系统的推理规则是由研究人员精心设计的，而统计系统的规则则来自数据的计算分析。</p><p>尽管自 20 世纪 50 年代以来就出现了各种统计思想，包括神经网络，但它们最先展示其实用价值的领域之一是语音识别。在 20 世纪 80 年代中期，Fred Jelinek 领导的 IBM 团队使用了一种标准统计技术，即隐马尔可夫模型，展示了 20,000 个单词的词汇表。 DARPA 1970 年代语音理解项目下完成的工作需要句法和语义信息来帮助消除语音歧义，而 Jelinek 的工作仅基于语音数据。 Later in the decade various speech recognition systems were released as consumer products.</p><p>语音识别是一种与识别句子中句法结构的问题非常相似的问题，而识别句子中的句法结构是乔姆斯基概念宇宙的中心问题。将解析视为自上而下的正式过程并不是没有道理的。如何将语音识别硬塞进这个概念盒子里？你不能。语音识别是指在连续的杂乱数据流中识别离散类别（单词）。单词的库存即使很大，也可能是有限的，但语音流的可变性是无限的。</p><p> We&#39;re no longer in Kansas.这是一个不同的世界，一个相反的世界。</p><p>进入 2000 年代<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation#Approaches">，机器翻译的统计方法</a>开始取代基于规则的方法，而它们又在 2010 年代被深度学习所取代（请注意，深度学习本质上是统计性质的）。尽管这些方法都不等同于人工翻译，但统计方法足以满足各种非正式目的。 2012 年， <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a>以大幅优势赢得了一场重要的机器视觉竞赛，标志着深度神经网络作为主导机器学习技术的出现。 2020 年，GPT-3 对语言任务的处理让所有人感到惊讶，并引发了人们对达到临界点的广泛猜测（我写了一篇关于该主题的工作论文， <a href="https://www.academia.edu/43787279/GPT_3_Waterloo_or_Rubicon_Here_be_Dragons_Version_4_1">GPT-3：滑铁卢还是卢比孔河？这里是龙</a>）。转折点在哪里？这还不清楚。但无论在哪里，2022 年 11 月下旬 ChatGPT 的发布似乎都拉近了 WHERE 的距离，也拉近了更广泛的人群。</p><p>这就是我们现在的处境。</p><p><i>是的，我知道，有所有的视觉和形象的东西。是的，这很有趣而且很重要。而且，不，它不会从根本上改变故事。</i></p><p> <strong>AGI Now or do we Need New Architectures?</strong></p><p>下一步是什么？没有人真正知道，没有人。大多数（当然不是全部）注意力和资本投资都集中在大型语言模型（LLM）上。 One widely popular view, that now has quite a bit of investment money riding on it, is that we have most of the basic ideas and techniques that we need.</p><p>我们所要做的就是扩大规模：更多的计算，更多的数据（参见 Rich Sutton 的“<a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">痛苦的教训</a>”）。据我所知，目前大部分资金都流向了这个领域。我们要多久才能知道，不管怎样，扩大规模是否是正确的选择？我不知道，其他人也不知道，真的不知道。如果我错了，那么这篇文章的基本方案就是错误的。我们所拥有的只是统计人工智能对经典人工智能的黯然失色。故事结局。</p><p>不可否认的是，这些新方法在符号人工智能确实遇到了众所周知的障碍之一的领域取得了巨大的成功。不可否认的是，更多计算的可用性对于这一成功至关重要。我们有什么理由认为更多的计算和更多的数据不会继续获得回报？</p><p>怀疑是有理由的。一方面，法学硕士有所谓的“幻觉”倾向。他们编造事情。他们在常识推理方面也存在问题。这两个问题似乎都与系统无法直接访问外部世界这一事实有关，这将使它们能够基于事实进行购买并访问常识所依赖的物理世界的所有许多细节。他们在严密的逻辑推理和（复杂的）计划方面也有困难。这些各种限制似乎是架构中固有的，因此不能简单地通过扩展来解决。</p><p>这些批评和其他批评需要争论，而不仅仅是陈述。但这不是争论的地方。我在<a href="https://www.academia.edu/43787279/GPT_3_Waterloo_or_Rubicon_Here_be_Dragons_Version_4_1">GPT-3 中阐述了其中的一些：滑铁卢还是卢比孔河？</a>加里·马库斯也许是对现政权最明显的批评者。您也可以检查他的子堆栈<a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/">Marcus on AI</a>的参数。我们都主张在这些符号系统中添加符号方法。领导 IBM Watson 项目的 David Ferrucci 一直远离公共领域，但他正在建立一家基于统计和符号概念和技术集成的公司<a href="https://ec.ai/">Elemental Cognition</a> 。 Yann LeCun 认为，<a href="https://www.noemamag.com/ai-and-the-limits-of-language/">仅接受语言训练的系统本质上是有限的</a>。他在这一点上肯定是正确的。 Subbarao Kambhampati 是规划系统方面的专家，他<a href="https://x.com/rao2z/status/1449831285199814659?s=20">在推特上列出了他撰写的一些批评文章</a>。其他人也很批评。</p><p>我的观点很简单，有人反对我们需要做的就是构建越来越大的系统这一想法。简单地指向未来并说“前进吧！”并不否认这些理由。如果这些理由被证明是有效的，接下来会发生什么？</p><p><strong>综合：假设我是对的，这种演变有什么辩证性？</strong></p><p>或者，更简单地说，为什么它是一种演变，而不仅仅是一件又一件的事情？</p><p>让我们回到最初。虽然我以几乎标准的方式讲述了这个故事，但符号计算被各种统计方法所掩盖，两种想法从一开始就混合在一起。正如<a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/markets-and-the-good/articles/language-machinery">理查德·休斯·吉布森（Richard Hughes Gibson）在最近一篇非常有趣的文章中指出的</a>那样，早在 20 世纪 40 年代和 50 年代初，克劳德“信息论”香农实际上是手工模拟当前语言机器学习引擎的小型版本。 Warren Weaver 提出了机器翻译的统计基础。</p><p>那么，为什么当时这些想法没有付诸实施呢？因为，正如马克思主义者可能会说的那样，物质条件不合适。他们没有这样做所需的计算机或数据。虽然传输器几乎不存在，但集成电路却没有，更不用说真正强大的处理器所需的大规模集成，更不用说所需的全部外围设备了。</p><p>即使他们拥有计算能力，我也怀疑这些统计思想是否会是第一个被尝试的。为什么？因为有一个悠久的思想传统——从 19 世纪的乔治·布尔、17 世纪的莱布尼茨到古代世界的亚里士多德——其中语言和思想都是用逻辑来概念化的。当这些知识分子聚集在<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop">1956 年著名的达特茅斯研讨会</a>上时，这是最接近的传统，该研讨会标志着人工智能的制度起源。此外，早在 1943 年，沃伦·麦卡洛克 (Warren McCulloch) 和沃尔特·皮茨 (Walter Pitts) 就发表了《<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf">神经活动中内在思想的逻辑演算</a>》，其中，正如标题所示，将神经系统视为执行逻辑运算是有道理的。</p><p>就这样就基本解决了。对心智计算观的理论和实践联合研究以达特茅斯研讨会产生的三个想法为基础：“符号方法、专注于有限领域的系统（早期专家系统）以及演绎系统与归纳系统。”第一个和第三个遵循逻辑传统，而第二个是由可用计算机的性质决定的实际需要。</p><p>然后，我们勇敢的知识冒险家团队开始探索新的领域。人们可以争论他们是否发现了这片领土，或者发明了它，但目前我不在乎我们以哪种方式思考它。他们对此进行了大约三十年的探索，然后人工智能冬天在 20 世纪 80 年代中期到来。 You can see it in the dip in the blue curve in the following graph, which is from Google Ngrams: </p><figure class="image"><img

939w"></figure><p>发生了什么？文献中对此有很多讨论。这是一个重要的问题。但我什至不打算尝试最简短的总结。我会把它当作一个残酷的事实。</p><p>接下来发生了什么？正如您所看到的，神经网络曲线开始上升，并在 20 世纪 90 年代中期达到顶峰。从我在这篇文章中的观点来看，这是一个统计技术家族，尽管与机器学习相关的技术家族有些不同，机器学习从 20 世纪 80 年代中期到 2015 年逐渐兴起，在这一点上转向急剧上升，使其高于神经网络和人工智能的曲线。至于“人工智能”，我强烈怀疑从 2015 年开始，这个术语更可能指的是神经网络或机器学习家族中的统计技术，而不是传统的符号人工智能。这并不是说象征性的人工智能已经从地球表面消失了。它仍然存在；但这只是人工智能总体框架下所做工作的相对较小的组成部分。</p><p>当然，机器学习和神经网络都不是凭空出现的。正如我在本节开头指出的那样，它们从一开始就存在。 They never disappeared.总是有人在研究它们。但当人工智能冬天到来时，事情开始解冻，首先是神经网络，然后是机器学习。人员和资源进入这些地区并开始探索该领土的这些地区。</p><p>这将我们带到上一节中的位置：下一步是什么？正如我当时所说，我认为现政权是靠借来的时间生存的。它也会碰壁。然后怎样呢？</p><p>我不知道。也许整个企业都会崩溃。那些致力于当前政权“更大数据、更大计算”的人将拒绝承认进展已经停滞，并将尽其所能地步履蹒跚。由于其他方法的倡导者一直缺乏资源，他们无法真正进入已经出现的概念和技术真空。他们只能零零散散地前行，依靠大帮残余分子留下的残渣生存。 What of China, India, Japan, and even Africa?他们是否也会陷入困境？谁知道。</p><p>但无论如何，我确实认为该企业会以某种方式继续下去。假设人力、物力都有了，创意怎么样？我认为可能有第三种观念与符号和统计观念截然不同，但我没有听说过它们，我认识的人也没有听说过它们。</p><p>不，为了继续前进，我们需要结合两个家族的想法的方法。谁知道这种合成会采取什么形式呢？也许我们应该向大脑寻求灵感。这就是我和 David Hays 在 1988 年<a href="https://www.academia.edu/235116/Principles_and_Development_of_Natural_Intelligence">《自然智能的原理与发展》</a>中所做的事情。最近，我用复杂的动力学（例如 Walter J. Freeman）和 Peter Gärdenfors 的几何语义来增强和扩展这些想法<a href="https://www.academia.edu/81911617/Relational_Nets_Over_Attractors_A_Primer_Part_1_Design_for_a_Mind_Version_3">，《吸引子上的关系网络，入门：第 1 部分，为心灵设计》</a> （2023 年）。当然，我不是唯一一个探索这些想法的人。如果辩证法停滞不前，那并不是因为缺乏思想。</p><p>至于辩证法，首先我们探索象征领域，论文。这种情况崩溃了，我们探索统计领域，即对立面。什么时候崩溃？当这种情况崩溃时，我们就没有领土了，不是吗？我们汲取这两个领域的想法，并在“更高”的层面上创建一个新领域：综合。</p><p>稍后再说。</p><p> ** ** ** **<br></p><p><strong>附录：1975 年和 2018 年图灵奖</strong></p><p>我突然想到，评选<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">图灵奖</a>获奖者的委员会非常友善地认识到符号人工智能和统计人工智能之间的区别。 1975 年，该奖项授予艾伦·纽厄尔 (Allen Newell) 和赫伯特·西蒙 (Herbert Simon)，以表彰他们“对人工智能、人类认知心理学和列表处理做出的基本贡献”。 2018 年，Yoshua Bengio、Geoffrey Hinton 和 Yann LeCun 荣获“概念和工程突破，使深度神经网络成为计算的关键组成部分”。以下是他们纪念这一时刻的论文：</p><p> Allen Newell 和 Herbert A. Simon，计算机科学作为实证探究：符号和搜索， <i>ACM 通信</i>。第 19 卷，1976 年 3 月 3 期，第 113–126 页， <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/360018.360022">https://doi.org/10.1145/360018.360022</a></p><p> Yoshua Bengio, Yann Lecun,

href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3448250">https://doi.org/10.1145/3448250</a></p><p>这篇文章的最后一段很有启发性：</p><blockquote><p>这些开放性问题所提出的方向与 20 世纪的符号人工智能研究项目有何关系？显然，这个符号人工智能程序旨在实现系统 2 的能力，例如推理、能够将知识分解成可以在一系列计算步骤中轻松重新组合的片段，以及能够操纵抽象变量、类型和实例。我们希望设计出能够在处理实值向量的同时完成所有这些事情的神经网络，以保留深度学习的优势，其中包括使用可微计算和基于梯度的自适应进行高效的大规模学习，为高层奠定基础低级感知和行动中的概念、处理不确定数据以及使用分布式表示。</p></blockquote><p>我相信，是的，我们可以做到这一点，但这样做需要我们在“更高”的水平上整合经典符号推理和统计深度学习的工具和技术。想想皮亚杰的反射抽象概念，其中一个级别的操作工具成为在进化的更高级别上部署和操作的对象。</p><br/><br/>
