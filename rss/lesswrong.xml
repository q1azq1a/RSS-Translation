[ChatGPT]]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on September 1, 2023 2:18 PM GMT<br/><br/><p><a href="https://new-savanna.blogspot.com/2023/09/can-llm-identify-ring-composition-in.html"><i>从新稀树草原</i></a><i>交叉发布</i><i>。</i></p><p>试探性地，非常试探性地，是的。 ChatGPT 曾经做到过。我相信更强大的引擎可以做得更多。</p><p><strong>但是：什么是环组合？</strong></p><p>简单地说，环组合或环形式是具有如下形式的文本： <i><strong>A, B, C...X...C&#39;, B&#39;, A&#39;</strong></i> 。这是一个有中心部分的文本，其他部分对称排列在周围。 ChatGPT 稍后会详细介绍这一点。</p><p>为什么我对环的组成感兴趣？原则上我对所有文学形式都感兴趣。在实践中，寻找特定类型的形式结构更容易。虽然一些有趣且重要的文本表现出环的构成（例如《忽必烈汗》、《黑暗之心》、《哈姆雷特》），但我不知道它有多普遍，其他人也不知道。我怀疑这是一种少数形式，甚至可能是一小部分。</p><p>我开始认为文学研究就像生物学一样：一切都始于描述。生物学家花了几个世纪的时间寻找和描述生命形式。有些已经进行了非常详细的描述，有些则仅足以将它们放入分类法中，我们在两者之间进行了各种程度的描述。嗯，文学就像生物学一样，我们有无数的研究对象，每个对象都有独特的特征。但文学学者还没有承担起描述我们文本的工作。哦，有一些工作，但没有生物学家在他们的领域所做的那么深入和丰富——我在下面给出了证明这一主张的材料的链接。</p><p>我对形式特别感兴趣。意义不可避免地存在主观因素，但我相信形式可以被客观地描述。多年来我做了足够多的描述性工作，知道这是艰苦、困难和乏味的，但并不是火箭科学。如果我们能够向法学硕士展示我们的文本并让它承担描述文本的困难单调，那将会很有用。甚至可能有两个或三个不同的法学硕士独立地描述特定的文本。然后，就像生物学家检查彼此的描述性工作一样，人类评论家也可以审查法学硕士的工作。对重要文本的描述将得到非常详细的审查，而法学硕士在次要文本上所做的大部分工作，那些根本没有文学评论家研究过的文本（就像潜伏在图书馆书架的地下室里的所有 19 世纪小说一样）可能会被忽略。根本不会被检查。但如果有人感兴趣的话它就在那里。</p><p>但法学硕士可以完成这项工作吗？我们不知道。然而，在这篇文章的其余部分，我提出了一些小迹象，表明他们很可能能够做到这一点。</p><blockquote><p><strong>注意</strong>：前几段中的材料比我在这里给出的材料更值得讨论。但这不是这样的地方。我在这些标签下有很多关于这些问题的帖子：

href="https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/BillBenzon/Ring-Composition">“戒指组成”</a>部分和一个<a href="https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/BillBenzon/Description">“描述”</a>部分。</p></blockquote><p><strong>第一次问：什么是环组成？ [2022 年 12 月 1 日]</strong></p><p>当我第一次访问 ChatGPT 时，我询问了有关环组成的问题。它的反应平淡无奇。</p><p>我的提示是粗体的，而 ChatGPT 的回复是普通的。</p><blockquote><p><strong>什么是环组成？</strong></p><p>环形结构是一种文学结构，其中文本的结尾以某种有意义的方式链接回开头。它是通过重复某些元素而创建的思想、图像或文字的闭合循环。环形构图有时用于强调主题或在文本中创建对称性。</p><p><strong>有哪些使用环构成的文本？</strong></p><p> 1. 《圣经》 2. 贝奥武甫 3. 约翰·弥尔顿的《失乐园》 4. 荷马的《奥德赛》 5. 荷马的《伊利亚特》 6. 杰弗里·乔叟的《坎特伯雷故事集》 7. 但丁·阿利吉耶里的《神曲》 8. 赫尔曼·梅尔维尔的《白鲸》 9.维吉尔的《埃涅阿斯纪》</p><p><strong>有没有使用环形构图的电影？</strong></p><p>是的，有些电影已知使用环形构图。电影《记忆碎片》（2000）是使用这种结构的电影的一个著名例子。影片以相同的场景开始和结束，某些元素在整部电影中不断重复，形成了一个循环的叙事。</p><p><strong>莎士比亚的《哈姆雷特》是否使用了环形构图？</strong></p><p>是的，一些学者认为莎士比亚的《哈姆雷特》确实使用了环形构图。该剧以同一场景开始和结束，某些元素，如人物、主题和词语在整个剧中重复出现。</p></blockquote><p>定义没问题，但不够具体。这不会是一个非常有用的指南。文本列表似乎还不错，尽管《白鲸》对我来说似乎有些可疑。研究 19 世纪小说的评论家不会去寻找环的构成。最后两个问题的答案太模糊，根本没有希望。总的来说，我没有理由相信 ChatGPT 对于环组成有一个有用的想法。</p><p>然后，在没有任何具体期望的情况下——虽然我没有抱太大期望，但我决定再次尝试 ChatGPT。不是新的和改进的 ChatCPT Plus，它连接到 GPT-4，而只是普通的旧 Chatster。这让我很惊讶。</p><p><strong>更好：什么是环组成？ [2023 年 8 月 31 日]</strong></p><p>它运行的是 8 月 31 日的版本。</p><blockquote><p><strong>解释什么是文学结构中的环构成。</strong></p><p>环形构图，也称为奇斯结构或循环构图，是一种文学和修辞技巧，故事或文本以循环或循环的方式构建，通常以相似或相关的元素开始和结束。它涉及以这样的方式组织叙述或内容，即叙述围绕一个中心主题、想法或事件，相关元素或主题以对称或平衡的方式相互反映。</p><p>以下是环组成的一些关键特征和示例：</p><p> 1.圆形结构：环形构图通常以圆形或封闭的形式呈现叙事。这意味着故事以相似或相关的元素开始和结束，创造出一种封闭和统一的感觉。</p><p> 2.中心主题：在构图的中心，有一个中心主题、事件或思想，作为叙述的焦点。这个中心元素被其他与其相关或以某种方式反映的元素所包围。</p><p> 3.镜像和平行：叙事中的元素通常是相互镜像或平行的。这可能涉及人物、事件、主题或主题，这些人物、事件、主题或主题的呈现方式可以引起人们对它们的相似性或对比的注意。</p><p> 4. 对称性：戒指的构图通常力求平衡和对称，相应的元素以刻意且结构化的方式放置。这种对称性可以增强作品的整体美感和主题冲击力。</p><p> 5. 强调中心：构图的中心元素通常是故事中最重要和最受强调的部分。它常常代表叙述中的转折点或关键启示。</p><p> 6. 多层：环组合物可以具有多层镜像和平行性。这可以创建一个复杂而错综复杂的结构，每一层都有助于文本的整体含义。</p><p> 7. 口头传统中常见：环的构成一直是口头传统和史诗中的共同特征。例如，荷马的《伊利亚特》和《奥德赛》的结构就展现了环形构图的元素，事件和主题在整个叙事中相互呼应。</p><p> 8.修辞手段：除了讲故事之外，环形结构也被用作演讲和论文中的修辞手段，以强化要点并在文本中营造封闭感和统一感。</p><p>环形构图在文学中具有多种用途，例如强化主题、创造叙事对称性以及通过突出文本中的模式和联系来吸引读者或听众的注意力。它可以成为一个强大的工具，以令人难忘和有意义的方式传达复杂的想法和构建叙述。</p></blockquote><p>这比 12 月份给我的信息要详细得多。问题是，它能分析实际文本并识别环形吗？我决定让它在一个具体的例子上发挥作用，即<a href="https://new-savanna.blogspot.com/2017/11/st-george-and-dragon-as-ring-composition.html">我已经分析过的</a>圣乔治和龙的故事。我正在使用<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#Golden_Legend">维基百科的文本</a>。</p><blockquote><p><strong>下面的故事是否表现出环的组成？为什么或者为什么不？</strong></p><p><strong>利比亚的席琳（Silene）受到附近池塘里一条喷出毒液的龙的困扰，毒害了整个乡村。为了防止它影响城市本身，人们每天向它献上两只羊，然后是一个人和一只羊，最后是通过抽签选出的孩子和青少年。有一次，抽签落在了国王的女儿身上。国王拿出所有的金银来饶恕他的女儿，但人民拒绝了。女儿打扮成新娘，被送到湖边喂龙。</strong></p><p><strong>圣乔治偶然来到了这个地方。公主试图送他走，但他发誓要留下来。当他们交谈时，龙从池塘里出现了。圣乔治画了十字，骑马冲向它，用长矛将它重伤。然后他叫公主把她的腰带（zona）扔给他，他把它套在龙的脖子上。无论她走到哪里，巨龙都像一头被皮带拴着的“温顺的野兽”一样跟随着她。</strong></p><p><strong>公主和圣乔治把巨龙带回了席琳娜城，那里的民众都被巨龙吓坏了。如果他们同意成为基督徒并接受洗礼，圣乔治提出杀死龙。包括西林国王在内的一万五千人皈依了基督教。乔治随后杀死了这条龙，用剑斩首，尸体用四辆牛车运出城。国王在龙死的地方建造了一座圣母玛利亚和圣乔治教堂，并在龙的祭坛上流出泉水，水可以治愈所有疾病。</strong></p><p>您提供的故事没有表现出严格的环组成。环的构成通常涉及更圆形或循环的结构，其中叙述以相关元素开始和结束，创造出封闭和对称的感觉。在这个故事中，事件的发展是线性的，从最初的龙困扰席琳市的问题到问题的解决以及该市民众的皈依和圣乔治杀死龙。这个故事并没有回到最初的状态，也没有以环结构的特征来反映它的开始。</p><p>虽然故事确实包含重复和平行的元素（例如，不断升级的对龙的祭祀和人们最终皈依基督教），但这些元素并没有形成封闭的循环结构。相反，它们通过展示事件的进展和人物发展来促进整体叙事弧线。</p><p>环形构图是一种特定的结构手法，虽然在很多叙事中都可以找到重复、平行的元素，但这并不一定意味着故事整体就呈现出环形构图。这个故事似乎遵循更线性的叙事结构，有清晰的开头、中间和结尾。</p></blockquote><p>因为我知道它确实表现出环的组成，所以我立即检查了大拇指朝下的按钮。当我完成后，ChatGPT 就提供了另一个答案，这让我感到困惑，因为我以前从未见过这种行为。答案如下：</p><blockquote><p>您所呈现的结构确实展示了环组成的清晰示例。故事以对称的方式组织，中心部分（Ω）作为叙事的关键点。对称性的工作原理如下：</p><p> 1. 故事以利比亚席勒涅的龙问题开始（1），并以通过建造一座教堂和一个神奇的泉水解决这个问题而结束（1&#39;）。</p><p> 2. 对龙的不断升级的牺牲，从两只羊开始，最终以一人和一只羊的牺牲结束 (2)，这与圣乔治不断升级的行动相呼应，从他到达现场开始，最终以龙的牺牲结束。失败（2&#39;）。</p><p> 3. 落在国王女儿身上的抽签 (3) 对应于圣乔治提出杀死龙以换取该城市皈依基督教 (3&#39;)。</p><p> 4. 公主被送去喂龙 (4)，与公主和圣乔治带领龙返回城市 (4&#39;) 平行。</p><p>

对对称性的解释是正确的。鉴于我已经向它提供了故障——我不知道它是否可以自己做到这一点——产生这样的解释并不困难，当然对人类来说更是如此。但我很难否认它所做的事情需要推理，不是深度推理，但仍然需要推理。</p><p>当然，一个更强大的引擎，一个在文学形式分析方面进行微调的引擎，可以做得更好。电影呢？电影也表现出环的构成。我分析过的一些作品： <a

OpenAI<i>正在</i>采取哪些措施来让人工智能更安全呢？</p><p>总的来说，OpenAI 非常看好利用 AI 来帮助进行比对研究。</p><p>他们的基本方法基于三个概念：</p><ol><li>使用人类反馈训练人工智能系统</li><li>训练人工智能系统协助人类评估</li><li>训练人工智能系统进行对齐研究</li></ol><p>换句话说，他们希望通过使用多种涉及人类评估人工智能性能的技术，并使用人工智能帮助人类评估其他人工智能的性能，使人工智能更安全。最终，他们希望这种方法能够得到发展，直到他们拥有足够智能（且安全）的人工智能，可以自行进行人工智能安全研究。</p><h2>使用人类反馈训练人工智能系统</h2><p>这里的基本概念是“<a

RLHF，我们更像是训练一只狗——我们观察它在做什么，并在它做的事情看起来更像我们希望它做的事情时奖励它。例如，我们向人类展示两个人工智能随机行为的片段，并询问他们哪个看起来更像后空翻。如果你经常这样做，人工智能就会做一个后空翻。</p><p> <a

找出了人类想要什么，模型 2 找出了如何实现该目标。使用模型 1 可以节省时间，因为这意味着人类不必对人工智能所做的每件事进行评分，而是可以间歇性地询问发生了什么。</p><p>这对于“微调”大型模型也很有用。<a href="https://ui.stampy.ai/?state=8161_"><u>大型语言模型</u></a>(LLM) 使用大量数据（例如来自互联网的文本）进行训练，直到它们能够可预测地输出令人信服的文本。然而，他们只是输出与他们接收的文本相似的文本——这意味着他们通常是粗鲁的、危险的或无益的。解决这个问题的一种方法是<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230227112828mp_/https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/"><u>使用 RLHF</u></a> ：让很多人查看 LLM 输出的文本，看看它是否有害，然后根据该数据训练模型。</p><h2>训练人工智能系统协助人类评估</h2><p>然而，这种方法的作用仅限于此。尽管对表现进行评级通常比实际表现更容易，但在某些时候，人类无法判断人工智能的表现如何。 AI已经能够超越</p><p>OpenAI 针对这个问题的主要解决方案是什么？训练人工智能来帮助人类评价人工智能！他们在<a href="https://openai.com/research/webgpt"><u>许多</u></a><a href="https://openai.com/research/critiques"><u>论文</u></a>中证明了这一点。例如，他们研究<a href="https://openai.com/research/summarizing-books"><u>总结书籍的问题。</u></a>训练人工智能总结书籍是相当困难的，因为训练人工智能需要进行大量的训练，而且你必须要求某人为每一本书阅读整本书。为了帮助实现这一目标，他们训练人工智能来总结书籍的<i>章节</i>，这要容易得多——每次训练都需要有人阅读一章。然后他们用那个<i> </i>AI辅助人们判断整本书的AI——人们可以阅读章节摘要而不是整本书，并以此来判断整本书的摘要。</p><p>到目前为止，他们还没有更进一步，用真正超人的人工智能进行测试，但他们表示，他们计划很快发布类似实验的数据，以判断编码任务，而这些任务对于无人协助的人类来说很难可靠地判断。</p><h2>训练人工智能系统进行对齐研究</h2><p>最终，OpenAI 希望能够自动发现人工智能安全中的新概念和方法。</p><p>他们认为大型语言模型是这样做的良好基础，因为它们已经包含了大量的知识。他们认为，培训越来越高效的研究助理将使越来越多的人工智能安全研究实现自动化，而狭窄的系统（不太可能产生危险）可能适合此类任务。</p><p>他们的新<a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment">超级调整</a>团队专注于这一目标。他们还概述了他们关注的三个原则，以确保自动化研究助理的安全：</p><ol><li>训练人工智能系统来帮助人类评估者</li><li>验证他们的助理是否安全</li><li>训练不安全代理类型的小例子并确认他们开发的工具可以使这些代理安全。</li></ol><p>我们已经讨论了 1，他们还没有发表关于 3 的工作，所以我们在这里重点讨论 2。有关 3 的示例，您可以查看<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ChDH335ckdvpxXaXX/model-organisms-of-misalignment-the-case-for-a-new-pillar-of-1"><u>Anthropic 最近的一些工作</u></a>。</p><p> OpenAI 概述了他们有兴趣验证助手安全的两种关键方法。</p><p>首先，他们希望利用人工智能来发现其他人工智能行为不可接受的边缘情况。我们将很快发布，更深入地解释其工作原理。</p><p>他们的另一种方法是基于<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/interpretability-ml-and-ai"><u>可解释性</u></a>。目前，很难弄清楚人工智能是如何工作的。因为我们基本上是教一堆数字如何完成一项任务，所以内部结构看起来就像……嗯，一堆数字，它们看起来是随机的。 OpenAI 使用 GPT-4（一种高级语言模型）来<a href="https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models"><u>解释其中一些数字在 GPT-2（一种不太高级的语言模型）中的作用</u></a>，并将其与人类手动执行相同操作进行比较。他们表明，尽管解释并不完美，但它们有时是正确的，并且作为起点可能足够有用。他们希望未来的语言模型能够更好地完成这项任务，或者他们可以改变训练更简单模型的方式，使此类任务变得更容易。了解人工智能正在“思考”什么对于发现诸如欺骗或人工智能预期其行为会造成伤害之类的事情很有用。</p><h2>局限性</h2><p>OpenAI 还概述了他们的计划中的一些弱点。他们目前的计划是基于在当前人工智能系统上开发安全技术，但让更大、更智能的系统变得安全可能会涉及非常不同类型的问题。他们还担心，有助于人工智能安全的最简单、最狭窄的系统可能已经很危险了。他们的新超级对齐团队专注于第二类问题。</p><br/><br/> <a

He thought that “all later utopians who shaped the blueprints of their earthly paradises according to Plato&#39;s example in the same way believed in the immutability of human affairs.” He went on, Bureaucratization is necessarily rigid because it involves the observation of established rules and practices. But in social life rigidity amounts to petrification and death. It is a very significant fact that stability and security are the most cherished slogans of present-day “reformers.” <strong>If primitive men had adopted the principle of stability, they would long since have been wiped out by beasts of prey and microbes.</strong></p></blockquote><p> “Comment posted to a NY Times article published 3 years ago during lockdown, questioning whether NYC would ever recover” (via <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelmiraflor/status/1695181415850332378">@michaelmiraflor</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been a NYC taxi driver for many, many years.

It is the best day in his life and I usually find it difficult to hide my own tears of joy as he tells me all about it.</p><p> My second favorite ride is similar. It is a young person with a dream who is coming to New York City for the very first time. I am the taxi driver taking him or her to Manhattan from the airport. I insist on the Upper Level of the 59th Street Bridge as our route. Excitement grows as the city grows larger and larger as we approach Manhattan. Finally, almost at ground level, the ramp takes us so close to the surrounding buildings that we can actually see the people inside. Touching down on E. 62nd Street, my newly minted New Yorker is experiencing for the first time the “energy” that is so often spoken of.

Excerpts and lessons from Empire State, Pentagon, Skunk Works and SpaceX]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on September 1, 2023 4:03 AM GMT<br/><br/><p> Patrick Collison has a fantastic list of examples of <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/fast">people quickly accomplishing ambitious things together</a> since the 19th Century. It does make you yearn for a time that feels... different, when the lethargic behemoths of government departments could move at the speed of a racing startup:</p><blockquote><p> [...] last century, [the Department of Defense] innovated at a speed that puts modern Silicon Valley startups to shame: the Pentagon was built in only 16 months (1941–1943), the Manhattan Project ran for just over 3 years (1942–1946), and the Apollo Program put a man on the moon in under a decade (1961–1969). In the 1950s alone, the United States built five generations of fighter jets, three generations of manned bombers, two classes of aircraft carriers, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and nuclear-powered attack submarines.</p></blockquote><p> [Note: that paragraph is from <a href="https://blog.anduril.com/rebooting-the-arsenal-of-democracy-anduril-mission-document-67fdbf442799">a different post</a> .]</p><p> Inspired by partly by Patrick&#39;s list, I spent some of my vacation reading and learning about various projects from this Lost Age. I then wrote up a memo to share highlights and excerpts with my colleagues at Lightcone.</p><p> After that, some people encouraged me to share the memo more widely -- and I do think it&#39;s of interest to anyone who harbors an ambition for greatness and a curiosity about operating effectively.</p><p> <i>How</i> do you build the world&#39;s tallest building in only a year <i>?</i> The world&#39;s <i>largest</i> building in the same amount of time? Or America&#39;s first fighter jet in just 6 months?</p><p> <i>How??</i></p><p> Writing this post felt like it helped me gain at least some pieces of this puzzle. If anyone has additional pieces, I&#39;d love to hear them in the comments.</p><h3> Empire State Building </h3><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/atkwzbarxthhqeqls3cv"></figure><p> The Empire State was the tallest building in the world upon completion in April 1931.

[...] There are different ways to describe this feat. Six months after the setting of the first structural columns on April 7, 1930, the steel frame topped off on the eighty-sixth floor. The fully enclosed building, including the mooring mast that raised its height to the equivalent of 102 stories, was finished in eleven months, in March 1931. Most amazing though, is the fact that within just twenty months -- from the first signed contractors with the architects in September 1929 to opening-day ceremonies on May 1, 1931 -- the Empire State was designed, engineered, erected, and ready for tenants. Within this time, the architectural drawings and plans were prepared, the Vicitorian pile of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel was demolished [demolition started only two days after the initial agreement was signed], the foundations and grillages were dug and set, the steel columns and beams, some 57,000 tons, were fabricated and milled to precise specifications, ten million common bricks were laid, more than 62,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured, 6,400 windows were set, and sixty-seven elevators were installed in seven miles of shafts. At peak activity, 3,500 workers were employed on site, and the frame rose more than a story a day, No comparable structure has since matched that rate of ascent.</p></blockquote><p> How did they accomplish this? Here are some things that stood out to me about their process.</p><p> <strong>Designs were made in groups that had representatives from all the key parts of the domain</strong></p><p> The team faced a tricky high-dimensional problem requiring lots of different knowledge to pull off. Here&#39;s a quote from the 1930 issue of <i>Fortune</i> magazine:</p><blockquote><p> These various elements fixed the perimeter of an oddly shaped geometric solid, bounded on one side by 83,360 square feet of land, on the other by $35,000,000, on the other by diminishing returns, on another by the laws of physics and the characteristics of structural steel, and on another by the conical exigencies of the zoning ordinances, and on still another by May 1, 1931.</p></blockquote><p> In response:</p><blockquote><p> From the outset, the owners, architects, and builder worked in committee to develop the building&#39;s [requirements]. This method avoided mistakes in design and costly delays in construction [...] The general contractor wrote: “I doubt there was ever a more harmonious combination than that which existed between owners, architects, and builder. We were in constant consultation with both of the others; all details of the building were gone over in advance, and decided upon before incorporation in the plans”.<br><br> These initial planning sessions occupied four weeks in September 1929, and produced the complete technical, planning and economic requirements for the project. (p. 20)</p></blockquote><p> For example, the mechanical engineers Meyer, Strong and Jones that noted building the elevators would involve larger installation, greater car sizes, heavier loads, higher speeds and longer travel than any previously known project. But still: “The proper simultaneous development of building, steel and elevator plans avoided the common error of attempting to fit an elevator plant into a previously fixed building arrangement and steel layout.”</p><p> The team&#39;s effort to pull in the people with detailed object-level knowledge to surface constraints and potential blockers went really deep -- the designers even brought in metal fabricators to help consult on the drawings.</p><blockquote><p> “Because the architects, builders, and subcontractors did not feel competent to develop the specifications on their own, they called in representatives of the metal workers fabricating it, those who were to erect it, and the inspectors who were to test the sheets at several stages of preparation. Such a conference, [the architect] Shreve noted, &#39;made possible decisions based on <i>instant</i> comparison of recommendations and the establishment of responsibilities of all those involved”. [my italics] (p. 24)</p></blockquote><p> <strong>The design of the building was deliberately optimised for being fast to construct</strong></p><blockquote><p> [...] nearly every decision in the design and construction of the Empire State was affected by the need for speed. [...] As the general contractor Paul Starret claimed in reflecting on his career, “Never before in the history of building had there been, and probably never again will there be an architectural design so magnificently adapted to speed in construction.” (p. 18)</p><p> The last major section of the contractor&#39;s notebook is subtitled “The Fascination of Speed” and concentrates on the four pacemakers of the construction: structural steel erection, concrete floor arch construction, exterior metal trim and aluminum spandrels, and exterior limestone. Starrett Brothers and Eken were extremely proud of the innovations they delivered in these four areas. (p. 24)</p></blockquote><p> For the building&#39;s windows, “the aim was to standardize the elements as much as possible, creating a sort of kit of parts that would speed both fabrication and erection, Among 5704 metal spandrels there were only eighteen variations”. For other parts of the facade pieces were left rough and unfinished if they could be covered with a trim, the erection sequence was redesigned to remove the traditional complex exterior scaffolding work and instead be erectable from inside the building, and pieces were designed to have fewer intersections with other pieces in order to make installation smoother.</p><p> <strong>They made clever optimisations in storing and moving material</strong></p><p> The team faced two key logistical problems: scheduling of deliveries and moving materials efficiently in both vertical and horizontal directions.</p><p> Since they were building in the busy center of New York, they had only very little onsite storage of supplies, yet at peak operation they received materials from about 500 trucks a day -- or about one every minute throughout the 8-hour workday!</p><p> (Funnily enough, one of the oldest known construction laws is the prohibition of daytime passage of carts bearing building materials through the streets of imperial Rome.)</p><p> They would always keep the ground floor free of temporary structures to allow trucks to drive in, then cut shafts from the top of the building to the first floor allowing them to dump have debris straight into down onto the back of trucks rather than into intermediate storage piles, and they even built a mini railway for moving material around inside the building. From the book:</p><blockquote><p> “For setting of our stonework, we cut out altogether the customary derrick. The stone trucks drove into the building with the stone in crates, which we call skips or slings. Marked for its proper section of the building, each crate was lifted off the truck by a small crane, operating from a monorail on the ceiling, and delivered to the flatcars of the industrial railway. Taken to the proper floor, it was unloaded at almost the exact location in which it was to be set. Two hoists handled all the stone for the building, not only eliminating a larger number of hoisting derricks and engines but, since the was inside the building, doing away with a grave source of danger to the public.”</p></blockquote><p> <strong>The general contractor designed and optimized the work to disentangle different workers as much as they could</strong></p><blockquote><p> Trades move at different speeds, have special requirements, and may view the same detail in entirely different ways. By eliminating as much of the contract between trades as possible, the builders reduced the risk of cascading delays. [...] various portions of the work show the idea in action: the curtain wall support detailed removed the dependence of the steel fabricator and erector on masonry information; concrete batching on site freed the mixers from Manhattan&#39;s traffic conditions, and the coordinated use of materials hoists, passenger elevators, and the industrial railroad system controlled the chaotic movements through the site. (p. 46)</p></blockquote><p> <strong>Design and construction proceeded at the same time</strong></p><p> Here&#39;s a diagram they made for tracking the steel processing: it charts 5 processes happening in parallel, with associated target dates -- drawings from the architects, mill orders, shop drawings, steel delivery, and steel erection.<br></p><p> <strong><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/pyxxd5rh3z66tnxqwx4g"></strong></p><p> <strong><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/lqvuojz8pkrgytn8derm"></strong></p><p> You can see that the steel for the first floors is being erected before the drawings for the top floor have even been finished.</p><blockquote><p> The diagram clearly shows the amount of forethought required for fast-tracking to be successful [JL: fast-tracking is the term used for interleaving, rather than staggering, design and construction] . Each participant had several activities to perform. On any given day, steel for various tiers was in different stages of preparation, requiring attention from several of the consultants and construction companies. Fast-track speed required everyone to move together in step.</p></blockquote><p> <strong>They used meticulous planning and supervision</strong></p><p> We saw an example of the need for detailed scheduling above, in the fast-track steel erection.</p><p> This was also the case for receiving one truck delivery every minute, and general contractor Eken said “We ran trucks for that one the way they run train in and out of Grand Central. If a truck missed its place in line on Tuesday, it had to wait until Wednesday to get back in line”.</p><p> The team also set various legible speed targets: they decided to attempt to erect the building at a rate of one story a day. (p. 29)</p><p> In addition, they had a whole slew of watchmen and checkers. They would walk through the site, make notes that every man was actually on-site (they checked on each worker I think 4 times per day(!)), kept detailed track of inventory, as well as records of what got accomplished each day.</p><p> <strong><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/fwwhbgb40bbgq642jmhv"></strong></p><p> Here&#39;s their org chart, if you want to zoom in.</p><p> <strong><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/jyxkrh7c86coudwekdg3"></strong></p><p> Here&#39;s an example page from a the daily job activity notes:</p><p> <strong><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/lia6p81zxpq7r3orwu3b"></strong></p><p> Overall, the construction of the Empire State is a remarkable achievement. Yet:</p><blockquote><p> The final chapter of the general contractor&#39;s autobiography ends not with bravado for his achievement, but with the startling statement: “After forty years of intense activity, the strain of erecting the Empire State Building in eleven months was too much for me and I suffered a rather severe nervous breakdown”.</p></blockquote><h3> Pentagon</h3><p> I didn&#39;t quite find the time to fully finish this section, but I care about the Pentagon example and it provides some interesting context.</p><p> The same guy, General Groves ran two of the biggest and most efficient mega-projects of the 20th Century: the Pentagon construction and the Manhattan project. </p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/afv1a6yplpueh1ipfpsd"><figcaption> The Pentagon under construction.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p> Construction began on Sept. 11 (the exact day the building would be struck by a plane 60 years later). Somervell pushed for an aggressive timetable — half a million square feet of office ready by March 1, 1942, and the remainder by Sept. 1. General Groves designers had already gotten a taste of the breakneck schedule. A few months earlier, as the initial plan for the Pentagon was being conceived, Somervell had famously given his designers, headed by American Institute of Architects President George Edwin Bergstrom, a single weekend in July in which to sketch out preliminary designs for what was planned to be a 4 million sq ft structure. It would be — and likely will remain — the largest office building in the world.</p><p> Architectural and structural design work for the Pentagon proceeded simultaneously with construction, with initial drawings provided in early October 1941, and most of the design work completed by 1 June 1942. At times the construction work got ahead of the design, with different materials used than those specified in the plans.</p><p> The building was built wedge by wedge;[38] each wedge was occupied as soon as it was completed, even as construction continued on the remaining wedges.[39][40]&quot;</p><p> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon"><u>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon</u></a></p><p> During construction, as many as 15,000 workers were on-site at a time. The design team included, Vogel wrote, “110 architects, 54 structural engineers, 43 mechanical engineers, 18 electrical engineers, 13 plumbing engineers, various specialists in roads, landscaping, and acoustics, as well as dozens of clerks and messengers.” Meanwhile, another group of more than 100 engineers, architects, and inspectors, located at the construction site, were authorized to make impromptu decisions — the building was truly being designed and built at the same time.</p><p> <a href="https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2021/09/building-for-the-american-age-the-pentagon">https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2021/09/building-for-the-american-age-the-pentagon</a></p></blockquote><p> The work was stressful enough that Groves said he was “hoping to get to a war theater so I could find a little peace.”</p><h3> Skunk Works</h3><p> The Skunk Works was a sub-division of Lockheed, that built primarily spy aircraft between 1940s and 1970s.</p><p> For example, in 1943 the Skunk Works both designed and built America&#39;s first fighter jet, the P80 Shooting Star, in just 5 months. Chief engineer Kelly Johnson worked with a scrappy team of, at its peak, 23 designers and 105 fabricators. Nonetheless, the resulting plane ended up being operationally used by the air force for 40 years.</p><p> For comparison: Boeing used more than 10,000 engineers to design the 777. And that was with the aid of computers and 3D modelling software. Kelly made diagrams by hand and calculations by slide rule.</p><p> The Skunk Works culture was all about keeping things small and fast:</p><blockquote><p> Kelly loved to tell how a general named Frank Carroll was so enthusiastic hearing Kelly describe the speed and maneuverability of the new P-80, America&#39;s first jet, which he had been pushing for, that Carroll decided to bypass all the red tape delays and do all the purchase order paperwork himself. &#39;We came back from a quick lunch at two in the afternoon. He had an official letter of intent for me to start work on the P-80 drafted, approved, signed, and sealed in time for me to catch the 3:30 flight back to California&#39; Kelly said, chuckling delightedly every time he told that story. The same thing happened with the F104 Starfighter. General Bruce Holloway, who was then head of Strategic Air Command, was a colonel in procurement back in the 1950s, and listened to Kelly&#39;s pitch about building a supersonic jet. Holloway needed to obtain a list of Air Force requirements to match Kelly&#39;s performance description as the first step toward forwarding a contract for a prototype. &#39;By God, Kelly, I&#39;ll write it myself&#39; he declared in a blaze of enthusiasm. Kelly helped him draft it, and the two of them carried it up the chain of command to a general named Don Yates, who signed off on it. Total elapsed time: two hours.”</p><p> (p. 290)</p></blockquote><p> They also built this really dope ship: </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/u7ntyrejd8ohdil1x1zs"></p><p> As described by Kelly&#39;s protege, Ben Rich:</p><blockquote><p> “Our ship had a four-man crew — commander, helmsman, navigator and engineer. By contrast, a frigate doing a similar job had more than three hundred crewmen.</p><p> Viewed from head-on the ship looked like Darth Vader&#39;s helmet. Some Navy brass who saw her clenched their teeth in disgust at the sight of the most futuristic ship ever to ply the seas. A future commander resented having only a four-man crew to boss around on a ship that was so secret that the Navy could not even admit it existed. Our stealth ship might be able to blast out of the sky a sizable soviet attack force, but in terms of an officer&#39;s future status and promotion prospects, it was about as glamorous as commanding a tugboat. At the highest levels, the Navy brass was equally unenthusiastic about the small number of stealth ships they would need to defend carrier task forces. Too few to do anyone&#39;s career much good in terms of power or prestige.”</p></blockquote><p> But their crowning achievement was a plane so legendary that Elon Musk literally named his child after it... </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/lrdqi2uru0ppwenmfdwm"></p><p> (The plane was called A-12 or SR-71, which are two different iterations on basically the same model.) </p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/vb9skrnacw0wxnyumqch"></p><p> Why was it so great?</p><p> Despite being a military plane that was used to overfly hostile territory, it didn&#39;t have any guns, flares, or other defense mechanisms. Because it was so damn fast that if anyone shot at it the standard defensive maneuver was to accelerate and <i>fly faster</i> .</p><p> Its cruising speed was literally faster than a speeding bullet. It flew a mile in 1.5 seconds. That&#39;s Los Angeles to Washington in 1h. In spite of being shot at over 4000 times in its history, it was never shot down, and I believe it&#39;s the only US military plane for which this is true. It flew high enough that the Soviet fighters couldn&#39;t even reach its altitude. They just helplessly flew up to 20,000 feet below, put in full afterbuner and pushed their planes hard enough that they permanently damaged their engines, and hopelessly fired their missiles.</p><p> Despite being built in the 1960s without the aid of computers, it remains <i>to this day</i> the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft ever constructed.</p><p> Yet Lockheed could barely sell it. As described by a CIA engineer inside the Skunk Works:</p><blockquote><p> The airplane pushed all of us to our limits in dealing with it. A pilot had to have tremendous self-confidence just to set foot inside the cockpit knowing he was about to fly two and half times faster than he ever had before. I know that Kelly was determined to spread the blackbird technology onto the blue-suiters and make the whole damned Air Force sit up and pay attention to what he had produced. But I never gave him much chance to sell a lot of those airplanes because they were so far ahead of anything else flying that few commanders would feel comfortable leading a Blackbird wing or squadron. I mean this was a twenty.-first-century performer delivered in the early 1960s. No one in the Pentagon would know what to do with it.</p></blockquote><p> At its peak there were 75 engineers working on its design. (At the peak of production there were 8000 workers producing one plane a month.)</p><p> The construction story itself is insane. They couldn&#39;t use normal materials because at the speeds the SR-71 was flying, the air around it got hot enough that it would just melt normal metals used for the fuselage. So they chose to use titanium, even though no one had ever built a plane out of titanium before. They didn&#39;t even know how to work it: it was strong enough that their tools would break just trying to cut it. They had to invent novel manufacturing methods just to work it, and teach those to their fabricators. And they had to do some crazy detective work to deal with new failure modes that cropped up: for example, after noticing that some titanium panels would suddenly fail after only six or seven weeks. They eventually realized that the titanium was super vulnerable to chlorine, and that those panels had been welded during July and August, after which they had to be washed, yet this time of year the local water system was heavily chlorinated to prevent algae growth.</p><p> The aircraft went from idea to service in 20 months. For comparison, the US most recent fighter generation of fighter jet, the F35, started development in 1995 and only started full-rate production in 2021.</p><p> Okay. So how did they do it?</p><p> One electrical engineer on the project recounts the following story:</p><blockquote><p> In late 1962, I walked into Kelly Johnson&#39;s office one morning, introduced myself, and told him I was having a bit of trouble understanding the Skunk Works organization. When someone asked me a &quot;What if&quot; question I really did not know who was asking and how I should respond. Kelly went to the blackboard and drew the following org chart.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> |KJ|</p><p> _____________________________|____________________________</p><p> | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> He said KJ, that&#39;s me, and all the people who work here work for me.</p></blockquote><p> Moreover, Kelly did us an amazing favor, in explicitly writing down his 14 rules for management. They were as follows:</p><ol><li> The Skunk Works manager must be delegated practically complete control of his program in all aspects. He should report to a division president or higher.</li><li> Strong but small project offices must be provided both by the military and industry.</li><li> The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10% to 25% compared to the so-called normal systems).</li><li> A very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided.</li><li> There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.<br><br> [The small teams were a key component here. In order to avoid the need for lengthy documentation, Kelly would enforce a rule to “Never put an engineer more than fifty feet from the assembly area”. (p. 222)]<br></li><li> There must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program.</li><li> The contractor must be delegated and must assume more than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids for subcontract on the project. Commercial bid procedures are very often better than military ones.</li><li> The inspection system as currently used by the Skunk Works, which has been approved by both the Air Force and Navy, meets the intent of existing military requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more basic inspection responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors. Don&#39;t duplicate so much inspection.</li><li> The contractor must be delegated the authority to test his final product in flight. He can and must test it in the initial stages. If he doesn&#39;t, he rapidly loses his competency to design other vehicles.<br><br> [JL: this contrasts with some contracts, where the air force asks the contractor to build the plane, but insists on only testing it themselves. Kelly would personally do user interviews with fighter pilots to obtain the specs for his planes, and would also insist on joining the test pilots to fly them himself, in order to iterate on the design.]<br></li><li> The specifications applying to the hardware must be agreed to well in advance of contracting. The Skunk Works practice of having a specification section stating clearly [which important military specification items will not knowingly be complied with and reasons] therefore is highly recommended.</li><li> Funding a program must be timely so that the contractor doesn&#39;t have to keep running to the bank to support government projects.</li><li> There must be mutual trust between the military project organization and the contractor, the very close cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum.</li><li> Access by outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled by appropriate security measures.</li><li> Because only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas, ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay not based on the number of personnel supervised.</li></ol><p> In addition to these rules, here&#39;s how Kelly&#39;s successor described what made the Skunk Works tick:</p><blockquote><p> We became the most successful advanced projects company in the world by hiring talented people, paying them top dollar, and motivating them into believing that they could produce a Mach 3 airplane like the SR-71 a generation or two ahead of anyone else. Our design engineers had the keen experience to conceive the whole airplane in their mind&#39;s eye, doing the trade-offs in their heads between aerodynamic needs and weapons requirements. We created a practical and open work environment for engineers and shop workers, forcing the guys behind the drawing boards on to the shop floor to see how their ideas were being translated into actual parts and to make any necessary changes on the spot. We made every shop worker who designed or handled a part responsible for quality control. Any worker -- not just a supervisor or manager -- could send back a part that didn&#39;t meet his or her standards. That way we reduced rework and scrap waste.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> We encouraged people to work imaginatively, to improvise and try unconventional approaches to problem solving, and then got out of their way. By applying the most common-sense methods to develop new technologies, we saved tremendous amount of time and money, while operating in an atmosphere of trust and cooperation both with our government customers and between our white-collar and blue-collar employees. In the end, Lockheed&#39;s Skunk Works demonstrated the awesome capabilities of American inventiveness when free to operate under near ideal working conditions. That may be our most enduring legacy as well as our source of lasting pride.</p></blockquote><h3> SpaceX</h3><p> I also read “Liftoff: the desperate early days that launched SpaceX”, which chronicles the company from like 2002 to 2008, when they were still young, scrappy and closer to a size that I feel able to reason about. Elon is well known as a magnate: but what were things like when he had a 10-person team?</p><p> SpaceX are also relevant because they work in hardware, in an industry usually requiring extremely large upfront capital investments (it used to be only governments who launched rockets), and they were started in a time where the Molochian decay in America&#39;s ability to build was already far gone. Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX COO, said that, roughly, trying to explain to government customers how and why spaceX used an iterative design philosophy was “one of the hardest things I&#39;ve had to work on for almost my entire career at SpaceX” (p. 104).</p><p> Judging from speed alone, doing rocketry from scratch seems harder than building skyscrapers or planes. SpaceX built their in-house engine in about 3.5 years, successfully made their first launch in 5 years, and made orbit in 6 years. For comparison, Jeff Bezos Blue Origin was founded earlier, in 2000, and has still not reached orbit after twenty years [at least when the Liftoff book was published].</p><p> Here I have collected some excerpts that stood out to me from the book, on areas relevant to current questions I&#39;m mulling over about org structure at Lightcone.</p><p> <strong>Team size at various points</strong></p><p> SpaceX hired their 14th employee after about one year (Elon had a personal assistant from the beginning). They also spend about a year on design before building their first prototype.</p><p> After three years, close to them finishing their first engine and getting ready for the first full launch test, they had a team of 160 people total, with about 12-30 engineers, technicians, and managers working on the little atoll in the Marshall Islands that they launched from, and about 20 people at their McGregor Texas test site. (p. 76, p. 114, p.156)</p><p> <strong>Decisions on the spot</strong></p><blockquote><p> Musk could be difficult to work  for. But his early hires could see the benefits of working for someone who wanted to get things done and often made decisions on the spot. When Musk decided [in 2002] that [a new fuel tank supplier] could make good tanks for a fair price, that was it. No committees. No reports. Just, done. (p. 19)</p></blockquote><p> And, relatedly:</p><blockquote><p> As Shotwell gained Musk&#39;s confidence, her role continued to expand. She managed customer interactions at first, but eventually added human resources, legal, and day-to-day operations of SpaceX to her portfolio. Her presence allowed Musk to focus where he could be most effective. On the days he works at SpaceX -- which have varied widely over the years given his multitude of projects, but generally amount to half of a given week -- Musk said he spends 80 to 90 percent of his time on engineering questions. This includes making design decisions, and optimizing the process by which SpaceX acquires parts from suppliers and builds its engines, rockets nd spacecraft. During meetings, Musk will make snap decisions. This is one of the key things that enables SpaceX to move so quickly.<br><br> “I make the spending decisions and the engineering decisions in one head”, he said. “Normally those are at least two people. There&#39;s some engineering guy who&#39;s trying to convince a finance guy that this money should be spent. But the finance guy doesn&#39;t understand engineering, so he can&#39;t tell if this is a good way to spend money or not. Whereas I&#39;m making the engineering and spending decisions. So I know, already, that my brain trusts itself.”</p></blockquote><p> <strong>They were able to do much of the work themselves</strong></p><p> Some of their senior engineers were also good enough electricians to wire and iterate on avionics circuits themselves. Others weren&#39;t, but had to learn:</p><p> “In the early Falcon 1 day we did a little bit of everything”, structures engineer Li said. “I learned how to use a rivet gun, and how to weld things together.” (p. 131)</p><p> <strong>How they dealt with life side-constraints</strong></p><blockquote><p> [COO Gwynne Shotwell] and her ex-husband each kept their two children for a week at a time. On weeks with her kids, Shotwell would arrive early at SpaceX, and leave around 6 or 7pm, taking over for the nanny at home. During other weeks, she could go crazy, working late into the night and traveling as much as needed. (p. 103)</p><p> [Musk&#39;s senior VPs Mueller and Buzza], who had young children, lived dual lives. For ten days, they would work twelve-to-fourteen-hour shifts in McGregor before flying back to California, where typically they wold have Thursday through Sunday afternoon Off. (p. 149)</p></blockquote><p> Another early engineer couldn&#39;t move to Los Angeles because his wife had gotten a job at Google in SF that she really liked. So Musk spoke to Larry Page, who agreed that the engineer&#39;s wife could be transferred to the Google LA office instead.</p><blockquote><p> Thompson [SpaceX second employee], with a young family, shared the same hesitation about leaving a comfortable position in the Aerospace industry. During a phone call in late April, Musk sought to all those concerns, He recognised what Thompson was walking away from, so he put two years&#39; worth of salary into an escrow account. If Musk decided to prematurely pull the plug on the venture, he would still have a guaranteed income. (p. 14)</p></blockquote><p> <strong>On ownership</strong></p><blockquote><p> [In order to work with Musk in 2006, you had to walk a middle line. That is,] Musk listened to ideas. He encouraged debate. He empowered his senior employees funding and authority. But always, he had the final say. (p. 126)</p></blockquote><p> And a related Skunk Works quote:</p><blockquote><p> All of us at the Skunk Works knew the two basic rules for getting along with Kelly Johnson: all the airplanes we built were Kelly&#39;s airplanes. Whatever pride we secretly took, we kept to ourselves. And if a blue-suiter wore star on his shoulder, only Kelly Johnson was authorised to deal with him. (p. 289)</p></blockquote><p> ---</p><blockquote><p> [In 2006] Musk would convene his different teams in a small conference room, be it his engineers working on propulsion, or structures, or avionics, and run down the major issues. If an engineer faced an intractable problem, Musk wanted a chance to solve it. He would suggest ideas and give his teams a day or two to troubleshoot, then report back to him. In the interim, if they needed guidance, they were told to email Musk directly, day or night. He typically responded within minutes. (p. 19)</p></blockquote><p> ---</p><blockquote><p> Musk had waited very nearly a full year for a second attempt, and he wanted to launch. He pressed [launch director] Tim Buxxa for why the rocket needed to be fully detanked to investigate the problem. Not safe, he was told. Could they just ignore the abort signal, reboot the rocket, and go for another try that day? Not if the sensor had identified a real issue that could threaten the mission&#39;s success.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> Buzza was the launch director. It was his call. He ordered the rocket emptied of fuel. “Elon was super upset”, Buzza said. “I suspect if he was in the control room on Kwah he would have had his way, but having him five thousand miles away gave me a little wiggle room to take more time to figure out the issue.” (p. 134)</p></blockquote><p> <strong>They frequently paid a lot for</strong> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zymnWfGwf6BdDt64c/how-i-buy-things-when-lightcone-wants-them-fast"><strong><u>fast shipping</u></strong></a> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p> Musk would sometimes lend his private jet for shipping parts. At its peak, they spent $500k and some political favors to rent a massive military cargo plane to ship their prototype rocket to the Marshall Islands, instead of shipping it by ship for a few weeks.</p><p> According to Kevin Brogan, early SpaceX employee:</p><blockquote><p> Musk would say that everything we did was a function of our burn rate and that we were burning through a hundred thousand dollars per day. [...]</p><p> Sometimes he wouldn&#39;t let you buy a part for two thousand dollars because he expected you to find it cheaper or invent something cheaper.</p><p> Other times, he wouldn&#39;t flinch at renting a plane for ninety thousand dollars to get something to Kwaj because it saved an entire workday, so it was worth it.</p></blockquote><p> <strong>For key roles, Elon hired experienced domain experts who were willing to have their thinking molded into his operational philosophy. For their teams, he hired younger generalists</strong></p><blockquote><p> After Musk hired a few experienced hands to lead his propulsion, structures, and avionics departments -- Thompson, Mueller and Koenigsmann -- he mostly brought on recent college graduates. [Those graduates had fewer side-constraints and were willing to work extremely hard.] (p. 25)</p></blockquote><p> Tim Buzza, launch director:</p><blockquote><p> We brought some heritage aerospace experience, but also were willing to be totally molded by Elon to change our thinking. (p. 246)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> Moreover, in order to get started with in-house manufacturing, they didn&#39;t learn everything themselves. They began by using a sub-contractors a firm to build their engines, but when that firm went bankrupt SpaceX acquired their machines and brought the whole team in-house to start their machining operation (p. 41).</p></blockquote><h3> What changed?</h3><p> Why was the ability to build lost? Some relevant quotes:</p><blockquote><p> Kelly Johnson&#39;s protege at Skunk Works, Ben Rich: “Kelly&#39;s stubbornness angered several important blue-suiters and a few of our own senior corporate executives. […] All of them demanded the same thing: that I accommodate our blue-suit customers and that I recognise the management&#39;s responsibilities to keep a close eye on me as Kelly&#39;s successor until I had a chance to prove myself. The name of the game was &#39;get along and go along&#39; — no more tyrannical Kelly Johnson types. I understood, as did Kelly, that he was unique in his power and independence, which was nontransferable to any successor. For better or worse, a new era was dawning for those left behind in a Kelly Johnson-less world. The Skunk Works was still expected to produce giant results, but the new guy sitting in the boss&#39;s chair would be a lot smaller than the original Gulliver.” (p. 293)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> “In my forty years at Lockheed I worked on twenty-seven different airplanes. Today&#39;s young engineer will be lucky to build even <i>one</i> .” (p. 316)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> “Kassouf [early SpaceX employee, senior avionics engineer]  had a friend at Lockheed Martin who worked on F-35 stealth aircraft, a lucrative program for the company. Eventually, the air force would buy more than two thousand units at a cost of $85 million each. It may sound like glamorous work, but it was not. Kassouf&#39;s friend had just a single job, finding a supplier from a bolt on the aircraft&#39;s landing gear and ensuring that it met all quality specifications. That single bolt was the totality of his employment.” (p.23 Liftoff)</p></blockquote><p> Note that the F-35 was built by the *same* Lockheed that also ran the Skunk Works! :(</p><p> Here&#39;s from Peter Thiel-affiliated defense startup Anduril (my model is that they&#39;re sort of like Palantir, but for hardware) on changes in defense spending:</p><blockquote><p> It can be difficult to imagine the Department of Defense, which today employs nearly 3 million Americans, moving quickly. But last century, it innovated at a speed that puts modern Silicon Valley startups to shame: the Pentagon was built in only 16 months (1941–1943), the Manhattan Project ran for just over 3 years (1942–1946), and the Apollo Program put a man on the moon in under a decade (1961–1969). In the 1950s alone, the United States built five generations of fighter jets, three generations of manned bombers, two classes of aircraft carriers, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and nuclear-powered attack submarines.</p><p> But, starting in the 1960s and intensifying through the 70s and 80s, the pace of military innovation began to slow, while costs grew. In 1955, it had become clear that the pace of defense spending was unsustainable: the federal government was spending more on defense than everything else combined.⁹ Congress knew something had to change. Robert S. McNamara, a wunderkind World War II veteran with a sterling reputation for administrative efficiency at Ford Motor Company, was the man for the job.</p><p> In the early 1960s, under the direction of then Secretary of Defense McNamara, the Department of Defense instituted a labyrinth of new rules for acquiring military systems. McNamara was not merely reducing spending: his experience at Ford led him to believe that comprehensive reform was needed to reshape how the government bought technology. He revamped acquisitions to emphasize efficiency, the elimination of waste, and predictability. The Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS, later changed to PPBE for “Execution”) process that he implemented is arguably the single most influential defense reform ever enacted, indelibly altering the incentives and business models of the major defense contractors.</p><p> [...]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <strong>1. Adherence to a Lengthy Bureaucratic Process</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> Under the PPBS system, before the government even considers purchasing a new military system, it embarks upon a years-long process of defining requirements, deciding where and how to allocate resources, and finally releasing an award for a new system. It is extremely difficult for the Department of Defense to rapidly acquire new technology, and as a result defense companies face no pressure to develop new systems quickly. Technology developed in the commercial sector hence takes years or decades to end up on the battlefield, if it does at all.</p><p> <strong>2. Working off Onerous System Specifications</strong></p><p> Reflecting the prevailing belief that industry was re- quired to execute, not innovate, to beat the Soviet Union, the requirements for major military programs are spelled out in extensive detail. Unlike most industries, which are driven forward by the creativity of the most successful companies, defense contractors are rarely asked to find creative ways to solve problems, and are sometimes punished for doing so.</p><p> <strong>3. Spending Little on Internal Research &amp; Development</strong></p><p> Because McNamara&#39;s reforms made it exceptionally difficult to buy new technology quickly or to buy technology for which there is no defined requirement, defense companies rarely develop products of their own accord. Typically, they sell existing systems (which was most of their business under McNamara) or they wait for the government to order specific R&amp;D efforts, for which they are directly compensated. For a comparison, the largest technology companies today — whose revenues vastly exceed those of the largest defense companies — spend roughly 10–20% of their revenue on research and development. Newer or mid-sized technology startups might spend closer to 60% or 70%. The major defense companies spend 1–4%.¹¹</p><p> Research and Development across industries.¹²</p><p> <strong>4. Prioritizing Proposals Over Performance</strong></p><p> McNamara believed duplicative programs to be at the root of DoD waste and would not tolerate government spending on multiple development efforts for similar new systems, whether between military services or among different vendors. This means that once a company is awarded a major contract, it is extremely difficult to take it from them. The incentive for large defense firms is hence to spend heavily on teams of lawyers and lobbyists to shape program requirements in line with the company&#39;s existing technology. This political battle becomes just as important as building the product itself. These lobbyists are often former military officials: By 1969, over 2,000 military officers per year were leaving the DoD to work for a major defense contractor, three times as many as in 1959.¹³</p><p> <strong>5. Tolerating Prolonged Failure</strong></p><p> In most industries, a company that fails to produce a functional product goes out of business. In the defense industry, when a company is three, five, ten years into a program and has failed to build what they promised, the government is stuck between a rock and a hard place — do they cancel the contract and throw away years of development, potentially bankrupting the vendor in the process? Or do they begrudgingly provide the vendor with even more money to salvage the program? Typically, it&#39;s the latter. In the words of the infamous city planner Robert Moses, “Once you sink that first stake, they&#39;ll never make you pull it up.”¹⁴</p></blockquote><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/a-golden-age-of-building-excerpts-and-lessons-from-empire#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ/a-golden-age-of-building-excerpts-and-lessons-from-empire<guid ispermalink="false"> BpTDJj6TrqGYTjFcZ</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[jacobjacob]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 04:03:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[If you asked a dog whether Humans were conscious, would he say yes?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on September 1, 2023 3:57 AM GMT<br/><br/><p> I think probably not.

Oh look, there&#39;s a whole field studying it called &quot;philosophy of science&quot;!</li><li> (20) Probability Theory - Bayesian subjective probability and the universal prior seem to constitute an elegant solution to the philosophy of science. Hmm, there are some curious probability puzzles involving things like indexical uncertainty, copying, forgetting... I and others make some progress on this but fully solving anthropic reasoning seems really hard. (Lots of people have worked on this for a while and have failed, at least according to my judgement.)</li><li> (25) Decision Theory - Where does probability theory come from anyway? Maybe I can find some clues that way? Well according to von Neumann and Morgenstern, it comes from decision theory. And hey, maybe it will be really important that we get decision theory right for AI? I and others make some progress but fully solving decision theory turns out to be pretty hard too. (A number of people have worked on this for a while and haven&#39;t succeeded yet.)</li><li> (35) Metaphilosophy - Where does decision theory come from? It seems to come from philosophers trying to do philosophy. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MAhueZtNz5SnDPhsy/metaphilosophical-mysteries">What is that about?</a> Plus, maybe it will be <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/w6d7XBCegc96kz4n3/the-argument-from-philosophical-difficulty">really important that the AIs we build will be philosophically competent</a> ?</li><li> (45) Meta Questions about Metaphilosophy - Not sure how hard solving metaphilosophy really is, but I&#39;m not making much <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EByDsY9S3EDhhfFzC/some-thoughts-on-metaphilosophy">progress</a> on it by myself. Meta questions once again start to appear in my mind:<ul><li> Why is there <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xWMqsvHapP3nwdSW8/my-views-on-doom?commentId=MqBLzocx8z8jDamop">virtually</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ghrdnc26ftJrxD49z/carl-shulman-on-the-lunar-society-7-hour-two-part-podcast?commentId=Mp96pHQyhoyEaA2MZ">nobody</a> <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WYsLjeJzh7tZqe6Lo/implications-of-evidential-cooperation-in-large-worlds?commentId=HPdgoLKheaEnSwcqD">else</a> interested in metaphilosophy or ensuring AI philosophical competence (or that of future civilization as a whole), even as we get ever closer to AGI, and other areas of AI safety start attracting more money and talent?</li><li> Tractability may be a concern but shouldn&#39;t more people still be talking about these problems if only to raise the alarm (about an additional reason that the AI transition may go badly)? (I&#39;ve listened to all the recent podcasts on AI risk that I could find, and nobody brought it up even once.)</li><li> How can I better recruit attention and resources to this topic? For example, should I draw on my crypto-related fame, or start a prize or grant program with my own money? I&#39;m currently not inclined to do either, out of inertia, unfamiliarity, uncertainty of getting any return, fear of drawing too much attention from people who don&#39;t have the highest caliber of thinking, and signaling wrong things (having to promote ideas with one&#39;s own money instead of attracting attention based on their merits). But I&#39;m open to having my mind changed if anyone has good arguments about this.</li><li> What does it imply that so few people are working on this at such a late stage? For example, what are the implications for the outcome of the human-AI transition, and on the distribution of philosophical competence (and hence the distribution of values, decision theories, and other philosophical views) among civilizations in the universe/multiverse?</li></ul></li></ul><p> At each stage of this journey, I took what seemed to be the obvious next step (often up a meta ladder), but in retrospect each step left behind something like 90-99% of fellow travelers. From my current position, it looks like &quot;all roads lead to metaphilosophy&quot; (ie, one would end up here starting with an interest in any nontrivial problem that incentivizes asking meta questions) and yet there&#39;s almost nobody here with me. <em>What gives?</em></p><p> As for the AI safety path (as opposed to pure intellectual curiosity) that also leads here, I guess I do have more of a clue what&#39;s going on. I&#39;ll describe the positions of 4 people I know. Most of this is from private conversations so I won&#39;t give their names.</p><ul><li> Person A has a specific model of the AI transition that they&#39;re pretty confident in, where the first AGI is likely to develop a big lead and if it&#39;s aligned, can quickly achieve human uploading then defer to the uploads for philosophical questions.</li><li> Person B thinks that ensuring AI philosophical competence won&#39;t be very hard. They have a specific (unpublished) idea that they are pretty sure will work. They&#39;re just too busy to publish/discuss the idea.</li><li> Person C will at least think about metaphilosophy in the back of their mind (as they spend most of their time working on other things related to AI safety).</li><li> Person D thinks it is important and too neglected but they personally have a comparative advantage in solving intent alignment.</li></ul><p> To me, this paints a bigger picture that&#39;s pretty far from &quot;humanity has got this handled.&quot; If anyone has any ideas how to change this, or answers to any of my other unsolved problems in this post, or an interest in working on them, I&#39;d love to hear from you.</p><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fJqP9WcnHXBRBeiBg/meta-questions-about-metaphilosophy#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fJqP9WcnHXBRBeiBg/meta-questions-about-metaphilosophy<guid ispermalink="false"> fJqP9WcnHXBRBeiBg</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Wei Dai]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 01:17:57 GMT</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[[Linkpost] Michael Nielsen remarks on 'Oppenheimer']]></title><description><![CDATA[Published on August 31, 2023 3:46 PM GMT<br/><br/><p> This is a linkpost to a recent blogpost from <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/">Michael Nielsen</a> , who has previously written on <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/">EA</a> among many other topics. This blogpost is adapted from a talk Nielsen gave to an audience working on AI before a screening of <i>Oppenheimer</i> . I think the full post is worth a read, but I&#39;ve pulled out some quotes I find especially interesting (bolding my own)</p><blockquote><p> I was at a party recently, and happened to meet a senior person at a well-known AI startup in the Bay Area. They volunteered that they thought &quot;humanity had about a 50% chance of extinction&quot; caused by artificial intelligence. I asked why they were working at an AI startup if they believed that to be true. They told me that while they thought it was true, &quot; <strong>in the meantime I get to have a nice house and car</strong> &quot;.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> [...] I often meet people who claim to sincerely believe (or at least seriously worry) that AI may cause significant damage to humanity. And yet they are also working on it, justifying it in ways that sometimes seem sincerely thought out, but which <strong>all-too-often seem self-serving or self-deceiving.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p> Part of what makes the Manhattan Project interesting is that we can chart the arcs of moral thinking of multiple participants [...] Here are four caricatures:</p><ul><li> Klaus Fuchs and Ted Hall were two Manhattan Project physicists who took it upon themselves to commit espionage, communicating the secret of the bomb to the Soviet Union. It&#39;s difficult to know for sure, but <strong>both seem to have been deeply morally engaged and trying to do the right thing, willing to risk their lives</strong> ; they also made, I strongly believe, a terrible error of judgment. I take it as a warning that <strong>caring and courage and imagination are not enough</strong> ; they can, in fact, lead to very bad outcomes.</li><li> Robert Wilson, the physicist who recruited Richard Feynman to the project. Wilson had thought deeply about Nazi Germany, and the capabilities of German physics and industry, and made a principled commitment to the project on that basis. He half-heartedly considered leaving when Germany surrendered, but opted to continue until the bombings in Japan. He later regretted that choice; immediately after the Trinity Test he was disconsolate, telling an exuberant Feynman: &quot;It&#39;s a terrible thing that we made&quot;.</li><li> Oppenheimer, who I believe was motivated in part by a genuine fear of the Nazis, but also in part by personal ambition and a desire for &quot;success&quot;. It&#39;s interesting to ponder his statements after the War: while he seems to have genuinely felt a strong need to work on the bomb in the face of the Nazi threat, his comments about continuing to work up to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain many strained self-exculpatory statements about how you have to work on it as a scientist, that the technical problem is too sweet. It smells, to me, of someone looking for self-justification.</li><li> Joseph Rotblat, the one physicist who actually left the project after it became clear the Nazis were not going to make an atomic bomb. He was threatened by the head of Los Alamos security, and falsely accused of having met with Soviet agents. In leaving he was turning his back on his most important professional peers at a crucial time in his career. <strong>Doing so must have required tremendous courage and moral imagination</strong> . Part of what makes the choice intriguing is that <strong>he himself didn&#39;t think it would make any difference to the success of the project. I know I personally find it tempting to think about such choices in abstract systems terms: &quot;I, individually, can&#39;t change systems outcomes by refusing to participate [&#39;it&#39;s inevitable!&#39;], therefore it&#39;s okay to participate&quot;</strong> . And yet while that view seems reasonable, Rotblat&#39;s example shows it is incorrect. His private moral thinking, which seemed of small import initially, set a chain of thought in motion that eventually led to Rotblat founding the Pugwash Conferences, a major forum for nuclear arms control, one that both Robert McNamara and Mikhail Gorbachev identified as helping reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. Rotblat ultimately received the Nobel Peace Prize. <strong>Moral choices sometimes matter not only for their immediate impact, but because they are seeds for downstream changes in behavior that cannot initially be anticipated.</strong></li></ul></blockquote><br/><br/> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ppQRJEfLBCLFzK73w/linkpost-michael-nielsen-remarks-on-oppenheimer#comments">Discuss</a> ]]>;</description><link/> https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ppQRJEfLBCLFzK73w/linkpost-michael-nielsen-remarks-on-oppenheimer<guid ispermalink="false"> ppQRJEfLBCLFzK73w</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[22tom]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 15:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
