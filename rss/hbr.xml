&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt; a href=&quot;/2023/08/dont-let-your-companys-culture-stifle-leadership-development?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/ dont-let-your-companys-culture-stifle-leadership-development?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;泰勒是一家中型科技公司的经验丰富的经理，最近完成了培训关于如何进行困难的对话。泰勒发现培训很有价值。她学习了一种新模型，练习了与同伴进行的困难对话，并从其他参与者那里得到了反馈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但泰勒从未进行过对话。这感觉很冒险，她担心这个人会如何反应。虽然泰勒知道这次谈话很重要，但她自己的经理很少如此直接地沟通，她公司的大多数经常得到认可和晋升的领导者也没有这样做。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“泰勒”是我认为许多积极进取的领导者的综合体。多年来一直与我们合作，他们受到鼓励和培养，以他们在公司中看不到的榜样或奖励方式进行领导。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我已经 &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/two -techniques-for-helping-employees-change-ingrained-habits&quot;>;之前写过&lt;/a>;关于使用行为科学来提高员工发展计划有效性的力量。当完成培训后，个人准确定义何时采取行动并计划他们将遇到的不可避免的障碍时，他们更有可能实现目标并做出有意义的行为改变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，这种关注点对个人发展的关注并不能解释任何行为改变努力中的另一个关键变量：个人工作的背景或环境。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/research/constructs/environments&quot;>;在几乎所有领域&lt;/a>;，一个人的环境在塑造其行为方面发挥着重要作用。我们环境的设计会影响我们的选择和随之而来的习惯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们也受到环境中其他人的规范和期望的强烈影响。当我们看到周围的人&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07712-9&quot;>;无私&lt;/a>;或&lt;a href=&quot;https://ijbnpa. biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-7-86&quot;>;锻炼&lt;/a>;，我们更有可能采取同样的行为方式。斯坦福大学行为设计实验室的创始人兼主任 BJ Fogg 甚至表示，“只有一种方法可以从根本上改变你的行为：从根本上改变你的环境。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在组织环境中，高级人员领导者在创造环境方面发挥着重要作用。 Edgar Schein，被认为是组织文化“之父”，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Organizational-Leadership-Jossey-Bass-Business-Management-dp-1119212049/dp/1119212049/ref =dp_ob_title_bk&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;领导者关注的内容、榜样、教导和强化的内容将对组织文化产生重大影响。如果一个领导者把所有时间都花在与上级领导在一起而忽视了自己的团队，那么他就会发出一个信号，表明他们认为什么是重要的。当领导者拒绝承认错误或弱点时，他们就在含蓄地告诉团队，这样做也不安全。在泰勒的案例中，她的经理避免了困难的、直接的对话，并定下了这样的基调：此类对话没有重要到优先考虑的程度，可以避免。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，领导力发展计划常常不会“不能充分考虑领导者工作所在的文化、规范和系统。领导者可能会被要求在注重即时结果的文化中进行长期思考，或者当他们在自己的团队中因工作而获得奖励时，他们可能会被教导要跨组织边界进行协作。当领导者和领导力发展从业者未能认识到 1) 公司文化和组织环境以及 2) 最高层领导者在塑造这种环境中的关键作用时，他们就会过于简单化，并可能会破坏他们的领导力发展工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;在 Intuit，我们过去五年一直致力于建立一种能够加强而不是抑制领导者积极成长的文化。一路走来，我们学到了很多东西，包括需要使我们的学习技术现代化，这需要我们的人力资源和技术团队的大量支持和投资。我们还被提醒，我们的领导人在有限的时间和许多相互竞争的优先事项中始终如一地优先考虑他们的发展是多么困难。虽然我们还有很长的路要走，但我们已经看到了积极的反馈、参与度和行为变化，这表明我们正走在正确的轨道上。希望我们的经历可以为经历类似旅程的其他人提供启发。以下是我们为确保我们的文化支持和加强领导力发展而采取的四项行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;定义领导力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首先，高层领导者需要明确阐明贵公司的优秀领导力是什么样子，并围绕您的领导力期望创建一种共享语言。为此，请考虑以下问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;我们最好的领导者真正擅长什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我们的领导者未来需要擅长什么？&lt;/li>; >; &lt;li>;我们期望领导者塑造和强化的文化有何独特之处？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在 Intuit，我们围绕领导力的共同语言与以下方面相关且适用，这对我们来说非常重要：各级领导者——不仅仅是我们的高管。我们还希望确保它“易于记忆和背诵”，因此我们避免使其过于规范或复杂。最终，我们将定义集中在三个核心能力上：1）以清晰的愿景领导； 2）建立高绩效文化； 3) 推动取得胜利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下一步是建立领导框架。我们将其称为“领导力手册”，它包括针对每项核心能力的三种支持行为。我们纳入的许多行为，例如“培养人才以提高绩效”，都是最佳实践，可能与许多其他公司和行业的期望行为类似。其他的，例如“专注于客户问题”，反映了我们独特的公司优先事项和价值观。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们不断收到领导者的反馈，认为将这些行为编入法典有助于明确他们的期望和提供一个框架来应对真正的领导力挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;树立领导力典范。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您是高级领导者，您可以做的最有影响力的事情是确保要让你的公司文化与你的领导力期望保持一致，你需要亲自塑造公司的领导行为。正如 Schein 所说，你的行为将对塑造文化产生不成比例的巨大影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了在 Intuit 鼓励这一点，我们从最高层开始，由我们的最高层领导者启动我们的许多领导力发展工作。当我们最初在年度领导力会议上推出《领导力手册》时，我们的首席执行官萨桑·古达齐 (Sasan Goodarzi) 和他的员工，以及我们的前首席执行官、时任执行主席布拉德·史密斯 (Brad Smith) 分享了他们实践手册行为的经验以及行为表现的方式根据他们独特的领导风格而有所不同。我们的最高层领导者为组织的其他成员定下了基调，他们的行动（比他们的言论更重要）表明了他们认为重要的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们还努力帮助领导者建立自我意识，了解他们是否他们正在模仿我们的领导行为。作为我们多个高管发展计划的一部分，领导者会收到来自其团队和/或经理的反馈，了解他们实践我们的领导力手册的程度。然后，领导者根据这些输入制定发展目标，以确保他们不断强化和实践这些行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;教授领导力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在书中 &lt;em >;高产出管理，英特尔前首席执行官安迪·格罗夫讨论了“管理杠杆”的概念——领导者可以采取的行动来增加组织的产出。他将培训视为“经理可以采取的最有效的行动之一。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为我们建立领导力发展文化的努力的一部分，我们正在培训我们的领导者抓住可传授的领导力时刻。这些可以是正式的机会——例如，我们设计的几乎所有培训项目至少部分是由领导老师主导的。我们尝试构建这些机会，以便领导者能够教授他们感兴趣的主题，并分享他们自己的经验和观察中的教训。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教学也可以在领导者日常对话中出现的非正式时刻进行。 、1:1 和团队会议。我们鼓励我们的领导者发展一种领导哲学——教授兼领导力专家诺埃尔·蒂奇（Noel Tichy）称之为“可传授的观点”。我们建议他们问自己以下问题，以形成自己的可传授观点：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;哪些经历或观察影响了我对领导力的看法？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我学到了哪些重要的教训？从我的经验中学到了什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我如何将我的经验教训整理或简化为原则或切实的建议？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在我们上一财年，我们 100% 的执行副总裁和 88我们 % 的高级副总裁促进了学习体验。也许并不奇怪，参与者的出席率、参与度和对领导力发展项目的承诺相对较强。在推出《领导力手册》后的第一年，95% 的副总裁自愿参加我们的第一个高管计划，即副总裁领导力实验室。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;认识并加强领导力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;为了让你的领导行为持续下去，必须通过你的人才和绩效系统和流程来系统地强化它们。当您的绩效系统与您所提倡的行为不一致时，&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Kerr_Folly_of_rewarding_A_while_hoping_for_B.pdf&quot;>;领导者持续实践这些行为的可能性要小得多。考虑您雇用、奖励和认可领导者的所有正式和非正式方式。每个流程都提供了一个机会来强化您的组织对卓越领导力的定义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们将领导力手册嵌入到我们的招聘、入职和绩效管理流程中。我们将行为面试问题映射到我们的剧本中，以便在招聘领导者时使用。例如，为了了解我们的“定义成功并激励团队围绕它”的领导行为，我们纳入了面试问题：描述一次你必须影响他人朝着他们最初抵制的方向前进的经历。您做到了吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在员工入职培训期间，每位员工都会了解该手册，并且所有新高管都会参加为期一年的深入学习，作为我们高管入职培训的一部分。领导力手册是我们用于绩效和晋升决策的准则，也是我们公司领导力奖项和年度领导力会议的基础。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多组织都有像“泰勒”一样的领导者 - 好奇、积极、渴望为他们的公司和团队做正确的事情，但要克服组织的阻力。采取措施创造一种环境和文化，支持和增强而不是削弱他们作为领导者的成长和发展，将会产生巨大的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt; br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;作为一名老年工人，改变职业可能会令人畏惧，尤其是在当今无情的不确定性的情况下。但你已经具备了让自己成为候选人所需的条件——你只需要做一些额外的准备，以确保招聘经理和面试官能够看到你独特的技能、经验和观点将如何推动他们的团队和组织向前发展。如果您考虑在职业生涯后期转向不同类型的角色或行业，作者提出了五个面试技巧，供您尝试。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-to-make-a-pivot-in-the-latter-half-of-your-career?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt; /a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-to-make-a-pivot-in-the-latter-half-of-your-career?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/ a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;改变职业可能具有挑战性，尤其是当您从事单一职业或行业时。当你处于职业生涯的最后一两年时，这样做可能会更加困难，因为你需要保持一定的薪酬、水平或头衔，而你的竞争对手更年轻并且“经验足够”来完成工作。&lt;/我记得 33 岁时，当我想从电视新闻记者转行到娱乐律师时，我担心招聘经理不会重视我十年的工作经验。当我在 48 岁时决定再次将职业生涯从娱乐律师转向科技这一新行业的人力资源业务合作伙伴时，这种恐惧成倍增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您正在考虑跳槽到不同类型的角色或行业在您职业生涯的后期，这里有一些方法可以让您在面试过程中从初级竞争对手中脱颖而出。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;突出显示需要多年工作才能掌握的经验。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在工作场所更加成熟意味着您不仅了解工作的“内容”，而且还了解“如何”表现出色。强调对您的职业成就和进步做出贡献的个人技能、人际交往技能和软技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可靠、准时和承诺等个人技能显示了您完成工作的整体职业道德和精力。软技能也很重要，例如独立执行工作、能够在组织的各个级别工作以及了解您的工作如何为公司的更大目标做出贡献的能力。例如，如果您有机会向首席执行官或其他高管展示或与他们一起工作，请突出显示这一经历，以表明您具有高管风范、有效沟通的能力，并且您不会被更高级的领导者吓倒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，人际交往能力在企业工作场所中至关重要。知道如何与跨职能团队成员合作，与他人解决问题，通过变革协调和管理利益相关者，以及如何在没有权力的情况下施加影响，是每项工作都重视的技能。但你的目标是展示这些技能以及更高水平的商业头脑——也许可以通过举一个例子来展示你理解决策的广泛影响的能力，或者在回答问题时表现出盈利能力的方向。提供复杂工作环境的示例来展示您对人际交往能力的掌握，将使您与那些没有太多接触或时间来获得这种经验的初级员工区分开来。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;展示您将如何带来价值.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;即使您从未在您所追求的特定职业领域工作过，作为一名经验丰富的工人，您也可能已经掌握了大量适用于该领域的技能和经验。在此期间，当许多公司通过合并角色来削减成本并期望员工事半功倍时，展示您的技能组合将有助于招聘经理将您视为最佳候选人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，说您的整个职业生涯都在金融领域工作，现在想进入商业运营领域。您对金融、平衡损益、摊销等细微差别的深刻理解，可能会让您成为比没有直接金融经验的资历较浅的人更有吸引力的候选人。当被问到一个以“告诉我一次……”开头的行为问题时，不要只从运营角度谈论你做了什么——还要解释你的金融背景如何成为你成功解决问题的主要原因。问题、影响某人的观点或获得利益相关者的一致。将这些点联系起来，以便面试官了解您广泛的技能如何使您比仅具有职位描述中列出的所需技能或工作经验更有限的人更有价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;展示您如何不断提高技能。 &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;不断地&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/5-ways-to-acquire-new-skills-without-going-back-to-school&quot;>;培养你的技能&lt;/a>;向你展示有精力继续学习，您就不会轻松退休。为了将自己与初级候选人区分开来，请解释一下您如何以与新职业相关的特定方式发展自己的技能和知识。通过查看最低和最高级别角色的职位描述，熟悉行业中常用的数字工具和应用程序。在那里，您会找到诸如“必须精通 X”或“必须具有利用 Y 等多种技术的经验......”之类的语言，然后研究这些应用程序在特定领域的使用方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，花时间了解人工智能和机器学习可能如何影响新的职业——即使你计划相对较快退休。通过简单搜索“人工智能对营销的影响”或“人工智能对金融的影响”，研究人工智能在您想要的领域中如何被使用或将来可能被使用。能够讨论新兴技术以及它们将如何改变工作方式，将使您的候选资格高于那些不具备分析能力的初级候选人，无法将这些知识应用到面向未来的战略对话中。&lt;/p>; &lt; h2>;准备回答：“但你以前没有真正这样做过？”&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;永远不要承认！在所有面试中，您的工作是使用职位描述中的关键字将您的技能与您正在面试的职位联系起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我从娱乐律师转变为人力资源业务合作伙伴和执行教练时，我在每次采访中都被问到这个确切的问题。以下是我为了说服招聘经理我拥有在新职业中取得成功的技能和能力所说的话（职位描述中的关键字以粗体显示）：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;人力资源业务合作伙伴&lt;strong>;调整员工&#39; 实现公司目标的技能和能力&lt;/strong>;。这就是我在真人秀节目中所做的事情：&lt;strong>;战略性地帮助&lt;/strong>;创意主管和制作人打造强大的演员阵容，拥有&lt;strong>;适当的技能&lt;/strong>;，以确保成功的节目&lt;strong>;推动&lt;/strong>;我还负责&lt;strong>;指导&lt;/strong>;制片人&lt;strong>;处理那些没有剧本&lt;/strong>;且&lt;strong>;需要特殊判断力的与人相关的问题&lt;/strong>;强>;。这正是&lt;strong>;人力资源业务合作伙伴&lt;/strong>;在办公室所做的事情 - 我只是在现场。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;我会与我的客户一起准备回答这个问题。也重新转变职业。例如，英语老师珍妮特被问到：“那么你是老师还是项目经理？”珍妮特回复：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;两者都是。我是一名英语老师，但要完成这项工作，我需要成为一名&lt;strong>;出色的项目经理&lt;/strong>;，&lt;strong>;准备项目以实现我们的业务目标&lt;/strong>;，在我的世界里，这就是提高两者整个学区的学生和教师&lt;strong>;表现&lt;/strong>;。由于我更像是一名项目经理而不是教育家，因此我获得了&lt;strong>;项目管理认证&lt;/strong>;，这样我就可以在&lt;strong>;长期规划&lt;/strong>;等领域获得更多工具和最佳实践， &lt;strong>;协调多个项目之间的相互依赖性&lt;/strong>;，&lt;strong>;并促进学区内多所学校和领导之间的项目沟通&lt;/strong>;。我相信，作为一名&lt;strong>;项目经理&lt;/strong>;，我可以为公司带来最大的&lt;strong>;价值&lt;/strong>;，这就是为什么我将这些&lt;strong>;技能和能力&lt;/strong>;运用到更多的公司环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h2>;依靠并突出您庞大的网络。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您已经工作了 20 到 30 年，您可能已经与现在是高管、董事会成员或经理的人，因此有能力为您提供担保。利用这些关系来了解工作（其中一些可能尚未公开发布），并看看这些关系是否可以将您介绍给招聘人员或招聘经理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，对于某些工作，需要庞大的网络，经验不足的候选人不太可能拥有哪些经验，可能会让您成为特别有吸引力的候选人。例如，您在销售或业务开发工作中的客户或联系人可以扩大您的影响力、影响力或使下一家公司受益的机会，并帮助您被认为比没有书的不太成熟的候选人更有价值业务或深厚的行业关系。&lt;/p>;

Moreover, make this a regular practice to help your managers re-assess and manage priorities on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While you can&#39;t create more hours in the day, you can make the case to adjust the scope of the work to be commensurate with the resources available (ie, people, time, and budget) or advocate for more resources, such as budget to hire more people or engage outside contractors to share the workload, even if only temporary to manage a peak period.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Revise Team Agreements&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Empower the managers on your team to help solve the problem of burnout by revising agreements about how you all work together. What boundaries can you and the managers on your team agree to respecting? This may include things like not sending evening or weekend emails or avoiding other &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/dont-let-micro-stresses-burn-you-out?autocomplete=true&quot;>;micro-stresses&lt;/a>;. Looking for a better way forward together by creating new norms can help create a sense of agency that is often missing in cases of burnout.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a team, you can decide things like how you will hold each other accountable to your respective commitments, give each other permission to push back or say no, and establish specific non-meeting days to do focused work. Making these types of agreements can reduce wasted time, energy, and frustration, as well as create a sense of empowerment and ownership for their experience going forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Regularly Check In&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Touch base one-on-one with your managers on a regular basis, particularly those who have exhibited signs of burnout. Check in to see how they are doing and how you can best support them. &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/ask-your-team-what-are-you-stuck-on&quot;>;Ask them where they are stuck&lt;/a>;. Make it safe for them to speak up and tell you when they&#39;re feeling &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/10/how-to-deal-with-constantly-feeling-overwhelmed&quot;>;overwhelmed&lt;/a>; so you can discuss how you can make their work less taxing by clearing obstacles or taking things off their plate, as appropriate.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Relax and Reset&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While not sufficient alone to recover from burnout, taking a meaningful break from work to decompress is a necessary step to restore your managers&#39; energy level and help them reset, both mentally and physically. Set the expectation that they &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-taking-a-vacation-improves-your-well-being&quot;>;use all of their vacation time &lt;/a>;— it can be easy to put off or &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/thinking-of-skipping-vacation-dont&quot;>;skip vacation&lt;/a>; when there&#39;s so much to do. The reality is, there will &lt;em>;always &lt;/em>;be more to do, so trying to wait until you feel &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/youre-never-going-to-be-caught-up-at-work-stop-feeling-guilty-about-it&quot;>;caught up at work&lt;/a>; is like running a marathon with no finish line.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, by making vacation &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/what-one-company-learned-from-forcing-employees-to-use-their-vacation-time&quot;>;mandatory&lt;/a>;, you can help counter any warrior mentality in your organization&#39;s culture that might be a contributing factor to burnout. This can be done in a staggered way amongst team members to avoid business interruption, or some organizations choose to shut down completely during selected weeks of the year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whichever approach you take, give your people permission to completely unplug while they&#39;re away and role model this for your team. &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/dont-work-on-vacation-seriously&quot;>;Research&lt;/a>; shows that working during time off (which, sadly, two-thirds of Americans do), reduces intrinsic motivation, which will already be at a low point if the individual is burned out to begin with.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The remedy for burnout is not an instantaneous single solution, nor is it one-size fits all. Using the above strategies in combination over time will allow you to not only support and recharge your burned-out leaders, but also to keep burnout at bay going forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A More Ethical Approach to Employing Contractors]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/a-more-ethical-approach-to-employing-contractors]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_02_645973167.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;For companies, the practice of outsourcing labor to third parties has become attractive: they get a pre-screened, flexible workforce and the ability to offload the responsibilities of legal employment to someone else.

There is a way for employers to contract out responsibility without exposing workers to harm &amp;#8212; and themselves to increased liability &amp;#8212; by adopting six pillars: 1) all workers should be paid family-sustaining wages and benefits, 2) equal pay for equal work, 3) provide workplace safety protocols and give the workers a voice, 4) demand equitable procurement, 5) offer pathways to fulltime employment, and 6) be transparent.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/a-more-ethical-approach-to-employing-contractors?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/a-more-ethical-approach-to-employing-contractors?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;On Thursday, November 3rd, 2022, thousands of Twitter workers didn&#39;t know if they would have a job in the morning. Those who were directly hired at Twitter woke up to an email with either a new assignment or a severance package. But contract workers like Melissa Ingle got nothing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ingle was contracted to work on political misinformation at Twitter, working to ensure that the midterm elections wouldn&#39;t be influenced by bots and hoaxes. She and her fellow contract workers rushed to check their inboxes for their decision emails — but they never got one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Melissa then tried to focus on her work in the week to come, tackling misinformation in the days leading up to the 2022 midterm elections, all the while wondering if that day would be her last at the company. On Saturday, November 12th, while Ingle was at the mall with her daughter and a friend, she received a notification that said “One or more of your access tokens have been revoked.” She tried opening her work email and Slack, only to get a notice that said “No such user exists.” That was the way Melissa was fired. No meeting to discuss it, not even an email — she was just deleted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/05/tech-layoffs-contract-temp-workers/&quot;>;Melissa&#39;s experience isn&#39;t unique&lt;/a>;. In California alone, estimates suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanstaffing.net/research/fact-sheets-analysis-staffing-industry-trends/staffing-statistics-by-state/&quot;>;nearly 2 million p&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://americanstaffing.net/research/fact-sheets-analysis-staffing-industry-trends/staffing-statistics-by-state/&quot;>;eople &lt;/a>;are working as contract workers — often doing the same work as their directly hired counterparts with less pay, worse benefits, and fewer protections.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For companies, the practice of outsourcing labor to third parties has become attractive: they get a pre-screened, flexible workforce and the ability to offload the responsibilities of legal employment to someone else. That compelling opportunity has spread far beyond tech to industries from healthcare and logistics. Gusto, a human resources services company, has found that the number of employers on its platform using contract workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://gusto.com/company-news/us-contract-work-2022-survey&quot;>;has increased by 28% since the start of the pandemic&lt;/a>;, with a ratio of contract workers to employees at the average company being nearly 1-to-5.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, this workforce model comes at a cost, to both workers and companies. Our research shows that contract workers — who &lt;a href=&quot;https://contractwork.techequitycollaborative.org/&quot;>;are more likely to be Black, Indigenous, Latinx, women, and nonbinary&lt;/a>; — are often doing the same work as their directly employed peers while making less money, receiving fewer benefits, and experiencing significant job precarity. This dynamic not only opens up contract workers to harm — it also opens up companies to some big risks. What was originally considered a system to reduce a company&#39;s ongoing financial responsibilities, contracting out has become a legal, financial, and reputational liability. Increasingly, courts and regulatory bodies are finding that when worker harm exists, employers are liable for that harm — whether they are the direct employer or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a way for employers to contract out responsibility without exposing workers to harm — and themselves to increased liability. By implementing responsible contracting standards that ensure workers have basic protections and pathways to opportunity, employers can mitigate their risk. Implementing these standards can also work towards diversity, equity, and inclusion commitments, by unlocking this pool of qualified, diverse talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of our research at &lt;a href=&quot;https://techequitycollaborative.org/&quot;>;TechEquity Collaborative&lt;/a>;, we created the Responsible Contracting Standard to act as a blueprint for companies to implement clear, high-road contracting practices that benefit workers and companies alike.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Harms and Risks of Contract Work&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In 1996, long-serving “temporary” contract workers sued Microsoft for the benefits they would have received if classified as direct employees. The workers argued that performing the same job functions and working for the same managers as direct employees entitled them to the same compensation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2000/12/13/microsoft-to-settle-with-temp-workers/6f59576a-0725-4bea-93cc-3e2d759bda45/&quot;>;Microsoft settled the lawsuit in 2000&lt;/a>;, and the case has informed how tech companies navigate the separation between contract and direct employment ever since.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies have set up (often flimsy) firewalls and processes to avoid classifying contract workers as employees — requiring them to use a different colored badge to enter the building, barring them from using internal systems, excluding them from all-staff events like annual holiday parties, and more. Meanwhile, many contract workers&#39; performance management and daily responsibilities are directly controlled by the tech company. At the same time, after the Microsoft lawsuit, many companies structured their contracts as ever-revolving doors: workers start on an initial contract, frequently for a six-month term, and their managers extend their jobs in repeated, shorter increments. These contracts can be canceled or not renewed at any time, leaving the workers in a constant state of precarity. Many of these workers stay in this pattern of short-term non-guaranteed contract extensions for up to two years, when they are made to take a break lest the companies run up against the standards laid out in the Microsoft settlement for qualifying as direct employees. Once they&#39;ve been away from the company for up to six months, many of them are hired back to start the process over, exposing the farce that they are “temporary” employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only are the contracts themselves disjointed, but so are the jobs they&#39;re performing. Contract workers are often stuck in the middle of a dual management structure: their day-to-day work is overseen by a manager at the parent company while the operational aspects of their employment — processing pay, managing benefits, and handling workplace complaints — are the purview of the staffing agency that hired them. Keeping contract workers at arm&#39;s length — whether it be the lack of access to company human resources, internal tools, and information, or career development — creates leaky communication pipelines, power imbalances, and the potential for worker harm.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the precarity of contract work (and the risk it creates for companies) is compounded by racial and gender inequities. In the tech industry, we found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://contractwork.techequitycollaborative.org/&quot;>;contract and temp workers are more likely to be Black, Indigenous, Latinx, women, and nonbinary&lt;/a>; than those in the directly employed workforce. Research examining temp work in blue-collar jobs in Illinois found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-temporary-staffing-agencies-racial-discrimination-20210223-34sof3i56rhjxhzu42xtcshx44-story.html&quot;>;Black and Latinx workers comprise 85% of blue-collar temp assignments in Chicago&lt;/a>; but only account for 40% of the population.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of these potential harms, compounded by race and gender inequities, create a potential legal liability. If a worker experiences harm — whether that&#39;s wage and hour violations, harassment, discrimination, or a hostile work environment — and decides to pursue remedies for that harm, companies aren&#39;t necessarily off the hook, even when they argue that they aren&#39;t the worker&#39;s legal employer. Courts and regulatory agencies have increasingly found the companies to be joint employers alongside the staffing agencies and thus liable for any violation or harm inflicted on the contract worker. There have been several high-profile instances of this dynamic in the tech sector in the last five years.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;In 2021, Meta agreed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/facebook-content-moderators-safe-workplace-litigation/#:~:text=viewing%20objectionable%20conduct.-,The%20award%20also%20establishes%20a%20%2452%20million%20fund%20for%20ongoing,financial%20compensation%20for%20content%20moderators.&quot;>;pay $52 million to content moderators&lt;/a>; who were hired through a third-party staffing agency to review disturbing content ranging from child pornography to suicide and bestiality — without adequate health and safety measures in place.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;In a class-action lawsuit against Riot Games, a judge ruled that contract workers should be included in a 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/27/riot-discrimination-100-million-settlement/&quot;>;$100M settlement&lt;/a>; for experiencing workplace gender discrimination and harassment.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Activision Blizzard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/29/1089577389/judge-activision-blizzard-settlement-sexual-harassment&quot;>;paid an $18 million settlement&lt;/a>; for subjecting female workers, including direct employees and contract workers, to sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Companies that do not adopt high-road contracting practices create a race to the bottom, degrading job quality and career mobility. Enacting high-road practices, and requiring them of any vendor your company works with, helps mitigate the potential for worker harm in the first place which helps reduce future liability and risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Way Forward: Responsible Contracting Standards&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Simply put, the best way to avoid liability for worker harm is to reduce the potential for harm in the first place. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://techequitycollaborative.org/download-responsible-contracting-standard/&quot;>;Responsible Contracting Standard&lt;/a>; offers six clear avenues companies can pursue to reduce worker harm, mitigate corporate risk, and close the equity gap for contract workers at your workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Family-Sustaining Pay&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This one is pretty straightforward — all workers should be paid family-sustaining wages and benefits. By being explicit about how much you expect contract workers to be paid by contracting agencies, you can make sure contract workers receive family-sustaining pay — often without needing to raise your contract budget at all. Other best practices include requiring staffing agencies to provide family-sustaining benefits, predictable schedules, clear communication on contract renewals, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Equal Pay for Equal Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All available research shows that contract workers are often paid less for doing the same job as full-time employees. You can ensure equal pay for equal work by providing transparent and responsive systems for raises and promotions, requiring staffing agencies to report on pay data, comparing pay rates with your full-time workforce, and implementing equitable hiring practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Workplace Safety Protocols and Worker Voice&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Contract workers routinely face the choice between speaking up about problems in the workplace and having their contracts canceled. Creating clear channels for reporting problems and including contract workers in company-wide communication streams can contribute positively to workplace morale for your direct employees and contract workers alike.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Equitable Procurement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One reason contract workers may experience pay disparities compared to the full-time workforce is that staffing agencies are taking a larger cut of the contract than you bargained for. Often, companies think they are hiring contract workers at the same rate as other employees on their team, not realizing that staffing agencies take a significant cut of the wages. Requiring staffing agencies to disclose their “markup” fee or pay rates for workers can help bring transparency to the process and help your company avoid inequitable pay structures — without having to increase your overall costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Pathways to Direct Employment&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Contract workers of color, especially Black workers, are more likely to have experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/article/eliminating-black-white-wealth-gap-generational-challenge/&quot;>;structural barriers to building wealth&lt;/a>;. One way to address occupational segregation is to provide meaningful pathways from contract positions into full-time roles at your company. Some best practices include allowing workers to share their experience working for your company on their resume, granting access to internal job boards, ending non-compete agreements for contract workers, and providing professional development training. Through forging real opportunities for career mobility, your company can tap into a pre-qualified, diverse pool of talent that not only advances equity but also lowers recruitment costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Transparency&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Demonstrate your company&#39;s values and commitments to shareholders, workers, and the public by being transparent with your responsible contracting. Measuring the adoption of these practices amongst vendors, auditing the standard&#39;s implementation, and checking in with workers directly to learn more about their experience — all help ensure that your written policies are correctly applied by the staffing agencies you employ.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Responsible contracting isn&#39;t solely about risk mitigation. Beyond “doing the right thing” as an inherent business value, responsible contracting is an investment that attracts and cultivates talent, lifts employee morale, generates returns, and bolsters your brand. An upfront investment will help your company actualize commitments to inclusion — and reap the benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Pandemic Changed Marketing Channels]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-the-pandemic-changed-marketing-channels]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_01_AdriaVolta.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Adrià Voltà&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The pandemic undoubtedly changed how marketers approach channel strategy, and there is no single route to success. With more channels than ever, marketers need to map which channels add clear value and forget the rest. It can be tempting to enter a channel because your competitors are there. But with limited customer time and attention, marketers must strategically determine in which channels they can have the greatest impact. The authors look at five post-pandemic channel strategies gleaned from The CMO Survey and offer analysis on how marketers can operationalize these trends.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-the-pandemic-changed-marketing-channels?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-the-pandemic-changed-marketing-channels?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The Covid-19 pandemic pushed companies to quickly adapt and respond to new customer requirements. One of the ways this dynamic was most apparent was in the marketing channels companies adopted to engage with and sell to customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what changed? The latest version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmosurvey.org/results/&quot;>;The CMO Survey&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;identifies five key trends gleaned from 314 US marketing leaders. We also offer our analysis and recommendations to help marketers operationalize these trends.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Channels are expanding. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Nearly two-thirds (61%) of companies reported increasing the number of channels they use. While true across both B2B and B2C firms, B2C services led with 77% reporting an increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One upside of channel expansion is that consumers can now choose their preferred method of interacting with companies. However, expanding channels takes significant effort and investment. Before jumping in, marketing teams should ask:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Will the new channel attract new customers to the category, steal existing customers from competitors, or increase share of wallet from current customers?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is the larger number of channels aligned from a brand and customer experience perspective?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do the touchpoints point to the same benefits and brand image?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Are the channels seamlessly connected?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do customers understand the value they acquire by using different channels and how to move easily between them?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Face-to-face (F2F) channels are alive and well. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Only 6.7% of companies report that their F2F channels have become completely digital — meaning most have stayed F2F. Further, 28% of companies are opening new F2F channels.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given the digital transformation of companies and marketplaces, we expected to see a larger reduction in F2F channels. We think there are three reasons channels have persisted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, consumers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://siteefy.com/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/&quot;>;exposed&lt;/a>; to 5,000 to 10,000 advertisements a day. This digital clutter is hard to penetrate, so staying F2F may provide marketers with different ways to reach consumers and achieve breakthrough.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, consumers report experiencing digital fatigue from the number of apps used and screen interactions they use in an average day — a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lxahub.com/stories/what-is-digital-event-fatigue-and-how-can-marketers-avoid-it&quot;>;level&lt;/a>; that has increased by more than 100% during the pandemic. As a result, we suspect that many people are craving human interactions from their all-consuming digital lives. Consumers also &lt;a href=&quot;https://escp.eu/news/why-consumers-seek-refuge-products-branded-authentic-pandemic-and-post-pandemic-era&quot;>;want more authenticity&lt;/a>;, a natural response to the risk and uncertainty of the last three years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, many companies view F2F channels, such as brick-and-mortar stores, as labs for learning about consumer behaviors. They&#39;re leveraging advanced technology, such as IoT-connected merchandise and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/customer-footfall-analysis-why-important-geoiq-io/&quot;>;footfall analyses&lt;/a>;, to learn more about what customers want and how they behave during the journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We did, however, observe several differences in our sample that may be useful in diagnosing the need for F2F channels in your industry. Product companies are less likely to go fully digital and are more likely to report opening new F2F channels (31%) compared to services companies (22%). Only pure-play internet companies are not opening F2F channels. New F2F channels are most prevalent in the real estate, retail, and communications/media sectors and least likely in health care, pharma/biotech, and technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Brand social media use is expanding. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Nearly half (45%) of companies are now using social channels to sell products and services, and (61.5%) of B2C services companies are. In this sector, real estate firms (100%), communications/media companies (82%), and retailers/wholesalers (70%) lead the pack.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media companies such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram achieved record-high e-commerce sales during the first year of the pandemic. Instagram&#39;s rollout of in-app checkout in 2020 may have accelerated this process, opening the door to reach more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/183585/instagram-number-of-global-users/&quot;>;1.2 billion&lt;/a>; users scrolling their social feeds. Furthermore, the ease of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-social-commerce-is-reshaping-customer-experience/#Social_channels_are_the_new_storefronts&quot;>;social messaging&lt;/a>; allows marketers to engage in real time with customers to answer questions. In 2022, more than half of US adults &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-commerce-brand-trends-marketing-strategies/&quot;>;purchased&lt;/a>; something through a social media channel, and a Sprout Social &lt;a href=&quot;https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-shopping-2022/&quot;>;survey&lt;/a>; found 98% expected to use this channel to make a purchase in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the example of Scrub Daddy, which has established a cheeky TikTok personality and collaborated with up-and-coming social media influencers, resulting in billions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foodandwine.com/scrub-daddy-review-trend-7483598#:~:text=Designed%20to%20make%20the%20often,3%20billion%20views%20on%20TikTok.&quot;>;views&lt;/a>; and millions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90756764/how-to-find-tiktok-influencers-scrub-daddy&quot;>;followers&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2022/02/21/how-viral-tiktok-fame-propelling-scrub-daddy-100m.html&quot;>;online sales&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we think about brands on social media, we tend to envision B2C brands. Indeed, those companies are more likely to sell their products and services on social channels (58%) compared to B2B brands (37%). However, there is a place for B2B companies in this world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/cmr.2014.56.3.142?casa_token=cu8dtuoZwScAAAAA:dv3SkiOmyT4Vr0cgFpqQlEI8v_hFu0w9ij_uacVoe61fl5egMUdQnKhWj3py-wCL1w2d1ioAWetWakc&quot;>;Maersk&lt;/a>;, the Danish shipping company, which launched a social media campaign more than a decade ago to build its brand reputation. Managers were surprised to find that 22% of its 850,000 Facebook followers were actual customers (even though Maersk was not yet selling shipping services online). Leveraging this channel for feedback and follow-up sales was a natural next step for the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, it has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-statistics/&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that 89% of B2B marketers turn to LinkedIn to generate leads. These numbers are encouraging and we expect they will only increase as younger, social media-savvy consumers move into management positions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The D2C revolution has begun. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Almost a quarter (24%) of companies added a direct-to-customer (D2C) channel in 2023. B2C product companies led the charge with 41% of brands adopting this channel.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are brands moving into D2C channels? First and most importantly, D2C allows companies to gather valuable firsthand insights into customer online behavior and needs — an opportunity companies in certain sectors, such as consumer packaged goods (CPG), have historically lacked. This first-party data is more important than ever given growing privacy restrictions on access to third-party data around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, D2C lets companies test new strategies and collect valuable feedback. If used wisely, this type of experimentation should yield more effective and efficient strategies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, D2C means companies can control the customer experience with the brand. This is especially important for premium and unique brands that deliver their benefits, in part, through the channels experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given these reasons, we weren&#39;t surprised to find that 55% of CPG companies report adding D2C. B2C services made the biggest leap — up from 15% in 2022 to 45% in 2023.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tesla has fully embraced the D2C revolution. The company sells its vehicles directly to customers through its online platform and national network of retail stores in major urban centers in US By bypassing traditional car dealerships, Tesla is able to control the sales experience (and markups), which most consumers find unpleasant.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies should consider two important factors before entering this space. First, does the company have a robust &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adroll.com/blog/what-is-d2c-and-why-does-it-matter#:~:text=A%20Better%20Connection%20With%20Customers&amp;amp;text=By%20offering%20a%20more%20streamlined,loyalty%20and%20encourage%20repeat%20business.&quot;>;digital&lt;/a>; footprint in place to analyze and execute D2C strategies? This is important considering D2C models&#39; reliance on digital marketing, social media, and data analytics skills to deliver positive returns. Also, does the brand have customer-service structures ready to handle the likely increase in customer interactions from this direct channel?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent partners from moving direct to consumers, we recommend distributors and other intermediaries provide value-added services in marketing, inventory, or logistics. Sharing customer data and analytics can also foster long-lasting and mutually beneficial partnerships between organizations. Another powerful partnership strategy is to leverage cross-category perspectives to share recommendations with key partners for new products, in-store advertising and promotion strategies, and even potential acquisition targets. The point is: provide value!&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Gamification is underutilized. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Gamifying shopping and other customer interactions via rewards, points, competitions, or other similar fun interactions is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/gamification.asp&quot;>;expected&lt;/a>; to grow from $9.1B in 2020 to $30.7B in 2025 — a 237% increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, only 4.8% of marketers integrated gamification into digital channels to sell. B2C product companies (13%) and companies with sales of $10 billion or higher (23%) are outpacing other sectors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large-scale research of the effect of gamification on brand outcomes has not been performed. However, practitioner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/coping-with-the-big-switch-how-paid-loyalty-programs-can-help-bring-consumers-back-to-your-brand&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; has shown that loyalty programs do increase the likelihood that customers will choose the brand over competitors, pay higher prices, and increase their spending levels. Gamification, we suspect, is only likely to heighten these effects. Given this, we think this low percentage is a missed opportunity for many companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to making gamification work is brand fit – the game has to make sense given the brand&#39;s position and associations. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpronews.com/business-leveraging-gamification/&quot;>;Fitbit&lt;/a>;&#39;s exercise milestones and friendly competitions help consumers gain more benefits from their devices and increase the likelihood they&#39;ll buy more products and recommend them to their friends. The game also needs to be engaging, but low-cost or free. If either of these elements are missing, current and potential customers will not play. Therefore, marketers must understand what motivates and delights their customers and use small-scale experiments to test different approaches to assess these costs and benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gamification is more daunting for B2B companies. Our findings show only 1% of B2B companies are using this strategy, compared to 13% of B2C companies. Using gamification with employees who serve B2B customers, including your salesforce, is perhaps the easiest way to begin the process. Another option is to introduce gamification during webinars that are generally somewhat boring. This may provide a way to keep attending prospects paying closer attention to sales pitches.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Evaluate and Deploy New Channels Strategically &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The pandemic undoubtedly changed how marketers approach channel strategy, and there is no single route to success. With more channels than ever, marketers need to map which channels add clear value and forget the rest. It can be tempting to enter a channel because your competitors are there. But with limited customer time and attention, marketers must strategically determine in which channels they can have the greatest impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Using AI to Build Stronger Connections with Customers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/using-ai-to-build-stronger-connections-with-customers]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_01_1500238081.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;As companies learn to use generative AI to create value, there&amp;#8217;sa risk that they take the wrong approach when applying the technology to the customer experience. In fact, research shows AI can help boost customer satisfaction when it&amp;#8217;s used to offer customers more personalized solutions or to help human employees provide better service than they would without the technological assist. Some examples of companies experiencing early success with this are in the financial services industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/using-ai-to-build-stronger-connections-with-customers?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/using-ai-to-build-stronger-connections-with-customers?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The surge of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications is spurring exciting innovations and consumer experiments, but it also worries many people who are concerned about data privacy or only being able to communicate with a company through a bot. These concerns are especially acute in industries where customer interactions and data privacy are critical, such as banking or healthcare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some level of anxiety typically accompanies breakthrough technologies, and it&#39;s natural to worry about a technology that mimics human intelligence. As this new class of large language models has emerged, however, most companies have put model risk, accuracy of the model&#39;s output, and ethical use of data at the heart of their risk frameworks. They aim to ensure responsible uses of new AI technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less appreciated is the risk that companies will cede the customer experience to models and bots designed to extract value in the short term, not to foster long-term customer loyalty. Companies might increasingly pair traditional AI and machine learning models with generative AI to deliver messages and offers to customers in more human-like ways. If we are not careful, profit-seeking bots, algorithms, and predictive models could indeed lead to dystopian experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the world of AI, customer love should lead the way. Traditional metrics of customer sentiment, such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), may start to look different, but one premise will endure: Every interaction enhances or diminishes a customer&#39;s perception the company involved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Informing each decision with the goal of enriching customers&#39; lives will lay down a reliable route to an AI-enabled future that creates more value for customers, employees, and shareholders. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31161/w31161.pdf&quot;>;early published results&lt;/a>; from researchers at Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology show favorable effects from the rollout of an AI-based conversational assistant tool to 5,200 customer support agents in several countries. Not only did the tool raise agent productivity by 14% on average, but the AI-assisted interactions had higher average NPS, and monthly agent attrition dropped by 9%.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Make It Personal&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Orienting AI around customer love requires a fundamental rethink of objective functions. Most existing algorithms optimize around ROI for a particular moment rather than around an entire experience. AI-enabled customer engagement holds the promise of a company learning more from each interaction and finding more ways to create value for customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s a good sign because customers increasingly expect more personalized, relevant experiences and are open to sharing their data in return. Bain &amp;amp; Company&#39;s latest survey of almost 30,000 banking customers in 11 countries found that the respondents who agreed that their bank personalizes the experience are more likely to reward it with a higher NPS. There&#39;s a 123-point difference in NPS between respondents who strongly agree that their bank interacts based on knowing who they are and those who strongly disagree.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way AI refines personalization is through digital assistants for customers, as shown by emerging efforts in banking and payments. Royal Bank of Canada uses an AI-enabled assistant called NOMI to personalize digital money management for customers. Features include timely tips pushed to clients, personalized budgets, and savings recommendations based on spending behavior and cash flow. In the year following its launch, the results were promising, with 50% more&amp;nbsp;digital interactions for NOMI customers relative to the entire customer base, 93% more time spent on financial accounts, and 2% attrition of NOMI customers vs. 8% for their peers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI digital assistants are also helping employees to strengthen their customer connections, reinforcing the places where a human touch may be a source of differentiation. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, for instance, is rolling out an AI assistant to help its thousands of financial advisers better support their clients in a personalized way. The assistant combines search and content creation so that financial advisers can quickly find and tailor the right information for each client at any moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large language models will enable a new era of personalization. Machine learning techniques already turn each customer&#39;s pattern of digital interactions into a unique behavioral “fingerprint,” and recent AI advances will now enable these fingerprints to include speech and text interactions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Help employees help their customers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Companies should start with a few no-regrets cases to get the organization comfortable with generative AI technology. These typically use AI to help employees who deliver aspects of the customer experience so that humans can vet the model&#39;s output. Examples include suggestions to relationship managers for the next conversation with a customer based on recent engagement or providing specific actions for handling collections with customers facing financial hardship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next wave of cases would feature AI embedded in standard operating procedures for employees. Promising cases include predictive routing of a customer&#39;s inquiry to the agent best equipped to handle a particular issue or real-time script recommendations for relationship managers. The technology will listen to a customer call in real time and help agents know whether their interactions are creating a promoter or a detractor Other employee-supporting features in the near future could include devising a personalized offer with images and text that evoke a customer&#39;s favorite hobby or reminding a relationship manager to call on a customer during key life stages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a few industries such as retail, a fully AI-enabled front line is starting to support automated engagement directly with customers. Over time, this digital front line could deliver service with the same thoughtful empathy as traditional human front lines. Bots will engage with customers and learn to serve up relevant products and information just as the best employees have always done. The best uses of AI may even completely reimagine the overall experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a time of high inflation and tight economics, some managers may be tempted to use generative AI technology only to cut costs and improve efficiency. That would be misguided. While generative AI has the potential to bend the cost curve in many industries, the greatest value will come to those companies that focus on enriching the lives of their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Secure Support for Your ERG&rsquo;s Initiatives]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-to-secure-support-for-your-ergs-initiatives]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_31_1058899848.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Maren Caruso/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Employee resource groups are essential in fostering belonging and advancing potential, and they need support to be able to continue to do that. But given cost cutting, lack of cultural awareness, and increasing pressure&amp;#160;to slash DEI budgets,&amp;#160;the challenges many identity groups or social causes face can slip through the cracks.&amp;#160;In such challenging circumstances, how can ERG members galvanize and get the attention their networks need to influence and have impact?

Unfortunately, many ERGs aren&#39;t given the resources, budget, and attention they need to fulfill that promise. Here are some concerns I&#39;ve seen in my work coaching individuals and delivering talks to ERGs:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How can I secure more budget allocation to support my faith-based ERG?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Why is my organization not running charity campaigns for floods in Pakistan or earthquakes in Turkey and Syria?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;My organization has an active women&#39;s network but lacks focus on intersectionality.

Here are a few strategies based on how I&#39;ve supported people with similar challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Know Your Why&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;First, get clarity on what exactly you want to achieve and what the added support would mean for you and your fellow ERG members. For example, Nadia* sought my advice on how to request a dedicated Wudu area for &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/how-leaders-can-better-support-muslim-women-at-work&quot;>;Muslim colleagues&lt;/a>;, while Hamza wanted to host an annual Iftar party during Ramadan. Despite the existence of faith networks at their companies, both faced obstacles due to their organizations&#39; reluctance to make “&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/where-religious-identity-fits-into-your-dei-strategy&quot;>;special religious arrangements&lt;/a>;.” Meanwhile, Akua, who was member of a women&#39;s network at her company, wanted to organize a conference for women of color that would focus solely on the challenges faced by women from Black, Asian, and multiethnic backgrounds. However, she was told that the organization would only fund the women&#39;s network initiatives that championed “all women.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As disappointing as this was and despite the resistance from their respective organizations, I encouraged all three to take time to reflect on why these initiatives were essential to them. My goal was to help them solidify their ask and improve their chances of achieving their outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To get others on board with your ideas, start affirming your outcomes based on what you want to happen, not what you want to avoid. Additionally, take the time to consider the resources required, potential obstacles, and how your desired outcome will impact the system as a whole. By staying focused on your purpose, you can increase your sense of ownership and strengthen your conviction when presenting your idea to others. Here are some of the questions I asked Nadia, Hamza, and Akua to answer:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Why do you want this? What purpose does it serve and value does it provide?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What, where, when, and with whom will you achieve this outcome?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What are the internal and external resources required to realize this outcome?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What will you gain or lose by achieving this outcome?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What is your action plan?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What changes would your desired outcome bring about in the larger system, and what will happen if you don&#39;t get to that outcome?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How will you monitor progress or overcome any challenges?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How will you measure the impact of this outcome?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Once these questions have been answered, it&#39;s time to move on to preparing the business case. It may be helpful to keep revisiting the above as priorities evolve.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Prepare Your Business Case&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now that you&#39;ve identified your why, it&#39;s time to get ready to make your case to leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most organizations operate on a “what&#39;s in it for me?” basis.&amp;nbsp;Cherron Inko Tariah MBE, author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;The Incredible Power of Staff Networks&lt;/em>;, encourages asking yourself the following questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Are you aware of what&#39;s happening in the organization?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do you know the workplace culture and the issues facing the business? What&#39;s at the top of your CEO&#39;s inbox?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What was discussed at the last board meeting?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What are the HR leader&#39;s priorities?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s important to ensure that any new initiative aligns with the company&#39;s overall goals and strategies. This is exactly what Nadia did when she presented her case for a &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/how-leaders-can-better-support-muslim-women-at-work&quot;>;Wudu sink&lt;/a>;. She was able to clearly show how this provision would support the company&#39;s goal of becoming one of the top inclusive employers within three years. By linking her proposal to that larger goal, she was able to gain the support needed to move forward and make it a reality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Measuring and regularly tracking progress can significantly impact how an ERG and its activities are seen and valued. To make a compelling business case, ERG leaders must gauge their work&#39;s effectiveness and calculate the&amp;nbsp;return on investment&amp;nbsp;for their efforts. Metrics such as membership numbers and participation, satisfaction, and retention rates are excellent tools to leverage. To help you substantiate the need for and interest in your initiative, use pulse surveys to capture sentiment and solicit feedback from your members. Equally important is making adjustments as necessary to ensure that your ERG is meeting its goals and adding value to your organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, you can also help build your case by evaluating the global and intercultural benefits of your ERG&#39;s activity. Help leaders consider a macro perspective: How will the initiative affect individuals, work groups, customers, and the global organization? For example, Salman, a member of the Black Asian multiethnic network at his company&#39;s London office, wanted to initiate a campaign to collect funds for victims of floods in Pakistan during South Asian Heritage Month last year. However, he received little support from colleagues and managers, as they had recently donated to refugees of the war in Ukraine. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/civilised-european-look-like-us-racist-coverage-ukraine&quot;>;people tend to support those they can relate to&lt;/a>; or champion causes that get more international attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salman reached out to his colleagues in the company&#39;s South Asia location and used their help and experience to garner interest at the London office through storytelling. After learning how the floods had affected families of employees working in the Pakistan region, the London office was more inclined to take action.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also valuable to collect information and share examples of how best-in-class companies (including competitors) are addressing your cause and encouraging others to join the alliance. To help get support at her company, Hamza gathered information on similar organizations that had successfully led Ramadan campaigns at their respective organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this stage, it&#39;s understandable that you&#39;re keen to press forward, but making your case tactfully is crucial; engaging in the conversation with humility while avoiding comparisons and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/whataboutism-what-it-is-and-why-its-such-a-popular-tactic-in-arguments-182911&quot;>;whataboutism&lt;/a>;” is more likely to yield a successful result. Attempts to minimize other groups or initiate a competing narrative when fighting for your right to be heard or seen will backfire and make you lose support from different identity groups. When we draw comparisons, we neither heal nor drive positive change. It shouldn&#39;t be a case of “this or that” but rather “this &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; that.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider starting your conversation with leadership like this: “I appreciate the organization&#39;s focus on inclusion. I have thoroughly enjoyed being part of XYZ network and can see the positive impact it has created. Encouraged by the influence, I propose an initiative for XYX.” Then you can elaborate on why what you&#39;re asking for is essential, including the data you&#39;ve gathered.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Gather Support&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The company will only consider your case if there&#39;s sufficient interest, so once your “why” is clear and you&#39;ve prepared a business case, it&#39;s time to rally support.&amp;nbsp;When I asked Nadia if there were other employees she could rely on, she affirmed there were quite a few. She then created an internal Google form survey and gathered responses from colleagues who shared the benefits of a separate a Wudu sink for their Muslim and non-Muslim colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, it was necessary to get senior leaders involved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/effective-employee-resource-groups-are-key-to-inclusion-at-work-heres-how-to-get-them-right&quot;>;McKinsey research found&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;that ERG leaders who have strong ties to executives are better able to obtain resources and funding than those with weak ties. Speaking to allies and sponsors you can count on for&amp;nbsp;support is vital. Hamza did exactly this and was able to bring many on board for her Iftar celebration — in fact, some were even eager to participate in a Ramadan Challenge before partaking in the Iftar celebration. Taking advantage of solid connections and visible supporters higher up within the ranks can be a significant bolster for the initiative to be taken seriously.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if you don&#39;t have sufficient numbers from your identity group to advocate for your initiative, you can look to other ERGs to support you. Here&#39;s one possible way to approach the conversation with ERG leaders:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I loved being part of your network&#39;s initiative; my participation has helped me recognize why your network is important and why it&#39;s essential to have our needs seen and acknowledged. Inspired by you, I&#39;ve asked management to allocate resources to XYZ. Can I count on the support of your network as I prepare to approach them?&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;The advantage of this is twofold: Not only will you have their backing, but because it&#39;s not uncommon for ERGs to combine resources and jointly advocate for social impact initiatives, they may even organize or run programs for you if you&#39;re unsuccessful securing what you need. But remember that such mutually beneficial associations rely on reciprocity — if you expect them to help, you must also be a visible ally for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Be Specific and Prepare to Pivot&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the earlier example, when Salman wanted to organize a charity drive for flood victims in Pakistan, he took charge of the initiative. He asked for specific things he needed: using the office&#39;s hall to hold a bake sale, mentioning the campaign in the company newsletter and a company-wide email, and using the office kitchen to store goods.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Be prepared to pivot when you don&#39;t get what you ask for. Prepare a sliding scale of asks and try to secure minimum commitment to start the conversation. If the company doesn&#39;t grant the budget for an event, perhaps ask them to at least send a company-wide email showing support and solidarity. Also, see if you can tie in with other networks and share resources or budgets. Remember, a “no” doesn&#39;t mean a “no” forever — revisit the ask in a few weeks or months as circumstances change.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;ERGs are essential in fostering belonging and advancing potential, and they need support to be able to continue to do that. Organizations need to include all identity groups and champion all social causes equally, but it&#39;s naïve to expect that to happen without a substantial push. Systemic inequities and organizational bias permeate most organizations, and leaders will remain complacent if they aren&#39;t actively challenged. Navigating a system where some voices are often trivialized or go unheard altogether requires ERG leaders and members to be resourceful and project their asks more strategically. Waiting for organizations to take that initiative may translate into a very long wait — better to push and be heard than not be heard at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;em>;* Names have been changed throughout to protect privacy.&lt;/em>; &lt;/div>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 31 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Value of Digital Transformation]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/the-value-of-digital-transformation]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_31_NiyiAdeogun.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Niyi Adeogun&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;While 89% of large companies globally have a digital and AI transformation underway, they have only captured 31% of the expected revenue lift and 25% of expected cost savings from the effort.

To see where digital transformation creates value, the authors used McKinsey&amp;#8217;s Finalta benchmark, which tracked the performance of 80 global banks every year from 2018 to 2022 against a set of 50 normalized metrics, such as digital/mobile adoption, digital sales by banking product, number of people in contact centers, and number of branches.

While 89% of large companies globally have a digital and AI transformation underway, they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/three-new-mandates-for-capturing-a-digital-transformations-full-value&quot;>;only captured 31% of the expected revenue lift&lt;/a>; and 25% of expected cost savings from the effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That track record begs some tough questions: Is all this digital effort worth it? Do I really need to lead my industry or is being a fast-follower a smarter strategy? Can I create digital and AI capabilities that give me a lasting competitive advantage or is this just the price of doing business in the modern age?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until business leaders are convinced of the value and confident in how to get it, they are unlikely to do the difficult, hands-in-the-dirt changes needed to improve their success rate, as we argue in our book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/rewired&quot;>;&lt;em>;&lt;i>;Rewired: How to Outcompete in the Age of Digital and AI&lt;/i>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;. But using proprietary data, we&#39;ve found just how and where digital transformations create value — and what businesses can do to beat the competition.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Hard Evidence, Real Value&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Hard evidence that directly ties digital and AI transformation to improvements in operational KPIs and financial performance is scant.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To redress this issue, we turned to banking, a sector that has enough of a history with digital transformations to produce meaningful findings and where we own a unique longitudinal dataset.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, we used McKinsey&#39;s Finalta benchmark, which tracked the performance of 80 global banks every year from 2018 to 2022 against a set of 50 normalized metrics, such as digital/mobile adoption, digital sales by banking product, number of people in contact centers, and number of branches. We then isolated performance in two metrics — the percentage of mobile adoption by their customer base and the percentage of sales originated in digital channels — to define 20 digital leaders and 20 digital laggards. These two metrics are broadly recognized in the industry as core indicators of a digital retail banking model.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, we combined this data with McKinsey&#39;s Corporate Performance Analytics to see how banks ultimately perform against financial metrics (eg, total shareholder return, growth, expenses). We then ran a blind assessment (ie, the identity of the banks was hidden) of the maturity of digital and AI capabilities of the leading and lagging banks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The findings have been striking: Digital leaders are creating much more shareholder value than laggards. Between 2018 and 2022, digital leaders achieved average annual total shareholder returns of 8.1% vs. 4.9% for laggards. Leaders also had significantly better return on pre-tax tangible equity (ROTE), growing it from 15.5% in 2018 to 19.3% in 2022, vs. a more modest growth from 13.6% to 15.3% for laggards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This financial outperformance is a result of leaders&#39; success in growing revenue and better containing expense growth. Between 2018 and 2022, digital leaders have grown their active customer base at 0.5% and their retail revenues at 0.8% annually, while digital laggards saw zero growth in their active customer base and a decline of 1.4% per year on retail revenues. During the same period, leaders&#39; operating expenses grew at 1.3% per year, while laggards grew at almost twice that (2.3% per year). So, how are leaders able to outcompete so demonstrably?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Creating Value That&#39;s Hard to Copy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Where does value come from? Let&#39;s look under the “digital hood.” Both digital leaders and laggards are growing adoption of their mobile app at the same rate, with a gap of 14 to 15 percentage points between them staying constant over time. (See below chart.) This is not surprising. As soon as a bank introduces a new mobile app feature, others see it and follow suit relatively quickly. The mobile app is table stakes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Turning to digital sales provides a much more insightful answer. Here, the gap between leaders and laggards is growing fast, with leaders almost doubling their advantage over laggards over the five-year period. In fact, digital leaders grew digital sales from 40% to 70%, while digital laggards grew from 8% to 17%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason for this large differential is that to drive digital sales, leading banks go well beyond the mobile app to digitally transform what&#39;s hard to see and hard to copy: the end-to-end process from origination to fulfillment to servicing. To do this, they must orchestrate hundreds of teams capable of developing digital and AI innovations, day-in, day-out, across all their customer journeys and core business processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the front end of this process, for example, leading digital banks deploy personalization analytics and digital marketing campaigns to bring relevant offers to (potential) customers. In the middle of this process, they create an omnichannel experience where branch and contact center professionals have the tools and data to support customers at any stage of the sales journey, even if that journey was started online. These leading banks also provide customer approvals in real time, thanks to automated credit-risk decisioning. At the back end of the process, they drive customer self-servicing through well-designed digital workflows enabled by a modern data architecture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The value of this approach to transformation is also revealed in contact center staffing. Laggards saw an increase of 20% over the past five years, as they were unable to contain inbound calls from customers that enter digital channels. In contrast, digital leaders were able to decrease contact center staffing by 11% as they benefited from their ability to fully fulfill customer demand online and provide effective self-servicing capabilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-361201&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/W230606_LAMARRE_DIGITAL_ADOPTION_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Knowing what to do is important, but executing on the “how” is what makes the difference. Let&#39;s see how a US bank did it for its secured lending business. Traditionally, the bank took about 45 days for a customer to secure a loan, on average. The process involved multiple documentation requests to customers (eg, pay stubs, W2s, letters of explanation), and back-end processes (eg, initial file review, file assignment, ad hoc reports) were highly manual.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To transform this journey, the bank&#39;s leadership team reinvented the entire process. To speed pre-approvals, they developed a database of tens of millions of US households combining credit, property and income attributes using internal and external data sources. This data allowed them to generate personalized pre-approved offers that customers could accept with one click. They built a mobile-first customer experience, where customers could personalize their offers based on real-time data and finalize a pre-filled application, either on mobile or with the assistance of a bank employee. They redesigned key processes (eg, specialized loan “assembly lines”), automated key tasks (eg, initial file scrub), and developed digital tools for operators to drive productivity (eg, daily workflow management). And they modernized credit policy execution to enable greater use of data in underwriting (eg, using direct deposit data for income), while maintaining or increasing risk controls for the bank.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To enable all these innovations, they implemented key technology and data capabilities, including a customer data platform, AI/ML models (eg, propensity models), data products (eg, income), a digital app for customers and a workflow tool for the fulfillment center, all deployed on a cloud-based platform-as-a-service infrastructure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All in all, this transformation required more than a dozen use-cases across the entire journey and massive change management programs (eg, training, retooling) for agents in branches, contact centers, and operations. But, only 18 months after the initial launch, the approval process was shortened from 28 to 7 days. This leap allowed the bank to become a leading secured lending originator and increase originations by 35%, while reducing origination cost by 20%.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Capabilities Needed to Outcompete&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A company that aspires to outperform needs to do the kind of end-to-end changes the bank above did across dozens of customer journeys and core business processes. That&#39;s only possible when it is rewired with differentiated capabilities. Our study of more than 200 large-scale digital and AI transformations isolated the six core capabilities rewired companies develop:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;Creating ambitious and focused transformation roadmaps&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;. This requires business leaders to align their efforts on specific domains (eg, journeys or processes) that matter to customers and generate significant value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;Building a quality digital talent bench&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;. Leaders prioritize creating an environment that attracts top-notch engineers and allows them to thrive (eg, tailored career tracks, autonomy).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;An operating model &lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;where hundreds of small cross-functional “pods” made up of business, engineering, and resources from control functions are mobilized against priority solutions. A single journey (or product) owner responsible for the end-to-end experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;A distributed technology environment and modern software engineering practices&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>; to allow the entire organization&amp;nbsp;— not just IT&amp;nbsp;— to develop digital and AI-based solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;Data products and modern data architecture&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>; that make it easy for different parts of the organization to consume data for their own applications.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;Change management to ensures digital solutions are adopted and can scale&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>; by making them easy to use and reuse across the enterprise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our blind assessment of these capabilities for the leaders and laggards, we found that leaders stand out across the board on these capabilities. No single one explains their success. All are needed. With that baseline, the most differentiated capabilities are talent and operating model, not technology. Over time, these capabilities create ever-improving customer experiences and drive lower unit cost. Financial rewards follow.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-361204&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/W230606_LAMARRE_DIGITAL_ADOPTION_CAPABILITIES_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;While our research has focused on banking, our experience reflects similar lessons and patterns in every industry, whether B2B or B2C, products, or services. A digital and AI transformation, however, cannot be done in “special project” mode. To pull this off, the entire organization must be able to deliver constant digital innovation, which requires a holistic set of capabilities. The effort is significant, but so is the reward.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 31 Jul 2023 20:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Keep Your Audience Focused During a Presentation]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/3-ways-to-keep-your-audience-focused-during-a-presentation]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_27_1029427796.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;AndreyPopov/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Grabbing and keeping your audience&amp;#8217;s focus is critical to communication success. What you have to say is important, so give yourself the best chance to convey your message to your audience by first gaining attention, but then, more importantly, sustaining it. In this piece, the author outlines three techniques &amp;#8212; physical, mental, and linguistic &amp;#8212; to engage your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-keep-your-audience-focused-during-a-presentation?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-keep-your-audience-focused-during-a-presentation?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Attention is our most precious commodity. In today&#39;s fast-paced world of always-on digital devices and round-the-clock media cycles, getting our audience&#39;s attention is critical to our communication success. With so many distractions vying for our time, we must actively seek and gain our audience&#39;s attention first.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, capturing ears and eyes isn&#39;t enough. Getting attention is only the first battle; keeping it is another challenge entirely. That&#39;s why smart communicators not only actively deploy ways to capture attention, but they work to sustain it. Sustained attention is what I call &lt;em>;engagement&lt;/em>;. If you can engage your audience, they will stay focused and be less distracted. Plus, you will have a better shot at demonstrating the relevance and significance of your topic to them. To that end, here are three approaches to engaging your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Three Ways to Engage Your Audience&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Physical Engagement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Where the body goes, the brain will follow. Anything that gets your audience doing something with their bodies will create engagement. Whether you are giving an in-person pitch or presentation, or conducting a virtual meeting, think about how you can include physical engagement in your activities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you can have people watch a video, read a handout, click on something on their screens, raise their hands, or use virtual reactions. All of these require your audience to become participants in your communication, not just observers. A simple invitation to “Turn to the person next to you and greet them” or “Read what is on the slide and share your thoughts” can get them involved.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Mental Engagement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Fight back against your audience&#39;s tendency to zone out or multitask by fostering cognitive engagement. There are three simple ways to do this: ask questions throughout your presentation; incorporate provocative statements, data, and stats; and introduce smart analogies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you ask a question, people almost automatically start to consider their answer, thereby moving them from passive listening to active participation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Provocative statements or &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/02/present-your-data-like-a-pro&quot;>;compelling data&lt;/a>; ignite curiosity and encourage your audience to internally ask their own questions. For example, if you&#39;re trying to justify headcount for your training department, you could say: “30% of our customer service tickets could be eliminated by training users better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analogies are where we compare what we know to what we don&#39;t know; in other words, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/finding-the-right-metaphor-for-your-presentation&quot;>;use the familiar to explain the unfamiliar&lt;/a>;. Invoking analogies invites involvement by making us actively think. One caveat: When you use analogies, make sure they&#39;re ones people can readily relate to. Over-reliance on sports metaphors or on complex comparisons people cannot follow or understand will work against your goal of engagement and greater understanding.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Linguistic Engagement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Linguistic engagement refers to the use of inclusive words, time-traveling language, and references to shared perspectives or experiences. Inclusive wording means inviting people into your communication. For instance, we&#39;re hardwired to perk up when we hear our own name, as well as when we hear the word “you.” Mention participants&#39; names, and use phrases like “As you know…” or “You may be wondering…” or “Today, you will learn…”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time-traveling language takes people from the present into the future or the past. You can use phrases like “Imagine…” or “What if you could…” or “Picture this…” to take people into the future. “Remember when…” or “Think back to when…” will take people into the past. Connect people through shared experiences or beliefs to create common ground. For instance, highlighting your company&#39;s mission and values or referencing a previous shared experience can draw people in, much like when you and your friends or family share old stories and jokes.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Combining Engagement Techniques&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t need to rely on only one engagement technique at a time. Instead, combine them to increase and enhance their effect. For example, polling is a great way to get both brains and bodies involved with a triple-whammy of activity. It works with a poll question as simple as, “By show of hands, which of the following do&lt;em>; you&lt;/em>; believe is the most important element of XYZ?” The synergy of the physical, mental, and linguistic engagement techniques deployed in this one question get attendees out of neutral and in the flow with you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Note that when polling, you must first tell your audience how to respond (eg, “By show of hands…” or “Type into the chat…”). It&#39;s also imperative that you comment on the response you get (eg, “That&#39;s what I expected…about half of you,” or “Wow, that is everyone”). If you fail to comment, your audience might feel tricked into complying, or worse, that you did not care about the answer and were just using the poll as a gimmick.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, these suggestions might not be appropriate for your situation (for example, if you&#39;re polling the three executives in the room), so choose options that fit the occasion and group size.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While engagement techniques can be used any time in a communication situation, they&#39;re especially critical when starting meetings, presentations, or pitches. Think about how an action movie opens. You&#39;re thrown into the midst of action with the actor doing something impressive, interesting, and curiosity provoking right away. Only after your attention is engaged and your interest piqued do the title and credits appear. If you start out with the traditional “Hi, my name is..,” you&#39;ve missed a prime opportunity to&amp;nbsp; engage your audience immediately.

She has authored a number of books, including the forthcoming &lt;em>;Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well&lt;/em>;, and she spoke with HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius about the right&amp;#8211;and wrong&amp;#8211;ways to fail. Experimentation and risk-taking are crucial for an organization&amp;#8217;s success, but failing twice in the same way is probably a mistake.&lt;/div>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/its-ok-to-fail-but-you-have-to-do-it-right?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/its-ok-to-fail-but-you-have-to-do-it-right?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When you or your team try new things — and not all of them succeed — that&#39;s called experimentation. Learning from experiments is essential for your company&#39;s growth. On the other hand, when you deviate from proven practice because of inattention or lack of training, that&#39;s probably a mistake. It&#39;s critical to know the difference, and to create a workspace where individuals feel psychologically safe to take smart risks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson, an expert in psychological safety and author of the upcoming book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Right-Kind-Wrong-Science-Failing/dp/1982195061&quot;>;&lt;em>;Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Productive, intelligent ways to fail&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Dangers of not experimenting enough&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Balancing individual employees&#39; needs with those of the team and organization&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Edmondson says that leaders should do a thorough post-mortem after every failure, whether it was productive or not, to ensure that it does not repeat itself. “A failure, even an intelligent failure, in new territory, new discovery, is no longer intelligent the second time it happens.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review/&quot;>;LinkedIn Live&lt;/a>; — previous interviews included &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/indra-nooyi-former-ceo-of-pepsico-on-nurturing-talent-in-turbulent-times&quot;>;former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi&lt;/a>;.

I was under the impression that we all understood that failure is noble and not shameful, and provides useful learning lessons. But you&#39;re writing a book that seems to be saying that we need to think hard and maybe differently about failure. What are you trying to accomplish with this book?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was with you and then I poked around and realized that the truth is many people were still confused about failure. There is a lot of happy talk about failure out there. There&#39;s the virtual mantra of Silicon Valley to fail fast, fail often, failure&#39;s good, let&#39;s learn from failure, let&#39;s have failure parties, let&#39;s have failure resumes and so forth. And the truth is, the future of work will be riddled with failure. We can&#39;t just wish it away, even if we wanted to, we have to work with it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think no one can really take to heart the happy talk about failure unless they have a coherent framework. You could think of it as two camps: the Silicon Valley fail fast, fail often camp. And then the other camp, which is, “I live in the real world, failure&#39;s not an option.” And they&#39;re both right or they&#39;re both partially right, but neither is terribly helpful nor context specific.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think the happy talk, when it&#39;s not qualified with a coherent way of making distinctions between the good kind of failure and the not-so-good kind, is possibly more destructive than helpful. It drives the honest conversation underground. It&#39;s important to talk about the kinds of failure for which we really should be welcoming it with open arms and the kinds where we maybe shouldn&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot; name=&quot;The New World of Work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;follow-subscribe data-name=&quot;hbpnewworldofwork&quot; data-activity=&quot;newsletter&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div style=&quot;color: #000000&quot;>; &lt;svg>; &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;/resources/css/images/hbr-icons.svg#the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;&lt;/use>; &lt;/svg>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Subscribe to our Weekly Newsletter &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; The New World of Work &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; Candid conversations on talent, tech, and the future of business.

That&#39;s part of the definition of what a digital company is. A digital company experiments frequently and tries and fails, and is able to tolerate failure. I would guess if you talk to most companies, they&#39;d say, “Yeah, we do that. That&#39;s the culture we have. We didn&#39;t used to, but we do that.” So I want to push you a little bit more: the rhetoric, that&#39;s the happy talk, but in reality that&#39;s not really how the world works?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it&#39;s not how most incentives are set up. I&#39;m not saying uniformly that&#39;s the case, but most of the time, failure is not rewarded in organizations, and people would rather do anything but fail.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And you&#39;re right, maybe a better way to talk about this is not as failure, but as experimentation. We have to be very pro-experimentation. But we have to be pro-&lt;em>;smart&lt;/em>;-experiments. And I think smart failures are the result of smart experiments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Smart experiments are ones that happen in new territory — honestly, if you can look up the answer, find the recipe, find the blueprint, please do, no need to experiment — new territory in pursuit of a goal that&#39;s consistent with the value proposition of the organization, with a hypothesis you&#39;ve done your homework on and importantly, as small as possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those are the kinds of both experiments and failures we must welcome with open arms. They are discoveries and they allow us to figure out quickly what to try next. But a portion of the book is devoted to best practices for failure-proofing that which can be failure-proofed. The activities, the operations in your company that are in known territory, are ones that should be well set up to make failure extremely rare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are there industries that do not tolerate failure? Airline pilots? You don&#39;t really want them to fail. This isn&#39;t a rhetorical question. Are there industries that really don&#39;t tolerate failure? And can you look at them and say, “You actually can get interesting results if you have that kind of policy?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start with airlines because clearly none of us want them to be comfortable with failure. Yet I think the reason why airlines have an extraordinary record of success and safety is because they&#39;re willing and able to talk about failure. The failures that they do tolerate happen in the simulator. There&#39;s training, there&#39;s a lot of emphasis on speaking up early to prevent something worse from happening. So their safety record does not come from being intolerant of failure, but rather being intolerant of major accidents.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we have to be very tolerant of the reality of human error so that we can catch and correct, we can train, we can allow people to take the kinds of risks and experiments we were just talking about in safe settings like the simulator, not in the execution of the real duties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to describe industries in the way your question implies. I think there&#39;s variation across companies. Pick an industry like fast-moving consumer goods. It&#39;s going to be not that hard to find differences in cultural failure tolerance within those industries across companies. So a more sensible way to put that is that some companies are doing better than others in having a healthy tolerance of intelligent failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What does a productive failure look like? You did mention that there are good and bad failures. What&#39;s the difference and how does one try to make sure their failures are the good kind?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In known territory where we have a process or a formula for getting the result we want, it&#39;s best practice to use that process, use that formula and get the result we want. So when a Citibank employee a number of years ago accidentally made a small human error and accidentally wired $800 million to a client that he shouldn&#39;t have, that was a basic unproductive failure. Turns out they were not even able to get the money back. So, not celebrating that kind of failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A productive failure is one where we get new and useful knowledge, new knowledge that helps us go forward in creating the kind of value we&#39;re trying to create in our market, for our customers. So we discovered something that we could not have discovered without trying it, without the experiment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Would you recommend that there be an elaborate postmortem? I think the military is very focused on doing detailed postmortems: what happened, what went wrong, why? Presumably to learn from that and not have it happen again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not the case that a postmortem has to take inordinate amounts of time, but it should be thorough. It should be analytical, and look carefully at the different facets of the failure, to understand accurately what happened and why, for the express purpose of preventing that exact failure from happening ever again. So a failure, even an intelligent failure, in new territory, new discovery, is no longer intelligent the second time it happens.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to shift gears a little bit to talk more generally about the workplace. The question really is: Are we OK? &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low&quot;>;You wrote a recent piece in Harvard Business Review&lt;/a>; that suggested maybe things are not so great, with relatively low levels of engagement and productivity, high rates of burnout. We can speculate as to why that&#39;s true, but is that accurate? It&#39;s hard to generalize, but you know, are we suffering? And if so, how do we respond to that as managers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, I don&#39;t have a kind of systematic worldwide dataset from which I can make solid inferences about how people are doing. My impression comes from informal conversations, qualitative research, reading HBR and so many other outlets, to see how people are doing. So really, in a way, I&#39;m commenting on the conversation in HBR and so many other business media contexts, maybe LinkedIn and elsewhere.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing I think I can say for sure is that the anxiety is real, and people are worried about the future. They&#39;re worried about it on so many fronts. They&#39;re worried about climate change. They&#39;re worried about AI. They&#39;re worried about burnout, as you mentioned. I&#39;ll come back to burnout.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But that anxiety tends to push us toward a retreat to our individual corner, and people start to think, “Am I going to be OK?” They become more focused on their own wellbeing than on the health of the team or health of the organization. And that gives rise to a real potential for erosion, even vicious cycles, where organizations find themselves in the trap of responding to requests and issues in isolation, one by one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We need a more holistic way of thinking about it. And I see limited evidence of companies being at least described as pausing to think about the larger picture, their value proposition, what it implies for how they must be structured and led, to get the necessary work done, and how to organize that work, with all its variety and variable needs, in a thoughtful way, and how to inspire and motivate people to do it well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let me just briefly go to the burnout issue, because there actually has been some recent data, some studies that have caught my eye, showing that burnout is systematically higher when psychological safety is lower, right? For instance, it seems to me that some portion of the burnout is associated with loneliness and isolation. I think it&#39;s fair to say that we can endure many challenges when we feel genuinely that we&#39;re in it together, that we&#39;re connected and engaged with our colleagues in trying to sort of navigate these challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One can&#39;t help but think, “Okay, is some of this related to the pandemic?” Which for many of us, broke up teams, created new work environments with work from home, that in many ways is fantastic for people who are balancing their work and life. It must take a toll on maybe the teaming imperative that you&#39;ve written about. Is that your hunch?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I do think the pandemic took a toll on us, on all of us. It created such an obvious uncertainty. It was such an obvious disruption. It wasn&#39;t the gradual shifts that we&#39;re normally used to. It was a very abrupt shift, and it gave rise to wonderful—and I think productive—experiments on different work arrangements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now it&#39;s time for a very systematic assessment of what&#39;s working and what isn&#39;t? And it can&#39;t be incremental, right? And it also can&#39;t be based on what people say they want. Because oftentimes, what we say we want is not actually what we need or truly want in the longer term, bigger picture, to get where we need and want to go.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You talked a second ago about trying to have a comprehensive policy and approach that, if I heard you right, is not dealing with people always individually, but that&#39;s sort of the nature of management now. Suddenly, managers are expected to be, in addition to everything else, almost like psychiatrists, that there&#39;s an openness for people to share their personal situations, challenges, problems, and that it&#39;s the role of the manager, increasingly, to engage with that in an intelligent way. So you end up where management becomes hyper-personalized, but I think maybe you&#39;re already on to the risks in that, which is losing the sense of the teaming and the collective effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s almost as if we&#39;ve lost sight of tensions and trade-offs. There will always be a tension between me and we, right? There will always be a tension between my desires in the moment and my aspirations over the long term. If you ask me what I want: pay me infinitely and don&#39;t ask me to do anything, and let me eat ice cream all day, right? But that&#39;s not going to get me where I really, really need to go, and want to go. I want to make a difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think we&#39;re in a moment of not helping people value the collective. As human beings, we&#39;re social creatures. That&#39;s part of it, but it&#39;s also that we want to matter. We want to matter to others. We want to matter in some way that&#39;s larger than ourselves and our hedonistic desires.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can think of an old-fashioned management theory of the firm, right? If markets worked by themselves, we would just have only contractors doing tasks, and it would be efficient, it would be sensible, it would be logical. But it doesn&#39;t work, because a lot of the work we have to do is inherently collaborative, and dynamically so. And it isn&#39;t easily parceled out, dividing-and-conquering style. It requires us to really work together in meaningful ways. The good news is, that can be a very engaging, rewarding, exciting experience. The bad news is, it&#39;s not easy to manage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think we can go down that rabbit hole of each person has to be managed differently, each person, you&#39;re almost a psychiatrist to that person, versus let&#39;s step back and rethink, how do we design our activities, our operations, so that we create the most value for those we serve?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, I love that, and I have to say that I don&#39;t think companies have figured that out yet. The disruption of Covid opened our eyes to some flexibility. But I think the things you&#39;re putting your finger on, we&#39;re trying to solve for that, and I think a lot of us haven&#39;t yet and need to keep experimenting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So we&#39;re in this age of anxiety, where there&#39;s burnout. And then, you throw on top of that generative AI, and a fear—possibly irrational, possibly not—that generative AI will be able to do all of our jobs at almost no cost. I assume you haven&#39;t done quantitative research. But qualitatively, what&#39;s your advice for people as generative AI enters the workplace at every level and the possibilities become clearer and clearer?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you indicated, it&#39;s a little outside my wheelhouse, except for the effects on people and culture. I speak from the perspective of someone listening at the margins to the many conversations in work and social gatherings alike, and I think you&#39;re right. I think fear is the dominant emotion, that certainly some are excited, some are super optimistic about the amazing changes to come, but I think casually I hear more fear than optimism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The truth is we need both. We need some positive, thoughtful, design-oriented approaches to experiment and figure out what&#39;s going to work. But I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be simple solutions to the dramatic shakeup of what&#39;s possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Omar from Monterrey, Mexico. What kind of metrics can be used to measure smart failures?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My first response is that it&#39;s a good idea to have metrics. One of the things that I&#39;ve spent the most time studying is how many failures just don&#39;t even get the chance to be measured, because people don&#39;t speak up about them. This was how I got into this topic in the first place: the discovery of dramatic differences across groups, even within the same organization, and their willingness to speak up about things that go wrong rather than just things that go right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the challenge more broadly than just people not necessarily speaking up: the category of intelligent failure covers vast territory. I think the metrics have to be tailored to the context — and let me illustrate vast territory. A well-run clinical trial on a new cancer drug is an intelligent failure when it turns out it doesn&#39;t have the efficacy that we hoped. It was in new territory. There was no other way to find out but to do a clinical trial. It&#39;s the right size, it&#39;s no bigger than it has to be. It&#39;s hypothesis-driven in pursuit of a goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But so is a really bad blind date. That&#39;s intelligent failure. Maybe your friend thought you&#39;d like each other. You are willing to go out and have a coffee. Smallest possible new territory in pursuit of a goal, all the rest. So a bad blind date and a failed clinical trial are clearly apples and oranges, yet they both qualify under the category.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the best way to answer the measurement question is, let&#39;s make sure the criteria are adhered to. And then, let&#39;s think about what the right frequency is, given the work we&#39;re trying to do, of intelligent failures?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another way to say that is: What&#39;s the right frequency of experimentation? How often should we be trying new things to push the envelope, to discover new possibilities, even to discover efficiencies? And are we doing that often enough? The answer is usually no, because most of us would rather succeed than fail, and most of us would rather keep doing what we&#39;re doing because we&#39;re kind of good at it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So here&#39;s another question along those lines from Mohammed in Pakistan. Employees may be hesitant to offer feedback that could be perceived as negative, which can impede professional development, hinder organizational progress. How does one tackle this situation?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a good question because it&#39;s true. We are very reluctant to do things, to speak up with negative or difficult information, because frankly it will always be easier not to. It will always be easier to hold back than to speak up candidly and forthrightly about something that you hope could be made better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The way to make this very difficult thing easier is to set the stage by pointing out how valuable it is. Periodically, I would say even frequently, refer to the fact that “We need to do this hard thing. We need to do it well if we want to be as good as we can as a team.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even individuals who have the ambition to grow and develop in their roles and in their careers have to train themselves to be willing to do this and receive it because of its value. So we&#39;ve got to call attention to its value. We&#39;ve got to call attention to the fact that it&#39;s hard and then do it anyway and support each other.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This question is from Don from Calgary in Canada. If it&#39;s true that we learn acutely from mistakes, what are some ways to encourage permission from our leaders who may be risk averse?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re all risk averse, and maybe leaders even more than others, maybe not. But first of all, I make a distinction between mistakes and failures. I&#39;m not anti-mistake because I&#39;m a human being, and I make them, we all do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But a mistake is not the same thing as a failure. A failure is something that went wrong that we wish were otherwise. A mistake is a deviation from a known practice. Now, that could happen because of inattention, because of lack of training, because of exhaustion, you name it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think it&#39;s helpful for leaders, and others for that matter, to talk about the reality that we will make mistakes because we&#39;re human. The very best practice is not to never make a mistake. It&#39;s to catch and correct them quickly, and then also to make that distinction between smart experiments in new territory that we also want to see more of because it&#39;s the secret to future value creation. And we welcome those, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthering that, here&#39;s a question from Benny from California. What&#39;s the best way to speak to subordinates after a failure to boost morale and communicate that, “This was a good failure. It&#39;s OK”?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m going to say “honestly.” You can be honest about, “Wow, this was disappointing for all of us, and let&#39;s get everything we can out of it. Let&#39;s learn as much as possible.” And in fact, given that something substantial that goes wrong nearly always has multifaceted aspects to it, it&#39;s helpful to have a thoughtful and data-driven conversation about what happened. Not “Who did it?”, but, “What happened?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We may go around the team and ask, “What did you see?” And we&#39;re really looking for what happened, what contributed to that, and that&#39;s both commission and omission, things that you did that may have contributed, things that you didn&#39;t do that may have helped. It&#39;s a thoughtful, deliberately learning-oriented conversation designed to help us be better next time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you reenergize your team these days? How do we reenergize our team particularly now, in 2023, where it feels like there&#39;s a lot of stuff swirling around?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It starts with personally taking the time to reconnect with your own sense of purpose for doing the job, the role that you are currently doing. And consider why it matters to you and why what you are doing or leading matters to the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having done that, share it. Share it often and then just as quickly invite others in to help navigate the necessarily stormy waters that lie ahead. I think it starts with you and then it&#39;s an honest sharing of why you care, why it&#39;s challenging, why you very much need and are interdependent with others. Because all of us want to be needed. We want to be needed. We want to matter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last few years, with the pandemic, I&#39;d say certainly in the US, there&#39;s been increased attention to social issues, which on the one hand I think felt right to people in the workplace. On the other, it brought more challenges into the workplace. One imagines there&#39;s a pendulum, and it might swing between leadership needing to be very empathetic to, I don&#39;t know, the backlash if that&#39;s the right word. Leaders need to achieve productivity. That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. Do you believe in that pendulum or are we in a different place? And if you do, where are we right now on that swing?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe in the pendulum. I believe that the pendulum happens and I believe there may be a better way. It&#39;s often thought of as empathy versus productivity. And I looked this up actually: Productivity is defined as the effectiveness of productive effort as measured in terms of the rate of output per unit of input.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first problem is that not all work is easily measured for productivity. The second problem is, often it&#39;s not the right way to measure excellence. Productivity is often a short-term measure, and it has limited predictive value for the future performance of the firm. For example, one way to be really productive is to just push people to their limits. But that has time constraints. Eventually they will burn out, leave, etc. It&#39;s like Buckminster Fuller used to say that it was foolish to burn down the house to keep warm on a cold winter&#39;s night. The excessive pressure can be the equivalent of that error.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And also innovation work in particular, we have case study after case study where the work actually suffers when productivity metrics are brought to bear.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a way, I wish the pendulum were more about excellence than productivity, because I think productivity is really tricky and variable to measure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I see the pendulum existing, but maybe it&#39;s a false dichotomy. Maybe it&#39;s not empathy versus productivity. Maybe we need smart, caring leaders who understand the importance of both. And given that that&#39;s very challenging, they&#39;re open about it being challenging. They&#39;re asking for help. They&#39;re sharing the burden of caring and excellence with their teams and considering, again, the fundamentals of what it is the organization must do well to stay alive in its market, to perform in its market. And talk about it honestly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sometimes think we don&#39;t talk often enough about the fact that work is work. It&#39;s supposed to be a little bit of work, but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be fun, energizing, collaborative, and full of empathy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I love that. Well, that&#39;s a good point to end on. Amy Edmondson, thank you for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks for having me.

Toxic cultures share five attributes: they&amp;#8217;re disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and abusive. Undeniably negative as these attributes are, there is no absolute, uniformly accepted scale against which we can measure any of them. Making matters more complicated, a hybrid environment by definition means that employees are experiencing their work in very different contexts &amp;#8212; some face-to-face, others remote &amp;#8212; and those may vary by the day. As a result, hybrid workspaces aren&amp;#8217;t uniform; some people may experience a hybrid environment as toxic while others do not. The author presents four mechanisms through which hybridity can lead to toxic behaviors, as well as four strategies for preventing and addressing toxic behavior in a hybrid environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/why-hybrid-work-can-become-toxic?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/why-hybrid-work-can-become-toxic?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Toxicity at work — no matter where or how we do our jobs — is caused by a range of factors. It is important to recognize that some aspects of hybrid and remote work make toxicity more likely to occur.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, though, let&#39;s quickly outline what “toxic” actually means. It doesn&#39;t refer to the misunderstandings, tensions, and conflicts that are a natural (and needed) part of any healthy organization. Nor does it refer to a one-off incident or a coworker who is a jerk every now and again. These kinds of irritations, for the most part, are best thought of as normal parts of (working) life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what actually is considered toxic? A study by Donald Sull and his colleagues identified &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture/&quot;>;five attributes of a toxic culture&lt;/a>;: disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and abusive. In a recent discussion I had with two colleagues who are experts on the subject, Amy Edmondson of Harvard Business School and Constance Hadley of the Questrom School of Business, we agreed that toxicity also implies the behavior in question is both pervasive and ongoing. And that, we believe, is what makes bad behavior rise — or perhaps fall — to the level of toxic. Toxicity carries a sense of inescapability, which is part of what makes it so painful to experience at work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Undeniably negative as these attributes are, there is no absolute, uniformly accepted scale against which we can measure any of them — all five are subjective, anchored in each person&#39;s experience. Making matters more complicated, a hybrid environment by definition means that employees are experiencing their work in very different contexts — some face-to-face, others remote — and those may vary by the day. As a result, hybrid workspaces aren&#39;t uniform; some people may experience a hybrid environment as toxic while others do not. That does not make a toxic hybrid environment any less painful or damaging to those who experience it as such. However, it does mean that some behaviors may be toxic even as a result of well-meaning — or at least not ill-meaning — actions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking with executives about toxicity, I encourage them to think like social scientists, to understand the mechanisms through which hybrid working can lead to increased toxicity. Here&#39;s what they should know.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How Hybrid Work Can Lead to Toxicity&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;My research and consulting experience has led me to think in terms of four mechanisms through which hybridity can lead to toxic behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Remoteness changes dynamics&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Working hybrid means that, compared with full-time in-office work, more communication will take place via technologies like email, text, phone, or video. One of the early findings in research on the effects of technology-mediated communication was that people become more disinhibited and exhibit less self-monitoring and self-control &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227445694_Reducing_Social_Context_Cues_Electronic_Mail_in_Organizational_Communication&quot;>;when communicating through technology&lt;/a>;. In other words, when we talk to one another electronically, we are more likely to blurt out things that might be hurtful. Think about heated exchanges you&#39;ve had with colleagues both in person and electronically — chances are, you were much more tempted to try to slip in a sharp quip in an email than face-to-face.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dynamic is not (necessarily) about being a nasty person. We all have moments of anger, frustration, or passion, and if handled badly, those feelings have the potential to turn toxic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In face-to-face interactions, though, the human on the other side of the conversation is far more salient to us, leading most of us to recognize the potential costs of a less-careful word and bite our tongues. The point isn&#39;t that we shouldn&#39;t speak our minds (if we feel that we can&#39;t, that&#39;s bad for psychological safety), but that we should choose our words well. While the reduced self-monitoring and self-control that come with remote interactions do not necessarily cause toxicity, they certainly make it more likely for &lt;em>;disrespectful&lt;/em>; or &lt;em>;abusive&lt;/em>; (two of Sull&#39;s toxicity characteristics) comments to come out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Hybridity is fundamentally imbalanced&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid also means different people are working in different contexts. Some may be at home, while others are in the office — and those locations have undeniable differences. People in the office have greater access to resources and higher visibility, often leading to more credit and quicker promotion as a result. Remote workers, meanwhile, often feel left out and shunned. Negative as these effects may be, they are not strictly toxic if everyone is equally disadvantaged at some point. The problem is when some people (likely remote/hybrid workers) feel &lt;em>;consistently&lt;/em>; excluded — as was the experience of one manager I recently worked with.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Company policy was to allow all employees to work remotely two days a week, and the manager had allowed her team members to choose those days. She quickly discovered her team had effectively split on the basis of different (but consistent) patterns of which days people chose to come into the office. Compounding the issue, team members&#39; remote-work choices were heavily driven by commutes and children&#39;s school schedules, which aligned them with demographic differences in the team. Problems arose when some team members felt they were being excluded from the discussions and meetings that occurred on the in-office days of the other group. The split led to interpersonal tensions and conflict, people feeling &lt;em>;excluded&lt;/em>; and &lt;em>;disrespected&lt;/em>; (two toxicity characteristics), and it ultimately resulted in turnover.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Hybridity can reduce cohesion and trust&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/a-study-of-1100-employees-found-that-remote-workers-feel-shunned-and-left-out&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; that lack of close contact reduces connection and trust, which are key elements of a healthy culture. During the pandemic, I spoke to many employees who had started new jobs remotely, and I consistently heard that they hadn&#39;t gotten to know their colleagues and felt disconnected. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work&quot;>;Research from Microsoft&lt;/a>; found remote working leads employees to have smaller, less-well-developed networks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remote (and by extension hybrid) working does not necessarily mean organizations will have a weak or inconsistent culture. Take Linux as an example. Its open-source software development from day one has been carried out by a loosely structured community of developers who have never met in person, yet extensive research on the group has found it has strong social norms governing behavior. However, it is hard to deny that the group&#39;s structure (or lack thereof) removes or impedes many of the mechanisms we traditionally use to establish, transmit, and maintain culture. Note that Linux &lt;em>;started &lt;/em>;with a remote, dispersed culture. While many companies have embraced remote and hybrid since the pandemic started, their cultures were already established and then adjusted to handle the crisis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Culture is so important because it is the compass organizations use to eschew &lt;em>;cutthroat&lt;/em>; and, in more extreme cases, &lt;em>;unethical&lt;/em>; behavior. To be clear, hybridity does not inherently lead people to be more cutthroat or unethical (though one might argue the sense of distance between people makes them less aware of the negative ramifications of their actions). However, in every social system we find a range of behaviors, and culture typically helps us rein in the negative ones. On top of that, while people are less likely to exhibit toxic behaviors toward those they feel close and connected to, the distance that a remote/hybrid environment brings makes us more likely to view some of our colleagues not as “us” but as “them” — and it&#39;s much easier to act poorly toward “them.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Hybridity makes it hard to resolve issues&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s one more key challenge in remote and hybrid work: We have fewer face-to-face interactions with colleagues, and research shows that it is harder to resolve disputes (like those around toxic behaviors) virtually. Think about trying to address a sensitive topic over Zoom with someone and worrying about everything from where they&#39;re looking to how fast they reply. &lt;em>;Are they giving me their full attention? Am I sure my sincerity is coming through over video? Was their slow response because they disagreed or are just lagging?&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we&#39;re face-to-face, we have more interpersonal tools at our disposal. We have better data, as we can more easily read facial expressions and can see off-camera behaviors. We also have better tools, as face-to-face interactions allow us to synchronously work together to resolve differences. And the propinquity effect (essentially, we like people we have more exposure to) means all of this happens from a starting point of a closer relationship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One other issue it&#39;s important to mention is microaggressions, which some people have argued happen less often in remote settings because we&#39;re around one another less. However, I would caution leaders and employees alike to stay vigilant for signs of microaggressions (often reflected in toxic behaviors like &lt;em>;noninclusion&lt;/em>;) in hybrid settings. While these settings may have fewer touchpoints where microaggressions can occur, they do not remove the underpinnings of why microaggressions happen — nor do they prevent them from coming out in other outlets, such as Slack, messaging apps, or videoconferencing. In effect, hybrid work can obscure the problem without resolving it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Leaders Can Do&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I advise leaders to approach toxic behaviors in hybrid work in four ways: educate, lay a foundation, have ongoing conversations, and intervene quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Educate employees&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The first step toward avoiding toxic behavior in hybrid teams is to help people learn how it can arise. You may think, “Of course they know not to be disrespectful, abusive, or noninclusive,” but that&#39;s not the issue. Sit down with your employees and have a conversation about how these outcomes can happen as unintended consequences of hybrid work arrangements and decisions. Remind them that toxicity is about behavior — and that what matters isn&#39;t what your intention was but how others perceive your actions. A good starting point is to ask employees to reflect on hybrid work behaviors they may have experienced as toxic (for example, feeling routinely excluded from a social group or reading comments on Slack that they found abusive or disrespectful). The goal of this step is not to identify particular issues or point fingers but rather to increase employees&#39; self-awareness and the number of eyes out there looking for toxic behaviors or their antecedents.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Lay a foundation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As Benjamin Franklin famously said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” One of the most effective tools you can put in place is a culture with built-in antibodies against toxic behaviors. In particular, focus on promoting empathy and psychological safety. A culture with a core of empathy encourages employees to consider the impact of their actions on their colleagues, increasing the likelihood that employees catch themselves before behaving in a way another might find troubling. In turn, a culture that includes psychological safety is critical for those cases that empathy doesn&#39;t prevent. We don&#39;t always recognize the impact of our actions, and building psychological safety ensures that employees can speak up about the behaviors they perceive as toxic. Research has provided excellent practical advice for promoting both &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/empathy-rules&quot;>;empathy&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety&quot;>;psychological safety&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Have ongoing conversations&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Because the experience of hybrid work is different among employees and dynamic over time (someone may be in the office today, surrounded by colleagues, and at home alone tomorrow), toxicity is a moving target. The only truly effective way to manage such dynamism is with an ongoing process — and the cornerstone is repeated, ongoing conversations. I encourage hybrid teams and organizations to have periodic check-ins where everyone is encouraged to raise concerns or flag toxic experiences. There is no hard-and-fast rule for frequency, as it depends on how dynamic the organization&#39;s hybrid environment is: The more and faster it changes, the more frequent those conversations should be. As a starting point, aim for a monthly check-in and adjust as needed. Make sure the psychological safety foundation is in place if you want people to share honestly, and treat these conversations as more than a superficial box-ticking exercise.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Intervene quickly&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Even with a good understanding of the issues, a positive cultural foundation in place, and ongoing discussions, hybrid working may still lead to behaviors that your employees find toxic. A big problem with toxic environments is that they tend to get worse: Toxic behaviors either feed on themselves, breeding more toxicity, or cause disgruntled employees to disengage, creating new tensions due to workloads needing to be redistributed. To break the cycle, you need to not only keep an eye out for toxic behaviors but also be ready to move fast when you see them, help all parties engage in a dialogue, and work to reach a mutually acceptable solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s say you notice a situation like that of the manager whose team was split over their WFH days. In a case like that, call a team meeting and share your concerns of how the situation might feel exclusionary. It may turn out your concerns aren&#39;t shared — but you&#39;re still creating buy-in and ownership of the issue, making it easier to address later if it does become a problem. If, however, you&#39;ve recognized a budding concern for some of your team members, you have a forum to discuss and collectively resolve it before it gets too far along.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Toxicity can be an unfortunate reality of some work environments. While hybrid work does not necessarily cause toxicity any more than in-person work does, it is important to recognize that hybrid introduces some different mechanisms through which toxicity may arise. Keeping these in mind can help leaders recognize, guard against, and eliminate toxicity when it occurs — or ideally before.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
