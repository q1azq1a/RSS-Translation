&lt;span>;&lt;p>;撒哈拉以南非洲地区正在城市化，大规模农村人口向城市迁移。但与西方世界的城市化不同，撒哈拉以南非洲缺少一个关键组成部分：工业化城市。因此，这些城市地区变得人满为患，住房质量不合格，基础设施严重不足，无法应对计划外的人口增长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;幸运的是，解决这一问题的新发展手册已经在制定，其基础是撒哈拉以南非洲地区拥有先进数字技能的年轻人。这些年轻工人精通数字技术、富有创造力，可以引领巨大的变革——如果他们有能力并得到支持来释放他们的潜力。他们可以通过互联网通过“数字工作”提供的无限和不受限制的机会，向西欧、美国和亚洲输出数字技能。从音乐到软件开发再到提示工程。但为了扩大规模并取得成功，必须在政策层面和实施过程中考虑优质数字教育、税务条约和协调以及以外包为重点的初创企业等领域的变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/digital-skills-provide-a-development-path-for-sub-saharan-africa?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/digital-skills-provide-a-development-path-for-sub-saharan-africa?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;撒哈拉以南非洲地区正在城市化，大规模农村人口向城市迁移。但与数十年和数百年前西方世界的城市化不同，撒哈拉以南非洲地区缺少一个关键组成部分：工业化城市。换句话说，与工业化先于城市化的西方世界不同，撒哈拉以南非洲的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/africas-urbanizes-dynamics-2022-economic-power-africas-cities&quot;>;城市&lt;/a>;正在随着边际制造业产出和工业能力的增长而发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其影响是巨大的，因为这些城市地区已经变得过于拥挤，住房质量不合格，基础设施严重不足，无法应对计划外的人口增长。 。由于税收有限，正在城市化的撒哈拉以南非洲城市资金不足，可能会面临医疗保健服务和整体社会福利方面的严峻挑战。随着气候变化影响&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c97je2gzdlwo&quot;>;拉各斯&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.africanews.com/2023/05/07/kenya-residents-on-a-mission-to-reduce-flooding-damage/&quot;>;内罗毕&lt;/a>;等主要城市，非洲大陆需要紧急解决方案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据Statista 表示，平均而言，2021 年撒哈拉以南非洲城市化率约为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/805657/urbanization-in-sub-saharan-africa/&quot;>;41.83%&lt;/a>;，即使该大陆仅占 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2016/11/23/figures-of- the-week-africa-induscialization-day/#:~:text=%20average%20share%20of%20manufacturing,at%20just%20under%202%20percent.&quot;>;全球制造业产出的 2%&lt;/a>;。这意味着那些搬到城市地区寻找经济机会的人却找不到经济机会，这导致了高失业率，尤其是年轻人的失业率。布鲁金斯学会估计非洲青年失业率&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/12/08/the-case-for-job-creation-hubs-to-reduce-youth-unemployment-in-africa/&quot;>;约 60%&lt;/a>;，而联合国贸易和发展会议 (UNCTAD) 则将&lt;a href=&quot;https://unctad.org/press- material/facts-and-figures-7&quot;>;大多数国家的贫困率超过50%&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多因素加剧了这种快速的“工业化之前的城市化”带来的挑战，其中包括落后的工业化政策。多年来，撒哈拉以南非洲领导人一直在制定一项模仿中国的战略，该战略依赖于这样的预期：一旦中国的工资变得相对昂贵，西方世界就会将低水平的工厂工作外包给撒哈拉以南非洲，以刺激制造业的活跃。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/why-africas-induscialization-wont-look-like-chinas&quot;>;正如我之前指出的&lt;/a>;，这将是一个巨大的挑战如果非洲试图推行中国的战略，那就错了。随着人工智能和机器人技术的进步，对中国有效的做法已经失效，西欧和美国几乎不可能将一些低水平工作转移到境外。机器人会做家里的工作。相反，撒哈拉以南非洲的政策制定者必须制定一套新的发展手册，考虑到该地区目前的现实状况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;幸运的是，这一新的发展手册已经在不断发展，并且以撒哈拉以南非洲众多的年轻人为基础。过去几年，在运营早期风险基金 Tekedia Capital 和拥有数千名学生的商学院 Tekedia Institute 的过程中，我收集了有关行业、核心经济指标、自由职业、离岸工作等因素的大量数据。根据数据集，我认为非洲大陆的发展之路是通过拥有先进数字技能的年轻人来实现的。撒哈拉以南非洲的年轻人精通数字技术，富有创造力，如果他们有能力并得到支持来释放他们的潜力，不仅是在区域范围内，而且在全球范围内，他们可以领导一场巨大的变革。这些年轻人可以通过互联网提供的无限和不受限制的机会向西欧、美国和亚洲输出数字技能。换句话说，西方国家在将工厂工作外包给中国的同时，很快就会以多种方式将“&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/the-most-and-least-digital-jobs-and-how-well-ey-pay&quot;>;数字工作&lt;/a>;”外包给撒哈拉以南非洲地区。这些数字工作多种多样，从音乐到软件开发再到&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/the-hottest-job-in-tech-right-now-is-in-prompt-engineering/&quot;>;即时工程&lt;/a>;。对于日本和韩国等出生率仍然较低的国家来说，撒哈拉以南非洲地区提供了现成的人才基础，可以远程支持其经济。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着撒哈拉以南非洲地区的宽带普及率不断加深，一些有利的基础设施已经存在。随着地面宽带的不断扩张，SpaceX Starlink 卫星宽带的到来为城市和农村地区的连接带来了许多希望。随着利用太阳能提供能源服务的可再生能源初创公司的出现，年轻的技术人员正在克服基础设施方面的挑战，使他们更容易参与全球数字经济。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些转变使年轻的撒哈拉以南工人能够在他们所在的地方赚取收入，一旦收入被进口，他们就有能力大规模贡献和改变当地经济。事实上，一些数字专家在为国际组织工作赚钱后，决定创办自己的公司，并在此过程中培养其他年轻人才。非洲大陆拥有&lt;a href=&quot;https://guardian.ng/technology/nigeria-products- Five-of-seven-unicorns-in-africa/&quot;>;至少七家独角兽&lt;/a>;——估值至少10亿美元的初创企业——当它们在公开证券交易所上市、被大型跨国公司收购或成长为有能力支付丰厚股息时，所创造的财富将用于加速发展。更重要的是，由于他们工作的数字化性质，甚至不需要留在城市地区；例如，Andela 是一家数字技能外包初创公司，它从撒哈拉以南非洲的任何地方雇用工人，只要他们有良好的互联网服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但要扩大这一规模并取得成功，必须在政策层面和实施过程中考虑以下因素：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;高质量数字教育：&lt;/strong>;Covid-19 大流行表明，许多撒哈拉以南非洲国家的数字化准备程度仍然很低。虽然中国、美国和欧洲的许多大学能够过渡到远程学习，但许多撒哈拉以南非洲的大学却不能。建设支持未来知识经济的基础设施对于撒哈拉以南非洲地区释放年轻人的巨大潜力至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;税收协定和协调：&lt;/strong>;在尼日利亚、加纳和肯尼亚等撒哈拉以南非洲地区的主要经济体中，大多数年轻人为欧洲、美国和加拿大的一些领先公司工作。撒哈拉以南非洲地区的政策制定者必须确保这些工人得到公平的报酬，并确保他们依法缴纳当地税款。一项使跨国公司更容易雇用和培养这些人才的明确政策应该成为该地区发展优先事项的一部分。同样重要的是确保繁重的税收不会削弱年轻工人的积极性。这就需要有效实施和协调税收协定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;以外包为重点的初创企业&lt;/strong>;：应制定区域和国家政策，以深化以外包为重点的数字公司的能力。像 Andela 这样的公司估值超过 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/andela-becomes-a-unicorn-raises-200-million-at-1-5-billion-valuation/&quot;>;15 亿美元&lt;/a>;，培训年轻人，然后将他们的数字技能输出到世界各地，而他们则留在非洲大陆。非洲驻欧洲、亚洲和北美的大使馆和使团可以支持他们与主要客户建立联系，提供雇用非洲青年服务的渠道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;撒哈拉以南非洲拥有年轻人来推动知识经济。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/ohrls/news/young-people%E2%80%99s-pottial-key-africa%E2%80%99s-sustainable-development&quot;>;根据联合国的说法&lt;/a>;，“非洲是世界上人口最年轻的国家，撒哈拉以南非洲地区 70% 的人口年龄在 30 岁以下。”如果非洲大陆对他们进行更高水平的数字技能教育和培训，撒哈拉以南非洲将在几十年内实现发展，并将经历其独特的工业化版本。&lt;/p>;

src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/hero-1024x682.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;最近多年来，越来越多的组织转向多个公共云提供商来运营其业务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在某些情况下，这种情况是无意中出现的，因为不同的团队更喜欢不同的平台。有时，这是渴望获得多云竞争和经济优势的组织战略决策的结果。这些包括更高的灵活性、更低的成本、更大的数据货币化能力以及法规遵从性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，采用多云的过程可能是漫长而痛苦的。在此过程中，许多企业可能会面临复杂性和成本的飙升，更不用说安全问题了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;释放多云方法的真正潜力（变得“云智能”）需要有针对性和战略性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;与多云复杂性的斗争&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多云挑战可能会让企业领导者措手不及。公有云“在纸面上看起来真的非常非常好”，ice挪威的云和基础设施架构师 William Brown 说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fiserv 的高级副总裁兼杰出工程师 Tom Eck 表示：“在最初的兴奋爆发之后，出现了幻灭的阶段，事情没有按预期进行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) google tag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;对于 T-Systems（德国电信股份公司旗下）云平台高级副总裁 Christoph Rode 来说，多云的采用带来了多个方面的挑战。 “即使你进行了成本控制，你也会意识到成本正在螺旋式上升，”他说。 “我需要控制成本。我需要控制安全性、合规性，并且需要帮助。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些经历并不是独一无二的。 VMware 委托 Vanson Bourne 最近对近 6,000 名 IT 领导者进行的一项调查显示，70% 的人表示他们正在努力应对多云挑战。很少有企业能够达到&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vmware.com/reaching-multicloud-tipping-point&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;临界点&lt;/a>;，即多云的战略优势超过其复杂性：70% 的公司尚未在多云采用之旅中达到高级阶段。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经历这些挑战的组织正在错失围绕多云收入、盈利能力和数据的关键机遇可以带来竞争优势的货币化。他们也无法享受多云数据主权和数据安全优势，从而保持客户和员工的忠诚度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“云智能”的优势&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有更好的方法来采用多云。报告中调查的五分之一的组织可以被视为“云智能”，或者其多云方法成熟。他们正在采取有计划的战略方法来实现数字化转型和多云实施。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“对我来说，应用程序的安全性、应用程序在世界各地的可访问性以及如何使用这些应用程序才是云智能的真正开始。”Quality Bicycle Products 的系统架构师 Joe Van Ert 说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些关键因素是将云智能组织与那些面临多云采用挑战的组织区分开来的：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;应用程序创新&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Vi灵活性和云支出&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;云安全&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;数据管理文化和团队&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;无论企业处于云采用之路的哪个阶段，它都可以采用云智能思维方式。采用这种方法并利用正确技术的组织可以降低复杂性并减轻处理多个云带来的挑战。充分利用可用的云平台，使企业能够最大限度地提高收入和盈利能力，安全地跨境管理数据，并通过指尖将数据货币化。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;当销售人员失去一笔交易时，大多数人更愿意继续前进，而不是徘徊在损失的具体细节上。同样，当他们赢得一笔交易时，大多数人都会很快庆祝。但很少有人花时间评估他们为何赢得业务。在作者的书中，在领导和指导销售团队的经验中，他们发现有证据表明，简短、针对性强的销售回顾可以显着提高团队未来的获胜率，在回顾中你可以揭示胜利或失败背后的原因。除了为销售团队带来明显的好处之外，对于谁来说，该流程可以帮助确定未来使用的最佳消息传递和行为——分析胜利和损失还可以为产品、营销和财务团队提供宝贵的见解。团队应该问三个问题：1）客户将如何阐明他们选择的价值？ 2) 谁是房间内外最有影响力的声音？ 3) 除了价格之外，客户做出决定的关键决定因素是什么？&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;布伦特是一家金融科技公司的客户经理，他非常确信这笔交易将会完成，因此他将其放在了本季度结束的预测中。他甚至已经在精神上花掉了他的佣金。当他接受自己失去这笔交易的现实时，他意识到有一些迹象表明客户没有完全投入。现在，他们要使用其他人了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;布伦特知道他必须告诉他的老板。但他最不想做的就是召开一次会议来揭露自己的失败。也许他可以在他们交谈之前再做一笔交易，从而避免他确信会是一场痛苦的谈话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当销售人员失去一笔交易时，大多数人更愿意继续前进，而不是在损失的具体细节上徘徊。同样，当他们赢得一笔交易时，大多数人都会很快庆祝。但很少有人花时间评估他们为什么赢得业务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据我们领导和指导销售团队的经验，我们看到证据表明，简短、针对性强的销售回顾可以揭示成功或失败背后的原因，可以显着提高团队未来的获胜率。除了为销售团队带来明显的好处（该流程可以帮助他们确定未来使用的最佳信息和行为）之外，分析胜利和损失还可以为产品、营销和财务团队提供宝贵的见解。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;领导者和销售人员面临的挑战是深入挖掘定价和功能的传统竞争分析，以揭示影响客户购买决策的细微差别因素。虽然销售人员可能会因为拿放大镜观察后视镜而抱怨，尤其是在可能仍然令人痛苦的损失时，但我们发现，即使只花 10 分钟进行回顾也会带来巨大的回报。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下是组织和个人可以在销售回顾中使用的三个问题。无论球队赢得还是输掉交易，这些问题都有效。它们旨在帮助团队了解推动客户购买决策的真正问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;客户如何阐明他们选择的价值？&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;领导者可以在交易完成或失败后向团队提出问题。该过程首先要求团队超越解决方案本身。相反，重点关注客户如何阐明实施他们选择的解决方案（无论是您的解决方案还是您竞争对手的解决方案）的效果。例如，该解决方案可能会影响客户的其他部门，超出销售人员传统上接触的初始用户组，或者它可能会帮助客户完成其他内部优先事项。超越明显的产品用户可以帮助团队了解他们更大的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你输掉了这笔交易，通过这个镜头更深入地挖掘将帮助你制定自己的定位，以便下次创造更多的紧迫感。如果您赢得了交易，这些信息将帮助您采取行动，确保从客户的角度实现高价值的实施。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上述金融科技公司中，销售回顾显示客户对一些产品功能给予了高度重视，他们认为这些功能是其内部团队的必备功能。客户认为竞争对手的产品在这些领域更加强大。在回顾期间变得具体，促使布伦特公司的产品团队进行了一些小调整，使它们处于同等水平。营销人员还收集了有关如何调整材料以突出变化的信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;揭示损失通常有助于发现机会。但赢得胜利也有好处。询问相关销售人员客户如何阐明您的解决方案的价值，为整个团队创造了共同的胜利。在经济紧缩的情况下，夸大胜利而不是仅仅解决损失，会提醒您的销售团队，客户发现您的解决方案很有价值，并且许多人仍在购买。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;谁是房间内外最有影响力的声音？&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;通常，关键决策者、影响者和主题专家直到交易决定后才会被透露。了解您赢得的交易中的这些人是谁，可以为您的实施做好准备。了解当您失去一笔交易时谁的声音具有重要影响力，可以帮助销售团队在未来的销售过程中尽早解决这些影响者的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过查看参与者和价值故事更全面地揭示损失，可以帮助销售团队摆脱拒绝的痛苦。值得注意的是，羞耻和责备的环境很少能产生伟大的洞察力。相反，应该关注他们下次可以采取哪些不同的做法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当金融科技公司更仔细地观察决策者时，很明显，首席信息官已经做出了最终决定。虽然大多数销售拜访都是针对用户组的，但正是 CIO 确定了必须具备的功能，从而导致团队付出了代价。了解这一点促使销售支持部门创建额外的培训，以帮助销售团队更熟练地拜访首席信息官。营销团队开发了一个新的平台，展示他们的产品如何应对典型的 CIO 挑战，财务团队开发了模型来展示其随着时间的推移产生的净积极影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;除了价格之外，客户决策的关键决定因素是什么？&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;当团队失去一笔交易时，很容易将其归咎于定价。要求团队思考为什么客户会出于价格以外的原因做出决策，这将使他们能够反思解决方案的全部价值。它还将使他们能够更广泛地审视自己的产品在竞争格局中的表现。当你失去一笔交易时，这个问题将帮助你的团队通过更加适应未来的细微差别来提高他们的技能。相反，当你获胜时，除了定价之外，解释你获胜的原因会增强团队的信心，这有助于你保持未来的利润。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;询问买家自己还有哪些其他因素影响了决策，这也很有帮助。他们甚至可能没有意识到推动他们思考的微妙因素，直到他们被要求拆开包装。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失败后，金融科技团队回到客户那里询问他们为什么选择竞争对手，从而使团队能够获得有关感知到的产品差异的更详细信息。保持对话中立，而不试图重新推销，创造了一个客户愿意分享的环境。损失仍然令人痛苦，但他们直接从客户那里获得的深刻见解帮助团队调整了未来的产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然销售回顾的好处是显而易见的，但挑战往往在于评估何时使用销售回顾。组织可能在一个季度内完成数百或数千笔交易，但并非所有交易都值得反思。人们倾向于限制对季度末未完成的大型交易进行回顾。然而，根据我们的经验，当时的情绪非常高涨，因此回顾的效用通常很低。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相反，我们发现销售领导每季度为每位客户经理至少举行一次回顾会很有帮助。这使得团队能够收集对公司多个职能部门有价值的信息。也许最重要的是，这种方法将训练销售团队独立思考为什么他们实际上获胜或失败，而与回顾无关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论领导者选择讨论哪项交易，从不进行回顾到进行几次回顾都将是一项相当大的成就，并提供可能改变进入市场策略的见解。通过进行更深入的销售回顾，这家金融科技公司能够调整他们的产品，提高销售团队的技能，并在关键买家中建立更强大的影响力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于大多数领导者来说，需要时间才能产生与案例研究中所取得的效果类似的影响，但在此过程中，客户主管会感到被倾听，销售将更加有效，并且进入市场的团队将能够更好地支持销售。最终，这使领导者能够将小损失转化为大胜利。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When Your Employee Isn&rsquo;t Reaching Their Full Potential]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/when-your-employee-isnt-reaching-their-full-potential]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;p>;因此，缩小员工可能无法充分发挥潜力的原因至关重要。我们发现了三个主要类别要检查：个人挑战，人际关系问题或您自己的领导。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>; &lt;strong>;个人挑战&lt;/strong>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;人们无法充分发挥自己的潜力的一个原因是，很少有人知道他们的&lt;a a href =“ “>;实际潜力&lt;/a>;首先。考虑一下，在任何专业知识、才能或绩效领域，人们的优秀程度和他们认为自己的优秀程度之间的重叠度通常小于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-29559-001&quot;>;10%&lt;/a>;。作为领导者，您可以向您领导和管理的团队成员赠送一份强大的礼物：了解他们的能力，有时甚至在他们行动之前，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fair-Talk-Three-Powerful-Feedback/dp/1912555093&quot;>;举起一面镜子&lt;/a>;。事实上，反馈是员工绩效的关键催化剂，但&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1996-02773-003&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;表明，三分之二的情况下，反馈要么无法使他人变得更好，甚至使他们&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy&quot;>;变得更糟&lt;/a>;！&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确保您特别赞扬了员工在其工作中的表现最好，这样他们就知道什么是“优秀”，并让他们参与讨论他们在那些时刻为成功所做的事情。他们之所以能成功演讲是因为他们花了时间练习和准备吗？ Did they interview audience members beforehand so they could cite relevant examples? Helping them dig deeper into the reasons behind their success helps show them how to replicate it. In other words, think of yourself &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;as a coach&lt;/a>; rather than a boss.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another major driver of people failing to reach their potential is, simply, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-06019-003&quot;>;motivation&lt;/a>;. If you&#39;ve seen your employees perform at a high level in the past, then clearly ability isn&#39;t the problem here — so their current level of motivation is worth investigating. You might check in with your team member to see what&#39;s going on, especially if there&#39;s been a sudden change. Perhaps they&#39;re going through something &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/how-to-manage-an-employee-whos-having-a-personal-crisis&quot;>;challenging in their personal life&lt;/a>;, or are on the pathway to &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/do-you-know-burnout-when-you-see-it&quot;>;burnout&lt;/a>; and need to take time off. Or perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/how-to-lose-your-best-employees&quot;>;they feel stagnant&lt;/a>; in their role and need new challenges, including stretch goals, which you can &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/give-your-employees-specific-goals-and-the-freedom-to-figure-out-how-to-reach-them&quot;>;help them craft&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Interpersonal Issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sometimes your employees&#39; underperformance comes from the circumstances surrounding them — ie, other people. As Boris Groysberg and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;/2004/05/the-risky-business-of-hiring-stars&quot;>;have shown&lt;/a>;, star employees who migrate to new firms often fail to replicate their success, because the supportive ingredients that helped propel their rise (such as company-specific knowledge or networks) are no longer in place. Indeed, although organizations typically pay more for external hires than internally promoted employees, external hires typically tend to fail to add as &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-external-hires-get-paid-more-and-perform-worse-than-internal-staff/&quot;>;much value&lt;/a>; as internal candidates, not least because many of the conditions that made them successful before may not be there anymore.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, your employee may be hitting a plateau as a result of new team dynamics (perhaps in the aftermath of a colleague departing or joining the team), altered roles or responsibilities, or a perceived lack of recognition or change in status (someone else landing a promotion or bonus). Your employee&#39;s talents may be unchanged — but their ability to execute on them has. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ll want to discuss the dynamics honestly and identify opportunities to reframe or mediate the conflict — or shift them to a new role where they&#39;re more likely to succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Leadership Problems&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s unpleasant to consider, but remember that at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324&quot;>;least 30% of employees&#39; performance&lt;/a>; is the product of how they&#39;re managed, meaning that your leadership could play a big role in determining whether people are reaching their potential or not. It&#39;s possible that, despite intending to support and nurture your employee, you may be squelching their talents through &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/signs-that-youre-a-micromanager&quot;>;micromanagement&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/get-what-you-need-from-your-hands-off-boss&quot;>;overly loose supervision&lt;/a>;, or poorly &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/02/making-sure-your-employees-suc&quot;>;communicated objectives&lt;/a>;, among other managerial sins.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good news about this potentially alarming revelation is that it&#39;s one area that&#39;s firmly within your control. By &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/a-refresher-on-ab-testing&quot;>;A/B testing&lt;/a>; strategies around how you communicate with your employee, give feedback, empower them, and manage them, you can directly examine the results of the guidance you provide and evaluate whether the main reason for their underperformance is actually . 。 .&amp;nbsp; you. It&#39;s useful to test strategies that have worked with them in the past, as well as those that have proven effective with other employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All people are unique and no strategy works for everyone. That being said, it&#39;s generally true that when you spend more time with an employee with whom you have a trusting relationship and give them more feedback (including constructive criticism, worthy praise, recognition, and resources), they&#39;ll be more likely to reach their potential than if you do the exact opposite with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, remember that people are humans, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Human-Automation-Quest-Reclaim-Unique-ebook/dp/B099KQV3ZJ&quot;>;humans are not machines&lt;/a>;. This means you shouldn&#39;t expect everybody to perform to their maximum level or full capabilities all their time. In fact, the most creative and talented people on earth — in any field — can be dramatically inconsistent in their performance, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-02410-016&quot;>;inspiration is a strong driver of results&lt;/a>; and the main fuel for innovative and exceptional work. Cutting people some slack and respecting their natural cycles, while of course &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/hold-your-team-accountable-with-compassion-not-fear&quot;>;holding them accountable&lt;/a>; as appropriate, is what good managers do. Incidentally, the inconsistency or erratic element that underpins work performance may also apply to you — so it&#39;s probably helpful to examine whether &lt;em>;you &lt;/em>;are reaching your own potential, and what could potentially be stopping you from doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Understanding the gaps in your employees&#39; performance — and, perhaps, your own — is an exercise in thoughtfulness and empathy. By examining the possibilities above, you&#39;ll be in a much better position to help guide your team to be at their best more frequently.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Effectively &mdash; and Legally &mdash; Use Racial Data for DEI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-to-effectively-and-legally-use-racial-data-for-dei]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/July23_24_RacialData.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Ngadi Smart&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;After the recent US Supreme Court ruling striking against affirmative action in higher education, leaders might be concerned that their DEI initiatives and programs will face additional scrutiny and legal challenge. While reducing liability is a responsible move, the author cautions against letting these efforts lead to a fear-driven abandonment of effective DEI practices. To sustain DEI progress in this time, companies should focus on curtailing the usage of racial data that is the most legally risky, while taking decisive action to continue using racial data to eliminate discrimination, remove bias, and create fairer workplaces. The author illustrates how to curtail this risk, identifies five goals for this data use (to identify disparities, to remove universal barriers, to correct discrimination, to design fair processes, and to demonstrate DEI progress), and offers dos and don&amp;#8217;ts for companies hoping to sustain DEI progress.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-effectively-and-legally-use-racial-data-for-dei?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-effectively-and-legally-use-racial-data-for-dei?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Following the US Supreme Court ruling striking down race-conscious admissions in higher education, some corporate leaders may be concerned that beyond reducing the already low diversity of their hiring pipelines, the ruling might cause their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and programs to face additional scrutiny and legal challenge.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While reducing liability is a responsible move, leaders should take care to ensure their efforts to protect against legal risk don&#39;t turn into a fear-driven abandonment of effective DEI practices. The key to sustaining DEI progress and commitment through this volatile time lies in acting intentionally: curtailing your usage of racial data that is the most legally risky, while taking decisive action to continue using racial data to eliminate discrimination, remove bias, and create fairer workplaces.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Curtail Legal Risk&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To understand how to best act on this complex topic, it&#39;s important to start with the legal foundations. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/policy-notices/no-fear-act/protections-against-discrimination&quot;>;Title VII of the Civil Rights Act&lt;/a>;, it&#39;s illegal to consider any single candidate&#39;s or employee&#39;s race — even with the intention of creating a more diverse, equitable, or inclusive workforce — in any employment decision. Employers can&#39;t create de facto hiring quotas (eg, “50% of the employees hired in this department must be women”), or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/esg-epicenter/20220524-california-court-strikes-down-law-on-board-diversity&quot;>;reserve seats&lt;/a>;” for employees from certain groups, even in the interest of diversity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the law, even after the recent Supreme Court ruling, gender-conscious or race-conscious hiring practices are permitted&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; but only as part of limited, temporary, and highly structured &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2023/07/considerations-for-employers-following-the-eeocs-response-to-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-race-conscious-college-admissions?utm_source=pardot&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=clientalerts&amp;amp;sc_camp=2D3D522D49CB4CE599B743213715F288&quot;>;voluntary affirmative action programs&lt;/a>;, undertaken only if employers find evidence of company-wide or industry-wide hiring discrimination, only to correct the initial imbalance, and only without “undue harm” on members of non-targeted groups (meaning that employers cannot lay off white workers to hire workers of color).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So long as these guidelines are followed, neither employers nor DEI practitioners need to panic. Removing the word “diversity,” vowing to strip all mentions of race at work, or shutting down race-related affinity groups are harmful overreactions that don&#39;t reflect real legal risks. As it stands, the vast majority of workplace DEI programs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catalyst.org/2023/06/29/legal-experts-supremecourt-affirmative-action/&quot;>;strongly supported by legal precedent&lt;/a>; and are unlikely to be affected by this Supreme Court ruling.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When done right, DEI programs can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2021/sep/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-an-important-loss-prevention-tool/&quot;>;reduce&lt;/a>; the risk of employment discrimination and hostile work environment claims and can mitigate risk across your organization. However, employers can nevertheless reduce their risk by auditing their existing programs to ensure they don&#39;t run afoul of existing laws. Policies that instruct hiring managers to use the race of individuals as a “tiebreaker” or “plus points” for individual candidates are impermissible under the law. Setting aside concrete numbers or percentages of roles or seats for members of specific social groups is similarly risky. Avoid practices like hard rules forbidding employees not of a particular race from joining employee resource groups or instructing recruiters to fill a position with someone meeting specific demographic criteria (eg, “you must fill this role with a woman of color.”) Essentially, if a policy, process, or practice requires knowing the racial characteristics of an individual to make a decision affecting their employment, you may want to review it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Collect Racial Data to Identify Disparities&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Some leaders may read the preceding paragraph and assume that an easy way to reduce risk is to simply not collect any racial data at all. However, making this conclusion would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and could put your company&#39;s DEI progress at risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While using the racial data of individuals to influence a hiring decision would be illegal, aggregating racial data for the overall candidate pool to identify overall race-related disparities is well within reasonable grounds. Collecting demographic data in conjunction with an employee engagement survey might reveal racial gaps in meeting participation deserving a closer look. Collecting demographic data in conjunction with HR data might reveal racial gaps in turnover deserving intervention. In other words, collecting demographic data, including race, can reveal adverse impact caused by existing practices, prior discriminatory practices, or historical limitations on the labor pool, all criteria specifically listed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.constangy.com/affirmative-action-alert/increase-diversity-without-violating-the-law&quot;>;Voluntary Affirmative Action Guidelines&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is this data-driven approach compliant with current guidelines for employers, but it is also highly effective in ensuring DEI initiatives deliver measurable impact. Socially conscious investors, employees, and customers want employers to go beyond public statements of commitment, to take specific actions that remedy real inequities in organizations, industries, and society. Collecting racial data to gain information about inequalities in your organization, your industry, or even society is one of the highest-value DEI-related actions you can take as a leader, and ensures that when you act, you will be working purposefully with a clear goal in mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Remove Universal Barriers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A common misunderstanding of DEI initiatives is the assumption that, if a racial disparity is identified, DEI initiatives rectify the disparity by giving marginalized groups preferential treatment — so-called “reverse discrimination.” For example, some managers might assume that if an analysis reveals racial hiring discrimination, DEI initiatives would seek to “give jobs to marginalized people” at the expense of white employees in return.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only would such a crude and zero-sum approach be blatantly illegal; it&#39;s also far from the reality of DEI work. Most effective DEI programs use racial data to identify discriminatory barriers that are compromising fairness and meritocracy in the workplace, and to develop initiatives that remove those barriers &lt;em>;for everyone&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if an analysis using racial data uncovers disproportionate barriers for Black, Asian, Latine, and Indigenous manager candidates due to the lack of a standard promotions process and high barriers to entry for candidates, a DEI initiative might follow up by working with all leaders to develop a standardized promotions process, train leaders on how to use it and how to interrupt biases, and automatically consider all employees for promotion after three years in a position. These initiatives would have the added benefit of reducing manager favoritism, nepotism, and other unethical practices that might negatively impact workers from any background. Most DEI initiatives follow this pattern: They collect data on marginalized groups to design workplaces that work better for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Correct Discrimination&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When employers seek out &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/how-to-identify-and-fix-pay-inequality-at-your-company&quot;>;pay equity audits&lt;/a>;, they learn whether employees of different backgrounds are being paid fairly for equal work. If the answer is no, then responsible employers may proactively offer back pay to the affected employees to rectify the inequality. The extra pay isn&#39;t “taken” from the non-affected employees like in a zero-sum game; it&#39;s given from the employer to make things right: expanding the pie, rather than fighting over it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if an employer uses racial data to identify that white managers are receiving disproportionately more opportunities to take on challenging projects, network, and receive mentorship from senior leaders, in addition to removing universal barriers to opportunity, they might proactively create more opportunities to offer challenging projects, networking, and mentorship to members of marginalized groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the surprising benefits of using data in this way is that it can help your workforce understand the rationale behind your DEI initiatives. Because most people assume that workplaces are inherently fair or are meritocracies until proven otherwise, DEI initiatives (eg, starting an employee resource group with event programming mostly directed at Latine employees) might be met with apathy or &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/fighting-backlash-to-racial-equity-efforts/&quot;>;backlash&lt;/a>; from those anxious about preferential treatment. By grounding DEI work in data (eg, with an analysis showing a relative lack of community, support, and belonging for Latine employees compared to White employees) you can help your workforce understand the importance of DEI programs and take pride in your commitment to supporting your workforce.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Design Fair Processes&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You cannot use individuals&#39; racial information to give them a 30% score bump compared to other candidates. You cannot allocate 30% of positions to members of marginalized racial groups, outside of a highly-bounded voluntary affirmative action program following the guidelines discussed above.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; you may stipulate that each stage of your hiring process be composed of at least 30% qualified candidates of color before proceeding (a practice known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diversitylab.com/pilot-projects/mansfield-overview/&quot;>;Mansfield Rule&lt;/a>;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclusocal.org/en/inclusion-targets-whats-legal&quot;>;Inclusion Rider&lt;/a>;). While these practices typically aim to correct for industry-wide discrimination or limited labor pools, no one candidate has higher or lower odds of being hired than the next candidate. The employer simply takes additional time to intentionally expand the candidate pool before proceeding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Processes like these can be combined with other bias-disrupting practices to further ensure fairness. For example, you can make it clear that any voluntarily shared racial data will not be associated with an individual&#39;s candidacy. You may even require that individuals handling racial data for candidate pool diversity work separately from those who will make employment decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Demonstrate DEI Progress&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Some leaders may invest in DEI initiatives and programs out of the applaudable initial justification that they are “obviously” needed to support the workforce. However, when these initiatives run their course, those leaders can feel unsure what to do next. When times are good, these DEI initiatives are seen as a marker of a successful, people-centered workplace. But when organizations are under financial pressure, face business challenges, and must juggle competing priorities, the lack of a solid justification for DEI can consign it to &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/protecting-dei-progress-when-budgets-are-tight&quot;>;the top of the list for budget cuts&lt;/a>;. Organizations that are neither able to demonstrate an evidence-based reason for DEI programs&#39; existence, nor an evidence-based assessment for DEI programs&#39; effectiveness will never be able to decouple their DEI efforts from short-lived trends and fads.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for organizations that &lt;em>;can&lt;/em>; initiate DEI programs using data showing racial disparities or unmet needs, racial data can be the single most powerful tool in justifying their continued existence. If your &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/to-understand-whether-your-company-is-inclusive-map-how-your-employees-interact&quot;>;network analysis&lt;/a>; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/employee-belonging&quot;>;belonging survey&lt;/a>; quantifies a racial gap in access to decision-making processes, you might use these findings as rationale to design new decision-making processes, create advisory boards to inform leaders, and lean on employee resource groups to share information to employees of color about their input is being sought out.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By once again running those same analyses and comparing the data you receive, you&#39;ll be able to make powerful inferences regarding the success — or failure — of your initiatives and draw on these findings to further improve your DEI programs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Principles to Remember&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;Don&#39;t:&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Panic, abandon your DEI efforts, or compromise effective initiatives out of unfounded fear.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Make employment decisions about or resources for individuals dependent on knowing their race or ethnicity, without a prior analysis showing disparity, and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Allocate or reserve a percentage of desirable resources (eg, promotions, positions, assignments) to members of racial group, without a prior analysis showing disparity and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Use people&#39;s racial data to give them a boost or a demerit in any decision, without a prior analysis showing disparity, and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Express racial preferences, criteria, or restriction for any role or position, without a prior analysis showing disparity, and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;Do:&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Use racial data to inform recruitment efforts and diversify candidate pools (eg, by using the Mansfield Rule).&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Aggregate racial data to preserve anonymity without losing group-level insight.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Draw upon racial data to identify racial inequalities and disparities in your organization.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Cite racial data to design DEI efforts and initiatives that remove barriers and correct for discrimination.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Reference longitudinal racial data to show DEI progress, communicate about the efficacy of DEI programs, and celebrate your wins.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/to-drive-diversity-efforts-dont-tiptoe-around-your-legal-risk&quot;>;Partner&lt;/a>; with attorneys and legal experts early on to design and communicate about legal — and effective — DEI programs.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;DEI work isn&#39;t going anywhere, and leaders know it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2023/bain--company-study-shows-85-of-business-leaders-view-social-issues-as-urgent-concerns-for-their-companies/&quot;>;85%, according to a recent survey&lt;/a>;, view social issues as “urgent” concerns. Employees and consumers continue to expect organizations to not just make commitments to do better, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/to-make-lasting-progress-on-dei-measure-outcomes&quot;>;achieve measurable outcomes&lt;/a>; that can prove that their talk isn&#39;t empty. Doing so will require that evidence-based DEI work — that requires collecting and using racial data legally and effectively, alongside other demographic data — becomes the new standard of this work. Done right, you&#39;ll be able to simultaneously shore up your legal risks and accelerate your organization&#39;s transition to the higher standard of transparency, accountability, and effectiveness your constituents expect from their DEI programs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is simply the next evolution of DEI in a longer fight for greater diversity, equity, and inclusion at work grounded in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with decades of widespread support. How your organization meets the needs of this moment will decide how well you adapt to the next stage in your DEI journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: A Little Nature in the Office Boosts Morale and Productivity]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/research-a-little-nature-in-the-office-boosts-morale-and-productivity]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_19_MaryHaasdykVooys.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Mary Haasdyk Vooys&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Research on &amp;#8220;micro-nature&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; the incorporation of small, affordable natural elements into workplaces &amp;#8212; demonstrates its positive impact on employee performance and well-being.

The integration of nature in workplaces enhances overall business performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/research-a-little-nature-in-the-office-boosts-morale-and-productivity?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/research-a-little-nature-in-the-office-boosts-morale-and-productivity?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In Canary Wharf, the bustling district that serves as the London base for many global enterprises, developers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/glenn-howells-and-eden-project-to-give-canary-wharf-a-green-revamp&quot;>;building a “green spine”&lt;/a>; that will soon wind through the skyscrapers, giving workers ready access to green spaces during their workdays. Across town at Google&#39;s under-construction UK headquarters, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15723642/google-london-office-pictures-headquarters-kings-cross&quot;>;300-meter-long rooftop park&lt;/a>; with over 250 trees crowns the building, providing employees with a natural escape from the offices and urban environment below. On the other side of the Atlantic, retailer LL Bean cut out the middle of one of their warehouses and turned the space into a courtyard, so that everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90908239/ll-bean-new-headquarters&quot;>;at their new home office&lt;/a>; would have views of nature while working. These real-world examples of incorporating nature into commercial spaces are part of a growing trend to design places where employees can be immersed in nature during their workdays.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Increasing nature in the work environment certainly aligns with many companies&#39; sustainability initiatives. However, the motive also stems from nature&#39;s effect on humans — it is well established that nature makes us feel better. Our emotions, our thinking, our connection to others, and our physical well-being &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2017.0177&quot;>;are all enhanced by being in and around nature&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the connection between contact with nature and our well-being, large investments in bringing nature into the workplace raise some thorny issues. First, in a time of economic headwinds and cost-cutting, is there a business case for incorporating nature into employees&#39; surroundings? Second, what about those workplaces where it is not feasible or sensible to incorporate a green spine or a rooftop garden?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answering these questions requires first understanding whether nature has effects on metrics that matter to organizations&#39; bottom lines (eg, employee satisfaction and performance) and if so whether less-extreme doses of nature are meaningful enough to elicit these gains. Thus, we set out to test the effects (if any) of what we call &lt;em>;micro-nature &lt;/em>;— small, affordable, seemingly innocuous ways of incorporating nature into the workplace — on how employees feel at work, and how they perform.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Research&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We measured or manipulated contact with nature at work in different ways across multiple studies, with workers in the US, Canada, China, New Zealand, and Indonesia. In experiments, working adults were simply shown images of workplaces suffused with natural elements or matching images without nature. We then asked them to imagine they worked in these spaces and report how it would make them feel and perform. We also conducted more complex studies in real-world work settings. For instance, we assessed employees&#39; actual contact with nature during a week at work (eg, working near plants, natural views, or the sound of running water), and then measured their feelings and objective job performance. Finally, in a field experiment in an accounting firm, we went into the offices at night and placed potted plants at some employees&#39; desks and similar pots, only filled with office supplies, at other desks. We then measured the attitudes and job performance of the two groups and compared them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results were largely consistent across these studies: Experiencing even small doses of nature at work improved the way employees felt in ways that fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10166977/1/Tang%20et%20al%20final%20prepublished.pdf&quot;>;higher task performance, increased helping&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01492063231172182&quot;>;enhanced creativity&lt;/a>;. These findings indicate that incorporating micro-nature into work settings can contribute to worker well-being and performance in a meaningful way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also looked into whether there were differences between employees that shaped how nature affected them at work — factors such as how much individuals appreciate nature in general, and the extent to which they are drawn to novel experiences. Our findings showed that some people are especially prone to experiencing the benefits of nature. However, we found no evidence that any employees were negatively impacted by nature exposure at work; thus, micro-nature seems to hold considerable promise for employees with little downsides.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bearing these findings in mind, we believe that nature should be accessible to as many employees as possible, not just those lucky enough to work below a green roof or alongside a park. Companies should provide employees with micro-nature experiences. Below, we offer suggestions for incorporating micro-nature into the workplace, while also encouraging managers to take liberties and get creative in their specific organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Capitalizing on Micro-Nature&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;Real is best, but artificial works too.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Giving employees opportunities to access “the real thing” is ideal when it comes to nature: indoor water features, windows with views of nature or that open to let in natural sounds like birdsong. But just because it&#39;s not the real thing does not mean that employees will not benefit from nature. Research shows that even depictions of nature, such as murals and artificial flowers, can give employees a natural boost.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Think beyond the office…&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It goes without saying that it is not just office workers who benefit from nature. Employees in settings where the work environment feels especially removed from nature — think warehousing or manufacturing — are especially likely to notice a dash of the outdoors brought inside and be positively impacted by it because of how different it is from their status quo.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;…and beyond the workplace.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The benefits of nature extend beyond employees&#39; work lives. Some of our research looked at the work-related benefits of spending time outdoors in the evening, after the workday. We found that employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01492063221106430&quot;>;were more productive the next day&lt;/a>; when they spent time outdoors the prior evening. Especially for hybrid and remote workers, the implications are clear: The benefits of being around nature at home carry over into work. So even incentivizing employees to take an evening walk can help them be more productive the next day.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Utilize unused or underused spaces.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;By definition, micro-nature is small, and can be as simple as painting a wall with natural tones, adding flowers to the break room, or landscaping the area outside employees&#39; windows. We encourage managers to keep an eye out for the unused or underused spaces around their workplace that can be easily and cheaply turned into natural features. For instance, adding more landscaping to an overly industrial parking lot may boost employees&#39; morale.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Overall, our findings indicate that the benefits of connecting employees to nature at work extend beyond sustainability, and include positive effects on employees&#39; well-being and how they perform their jobs. As such, we view contact with nature as a valuable supplement to well-designed jobs that already include meaningful work, fair compensation, and respectful treatment. For firms that provide these things and are looking for more ways to enhance the environment in which their employees work, micro-nature offers considerable promise.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Companies Need to Prove They Can Be Trusted with Technology]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/companies-need-to-prove-they-can-be-trusted-with-technology]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/July23_20_1282056839.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Hiroshi Watanabe/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Trust in technology &amp;#8212; and the companies that use it &amp;#8212; has taken a hit over the past few years. Transgressions against individuals&amp;#8217; privacy, calcification of corporate or individual biases into life-altering algorithms, constant threats that new tech erodes their ability to make a living, and beta testing unsecured or faulty connected devices or vehicles on an unsuspecting populace have encouraged healthy skepticism. To rebuild digital trust, companies need to pursue three broad goals: security and reliability, accountability and oversight, and inclusive, responsible, ethical use. Practically, this requires three steps: 1) define a vision for digital trust, 2) plan to act in more trustworthy ways, and 3) recruit people who will help earn trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/companies-need-to-prove-they-can-be-trusted-with-technology?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/companies-need-to-prove-they-can-be-trusted-with-technology?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Technological solutionism — the idea that tech developers can be trusted to innovate or code our way out of problems, and into prosperity — is on its way out. Individuals&#39; trust in tech and the companies who develop it has been eroded by innumerable failures. For businesses, it&#39;s no longer acceptable to use technology without taking steps to ensure it&#39;s trustworthy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regular people — and, increasingly, legislators and regulators — have reasonably been made skeptical by recent transgressions against individuals&#39; privacy, calcification of corporate or individual biases into life-altering algorithms, constant threats that new tech erodes their ability to make a living, and beta testing unsecured or faulty connected devices or vehicles on an unsuspecting populace. Looking at the near future, with generative AI and virtual worlds being implemented faster than we can track, the trust problem is only getting worse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More tech isn&#39;t going to solve this problem. Customers are looking at the choices that company leaders make and assessing whether those choices match individual consumers and citizens&#39; values — and whether they put people first. And because every company uses some form of digital technology in its operations and relationships with customers and partners, every company needs to worry about digital trust. “Digital trust programs are a necessity, and when done right, can be both a differentiator and enabler for a business. As demands rise for companies to show they are trustworthy, organizations should strive to build a digital trust strategy that meets or exceeds their customers&#39; expectations, not just what&#39;s legally required,” according to Vikram Rao, Salesforce&#39;s Chief Trust Officer and a member of the World Economic Forum Digital Trust Steering Committee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some companies may look at the problem and hope they can buy or hire their way out of it. In some cases, a new role, like a Chief Trust Officer or Chief Digital Trust Officer may help. But before CEOs and boards rush into creating a c-suite role as a panacea, they need to take a hard look at what exactly trustworthy technology looks like in the 21st century, how companies earn digital trust, and what changes and investments they need to make to do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What makes technology trustworthy?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;No technology is inherently trustworthy or untrustworthy. After all, technologies have no agency in themselves; instead, as a character in the Afrofuturist film &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/twelve_new_films_that_highlight_the_best_in_humanity&quot;>;Neptune Frost&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>; puts it, “technology is only a reflection of us.” Trust in technology is a reflection of the decisions people make when they develop the tech, use it, and implement it. While there are many ways to think about trust, when the World Economic Forum convened business, government, and civil society leaders in the field of trustworthy tech, the assembled group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/reports/earning-digital-trust-decision-making-for-trustworthy-technologies&quot;>;reached this consensus&lt;/a>;: “Digital trust is individuals&#39; expectation that digital technologies and services — and the organizations providing them — will protect all stakeholders&#39; interests and uphold societal expectations and values.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this work, the Forum&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://initiatives.weforum.org/digital-trust/community&quot;>;Digital Trust Community&lt;/a>; realized that the most important question to ask with regard to technology is not “how do you get people to trust technology?” Rather it&#39;s “what do we need to do — as technology developers, owners, and users — to respect people&#39;s values and expectations?” With the right mindset and the right goals, it&#39;s possible to develop an effective and trustworthy strategy for the use of digital technology. At its heart, such a trustworthy tech strategy comes from consideration for the individuals subjected to new technologies (regardless of the technology in question).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With respect for individual rights and expectations in mind, a trustworthy digital technology strategy should identify the right goals. The World Economic Forum&#39;s digital trust community offered three broad sets of goals:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Security and Reliability&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Accountability and Oversight, and&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Inclusive, Ethical, and Responsible Use&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;As Julie Brill, Microsoft&#39;s Chief Privacy Officer and a member of the Forum&#39;s Digital Trust Steering Committee said at the time, “the goals of any developer of AI or other technologies should mirror the goals of the organizations and individuals who use or encounter that technology. Shared goals of inclusivity and responsible use, strong privacy and security protections, and effective oversight are the foundational elements to building a trustworthy relationship between developers, their customers, and individuals who use the technology.” Users and consumers can better rely on technologies that protect them, that include their needs and match their values, and that have good governance practices baked in, to remediate any inadvertent harms.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How do you invest in digital trust?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Earning digital trust isn&#39;t simple, and it can&#39;t be automated. Rather it requires a series of judgment calls, investments, and organizational changes that reflect the totality of a technology&#39;s likely impact on individuals. These shifts, encompassing the whole business, can only be orchestrated by company leaders. As Keith Enright, Chief Privacy Officer at Google and Digital Trust Steering Committee member, said, “decisions companies are making now about preparedness determine where they will be down the line in terms of trust.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Becoming prepared to start earning back trust requires CEOs and Boards of Directors to do at least three things:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Define a vision for digital trust&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Plan to act in more trustworthy ways&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Recruit people who will help earn trust&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The first investment leaders need to make is to take the time and energy to truly understand the impact of the technologies they create or deploy. Developing a realistic and comprehensive vision for how an organization uses technology in service of its goals and those of the people who rely on it determines how an organization will invest in digital trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders should approach decisions involving technology with a clear sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_World_Economic_Forum_Digital_Trust_Initiative_2023.pdf&quot;>;how those technologies reflect and impact core organizational values&lt;/a>; and the values of the society in which the business operates. Their vision for creating or adopting new technologies must consider both the benefits to the business and society alongside a clear and responsible assessment of the potential harms new technologies might impose on potential customers or other stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a business adopting generative AI must assess how the technology might increase efficiencies (a benefit to the business), unlock new solutions to pressing challenges (a benefit to society) while also developing a plan to prevent &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/managing-the-risks-of-generative-ai&quot;>;expected harms&lt;/a>;, for example, to democratic processes from AI “hallucinations” or misinformation and to workers displaced by these advanced technologies. Only a vision that responsibly considers both the benefits and the risk of new technology can truly be considered trustworthy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After deciding on a vision that includes trustworthy goals, organizations need a plan to act for digital trust. This plan requires leaders to invest in the internal structures and teams that best support digital trust. For all applications of digital technology, the Forum&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://initiatives.weforum.org/digital-trust/framework&quot;>;work&lt;/a>; identified eight dimensions where positive action can help achieve an organization&#39;s goals — both trust goals and overall financial or strategic goals. Those dimensions are cybersecurity, safety, transparency, interoperability, auditability, redressability, fairness and privacy. (As with the Digital Trust Goals, these dimensions are defined and explored in the Forum&#39;s Insight Report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/reports/earning-digital-trust-decision-making-for-trustworthy-technologies&quot;>;&lt;em>;Earning Digital Trust: Decision-making for Trustworthy Technologies&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In most organizations, these areas likely fall to different departments and leaders, which means optimizing them requires an interdisciplinary approach — and possibly some structural change — in order to support the careful decision-making required to earn trust from users and other stakeholders. However, the realities of a given industry or company may mean it&#39;s not possible to maximize every one of the dimensions described. For example, greater transparency may not be possible for companies who work in highly-sensitive industries (eg, national security), so their accountability and security would have to supplement. Similarly, some dimensions of trustworthiness (perhaps most noticeably privacy) vary between jurisdictions and geographies. People&#39;s expectations and values are the litmus test for what makes technology trustworthy. Trust, itself, may be highly region and industry specific.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third big initial investment is in the people who can help the business earn digital trust. Making technology trustworthy is a multi-faceted effort conducted on an organizational (or societal) scale — which means that ultimate responsibility for trustworthiness falls to the CEO. This general duty of trustworthy technology decision-making doesn&#39;t mean, however, that the business shouldn&#39;t invest in recruiting experts (maybe even on the c-suite), who can help establish the right strategy, and the right structures, to support digital trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This leader, possibly a Chief Trust Officer — but just as likely to be the Chief Privacy Officer, General Counsel, CISO, or another executive — must be both an expert in stakeholder management and a trusted counselor to the CEO and the board. Stakeholder management comes into play where companies already have cybersecurity, privacy, compliance, and even ethics functions. The leads for each of those roles has a stake in the overall trustworthiness of the digital strategy of a company — in both building it and benefiting from it. In order to be a counselor on digital trust, this individual must also be able to think systemically — bridging between these disciplines in order to help leaders make the best judgement call on how, where, and toward what ends new technologies should be applied.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to be most effective, an officer responsible for digital trust can&#39;t be an expert on every technology and every facet of trust, rather they have to be able to understand the strategy for the company and the values of affected individuals, workers, and customers. They support development of a trustworthy vision by conveying a system-wide picture of what the technology landscape looks like to CEOs and boards and helping build a strategy that supports trust rather than erodes it. They also help oversee the myriad and interdepending actions that, taken together, earn trust from users, partners, and other stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CEOs must understand that trust in the technology that underlies and enables virtually every business can&#39;t be bought, but by investing in the time it takes to make the right decisions, establish a trustworthy vision, and recruit effective supporters, it can be earned.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Happens After the U.S. Economy&rsquo;s Soft Landing?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/what-happens-after-the-u-s-economys-soft-landing]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/July23_20_1427804800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;baona/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;A year ago, a recession was seen as a foregone conclusion &amp;#8212; and yet the Fed appears to have successfully lowered inflation without triggering a recession. Many of the negative forecasts followed a pattern of underestimating the US economy&amp;#8217;s resilience, typically because they were based on historical models and precedent, not situational and idiosyncratic context. While the soft landing may be progressing with promise, it won&amp;#8217;t be an end state &amp;#8212; a new disequilibrium will emerge. Leaders can&amp;#8217;t wait for macroeconomic certainty or stability. Instead, they must recognize that the macroeconomy will remain untamed by models &amp;#8212; and that what matters is judgment.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/what-happens-after-the-us-economys-soft-landing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/what-happens-after-the-us-economys-soft-landing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The US economy has defied the doomsayers once again. More than a year has passed since a recession was seen as a foregone conclusion and a “soft landing” pronounced near impossible. But today, the soft landing is well advanced, even if not complete: The Fed has found success in lowering inflation without triggering a recession. The labor market, the only reliable evidence that the economy is in recession, has cooled without pushing up the unemployment rate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Though this is welcome news, the protracted uncertainty surrounding the economy has confounded many leaders — and came at a cost for those who hunkered down prematurely in anticipation of recession. This uncertainty will persist. What comes after the soft landing (if in fact it can be completed)? To answer this question, we look at why the recession calls were wrong and what lies ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Recession Prophecies, Unfulfilled&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As in the pandemic, when doomsayers predicted a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/coronavirus-greater-great-depression-by-nouriel-roubini-2020-03&quot;>;Greater Depression&lt;/a>;,” much negativity dominated public discourse of the last year and a half. Some leaders predicted a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/jamie-dimon-says-brace-yourself-for-an-economic-hurricane-caused-by-the-fed-and-ukraine-war.html&quot;>;hurricane&lt;/a>;” would hit the economy shortly; others &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@alex.domash/can-job-vacancies-fall-without-an-increase-in-unemployment-1031fe19c635&quot;>;dismissed even the possibility&lt;/a>; of a soft landing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as the below graphic illustrates, that is exactly what has played out over the last 16 months. Job openings have come off their highs as firms feel under less strain, and quit rates have fallen as workers feel less enticed to jump ship — all while hiring (“payrolls”) continues at a robust pace. As the unemployment rate remains near its 60-year low there is no sign of recession.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-360940&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230719_SZLEZAK_SOFT_LANDING_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;US Labor Market&#39;s Progress Toward a Soft Landing.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;1592&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;What went wrong, or, more appropriately, what went right?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the negative forecasts followed a pattern of underestimating the US economy&#39;s resilience, typically because they were based on historical models and precedent – not situational and idiosyncratic context. Consider the following four displays of resilience:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Labor market resilience.&lt;/strong>; The widespread assumption was that monetary policy would push labor demand collectively under water. Instead we have seen pockets of weakness, covered by aggregate strength. Significant layoffs happened where hiring had overshot (eg, tech) but in other sectors (eg, services) hiring was still catching up and remained strong. Laid-off workers found new jobs. Resilience was found in the unusual economic diversification of recessionary sectors with booming ones.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Consumer resilience.&lt;/strong>; Growing layoffs, inflation eating away at household budgets, and falling portfolios weakening balance sheets led to predictions of a collapse in spending. But the context mattered. Balance sheets had buffers, including cash. And while individual budgets were squeezed, the total number of incomes continued to grow rapidly as hiring persisted, providing consumer strength. The aggregate downdraft has not happened.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Housing resilience.&lt;/strong>; A common fear has been that rising interest rates would kneecap the housing market — delaying construction activity, pushing down prices, or even, as some doomsayers predicted, causing another housing-centered recession. But these narratives overlooked the fact that activity remains precisely because &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2022/08/09/real-estate-housing-market-falling-prices-economic-risk/&quot;>;housing inventory is low&lt;/a>;. As a result, higher rates have tamped down — rather than choked — housing activity. Housing starts and prices dipped, and transactions fell, but they have stabilized and are rising again.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Financial system resilience.&lt;/strong>; Another common fear was that the Fed will hike until something breaks. The idea that the financial system would be the collateral damage of higher rates is not unreasonable as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/03/15/svb-collapse-financial-instability-fed-inflation-recession-finance-banks-economy-carlsson-szlezak-swartz/&quot;>;collapse of SVB demonstrated&lt;/a>;. But the risk of contagion was overestimated, while the ability of policy-makers to avert it was underestimated.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The better-than-expected outcomes share a pattern. Each concern had merit but was considered too narrowly. The idiosyncratic, contextual, and situational drivers mattered more than what historical relationships — and the models that are based on them — said about these sectors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lesson that cannot be learned often enough, it seems, is that trust in macroeconomic models remains too strong. The idiosyncrasies of the cycle call for judgment rather than precise forecasts. Meanwhile, the doomsaying is routinely amplified as the microphone is reliably passed to the gloomiest voices.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Path Ahead&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Economics often unhelpfully frames the economic cycle as “moving to equilibrium.” (The aviation analogy of a “soft landing” is similarly guilty.) In reality, we are always moving from one idiosyncratic disequilibrium to another, meaning &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/business-forecasts-are-reliably-wrong-yet-still-valuable&quot;>;executives cannot rely on forecasts&lt;/a>;. New idiosyncratic drivers will always deliver new situations that models won&#39;t readily pick up on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what could the new disequilibrium be?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Though the first stages of the soft landing are a success, ruling out a recession would be a mistake. It remains a possible, even plausible, outcome (and over time an inevitability). Monetary policy still has a foot on the brake. Real shocks can always end a cycle, particularly when growth is already slow and the economy thus more vulnerable, and financial stressors, such as bank failures, can pop up unexpectedly. Considering the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/assessing-the-current-risks-to-the-us-economy&quot;>;three types of recession&lt;/a>; risk remains indispensable, but we still view recession risk in the near term as much lower than consensus.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A re-acceleration is more likely, as a resilient economy successfully weathers this period of weak (but non-recessionary) growth. Yet, such a re-acceleration could play out in different ways – some are welcome, others are not.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Scenario 1: A Re-run of the Overshooting Economy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If demand picks up strongly and outstrips the economy&#39;s capacity (think available labor, capital, and known processes), another bout of inflation is likely. This would necessitate a fresh round of monetary tightening with all the risks we discussed above.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even so, it would &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; immediately point to an “inflation regime break” — the mistaken narrative of the last two years that the US economy was seeing a structural return of inflation. It would mean another bout of cyclical inflation that comes (and goes) with a mismatch of demand and supply.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Scenario 2: A Just-Right Economy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If demand grows in line with the economy&#39;s capacity, the expansion can plod along at acceptable growth rates without renewed inflation pressures. Monetary policy could ease from its very tight stance toward a more neutral stance — until a shift toward a new disequilibrium arises.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Scenario 3: A Better-Than-Good Economy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;We know this has arrived when the economy&#39;s capacity grows considerably faster than demand, facilitating rapid growth without concomitant cyclical inflation. While strong capital formation and strong labor participation can help facilitate this scenario to a degree, it&#39;s crux would be an acceleration of productivity growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can this happen and is it likely?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many are eager to pencil in much higher growth courtesy of ChatGPT and other applications of AI — but not so fast. The mere availability of labor does not guarantee faster productivity growth; think of tech as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/the-secret-of-productivity-growth-is-not-technology/&quot;>;just the fuel&lt;/a>;. The &lt;em>;spark&lt;/em>; typically comes in the form of tight labor markets. When firms are forced to substitute capital for labor, they tend to do more of it. When they can&#39;t hire the next worker, they transform their processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such sustained labor market tightness and its benefits are a realistic prospect. Still, leaders should remain prudent about size and speed of such gains. Big productivity gains at the macroeconomic level come gradually, not abruptly, and their size is often overestimated — as we saw in the pandemic, when analysts rushed to pencil in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/how-to-be-realistic-about-covids-impact-on-productivity-growth/&quot;>;an extra 1 percentage point of growth&lt;/a>; that did not materialize.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The benefits of such a scenario would be broader than just somewhat higher growth. Tight labor markets create real wage growth across the income distribution, and the biggest winners tend to be at the bottom of the distribution. This creates opportunities for career advancement and job creation for those who have had fewer opportunities or struggled to get on the job ladder, and it pulls into the labor market those who may have otherwise exited.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While the soft landing may be progressing with promise, it won&#39;t be an end state — a new disequilibrium will emerge. Leaders can&#39;t wait for macroeconomic certainty or stability. Instead, they must recognize that the macroeconomy will remain untamed by models — and that what matters is judgment. Gloomy headlines will persist, and economic models will offer a flat view of the world that misses out on critical context. Leaders must apply the same skills they employ each day to lead their firms through uncertainty to navigating the macroeconomy. They must avoid both overreacting to the latest piece of data and preparing for only one unchanging view the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For firms, the &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/why-firms-are-struggling-with-the-us-economys-soft-landing&quot;>;challenges of a tight economy&lt;/a>;, including margin pressure, as well as higher, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2022/06/07/inflation-interest-rates-higher-but-healthy-bcg/&quot;>;healthy interest rates&lt;/a>;, are likely here to stay — but they are preferable to the alternative of recession. Meeting these challenges head on means more capital for labor substitution, more reinvention, and more technological absorption. Each of these form the foundation of the better-than-good economic scenario.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using Sprints to Boost Your Sales Team&rsquo;s Performance]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/using-sprints-to-boost-your-sales-teams-performance]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_20_stk149282rke.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;George Doyle/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Over the last two decades, technology developers have utilized the agile methodology to work more effectively. As sales teams are stretched thin and face change initiatives and strategy shifts, using the sprints made popular by agile can help them focus on priorities that will drive results. At the heart of this is a cadence of structured, weekly meetings between the manager and the salesperson.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/using-sprints-to-boost-your-sales-teams-performance?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/using-sprints-to-boost-your-sales-teams-performance?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Fueled by a rapidly changing digital world, sales organizations are spending significant amounts of resources and energy on strategic initiatives. Whether these involve wholesale changes (eg, reorganizing the sales team or shifting to hybrid field-digital customer engagement) or less disruptive ones (eg, introducing new sales quotas or adopting new sales technologies), the primary roadblock to intended impact is the failure to achieve execution excellence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For sales teams, executing on new strategies can be quite difficult. Sales is a multifaceted job, with many choices of what to do at any moment. Demanding customers, sales managers, marketing managers, and digital nudges can push salespeople in inconsistent directions. They may choose to do tasks that are easier, such as calling on friendly accounts with modest upside, or focusing on small short-term wins rather than advancing larger longer-term opportunities. Further, salespeople can be reluctant to adopt new approaches that disrupt how they have engaged customers in the past. Results, especially with large deals, follow weeks and months after the actions salespeople take to drive those results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A solution that has helped many sales teams close execution gaps is sales sprints – time-boxed periods of one to two weeks bookended by a one-on-one meeting between the sales manager and salesperson (or account team). The idea is to break down strategies and goals into small, more manageable tasks to help sales teams stay focused and be accountable. Sales sprints have some obvious parallels to &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/embracing-agile&quot;>;agile sprints for technology development&lt;/a>; – both break down work into small segments and those involved meet frequently to monitor progress and adjust. But unlike agile sprints (which are used for projects with a beginning and an end), sales sprints are part of a regular management cadence for continually improving the processes of growing value for customers and driving sales.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sales sprints sound straightforward, and they are. However, successful implementation takes work. To be effective, sales sprints must be embedded into the operating rhythm of an organization; they can&#39;t pile on more administrative duties for sales teams. Sprints work best when the effort is supported by a centralized digital platform that connects the approach to sales management programs including pipeline management, goal setting, coaching, and rewards.&amp;nbsp;Further, sales managers must collaborate with their peers across the organization to bring insights and experiences to each sprint conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Sales Sprints in Action&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The global steel and wire manufacturer Deacero has a vast product portfolio and longstanding customer relationships. To achieve aggressive growth targets, the company wanted to move beyond a transactional “inside-out” sales process in which its sales teams focused on getting orders for what was in inventory. Leaders recognized the need for a new market-focused “outside-in” sales strategy that would rely on anticipating market trends, and proactively prioritizing accounts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deacero launched “Win the Week,” a program of sales sprints to gradually introduce new capabilities (eg, key account management, solution selling) and activities (eg, account prioritization and planning). The goal was to ensure salesperson focus on individual customer opportunities and needs. After a short training session, sales managers started using sprints to guide their salespeople to define and complete a set of customer advances to increase pipeline value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In each weekly 50-minute 1:1 meeting, usually on a Friday, the manager and salesperson discussed three questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;What happened?&lt;/strong>; For example, how did the planned actions play out last week? How did we do on pipeline progress and key result areas? What did we learn about customers and the market?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;What&#39;s next? &lt;/strong>;For example, which prospects and customers should we focus on next week? What actions should we take? What offers and value do we need to communicate? What customer advances or progress should we seek?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;How can the manager help?&lt;/strong>; For example, what could the manager do to support next week&#39;s planned efforts? What support is needed from the rest of the organization?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;Sales managers used sprint conversations to help their salespeople break down larger, more complex sales strategies (eg, increase product portfolio sales) into smaller, more manageable, opportunity-specific customer activities (eg, in vertical market A, sell solution B, to account C, by meeting with decision maker D, and leveraging value proposition E). Managers ensured that weekly schedules centered around spending a greater portion of time with accounts that demonstrated the highest growth potential. Planning conversations focused on how Deacero&#39;s full suite of products could best meet the needs of key accounts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The success of sprints with the sales team encouraged Deacero to use sprints with more teams and across organizational levels. Sales, marketing, and manufacturing executive teams began working together in bi-monthly sprint meetings to align the business towards specific market opportunities. Sales executives then worked with sales managers to break down quarterly forecasts into salesperson-based key performance indicators.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deacero supported the sprints with a leading CRM platform. The mindset and processes of the organization transformed to produce what the market needed, rather than to sell what was produced.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Results were stellar – with increased focus on customer advances, sales reps sold an average of 8% more product categories to each account. Within the first six months in the new organization, sales reps exceeded sales goals previously thought unachievable, resulting in a 16% revenue increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Why Sales Sprints Are Effective&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Here is what salespeople and sales managers say about how sales sprints drive results.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Move from strategy to execution:&lt;/strong>; “Our quarterly plans before were like checking the box. I never looked at them after I had developed them … Sprints make the plans dynamic and actionable.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Collaborate across the business:&lt;/strong>; “I&#39;ve never had this type of conversation. Marketing and sales brainstorm together to generate ideas that move the needle.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Link insights to actions:&lt;/strong>; “The past approach was too general and not relevant. Sprints help us stay informed on the market and focused on priority actions that help us achieve our sales goals.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Focus on the customer:&lt;/strong>; “The weekly game planning for specific customer decision makers helps me focus on what is important in each conversation. Things don&#39;t fall through the cracks.”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;As companies across industries such as manufacturing, technology, health care, and professional services seek to drive growth in a fast-changing digital world, they are leveraging sales sprints to connect their ever-changing strategies to execution. Further, these organizations are accelerating the success of their sprints by supporting them with cross-functional collaboration, incentive compensation plans aligned with growth strategies, and CRM dashboards that help identify sales pipeline gaps. Sales sprints are helping organizations keep strategy and execution in synch, and in turn, drive value for customers to “win&#39;” each week, quarter, and year.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Make Generative AI Greener]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-to-make-generative-ai-greener]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_19_AlexWilliam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Alex William&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Generative AI is impressive, but the hidden environmental costs and impact of these models are often overlooked. Companies can take eight steps to make these systems greener: Use existing large generative models, don&amp;#8217;t generate your own; fine-tune train existing models; use energy-conserving computational methods; use a large model only when it offers significant value; be discerning about when you use generative AI; evaluate the energy sources of your cloud provider or data center; re-use models and resources; include AI activity in your carbon monitoring.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-make-generative-ai-greener?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-make-generative-ai-greener?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;While observers have marveled at the abilities of new generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, BERT, LaMDA, GPT-3, DALL-E-2, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion, the hidden environmental costs and impact of these models are often overlooked. The development and use of these systems have been hugely energy intensive and maintaining their physical infrastructure entails power consumption. Right now, these tools are just beginning to gain mainstream traction, but it&#39;s reasonable to think that these costs are poised to grow — and dramatically so — in the near future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data center industry, which refers to a physical facility designed to store and manage information and communications technology systems, is responsible for 2–3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks&quot;>;emissions&lt;/a>;. The volume of data across the world doubles in size &lt;a href=&quot;https://rivery.io/blog/big-data-statistics-how-much-data-is-there-in-the-world/&quot;>;every two years&lt;/a>;. The data center servers that store this ever-expanding sea of information require huge amounts of energy and water (directly for cooling, and indirectly for generating non-renewable electricity) to operate computer servers, equipment, and cooling systems. These systems account for around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks&quot;>;7% of Denmark&#39;s&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/faculty-research/Energy-Smart-Electronic-Systems/Datacenter-efficiency-challenges.html&quot;>;2.8% of the United States&#39;&lt;/a>; electricity use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost all of the best-known generative AI models are generated by “hyperscale” (very large) cloud providers with thousands of servers that produce major carbon footprints; in particular, these models run on graphics processing unit (GPU) chips. These require 10–15 times the energy a traditional CPU needs because a GPU uses more transistors in the arithmetic logic units. Currently, the three main hyperscale cloud providers are Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we try to understand the environmental impact of ChatGPT through the lens of carbon footprint, we should understand the carbon footprint lifecycle of machine learning (ML) models first. That&#39;s the key to beginning to make generative AI greener through lower energy consumption.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Determines the Carbon Footprint of Generative AI Models?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;All large generative models are not alike in terms of their energy use and carbon emissions. When determining the carbon footprint of an ML model, there are three distinct values to consider:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;the carbon footprint from training the model&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;the carbon footprint from running inference (inferring or predicting outcomes using new input data, such as a prompt) with the ML model once it has been deployed, and&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;the carbon footprint required to produce all of the needed computing hardware and cloud data center capabilities.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Models with more parameters and training data generally consume more energy and generate more carbon. GPT-3, the “parent” model of ChatGPT, is at or near the top of the generative models in size. It has 175 billion model parameters and was trained on over 500 billion words of text. According to one &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2023-04-07-what-developers-need-to-know-about-generative-ai/&quot;>;research article&lt;/a>;, the recent class of generative AI models requires a ten to a hundred-fold increase in computing power to train models over the previous generation, depending on which model is involved. Thus overall demand is doubling about every six months.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Training models are the most energy-intensive components of generative AI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922&quot;>;Researchers&lt;/a>; have argued that training a “single&amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;language deep learning model” such as OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 or Google&#39;s PaLM is estimated to use&amp;nbsp;around 300&amp;nbsp;tons&amp;nbsp;of CO2 — for comparison, the average person is responsible for creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-s-top-1-of-emitters-produce-over-1000-times-more-co2-than-the-bottom-1&quot;>;around 5 tons&lt;/a>; of CO2 a year, though the average North American generates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-s-top-1-of-emitters-produce-over-1000-times-more-co2-than-the-bottom-1&quot;>;several times that amount&lt;/a>;. Other &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243&quot;>;researchers&lt;/a>; calculated that training a medium-sized generative AI model using a technique called “neural architecture search” used electricity and energy consumption equivalent to 626,000 tons of CO2 emissions — or the same as CO2 emissions as driving five average American cars through their lifetimes. Training a single BERT model (a large language model developed by Google) from scratch would require the same energy and carbon footprint as a commercial trans-Atlantic flight.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inference, or using the models to get responses to user prompts, uses less energy each session, but eventually involves many more sessions. Sometimes these models are only trained once, and then deployed to the cloud and used by millions of users for inference. In that case, deploying large deep-learning models to the cloud for inference purposes also consumes a lot of energy.&amp;nbsp;Analysts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/05/09/google-cloud-doubles-down-on-nvidia-gpus-for-inference/?sh=7aa7fce46792&quot;>;report&lt;/a>; that NVIDIA estimates that 80–90% of the energy cost of neural networks lies in ongoing inference processing after a model has been trained.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to initial training and inference usage of energy by large generative models, users and resellers of these models are increasingly employing &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-train-generative-ai-using-your-companys-data&quot;>;fine-tuning or prompt-based training&lt;/a>;. When combined with the original generative model trained on large volumes of data, fine-tuning allows prompts and answers that are tailored to an organization&#39;s specific content. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01541.pdf&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; suggests that fine-tuning training consumes considerably less energy and computing power than initial training. However, if many organizations adopt fine-tune approaches and do it often, the overall energy consumption could be quite high.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is difficult to calculate the cost of manufacturing the computers needed to run all this AI software, there is reason to believe that it is very high. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.networkworld.com/article/2229029/computer-factories-eat-way-more-energy-than-running-the-devices-they-build.html&quot;>;2011 study&lt;/a>; estimated that 70% of the energy used by a typical laptop computer is incurred during its manufacture, and that desktop computers are even higher. It is likely that the complex and powerful GPU chips and servers used to run AI models are much higher than laptops and desktops.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How to Make AI Greener&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Given all that, there is a movement to make AI modelling, deployment, and usage more environmentally sustainable. Its goal is to replace power-hungry approaches with more suitable and environmentally-conscious replacements. Change is needed from both vendors and users to make AI algorithms green so that their utility can be widely deployed without harm to the environment. Generative models in particular, given their high energy consumption, need to become greener before they become more pervasive. We know of several different ways in which AI and generative AI can move in this direction, which we describe below.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; Use existing large generative models, don&#39;t generate your own. &lt;/strong>;There are already many providers of large language and image models, and there will be more. Creating and training them requires enormous amounts of energy. There is little need for companies other than large vendors or cloud providers to generate their own large models from scratch. They already have access to the needed training data and massive volumes of computing capability in the cloud, so they don&#39;t need to acquire it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; Fine-tune train existing models. &lt;/strong>;If a company wants a generative model trained on its own content, it shouldn&#39;t start from scratch to train a model but rather refine an existing model. Fine-tuning and prompt training on specific content domains consume much less energy than training new large models from scratch. It can also provide more value to many businesses than generically-trained models. This should be the primary focus for companies wishing to adopt generative models for their own content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; Use energy-conserving computational methods.&lt;/strong>; Another approach to reducing generative AI energy consumption is to use less computationally expensive approaches such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinyml.org/&quot;>;TinyML&lt;/a>; to process the data. The TinyML framework allows users to run ML models on small, low-powered edge devices like microcontrollers with low bandwidth requirements (no need to send the data to the server for processing). While general CPUs consume an average of 70 watts of power and GPUs consume 400 watts of power, a tiny microcontroller consumes just a few hundred microwatts — a thousand times less power — to process the data locally without sending it to data servers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; Use a large model only when it offers significant value.&lt;/strong>; It is important for data scientists and developers to know where the model provides value. If the usage of a 3x more power-hungry system increases the accuracy of a model by just 1–3% then it is not worth the extra energy consumption. More broadly, machine learning and artificial intelligence are not always required to solve a problem. Developers need to first do research and analysis of multiple alternative solutions and select an approach according to the findings. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://montrealethics.ai/publications/&quot;>;Montreal AI Ethics Institute&lt;/a>;, for example, is actively working on this problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Be discerning about when you use generative AI. &lt;/strong>;Machine learning and NLP tools are revolutionary for medical-related health problems and prediction. They are great for predicting natural hazards such as tsunamis, earthquakes, etc. These are useful applications, but tools just for generating blog posts or creating amusing stories may not be the best use for these computation-heavy tools. They may be depleting the earth&#39;s health more than they are helping its people. If a company is employing generative AI for content creation, it should try to ensure that the models are used only when necessary or to reduce other computing costs, which should also reduce their overall computing budgets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Evaluate the energy sources of your cloud provider or data center. &lt;/strong>;AI (and software in general) carbon intensity can be minimized by deploying models in regions that are able to use environmentally friendly power resources and are carbon friendly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mlco2.github.io/impact/#publish&quot;>;This practice&lt;/a>; has shown a 75% reduction in operational emissions. For example, a model trained and operating in the US may use energy from fossil fuels, but the same model can be run in Quebec where the primary energy source is hydroelectric. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/clean-energy-projects-begin-to-power-google-data-centers&quot;>;Google&lt;/a>; has recently started to build a $735 million clean energy data center in Quebec and plans to shift to 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. It also offers a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/active_assist_sustainability_spotlight.pdf&quot;>;Carbon Sense Suite&lt;/a>;” to help companies reduce energy consumption in their cloud workloads. Users of cloud providers can monitor the companies&#39; announcements about when and how they have deployed carbon-neutral or zero-carbon energy sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; Re-use models and resources&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;.&lt;/strong>; Just like other materials, tech can be reused. Open-source models can be used rather than training new ones. Recycling can lower the impact of carbon-producing AI practices. Raw materials can be extracted to make newer generations of the latest laptops, processors, hard drives, and much more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; Include AI activity in your carbon monitoring.&lt;/strong>; Carbon monitoring practices need to be adopted by all research labs, AI vendors, and AI-using firms to know what is their carbon footprint. They also need to publicize their footprint numbers in order for their customers to make intelligent decisions about doing AI-related business with them. The calculation of GHG emissions is dependent on the data sets of the data suppliers and processing firms such as research labs and AI-based service providers such as OpenAI. From the inception of the ideas to the infrastructure that will be utilized to gain research results, all need to be following green AI approaches.

From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/13/heatwave-california-arizona-florida-texas-records/&quot;>;coast-to-coast heat domes&lt;/a>; to eponymous heatwaves like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66183069&quot;>;Cerberus&lt;/a>;, extreme heat events may be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/climate/climate-change-extreme-weather.html&quot;>;new norm&lt;/a>;. And companies have more than one reason to be worried.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.website-files.com/5df9172583d7eec04960799a/618872a58d35f2643cbcaef2_BX9770_ESG_Critical%20industries%20have%20substantial%20exposure_7Nov2021.pdf&quot;>;2021 Moody&#39;s report&lt;/a>; identified heat stress as a physical risk that impacts almost every sector. Beyond rising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/heat-waves-can-create-stormy-economic-weather-n894311&quot;>;cooling costs&lt;/a>; and shifting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/disney-world-universal-orlando-attendance-down/index.html&quot;>;consumer demand&lt;/a>;, heat stress represents a major threat to companies because of its effects on human health. Heat waves can cause exhaustion, cramps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/extreme-heat-contributes-to-worsening-mental-healt#:~:text=Extreme%20heat%20has%20been%20associated,with%20an%20increase%20in%20suicide.&quot;>;worsening mental health&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/manage-diabetes-heat.html&quot;>;diabetic complications&lt;/a>;, and even stroke. There is considerable risk in any population, and this includes your company&#39;s workforce.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to direct health costs of heat waves, the World Health Organization cites one of the most important economic impacts as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240057906&quot;>;lost productivity&lt;/a>;. Two percent of total working hours are projected to be lost each year due to heat stress at work, representing more than $&lt;a href=&quot;https://futureearth.org/publications/issue-briefs-2/heatwaves/&quot;>;4 trillion annually&lt;/a>; by 2030. So when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/13/heatwave-california-arizona-florida-texas-records/&quot;>;100 million Americans&lt;/a>; are under a heat alert, that could mean up to one in three employees – or more, depending on your company&#39;s geography — are at risk at a given time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keeping your cool when extreme heat hits your workforce isn&#39;t easy, but insights from health care can help. As a physician working for an international organization advising corporate leaders, I&#39;m seeing employers looking to deepen their understanding of heat stress to adopt new best practices that safeguard their people &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; their business. Here are six actions to consider in navigating this challenge.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Take a preventative approach.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Employers should start by educating employees on what heat stress is, how it affects their health and safety, and how it can be prevented.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any warm environment, the human body relies on its ability to get rid of excess heat to maintain a healthy internal body temperature. This happens naturally through sweating and increased blood flow to the skin. If this doesn&#39;t happen quickly enough, body temperature rises and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehs.research.uiowa.edu/occupational/heat-stress&quot;>;heat stress&lt;/a>; can occur.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Workers may experience symptoms including thirst, irritability, &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22440-heat-rashprickly-heat#:~:text=A%20heat%20rash%20is%20an,in%20hot%20and%20humid%20climates.&quot;>;heat rash&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21480-heat-exhaustion#:~:text=Heat%20exhaustion%20happens%20when%20your,resting%20in%20a%20cool%20place.&quot;>;heat exhaustion&lt;/a>;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21812-heatstroke#:~:text=A%20note%20from%20Cleveland%20Clinic,loss%20of%20consciousness%2C%20among%20others.&quot;>;heat stroke&lt;/a>; which includes brain dysfunction such as slurred speech, confusion, disorientation or even coma. Heat stress can also impair &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facilities.udel.edu/safety/5224/&quot;>;fine motor s&lt;/a>;kills, such as typing, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1518/001872007X230226&quot;>;reduces capacity&lt;/a>; to process task-relevant information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During heat waves, workers may experience a combination of two kinds of heat-related illness: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC164365/&quot;>;exertional heat illness&lt;/a>;” due to physical activity and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/582911&quot;>;environmental heat illness&lt;/a>;” due to ambient conditions like heat and humidity. The latter is especially common in &lt;a href=&quot;https://climatekids.nasa.gov/heat-islands/#:~:text=An%20urban%20heat%20island%20occurs,environment%20absorb%20and%20hold%20heat.&quot;>;urban heat islands&lt;/a>; where temperatures in a city are much warmer than nearby rural areas.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, heat stress can lead to illness, hospitalization, and even death. Given the potential severity, upstream solutions are critical. An effective heat-related illness prevention program should be incorporated in your organization&#39;s broader health and safety program and align with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/safety-management&quot;>;Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#39;s&lt;/a>; (OSHA) recommended practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the first few days in a heat wave, employers should encourage workers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/UserFiles/works/pdfs/2017-126.pdf&quot;>;hydrate&lt;/a>;, take frequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/UserFiles/works/pdfs/2017-127.pdf&quot;>;breaks&lt;/a>;, and quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3154.pdf&quot;>;identify&lt;/a>; any heat-related symptoms.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Know how hot is too hot — and for whom.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Workplace heat exposure involves a combination of factors. To determine if heat stress is too high, employers need to assess the:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Environment (including conditions such as humidity, sunlight, and airflow)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Job (for example, whether it involves physical activity or protective gear)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Worker (assessing common individual risk factors, such as age, pre-existing health conditions, and lifestyle)&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The most accurate way to measure environmental heat impact on body temperature is with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/environment/wet-bulb-globe-temperature/&quot;>;wet bulb globe temperature&lt;/a>; (WBGT) meter, which incorporates temperature, humidity, sunlight, and air movement into a single measurement. OSHA provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure/hazards#environmentalheat&quot;>;guidance&lt;/a>; for use and interpretation of results. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weather.gov/ama/heatindex#:~:text=The%20heat%20index%2C%20also%20known,combined%20with%20the%20air%20temperature.&quot;>;heat index&lt;/a>; focused on temperature and humidity alone can provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25616731/&quot;>;helpful surrogate data&lt;/a>; in certain circumstances.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Job-related physical activity can be estimated using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure/hazards#metabolicheat&quot;>;metabolic heat and workload tables&lt;/a>; with workload classified from light (eg, sitting or standing) to very heavy (eg, intense activity). Employers should also be aware of whether workers&#39; clothing increases risk and recognize jobs in hot environments such as firefighting, farming, construction work, mining, and factory work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Individual worker factors can also indicate unique risks whereby different employees react to heat in different ways. This includes vulnerable populations, such as those who are 65 years of age or older, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/repro/heat.html&quot;>;pregnant&lt;/a>;, have certain types of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes or use certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-heat-and-how-it-affects-medication/&quot;>;medications&lt;/a>;. Gender differences are important to consider as well. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/heat/heat_health.html#:~:text=The%20National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational,less%20heat%20tolerant%20than%20men.&quot;>;several studies&lt;/a>; showing women are less heat tolerant than men.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Maximize indoor thermal comfort.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/thermal_comfort.html&quot;>;Thermal comfort&lt;/a>; for office work is important for well-being and productivity. Too warm, and employees feel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288297978_Effects_of_thermal_discomfort_on_performance_of_office_work_and_physiological_behaviours&quot;>;fatigue or experience mood disturbance&lt;/a>;. Too cold, and attention can &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23443576/&quot;>;drift&lt;/a>; with employees feeling restless or distracted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maintain consistent thermal conditions in the office environment. Even minor deviation may cause stress and affect performance and safety. Workers already under stress are less tolerant of uncomfortable conditions, so temperature becomes particularly important for high-demand jobs and during periods of high-stress crisis response.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Optimize temperature to match recommended guidelines. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/hvac.html&quot;>;Standard&lt;/a>; recommends temperature ranges of 68.5°F to 75°F in the winter, and 75°F to 80.5°F in the summer. The difference in seasonal temperature ranges is largely due to clothing selection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some situations, legislation may have specific requirements and it is important for employers to meet these. Beyond federal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure/standards&quot;>;OSHA standards&lt;/a>;, some states have adopted OSHA-approved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/stateplans/&quot;>;state plans&lt;/a>; that cover hazards not otherwise addressed. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mn.gov/admin/assets/heat_stress_guide_tcm36-207189.pdf&quot;>;Minnesota&lt;/a>; regulates indoor air temperatures in places of employment and varies requirements based on intensity level of work. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opb.org/article/2022/05/11/oregon-heat-wildfire-smoke-farmwork-laborer-rules/&quot;>;Oregon&lt;/a>; recently adopted some of America&#39;s most protective heat rules for workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recommended temperature ranges meet the needs of at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Conferences/Specialty%20Conferences/2018%20Building%20Performance%20Analysis%20Conference%20and%20SimBuild/Papers/C036.pdf&quot;>;80% of individuals&lt;/a>; but some employees may feel uncomfortable even if these values are met. Temperature needs and preferences vary greatly, and there is no one temperature that can satisfy everyone. Additional measures may be required.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Difference in thermal comfort may be due to indoor climate regulations being based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/energy-consumption-in-buildings-and-female-thermal-demand&quot;>;standard values in men&lt;/a>; and can impact women&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727108363/how-office-temperature-affects-cognitive-performance&quot;>;cognitive performance&lt;/a>;. In general, women prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132306000242&quot;>;higher ambient temperature&lt;/a>; at home and in the workplace. That being said, when it comes to heat waves, women are generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935122013135&quot;>;more vulnerable&lt;/a>; to high temperatures. And this vulnerability increases after menopause when &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26674572/&quot;>;lack of estrogen production&lt;/a>; makes it more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935122013135&quot;>;difficult to adapt&lt;/a>; to sudden temperature increases.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given thermal comfort is determined by a number of factors beyond temperature, such as activity levels, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/solar-gain#:~:text=Solar%20gain%20(or%20solar%20heat,results%20from%20absorbed%20solar%20radiation.&quot;>;solar gain&lt;/a>;, and air flow, optimizing for those can help. For example, enhance access to desk fans or working areas of greater air flow for menopausal women experiencing hot flashes. Other options to make the workplace more comfortable include changes to workload and schedules. For example, scheduling work during off-peak temperature hours or shorter shifts with frequent rest breaks.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Tailor training and safety for outdoor workers.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Provide a heat stress training program before hot outdoor work begins. Training may include proper use of heat-protective clothing and equipment, effects of drugs and alcohol on heat stress tolerance, immediate reporting of signs or symptoms of heat-related illness (in oneself or coworkers), and procedures for responding to these symptoms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Supervisors should be provided with additional training. This may include monitoring alert reports, responding to hot weather advisories, procedures to follow when a worker has signs or symptoms of heat-related illness (including contacting emergency medical services where appropriate), encouraging hydration, and reinforcing rest breaks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond training, employers should reduce workplace heat stress using engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include changes to work-setting design that reduce exposure to heat, such as the use of reflective or heat-absorbing shielding. Administrative controls are changes to tasks or schedules that reduce heat stress, for example, limiting time in the heat, increasing recovery time in cool shaded areas, increasing the number of workers per task, or providing adequate cool, potable water. It is also important to limit heat burden while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and to explore auxiliary cooling systems, like water-cooled garments or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6997718/&quot;>;cooling vests&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additional strategies include creating a multi-disciplinary working group (eg, cohort of workers, qualified health care provider, safety manager), instituting medical and self-monitoring programs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7374462/&quot;>;wearable monitors&lt;/a>; to estimate workload (eg, heart rate sensors), and a buddy system where workers observe each other for signs of heat-related illness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Practice acclimatization.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Individuals can adapt to higher temperatures through repeated exposures, for example, via increased sweating efficiency. This is particularly relevant for outdoor workers during rapid onset heat waves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers should develop acclimatization schedules in hot conditions that gradually increase worker exposure time and physical demands. This is typically done in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/userfiles/works/pdfs/2017-124.pdf&quot;>;step-wise process&lt;/a>; over a seven to 14 day period. New workers will need more time to acclimatize than those with pre-existing exposure, and absence for a week or more may require re-acclimatization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of adaptation for each worker is relative to physical fitness and heat stress experienced. It is also important to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33205218/&quot;>;gender differences&lt;/a>;, as women require greater intensity, frequency, and duration of heat exposure for adaptation. Given related literature primarily focuses on males, current guidelines may not account for physiological differences and may require employers to explore &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10289939/&quot;>;new frameworks&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. Adopt a long-term heat-health action plan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As extreme heat continues to worsen, employers must adopt a long-term approach. The World Health Organization&#39;s guidance for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789289071918&quot;>;heat-health action plans&lt;/a>; offers particularly useful principles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to how airlines track weather for flight planning, employers should tap into accurate and timely temperature alert systems that trigger weather-related warnings, determine thresholds for action, and communicate risks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalnews.ca/news/8738567/summer-air-travel-heat-wave-impact/&quot;>;Establishing links&lt;/a>; with local public health systems and emergency response services also helps.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You should also have a communication plan that includes what to communicate, to whom, and when. Recognize that you may be managing multiple environmental health issues simultaneously — for example, extreme heat and &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires&quot;>;air quality issues&lt;/a>; related to wildfires — and be sure to streamline messaging. Avoid overwhelming employees with multiple non-synchronized communications. Also tailor your messaging for local areas.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your heat-health action plan should also include short and medium-term heat relief approaches, such as reduction in indoor heat exposure, enhanced outdoor worker protections, and a care strategy for vulnerable populations. Your long-term approach should include strategic urban planning to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90653389/how-an-ancient-design-technique-could-help-us-survive-extreme-heat-no-ac-needed&quot;>;building design&lt;/a>;, location, and transit access points that can reduce heat exposure for employees in their end-to-end journey from home to work and back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Track efficacy of your heat-health strategy over time. Implement real-time surveillance and evaluation particularly for outdoor workers, and don&#39;t forget oversight of indoor environment controls. Monitor for quality and consistency to make sure you are meeting ASHRAE recommendations and local legislation requirements. Engaging safety checklists and standard best practices found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://airlines.iata.org/2014/12/08/severe-weather-warning&quot;>;airline industry&lt;/a>; can be especially helpful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Extreme heat can greatly impair the performance and health of your greatest assets — your people. As these high temperatures become more commonplace, employers must seize the opportunity to protect their employees today and into the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
