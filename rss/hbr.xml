&lt;span>;&lt;p>;平台向 AI 的转变正在顺利进行。虽然它有望改变工作方式并赋予组织竞争优势，但如果没有拥抱好奇心、失败和学习的文化，就不可能实现这些好处。领导者处于独特的地位，可以在当今的组织内培育这种文化，以便让他们的团队为未来的成功做好准备。当与人工智能的能力相结合时，这种文化将为每个人开启更美好的工作未来。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href =&quot;/2023/06/3-steps-to-prepare-your-culture-for-ai?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3- Steps-to-prepare-your-culture-for-ai?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;作为商业领袖，今天我们发现自己处于一个非常熟悉的地方：陌生。正如我们引导我们的团队转向远程和灵活工作一样，我们现在正处于另一个巨大转变的边缘：人工智能。就像向灵活工作的转变一样，组织接受人工智能首先取决于文化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作的节奏和数量呈指数级增长，我们都在其重压下挣扎。 。领导者和员工都渴望人工智能能够减轻负担。这是我们的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work&quot;>;2023 年工作趋势指数&lt;/a>;的关键要点，该调查对 31 个国家/地区的 31,000 人进行了调查，并分析了 Microsoft 365 中数万亿个聚合生产力信号以及 LinkedIn 上的劳动力市场趋势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接受调查的员工中近三分之二告诉我们他们没有足够的时间或精力来完成他们的工作。我们在报告中将这种消耗的原因确定为数字债务：数据、电子邮件和聊天的涌入已经超出了我们跟上的能力。如今，员工将近 60% 的时间用于沟通，只有 40% 的时间用于创造和创新。在创造力成为新生产力的世界中，数字债务不仅是一种不便，而且是一种负担。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能承诺通过让员工专注于最有意义的工作来解决这种负担。根据我们的研究，提高生产力、简化重复性任务和提高员工福祉是领导者希望从人工智能中获得的三大好处。值得注意的是，由于担心人工智能将取代工作岗位，减少员工数量被排在最后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成为人工智能驱动的组织将需要我们以全新的方式工作。作为领导者，我们今天可以采取三个步骤，让我们的文化为人工智能驱动的未来做好准备：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;选择好奇而不是恐惧&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;人工智能标志着人类与人类之间的新互动模式电脑。到目前为止，我们与计算机交互的方式类似于我们与计算器交互的方式：我们提出问题或给出指示，然后计算机提供答案。但有了人工智能，计算机将更像是副驾驶。我们需要共同发展一种新的化学反应，学习何时以及如何提出问题以及事实核查答复的重要性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;恐惧是对变化的自然反应，因此员工可以理解对人工智能对他们的工作意味着什么感到有些不确定。我们的研究发现，虽然 49% 的员工担心人工智能会取代他们的工作，但人工智能的前景大于威胁：70% 的员工非常愿意委托人工智能来减轻他们的工作量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在恐惧中行动很少能得到好处。通过培养好奇心文化，我们可以让员工了解人工智能的工作原理，包括其功能和缺点。这种理解始于第一手经验。鼓励员工通过（安全可靠地）尝试新的&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/reinventing-productivity/&quot;>;AI 工具&lt;/a>;（例如由 AI 驱动的&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&amp;amp;OCID=MY0291&amp;amp;q=Bing+AI&amp;amp;showconv=1&quot;>;搜索&lt;/a>;、智能写作帮助或智能日历，以仅举几个例子。由于每个角色和职能都有不同的方式来使用人工智能并从中受益，因此要求他们在熟悉这些工具后重新思考人工智能如何改进或转变流程。从那里，员工可以开始解锁新的工作方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;拥抱失败&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;人工智能将改变几乎所有工作，几乎每种工作模式都可以从某种程度的人工智能增强或自动化。作为领导者，现在是鼓励我们的团队将创造力重新构想工作的时候了，采用边测试边学习的策略来寻找人工智能能够最好地帮助满足业务需求的方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能赢了。不可能每次都正确，但即使是错误的，它也是&lt;em>;有用&lt;/em>;的错误。它至少能让你从一张白纸向前迈出一步，这样你就可以直接进入审阅、编辑或增强的批判性思维工作。学习这些新的工作模式并确定哪些流程需要改变以及如何改变需要时间。但是，如果我们创造一种文化，将实验和学习视为进步的先决条件，我们就会更快地实现这一目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为领导者，我们有责任为失败创造合适的环境，以便我们的团队能够成功。人们有权进行实验，以发现人工智能如何融入他们的工作流程。根据我的经验，这包括庆祝胜利以及分享经验教训，以帮助彼此避免浪费时间学习相同的教训两次。无论是正式还是非正式的方式，为人们分享知识创造空间——例如，通过在部门内众包一本快速指南，或者将人工智能技巧作为每月全体员工会议的常设议程项目。敏捷运营将成为人工智能驱动的组织的基本原则。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;成为万事通&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我经常听到这样的担忧：人工智能将成为拐杖，提供捷径和解决方法最终会削弱创新和参与度。在我看来，人工智能的潜力远不止于此，对于那些深思熟虑地使用它的人来说，它将成为一种竞争优势。这些人将成为您最敬业、最具创新精神的员工。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您从人工智能中获得的价值取决于您投入的价值。简单的问题将得到简单的答案。但复杂的、发人深省的问题将带来更复杂的分析和更大的想法。价值将从拥有所有正确答案的员工转移到知道如何提出正确问题的员工。未来的组织将重视能够对人工智能生成的内容进行有效推理的分析思考者和问题解决者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在 Microsoft，我们相信博学多才的心态将使我们走得更远。一位无所不知的人。虽然使用人工智能的学习曲线可能令人望而生畏，但它是一种必须随着时间的推移而增强的肌肉——我们今天就应该开始加强它。当我与领导者谈论如何在公司和团队中实现这一目标时，我告诉他们三件事：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;建立护栏，帮助人们安全、负责任地进行实验。您鼓励员工使用哪些工具，哪些数据适合输入，哪些数据不适合输入。他们在事实核查、审查和编辑方面需要遵循哪些准则？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;学习使用人工智能需要是一个持续的过程，而不是一次性的培训。将学习机会融入您的业务节奏，让员工了解最新资源。例如，一个团队可能会在周五下午安排学习时间，而另一个团队则每月安排“办公时间”进行人工智能问答和故障排除。并超越传统课程或资源进行思考。点对点知识共享（例如午餐和学习或数字热线）如何发挥作用，以便人们可以互相学习？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;拥抱变革管理的需求。有意和有计划对于成功采用人工智能至关重要。确定成功的目标和指标，并选择人工智能冠军或试点项目负责人来帮助实现愿景。在人工智能方面，不同的职能和学科会有不同的需求和挑战，但当我们都转向新的工作方式时，一个共同的需求将是结构和支持。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;平台向人工智能的转变正在顺利进行。虽然它有望改变工作方式并为组织带来竞争优势，但如果没有拥抱好奇心、失败和学习的文化，就不可能实现这些好处。作为领导者，我们拥有独特的优势，可以在当今的组织内培育这种文化，以便让我们的团队为未来的成功做好准备。当与人工智能的能力相结合时，这种文化将为每个人带来更美好的工作未来。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>;

close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;摘要。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;随着反 LGBTQ+ 情绪和立法的急剧增加，在美国和世界其他国家，善意的高管与其选民之间的脱节日益严重。正如 LGBTQ+ 员工和社区、民权倡导者以及具有社会意识的消费者希望雇主采取行动一样，许多公司正在收回之前的支持。然而，大多数消费者仍然期望企业通过行动履行其承诺，并继续奖励那些这样做的公司的支持和惠顾。在充满敌意的社会和政治环境中，公司必须将其行动植根于组织的宗旨、价值主张和价值观，以长期将支持 LGBTQ+ 的支持融入到组织的身份中。作者建议采取三个步骤来实现这一目标：1) 将 LGBTQ+ 包容性与您的客户群、运营和价值观联系起来； 2) 协作设计有利于 LGBTQ+ 社区的举措； 3) 采取有目的的立场并捍卫它。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;“该组织长期以来一直是 LGBTQ+ 社区的盟友，”一位高管指出。 “但最近，鉴于目前的政治气候，即使在五年前做或说也不会引起争议的事情现在比以前受到了更多的阻力。我们如何表达我们的关心？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这个组织声称它是我们社区的盟友，”一名员工说道。 “但最近，面对对 LGBTQ+ 人群日益增长的敌意，我们已经到了崩溃的边缘，而我们的领导人却什么也没说。他们为什么不保护我们？是因为他们从来没有关心过吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一名 DEI 策略师，我经常从与我合作的组织中的人员那里听到此类评论。他们并不罕见。这些情绪表明，随着企业参与 LGBTQ+ 事业的不断发展，善意的高管与 LGBTQ+ 员工、消费者和社区之间的脱节日益严重。消费者和员工越来越要求企业遵守&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/06/were-entering-the-age-of-corporate-social-justice&quot;>;更高的标准&lt;/a>;，这使得他们的惠顾取决于品牌的内部表现LGBTQ+ 人群的外部待遇与他们华丽的营销相一致，并呼吁他们进行&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a43713768/rainbow-washing/&quot;>;彩虹清洗&lt;/a>;他们失败了。与此同时，&lt;a href=&quot;https://acleddata.com/2022/11/23/update-fact-sheet-anti-lgbt-mobilization-in-the-united-states/&quot;>;戏剧性峰值&lt; /a>; 在反 LGBTQ+ 社会和政治运动中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/may-anti-trans-legislative-risk-map&quot;>;倒退法律的通过&lt;/a >;、仇恨言论和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/07/lgbtq-violence-protest-glendale-unified-school-district&quot;>;身体暴力行为&lt;/a>; 在美国，伴随着世界各地右翼极端主义、威权主义和反民主信仰的相关增加，推动了新一波&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/ newshour/nation/online-right-wing-extremists-amp-up-anti-lgbtq-rhetoric-during-pride-month&quot;>;针对 LGBTQ+ 社区以及支持他们的品牌和雇主的活动&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些因素的结合意味着，现在，正如 LGBTQ+ 员工和社区、民权倡导者以及具有社会意识的消费者希望雇主采取行动支持他们之前支持 LGBTQ+ 的承诺一样，一些雇主&lt;a href=&quot; https://nypost.com/2023/05/04/anheuser-busch-ceo-disavows-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-ads/&quot;>;否认他们的 LGBTQ+ 合作伙伴关系&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.npr.org/2023/05/24/1177963864/target-pride-month-lgbtq-products-threats&quot;>;删除骄傲主题商品&lt;/a>;，以及&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/06/23/starbucks-union-workers-are-striking-after-accusing-firm-of-banning-pride-decorations/?sh=371a510a511b&quot;>;禁止骄傲装饰&lt;/ a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那些担心现在采取行动支持 LGBTQ+ 社区“风险太大”的领导人可以放心，因为他们知道绝大多数消费者 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc .com/2023/06/01/consumers-say-companies-should-support-lgbtq-community-glaad-survey.html&quot;>;根据 GLAAD 最近的一项调查，70%&lt;/a>; — 希望他们采取通过支持 LGBTQ+ 人群，明确站在公民权利、公平和包容方面。还有有据可查的商业利益：绝大多数消费者，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/workers-consumers-prefer-pro-lgbtq-brands-glaad -study.html&quot;>;无论他们本身是否是 LGBTQ+&lt;/a>;，都更有可能从支持 LGBTQ+ 的公司购买产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管有这些明显的好处，领导者可能仍然不确定未来如何-证明他们在敌对的社会和政治环境中对 LGBTQ+ 包容的承诺。答案在于将他们的行动植根于组织的宗旨、价值主张和价值观，从而将支持 LGBTQ+ 的支持长期融入到组织的身份中。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.将 LGBTQ+ 包容性与您的客户群、运营和价值观联系起来。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;虽然大多数消费者现在期望品牌在社会和政治问题上采取立场，但这并不像发布一次性社交媒体帖子或公然以利润为动机的营销活动那么容易。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/brands-creating-change/&quot;>;关于社会问题的品牌传播研究&lt;/a>;发现，消费者认为品牌最适合采取当涉及到品牌价值观、影响业务或影响品牌员工或消费者时，您应采取何种立场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面向未来的 LGBTQ+ 包容性需要积极主动地了解 LGBTQ+ 群体的需求，以及您的 LGBTQ+ 群体的需求。非 LGBTQ+ 客户以及客户对 LGBTQ+ 问题的看法。然后，您需要了解您的运营如何影响 LGBTQ+ 社区，以找到独特的重叠部分和采取行动的机会。如果您有 LGBTQ+ 客户，您可能会开发满足他们需求的产品。如果您与 LGBTQ+ 内容创作者或艺术家合作，您可能会利用他们的才能实现互惠互利。如果您有 LGBTQ+ 用户或客户，您可能会征求他们的反馈以开发更具包容性的产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了锁定这些努力，您需要根据组织根深蒂固的使命、目的来重新构建它们和值。如果您的组织坚定地致力于维护尊严，您可以将 LGBTQ+ 包容性作为保护所有客户和员工尊严的重要组成部分。如果您的组织坚定地致力于勇敢，您可以将 LGBTQ+ 包容性定义为承认勇敢反对迫害，并作为一个组织勇敢地发言。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总而言之，这意味着组织能够&lt;a href= &quot;https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/people/social-responsibility/lgbt-inclusion.html&quot;>;明确阐述&lt;/a>; LGBTQ+ 包容性的地位，因为它与其核心目的、价值相关主张和价值观将为他们的努力奠定坚实的基础，当政治风向转变时，这种基础不太可能动摇。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.协作设计有利于 LGBTQ+ 社区的举措。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;尽管品牌的骄傲月活动已经变得无处不在，但仅仅将产品交给 LGBTQ+ 影响者并让他们阅读剧本并不能特别引起 LGBTQ+ 人群的共鸣。如果做得不好，它可能会被认为是一种肤浅的宣传噱头，旨在从 LGBTQ+ 群体中获利，但却没有给他们带来真正的好处。此外，当这些举措似乎与组织的目的或价值主张脱节时，您的非 LGBTQ+ 选民可能会觉得您的社会立场是武断的——这为那些可能对 LGBTQ+ 人群存有偏见的人批评您的立场“打开了大门”。告诉他们应该怎么想。”&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你可以实际解决的问题&lt;em>;不是&lt;/em>;消费者、员工或其他人持有的信念范围而是社会事业、组织目的和选民需求的一致性。当举措或合作伙伴关系同时​​满足这三个方面时（例如，由客户需求驱动并根据客户意见设计的骄傲月举措，旨在解决与企业核心服务相关的未满足需求），即使选民不属于直接以社区为中心的社区，他们可能会支持这一举措，或者在最坏的情况下，对这一举措持中立态度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顾问在 30 分钟的头脑风暴中吐出的机会主义营销策略已经过时了。设计&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2022/10/11/how-to-promote-inclusion--virgin-atlantic-removes-gendered-uniforms/?sh=74cb1f3355dd&quot;在这方面>;成功的举措&lt;/a>;需要与 LGBTQ+ 社区内外的成员进行深入合作，以确保该举措为目标社区创造价值，使其与组织的宗旨和身份保持一致，并测试它是否能够实现以预期的方式登陆观众。越多的三方成员能够推动并告知这一过程（无论是通过顾问委员会、焦点小组还是其他参与方法），这些举措就越有可能成功满足未满足的需求、创造价值并引起共鸣。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;强>;3。采取有目的的立场并捍卫它。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一旦您了解了社区的需求以及您的组织可获得的机会，就可以在您的品牌的全力支持下采取果断且有目的的行动。对于您发起的每一项倡议和活动，请讲述一个故事，说明并加强您所倡导的社会事业、组织的宗旨和选民的需求之间的联系。我们的目标是让任何熟悉您品牌的人都会说：“当然，他们会支持这一事业。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您的支持 LGBTQ+ 的举措遭到批评者的攻击，无论是反对者，该怎么办？通过抵制、社交媒体活动，甚至当面恐吓？执行将包容性举措与组织的宗旨、价值主张、核心价值观和选民需求保持一致的步骤并不是为了防止批评，而是为了为此做好准备。以这种方式准备，为领导者提供了面对批评时坚强站起来并做出回应所需的一切：“我们在与全球客户和员工社区的对话中设计了这一举措，并相信它不仅庆祝骄傲月，而且体现了我们坚定的信念并进一步推进了我们的核心使命。我们很自豪能够产生这种影响，并邀请您详细了解为什么这一举措对我们很重要。虽然如果您觉得我们没有达到目标，我们会提出尊重的不同意见，但我们不会容忍针对我们的团队成员或其他客户的骚扰或暴力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，组织仍然有可能犯错并撤回他们的倡议并道歉。但如果他们这样做了，那是因为他们在与自己的目的、价值主张和价值观保持一致、了解其选民和满足他们的需求的过程中犯了错误，而不是因为他们受到暴力威胁的压力。&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;使用此方法作为试金石。随着社会格局的变化，品牌、组织和领导者面临的期望也会发生变化。今天的“最佳实践”很可能在十年、五年甚至一年后变得无效，甚至适得其反。您的 DEI、ESG 和其他与社会问题相关的举措应该与时俱进，但您的承诺力度不应与时俱进。为了保持和加强员工、客户和其他成员对组织的信任，请使用这种目的和价值驱动的方法作为创建、重新审视和修改您的计划的试金石。在行动中，所需要做的就是回答以下问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;这个问题如何影响我们现有的目标以及我们服务的选民？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;对此的立场如何问题强化了我们现有的目标，并使我们的选民受益？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我们的选民希望我们如何在这个问题上采取行动，以我们的目标为中心并为他们创造价值？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p >;回答这些问题的一个后果是，您的组织最终不会对每个社会问题都采取立场，也不会以相同的程度参与每个事业或当前事件。它甚至可能因其在这些情况下的不作为而受到批评。但当它确实采取立场时，它将与其目的、价值主张、价值观以及员工、客户和其他选民保持密切一致。当它采取行动时，它将充分利用其组织身份和资源，即使面对阻力也不会动摇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最新一波反 LGBTQ+ 敌意浪潮令人震惊，但如果您的组织坚持不懈，坚定不移地践行其宗旨、运营及其服务对象，您将在一年中的每个月都恪守对 LGBTQ+ 包容的承诺。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div >; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;财政年度结束时到 2022 年，欧洲消费品巨头联合利华 (Unilever PLC) 的市净率 (P/B) 将为 6。其印度子公司印度斯坦联合利华 (Hindustan Unilever) 的这一数字是这个数字的两倍，为 12 人。这种差异并不是因为印度子公司是一家年轻的或小公司，相反，印度子公司是一家拥有 90 年历史、市值 760 亿美元的公司。这也不是一个孤立的例子。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总部位于瑞士的全球最大的食品和饮料公司巨头雀巢公司的市账率为 6，而其印度子公司的市账率为 6。高达82； 3M美国公司的P/B为4.2，其印度子公司的P/B为12.7；全球特种化学品领先企业巴斯夫的德国母公司的市账率仅为 1，而其印度子公司的市账率为 4；重工业龙头企业西门子的德国母公司的市账率为 2，而其印度子公司的市账率为 10。这些差异是如此之大，以至于在某些情况下，印度子公司的独立价值可能高于母公司。 &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>; &lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;为什么母公司与其印度子公司的市盈率存在如此大的差距？因为当母公司在本土市场陷入困境时，印度企业拥有更好的增长前景、更高的盈利能力和更高效的资产利用。这就是为什么每个跨国公司都必须制定印度战略，否则就会错过当今世界上最有前途的市场机会之一。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0, “335551550”:6、“335551620”:6、“335559731”:0、“335559739”:160、“335559740”:259}&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

I got my first job with the word “digital” in the title 20 years ago, which I guess makes me something of a digital marketing veteran. Back then I spent almost as long building business cases as I did activating campaigns. It&#39;s easy to forget, but making the switch from offline to digital in the mid-2000s was far from a no-brainer. Digital marketing leaders were always hungry for &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; — more budget, more technology, more data, more people, more attention from the leadership team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed this was the start of the period of more. Digitization hit marketing hard, and the possibilities to engage, connect, and transact with consumers and customers created a massive opportunity. It also created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/leadership-vision-chief-marketing-officer?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_CMOVISION2022&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;challenge for CMOs,&lt;/a>; who struggled to balance the budget demands of their plucky digital marketing leaders alongside non-digital leaders. And the former presented a compelling argument: We constantly extolled the virtues of digital as &lt;em>;the&lt;/em>; cost effective, measurable, and optimizable choice. By contrast, anything offline seemed stuffy, old-fashioned, and, well, analogue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Nobody Got Fired for Spending (Even More) on Digital and Tech&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The period of more lasted for quite a long time. Digital is a hungry beast after all, with a seemingly unending array of alluring tools, tech, talent, and channels. I became a marketing analyst back in early 2016 — a time when martech and digital channels accounted for a serious chunk of total marketing budgets. At that time, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/495785/1158365?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBCMOSPENDSURVEY&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey&lt;/a>; reported average enterprise marketing budgets at a whopping 12.1% of company revenue. More than a quarter of the total marketing budget was allocated to technology in 2016, and each of the top three channels ranked by spend were digital.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While 2016 may have represented a high watermark in terms of total marketing budget, it certainly wasn&#39;t an outlier — indeed, technology spend as a proportion of total marketing budgets peaked at almost a third (29.2%) of marketing budgets in 2018. And marketing budgets averaged an impressive 11.2% of company revenue between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Less, But Still More&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When we surveyed CMOs in early 2020, before pandemic lockdowns, CMOs couldn&#39;t have anticipated the full scale of the Covid-19&#39;s impact: demolished marketing budgets and disrupted customer journeys. But the pandemic also presented another boost for digital and technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/digital-iq-index-genius-brands?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_GENIUSBRANDSEBOOK&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;Brands&lt;/a>; that previously lagged their peers now had little choice but to switch to digital channels to engage and transact with locked-down audiences. Brands that had already invested heavily in digital had little choice but to further accelerate investments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, even when there was less, there was more. More e-commerce, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/multichannel-marketing-survey?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_MULTICHANNELMKTG&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;more digital channels&lt;/a>;, and more tech. When we surveyed CMOs in 2020, they reported that they were more likely to protect their investments in tech than other elements of the resource mix, such as paid media or agencies, as they believed tech would be an essential tool to help them grow post-pandemic — when we hit the “new normal.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Long Post-Covid Climb-Back&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Like a carrot dangling on the end of a stick, the “new normal” has been frustratingly out of reach over the last few years. The World Health Organization may have declared the end of the Covid-19 global health emergency, but we&#39;re still pretty far from normal. From the recent failures of major banks to the volatility of various social media platforms, these issues weigh on the minds of the entire C-suite, regardless of their level of exposure to their impact. This seemingly unending set of disruptions result in a number of anchors on growth for the enterprise:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Higher interest rates &lt;/strong>;impacting the ROI potential of new investments. In the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/recession-playbook-marketing-leaders?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_GMLRECESSIONPLAYBOOK&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;macroeconomic environment&lt;/a>;, investors are prioritizing profits and cash flow today rather than holding out for future growth. Higher interest rates are also weakening demand in the economy, dulling growth.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;A stubbornly difficult talent market&lt;/strong>; with higher rates of staff turnover, increasing competition for strategically important roles, reduced employee trust in management, and tensions regarding hybrid and remote working.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Lagging digital transformation&lt;/strong>;, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-19-gartner-says-89-percent-of-board-directors-say-digital-is-embedded-in-all-business-growth-strategies&quot;>;2023 Gartner Board of Directors Survey&lt;/a>; reporting that 81% of boards have not made progress toward or achieved their digital business transformation goals. Furthermore, a 2022 Gartner survey found that 67% of CFOs believe the last three years&#39; digital spending has not met enterprise expectations.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;While it&#39;s convenient to frame recent enterprise history in pre- and post-pandemic terms, another inflection point may also have occurred. Enterprises have pivoted from a period of concentrated investment in the tools and capabilities that support digitally led growth to an era when these investments need to start paying back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When technology investments and digital marketing are no longer cool and different, they&#39;re &lt;em>;mainstream&lt;/em>;. In Gartner speak, such investments have shifted from being the &lt;em>;system of innovation&lt;/em>; — transformative, disruptive, and largely unproven — to being the &lt;em>;system of record&lt;/em>; — where the prevailing strategic force is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/455982/1074604?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGOPERATIONS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;operational efficiency&lt;/a>;, and the enterprise expects predictability, reliability, and stability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;We&#39;re (Not) Going to Need a Bigger Boat&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;That brings us to 2023. Data from Gartner&#39;s annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey published in late May suggests that the era of more has come to an end. Firstly (and most obviously), it reveals that the marketing budgets of the 400+ North American and European CMOs we surveyed have not recovered to their pre-Covid peaks. In fact, gains reported in 2022&#39;s survey have slipped, with average budgets down from 9.5% of company revenue in 2022 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-22-gartner-survey-reveals-71-percent-of-cmos-believe-they-lack-sufficient-budget-to-fully-execute-their-strategy-in-2023&quot;>;9.1% in 2023&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps more worrying than the top-level budget trend is an apparent squeeze on marketing&#39;s spending power. Increasing costs (of talent and digital media) and decreasing yield (of marketing technology utilization rates) has created a marketing cost-of-living crisis akin to that experienced by consumers in many markets over the last 18 months. Simply put, each marketing dollar buys less. So, in very real terms, we&#39;ve switched from the era of more to the era of less.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial and psychological impact of the era of less can be heard loud and clear in the responses to this year&#39;s survey. More than 70% of respondents report that their enterprise lacks sufficient budget or resources to successfully deliver its marketing strategy in 2023. Seventy-five percent of respondents state that their enterprise is asking them to do more with less, and 86% report that they&#39;re under pressure to make significant changes to how marketing works to achieve sustainable results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most surprising findings from this year&#39;s survey relate to the enterprise growing impatient with technology investments. Three-quarters of respondents reported that they&#39;re facing pressure from the enterprise to cut investments in martech — unthinkable just a few years ago. What&#39;s more: The seemingly inexorable rise of digital media has stalled. When we look at the proportion of media spend allocated to digital versus offline channels, it&#39;s fallen one percentage point to 55% in 2023. In 2023 it&#39;s entirely possible to get fired for spending more on digital and tech. To misquote the classic 1975 film &lt;em>;Jaws&lt;/em>;: We&#39;re not going to need a bigger boat; we&#39;re going to need a more efficient one.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Adapting to the Era of Less&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;On the subject of classic &#39;70s cinema, Francis Ford Copolla famously said of his 1979 magnum opus &lt;em>;Apocalypse Now&lt;/em>;, “There were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.” This is not to say that CMOs have experienced the sort of excess Copolla is speaking of, but he does refer to one of the major challenges of more: Sometimes more can actually deliver less. Or, to flip this around, sometimes you can get more from less.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But delivering more with less is one of those terrible clichés — easy to say and significantly harder to achieve. It&#39;s challenging because more is the go-to state for most enterprise leaders. In the thousands of conversations I&#39;ve had with CMOs and marketing leaders over the years, a reasonable chunk entails a variation on the theme of “How can I build a business case to grow my marketing budget?” Another reasonable chunk? “How do I define the stuff I can afford to cut and the stuff I can&#39;t afford to lose?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answers to these fundamental questions cannot be found in shiny new technologies; rather, it&#39;s the strategic version of eating your greens. As a leader you need to have a firm plan that defines the scope of marketing and be painfully clear about how the function&#39;s scope ladders up to enterprise goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, your plan must be grounded in both the near-term actions that will deliver the leads and sales that keep the lights on today, alongside the investments that will contribute toward differentiation and growth tomorrow. This requires a nuanced story setting out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/three-techniques-to-prove-the-value-of-marketing?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_PROVEMKTGVALUE2023&quot;>;marketing&#39;s value &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/three-techniques-to-prove-the-value-of-marketing?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_PROVEMKTGVALUE2023&quot;>;proposition&lt;/a>; to the enterprise — how marketing delivers &lt;em>;return on objectives&lt;/em>; alongside &lt;em>;return on investment&lt;/em>;. And it requires an acceptance that the job of building this value story is not about econometric models or attribution analysis; these are a means to an end, not the end itself. It&#39;s about coming to a mutual understanding with stakeholders of how marketing delivers value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also about embracing and exploring the uncertainty that abounds and using the core strategic tools of scenario planning and sensitivity analysis to understand the prevailing issues that are material to success, enabling your team to develop strategic options that respond appropriately.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By returning to the first principles of sound strategic management, marketers will create a plan that rids them of the extraneous stuff, enabling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487268/1142263?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGSYMTAKEAWAYS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;focus on the right &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487268/1142263?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGSYMTAKEAWAYS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;&lt;em>;less&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that&#39;s most likely to support the delivery of goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To frame this in a slightly different way, at Gartner we talk about how CMOs can free themselves from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-22-gartner-says-catalytic-marketing-allows-cmos-to-drive-profitable-growth-amid-macroeconomic-pressures&quot;>;tyranny of more&lt;/a>; by focusing on three key leadership traits:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Clarity.&lt;/strong>; Choicefulness matters. CMOs must make clear-eyed decisions on what will — and will not — be supported over the life of the strategy. Equal thought and consideration should be given to the initiatives that don&#39;t make the cut, and to clarity on why that&#39;s the case.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Courage. &lt;/strong>;Leaders must have the courage to ask difficult questions of their team. It identifies spurious assumptions, strategic sentimentality, and harmful cultural norms. For example, CMOs must dispel the sunk-cost bias of “just because we&#39;ve spent $100,000 on a program, it doesn&#39;t mean we should spend $100,000 more.” Similarly, CMOs must battle historic assumptions of value: Just because an investment made sense three years ago, it doesn&#39;t mean that the business case just rolls over year-on-year. All major investments should be able to justify themselves based on measurable contribution to &lt;em>;future &lt;/em>;goals, not those in the past.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Connection.&lt;/strong>; Success is almost always a collaborative endeavor. The start of successful collaboration is communication and understanding. CMOs must collaborate with CFOs, CSOs, CIOs, et al., with a clearly defined and shared understanding of how marketing&#39;s programs deliver against business objectives. Likewise, they must have an understanding of where marketing intersects with other functions in the value-creation process. Ditch the obscure metrics and three-letter acronyms so beloved of marketing. Translate brand speak into business speak to demystify marketing and increase connection.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Wait, But What About AI?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You may be asking “surely AI changes everything?” Perhaps the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/how-should-cmos-respond-to-chatgpt-today?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_YOY_GML_NPP_PR1_RECHATGPT&quot;>;transformative power of AI&lt;/a>; will usher in a new era of digital investment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reality is complicated for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, AI isn&#39;t particularly new to marketing — it&#39;s been there, hiding in your tech stack (and the tech stacks of your partners and agencies) for years. Second, while the promises of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487667/1143179?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGGENERATIVEAI&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;generative AI&lt;/a>; amp up interest and enthusiasm, this is all happening at a time when utilization rates of technology have plummeted. Gartner&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/marketing-technology-survey-2022?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_MARTECHSURVEY22&amp;amp;utm_term=gi&quot;>;2022 Marketing Technology Survey&lt;/a>; reported that the utilization rate of martech is only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-03-gartner-survey-finds-marketers-utilize-just-42-percent-of-their-martech-stack-capabilities&quot;>;42%&lt;/a>;. So, for every dollar you spend on martech, you&#39;re utilizing less than half of the investment. Given marketing technology has consistently accounted for more than a quarter of the total marketing budget, this level of yield is more than a technology risk — it&#39;s a fiscal risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This level of fiscal risk doesn&#39;t prevent CMOs from looking at new technology solutions. But it should make them think really hard before plunging headfirst into new commitments.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Will There Ever be More &lt;em>;More&lt;/em>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The general rule of enterprise finance is that marketing budgets drop like a stone at the first sign of trouble and rise like a feather once the environment is more settled. In mid-2023 we&#39;re far from a settled state — projected GDP growth in western markets is depressingly flat, inflation is proving to be rather stubborn, and those disruptions just keep on coming. It&#39;s tough to see a significant increase in marketing budgets in the near term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the picture is somewhat mixed. Averages mask variances, and budgets differ significantly across industries and geographies. If you&#39;re a CMO marketing consumer goods, the chances are that your budget in 2023 is much healthier than your counterparts in financial services. And if you&#39;re based in Germany, the chances are that your budget is less healthy than your UK–based colleagues&#39;. However, across all industries and markets we surveyed in 2023, budgets lag pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What of 2024? Predicting the future has always been a fool&#39;s errand. Perhaps we will again see another era of more as new technologies, experiences, and channels open up brave new opportunities for marketing. And perhaps we&#39;ll have learned valuable lessons from the era of less that will make marketing lean and efficient, even with increased funding. Perhaps.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Managing Anxiety When There&rsquo;s No Room for Error]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/managing-anxiety-when-theres-no-room-for-error]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jul23_27_57363406.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;fStop Images - Brian Cassie/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When you work in roles where mistakes must be avoided at all costs &amp;#8212; think medical, security, financial, and transportation professions &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s easy to become terrified of making one. But there are ways to constructively reduce the risk of potential mistakes and reduce your anxiety. First, distinguish between critical and not-so-critical potential mistakes and focus on the former. Then adopt systems and habits to mitigate those threats. Get support from others to address your weaknesses, while also finding solutions that play on your strengths. Collaborate with others focused on the same issues. Address any self-sabotaging behaviors, like failing to ask for help. Reduce the distractions caused by small-error worries with small actions that eliminate most of them. And, finally, consider a hobby in which you can make consequence-free mistakes.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/managing-anxiety-when-theres-no-room-for-error?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/managing-anxiety-when-theres-no-room-for-error?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In some arenas, mistakes are par for the course and not very costly. It doesn&#39;t &lt;em>;really&lt;/em>; matter if a designer starts over several times before producing a beautiful cover image, an inventor tries a hundred prototypes before finding the one that works, or an entrepreneur pivots from one idea to another based on customer feedback. In these roles, failures are part of the path to success. In others, the stakes might be limited by one&#39;s lower level of responsibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what about roles in which perfection is expected? No one wants their neurosurgeon to make a mistake or their criminal defense lawyer to have an off day. Accountants can&#39;t file flawed financial statements with the IRS, SEC, or any other regulator. Some security roles are focused on surveilling for potential threats, and success means not missing any, ever. Your job may be in this category. Or maybe the consequences for getting something wrong at work aren&#39;t so dramatic, but you feel they are because of a mean boss, looming layoffs, or deep-seated anxiety.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you cope with the feeling that you simply can&#39;t screw up? My recommendation is to use strategies that reduce your chance of making a critical mistake while simultaneously reducing your worry about doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The basics of anxiety&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start with some basic background on how anxiety works. First, overthinking is not problem-solving. It paralyzes us more than it mobilizes us. Second, people often obsess about one particular type of mistake or threat while ignoring others because fear narrows our attention. Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gretchenrubin_one-of-my-aphorisms-is-action-is-an-antidote-activity-6651614263683137537-w-8Y?trk=posts_directory&quot;>;action is an antidote to anxiety&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jobs in which mistakes are costly or dangerous (like medicine, accounting, engineering, or security) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316156/the-anxiety-toolkit-by-alice-boyes-phd/&quot;>;sometimes attract people who are naturally conscientious&lt;/a>;, diligent, and good at getting things right. But the additional focus on being careful at all times can be hard for someone who already has that personality type. It&#39;s a bit like how a parent&#39;s admonition to “be careful” can make an already cautious or anxious child even more nervous. If your training or institution is focused on eliminating mistakes, that might intensify your perfectionism and anxiety.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s what you can do to lower the tension.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Distinguish between big and small mistakes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you think about every mistake you could possibly make, it will distract you from the ones you should most fear. You&#39;ll lighten your mental load if you regularly take actions that lessen the risk of making the worst mistakes. To figure out which to prioritize, consider ones that easily come to mind as well as those that are often overlooked, such as opportunity costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are several other, somewhat related categories of major risks people fail to see. One is what former Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld called “unknown unknowns”: risks from situations that are so unexpected they would not be considered. Another is “you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know,” which refers to blindspots you&#39;re not aware of having, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/05/discover-what-you-need-to-know&quot;>;when you think you understand something fully but you don&#39;t&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Put mechanisms in place to mitigate these risks. For example, schedule a monthly meeting with a colleague to discuss how you are approaching difficult cases as a way of uncovering any potential risks you&#39;re missing. Putting a recurring meeting on your calendar with the expectation you will discuss complex decision-making will ensure this gets done. Consider some examples and ask what similar situations you might face in your own role: Maybe you don&#39;t know that a student may interpret an instruction differently than you&#39;d intended, resulting in a dangerous situation in your lab. You don&#39;t know that a traveling nurse in your operating room will use a procedure they&#39;re familiar with rather than the one you routinely use, resulting in confusion or an important step being missed. You don&#39;t know that a software provider will roll out a buggy update the day before an important deadline and break systems you rely on. What could you do now to ensure those mistakes aren&#39;t made?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cautious people can retrain themselves to look for and ward off the most critical risks. But this requires a mental capacity to see beyond what others typically do and to tolerate uncertainty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Adopt risk-reducing systems and habits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Instead of thinking about reducing mistakes through willpower and by never having a bad day, create systems that don&#39;t rely on that type of unrealistic, robotic perfection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s evidence that basic strategies like &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/2010/01/using-checklists-to-prevent-fa.html&quot;>;checklists, for example, can reduce mistakes&lt;/a>; but are &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/02/draftwhat-sort-of-checklist-sh&quot;>;underutilized in particular fields&lt;/a>;. If you&#39;re looking for inspiration, consider how you adapt actions taken in other industries or roles. For example, medical devices such as heart monitors and ventilators often incorporate redundant sensors and alarms to detect malfunctions and provide timely alerts. How could people in your role get earlier or duplicate warning signals automatically? Industries like aviation have strict reporting requirements for near-misses. Should you do the same if an article nearly goes to print with a significant factual mistake or a project barely meets its deadline and only after staff pulls an all-nighter? What would be most useful and genuinely focused on learning rather than blaming? &lt;a href=&quot;https://toddkashdan.com/the-art-of-insubordination/&quot;>;Educate yourself on the science&lt;/a>; of how to build diverse teams that share opposing views, courageously speak up about concerns, and engage in healthy debate. Create a culture that rewards people for soliciting and positively reinforcing uncommon views. When someone points out something you didn&#39;t know you didn&#39;t know, take special care to encourage them to continue to do this in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Get support to address your weaknesses&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When I was a therapist, my weakest spot was always record keeping. I hated documenting. My mind worked quickly, and it felt like recording kept slowing me down. I preferred to put all my energy into face-to-face interactions with my clients. If I were ever in this role again, I&#39;d stop trying to improve in that area on my own and accept that I needed a support person to keep me on track with documenting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if you&#39;re the only one who knows how to perform critical roles and you&#39;re not good at systematizing your process, you might get help to do that. If you&#39;re not the best communicator but are making a must-win pitch to a client or boss, could you ask a mentor, friend, or even an AI chatbot with more of those skills to help you be more persuasive? Likewise, if conflict management isn&#39;t a strength, but team in-fighting threatens to derail a key project, perhaps you engage a consultant you can call on as needed to give, and maybe even implement, suggestions. Or, if your messy office presents a real risk of losing documentation, have a professional organizer come in and give you a fresh start every few months. Remember that it&#39;s not just your own willpower and diligence that will help you avoid mistakes. You can enlist a village of coworkers — and even friends, family, and technology — to help you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Play on your strengths&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645534/stress-free-productivity-by-alice-boyes-phd/&quot;>;often argue&lt;/a>; for using your strengths to mitigate your weaknesses, and this can extend to how you avoid mistakes. For instance, if you&#39;re visually creative you might create visual reminders, or if humor is a strength, then humorous ones. Just Google “funny airline safety video” for examples of how to make people pay attention to serious safety advice. If you&#39;re gregarious and good with people, how might you use that gift to extract information others might usually keep close to the vest, like telling you why you might not want to partner with a particular individual or group? If, by contrast, you&#39;re more introverted, how might you use your natural inclination to listen and observe more than speak to notice looming problems or make it more likely people will trust you enough to disclose concerns or errors without fearing you&#39;ll tell others? Consider how your top strengths can help you solve your particular problems. One question you can ask yourself to identify your uncommon strengths is: What are you willing to do that 95% of other people aren&#39;t?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Address self-sabotaging behaviors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When we&#39;re very anxious about something, we often self-sabotage in ways that increase the chances of the feared thing happening. For example, you know you&#39;ve got a weakness, but you don&#39;t seek mentors or supervisors who could help you address it because you don&#39;t want to draw attention to it. Or you don&#39;t ask for an accommodation for your depression due to embarrassment and stigma or a belief you should tough it out, but that increases the chances of making a mistake on a bad day. Or you hate wasting money, so you don&#39;t try an option that might solve the problem but isn&#39;t guaranteed. Or you&#39;re a perfectionist so you don&#39;t seek to solve a problem where improvements are possible but perfect seems impossible. Get creative about overcoming your self-sabotage, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/be-kinder-to-yourself&quot;>;talk to yourself compassionately about it&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Collaborate with others focused on the same issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When you think about mistakes, you may mostly do so on a personal or team level. “How can I prevent myself or a colleague from getting this important thing wrong?” But to seek out better solutions — and the camaraderie of a group that shares your fears — consider getting involved in larger efforts to reduce mistakes in your field, like sitting on a committee for complaints and disciplinary actions or one establishing new guidelines for people in your role. Teaching also usually improves our own practice, so consider finding opportunities to teach others about how your work is done in a way that minimizes or eliminates mistakes. Write a talk on this for an industry conference or host a panel.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Reduce small-threat distraction by taking simple actions to mitigate those risks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Though most of your focus should be on the biggest threats, some simple strategies can lessen the risk of small mistakes so they won&#39;t distract you from that focus. You&#39;ll want to take simple actions that help reduce the frequency of minor problems, and then accept that you can&#39;t eliminate all of them. Pick the low-hanging fruit. For example, if a doctor is worried about forgetting names of patients and family members, they might write the names down on the top of each page as they&#39;re taking notes during interactions. Address minor potential mistakes to the extent that they free up your mental capacity to think about and prevent larger ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Consider a hobby that allows you to make mistakes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To add some balance to your life, you might want to take up an activity in which mistakes and false starts aren&#39;t at all costly. For example, I&#39;ve recently taken up vegetable gardening, and it&#39;s refreshing to partake in an interest in which a low rate of success is perfectly acceptable. After all, a packet of a hundred seeds costs only a few dollars. A friend of a friend is an avid surfer, content to miss or bail out on dozens of waves to eventually get few good rides, which is a great antidote to his day job as a startup CFO trying to make sure the company doesn&#39;t run out of money.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When perfection is expected and mistakes are costly, it&#39;s easy to become terrified of making one. You might lose sleep over it or avoid leadership and increased responsibility. But there are ways to constructively reduce the risk of potential mistakes and reduce your anxiety.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Manage Your Team&rsquo;s Workload After Layoffs]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-manage-your-teams-workload-after-layoffs]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_26_98413121-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Susanne Walstrom/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;All too often in the case of layoffs, the people who survive it are expected to pick up the work that their terminated colleagues left behind.与此同时，这些被解雇的幸存者常常在幸存者内疚、焦虑和士气低落中挣扎。简而言之，裁员之后，那些能给予的人越来越少的人会被要求更多。当涉及到关键人才的倦怠和保留时，这会导致灾难。 In this piece, the authors outline four strategies for right sizing the workload on your &lt;span data-markjs=&quot;true&quot;>;team.&amp;#160;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-manage-your-teams-workload-after-layoffs?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-manage-your-teams-workload-after-layoffs?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Facing economic uncertainty and slowing revenue growth, companies continue to announce layoffs affecting thousands of workers. These downsizings, which have shifted beyond the tech industry to multiple&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-companies-conducting-layoffs-in-2023-heres-the-list-11673288386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;other sectors&lt;/a>;, are undeniably tragic for layoff victims. But they&#39;re also terrible for the workers left behind. Layoff survivors often struggle with psychological impacts from the downsizing, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizreport.com/layoff-aftermath-survey-2022/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;guilt, anxiety, and depression&lt;/a>;. In a state of diminished&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/what-companies-still-get-wrong-about-layoffs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;trust and morale&lt;/a>;, they also remain on edge as they fearfully await another round of cuts. And all too often, layoff survivors are expected to pick up the work their terminated colleagues left behind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, companies often ask even more of their people at a time when they have less to give. This dynamic is a recipe for disaster when it comes to burnout, retention of key talent, and the long-term success of your team. For the health and performance of your team, it&#39;s essential to evaluate your team&#39;s capacity after a layoff and to take significant steps to right-size your team&#39;s workload. Here&#39;s how:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Identify projects and initiatives to postpone&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In a state of overload, it&#39;s a natural stress response to put your nose to the grindstone to make a dent in the volume of work. However, it is critical to step back and identify where your team should invest its precious time and energy.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Start by creating a comprehensive list with your team of all ongoing initiatives and projects and discussing what each one solves, creates, or improves.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Next, rank these initiatives based on their expected impact and each project&#39;s potential benefits to the organization.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Finally, identify which initiatives can be postponed but easily resumed later versus those where temporarily pausing might be consequential and difficult to reverse.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;Due to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/07/how-susceptible-are-you-to-the-sunk-cost-fallacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;sunk cost fallacy&lt;/a>;, we are reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action that we have already invested in. However, many projects can be put on hold and resumed easily at a moment&#39;s notice. Acknowledging this distinction will allow you and your team to override this fallacy and make decisions more swiftly so you can focus on the most critical work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you choose projects to postpone, however, ensure you retain one or more future-focused projects. These projects often serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for the team, infusing energy into their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Align with your boss to manage your “shelf space”&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Supermarkets and retail stores are naturally constrained by their shelf space, unable to add a new product unless they remove an existing one. Leaders should apply a similar principle in managing their team&#39;s workload, but rarely do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next time your boss requests something from your team, ask whether the new request requires immediate attention. If it does, ask your manager to help you prioritize the request among your team&#39;s other assignments. For example, you might say, “The team is also working on these three other initiatives. Are there any that can be dropped or postponed to make room for this one?” Giving your boss a choice gives them a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33400628/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;sense of control&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;and is more effective than flatly pushing back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, get in the habit of proactively sharing the estimated resource requirements for any requests. Most leaders are unaware of the effort and expense teams expend to fulfill their demands. When you proactively communicate resource requirements with your boss, they become more discerning in their inquiries, significantly reducing your team&#39;s workload.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Uncover your team&#39;s full set of talents&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Teams are often unaware of the complete set of skills, knowledge, and abilities within their ranks. This talent goes untapped to the detriment of team productivity and performance precisely when you need it most.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To address this issue and unlock your team&#39;s potential, schedule a meeting to uncover all the talent resident on your team. Give team members 10 minutes to reflect and write down their talents and skills. Next, ask each team member to share their list with the team. As they do so, encourage the team to add additional talents or skills they recognize in their colleague that they didn&#39;t mention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This simple exercise is a profound eye-opener, revealing hidden talents and helping teams identify their go-to colleagues when they need help. It also serves as an energizing experience for all participants, as colleagues rarely discuss and acknowledge each other&#39;s talents and skills in a direct and focused manner. In our experience facilitating this exercise with over 30 teams and hundreds of participants, every participant has had the uplifting experience of having talents that they were unaware of or took for granted added by their colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This simple exercise can deliver a significant boost in both engagement and productivity on teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Simplify, simplify, simplify&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the face of overwhelming workloads, teams often overlook opportunities for simplification.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://webinar.gartner.com/463005/agenda/session/1092611&quot;>;Gartner data&lt;/a>;, 27% of employees and 38% of managers feel overwhelmed by the ever-mounting burden of information. Discuss with your team how to simplify communication and information overload. For instance, it can be helpful to agree to limit any write-ups, such as proposals or meeting pre-reads, to a one-page summary that clearly highlights its relevance in the present context. Additionally, in meetings or chats — where opinions often overflow and unnecessary complexity arises — encourage participants to distill their ideas to their essence. Prompt team members to get to the crux by asking, “Can you summarize the essence of your suggestion in two sentences?” And as you discuss any workstream or product with your team, consistently challenge yourselves to simplify by asking, “How can we shorten or simplify this?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A second frequently neglected area is to seek input from your internal customers on what can be simplified in the solutions or services you offer them. Surprisingly, their perspectives can illuminate unnecessary complexity that your team may have overlooked. For example, the Dutch company AFAS Software regularly holds meetings with its clients solely dedicated to discussing what features or elements they should remove from their software solution. This proactive approach ensures that their software remains up-to-date and free from needless complexity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Layoffs are difficult and stressful for everyone involved. But by implementing the strategies above, you can help shield your team from the damaging effects of work overload. Your efforts will help eliminate depleting low-value work, ensure your team can focus on the most critical work, and boost their morale and engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 26 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Out for These 3 Gender Biases in Performance Reviews]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/watch-out-for-these-3-gender-biases-in-performance-reviews]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_26_AnjaSusanj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Anja Sušanj&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Three kinds of bias often creep into the performance-review process, in ways that disproportionately affect women, especially when they choose to take advantage of the flexibility offered by hybrid and remote work. These biases are &lt;em>;experience bias&lt;/em>;, which leads reviewers to overvalue tasks that are easy to define; &lt;em>;proximity bias&lt;/em>;, which leads them to think that people in their immediate orbit do the most important work; and i&lt;em>;n-group/out-group bias, &lt;/em>;which leads them to give preferential treatment to people they feel belong to a group they identify with. This article, based on the author&amp;#8217;s study of a large multinational consulting group, explains the nature of these biases and offers suggestions for how to combat them.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/watch-out-for-these-3-gender-biases-in-performance-reviews?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/watch-out-for-these-3-gender-biases-in-performance-reviews?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Because women continue to bear most of the burdens of caregiving, many have benefitted from the flexibility of hybrid and remote work, which has allowed them to remain part of the full-time workforce while spending more time at home. In theory, this is good news, because full-time employees tend to be promoted more often and let go less often — but &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/women-face-a-double-disadvantage-in-the-hybrid-workplace&quot;>;in practice&lt;/a>; that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening.为什么？ Because when women take advantage of hybrid and remote work options today, they become subject to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/6-ways-to-make-performance-reviews-more-fair&quot;>;biases&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;that creep into the performance-review process and cause them to be &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/how-gender-bias-corrupts-performance-reviews-and-what-to-do-about-it&quot;>;judged unfairly&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I witnessed this problem firsthand during a consulting project I did recently for a global company with hundreds of thousands of employees worldwide. During the project, which took place as the company (which I&#39;ll call HAPI&amp;nbsp; Consulting, to preserve its anonymity) was in the midst of a large reorganization, I was reporting to the CEO, his executive, and the board. With their support, I gathered and analyzed data on performance reviews given in a hybrid work environment (pre- and post-pandemic), and in that context I identified three specific kinds of bias that were hurting women and their career prospects. I&#39;ll explore them in turn below.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Experience bias&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The first bias I observed was what we call &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/fooled-by-experience&quot;>;&lt;em>;experience bias&lt;/em>;,&lt;/a>; one aspect of which is overvaluing tasks that are easy to define.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This form of bias, I found, was prevalent in performance reviews at HAPI Consulting — where, because of the reorganization, many employees had been forced to put their routine work on hold. During that period, reviewers had judged employees instead on how they had chosen to refocus their energies. Men, on the whole, had chosen work that was much easier to recognize. They spent more time on highly visible external tasks, such as speaking at industry conferences and giving interviews to journalists, bloggers, and podcasters. These tasks were straightforward to review when it came to short-term measures of success. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/research-women-took-on-even-more-invisible-work-during-the-pandemic&quot;>;women&lt;/a>; spent more time on much less visible internal tasks, such as boosting team cohesion to help get projects back on track and providing psychologically safe spaces for team members to ask questions and process elements of the reorganization that were taking place at the company. These tasks had longer timelines and were harder to evaluate in the short term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These choices lent themselves to experience bias. It&#39;s easy to understand, for example, how somebody who has presented at a major conference (probably a man) might have immediately provided a measurable benefit to the company. In fact, men were three times more likely than women to speak at outside events. But how easy is it to measure and evaluate the work that somebody (probably a woman) has begun to do in a long-term effort to repair team dynamics or prevent deep-rooted problems that might ultimately affect hundreds or thousands of employees? Needless to say, given the nature of experience bias, reviewers at HAPI Consulting praised the men more regularly in their performance reviews for having succeeded in their work. More specifically, men who reviewed other men assessed them 12% higher than women, on average, as compared to when women reviewed both men and other women.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the support of leadership, I tested several interventions designed to help reviewers at the company correct this bias. While some interventions failed, two had a statistically significant chance (with a 95% confidence interval or above) of reducing biases at this company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first was for managers to help employees set individualized goals with tailored metrics and then ask them to track what they had done every week — and to do it on a virtual whiteboard that the rest of the team and the directors up the chain could see. In this way, people who had contributed to less-easily-defined outcomes, such as team cohesion, could still point to a record of their efforts over time for all to see. This whiteboard could record important work even if it wasn&#39;t easily described in terms of traditional goals and metrics. This was helpful come performance review time. Even if employees had failed to reach the goals laid out for them in their last performance review, there was still a record of all their efforts and achievements, which, according to the post-survey results, helped reviewers better grasp the value of the more ambiguous, internal work that (mostly) women were performing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second was designed to help employees become better at describing their own efforts. At the beginning of the week, for each project they were working on, employees were asked to provide two different estimates on their virtual whiteboard: how long each task would take to accomplish and its level of difficulty (high, medium, or low). For example, an employee might identify the three projects they&#39;re working on for the week and allocate the amount of time they plan to spend on each, based on the type of task and estimated difficulty. At the end of each week, employees were asked to revisit their estimates, note how their time was actually allocated and how difficult the task ended up being, and reflect on the reasons for the differences between their forecasts and “actuals.” This practice allowed employees to look back on their recorded predictions, reflect on what the record showed in comparison to their perceptions, and fine-tune their ability to paint an accurate picture of their efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the data showed that women were more accurate in their estimations of the time a task would take, although they often overestimated the difficulty of tasks. Meanwhile, men underestimated both the time a task would take and its difficulty. Following the intervention, the likelihood of women accurately identifying the difficulty of the task increased by a factor of 28, while men were 12.5 times more likely to do so. Additionally, men became 7 times more likely to accurately estimate the time required for a task, whereas there was no significant difference in this aspect for women.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Proximity bias&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;An other form of bias I observed was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/preventing-proximity-bias-in-a-hybrid-workplace.aspx&quot;>;&lt;em>;proximity bias&lt;/em>;,&lt;/a>; or the tendency to think that people who are in your physical orbit do the most important work. A hybrid work environment exacerbates this bias and was penalizing women at HAPI Consulting, where men were more likely than women to come into the office. Reviewers tended to express skepticism, or at least confusion, about what women did when they worked remotely, whereas they tended to give men the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were more focused and productive.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when women came into the office as often as men, reviewers assigned them achievement levels that were a statistically significant 3% lower than those they assigned to the men. And when women came into the office more than men, reviewers seemed to believe that they were doing so only because they were looking out for themselves and wanted to “have a seat at the table” to defend their position in the reorganization of the company. Conversely, when men came into the office an above-average amount, they were seen as strong leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To address this problem of proximity bias, I administered a survey to employees to gauge their preferences among several choices: more online gatherings, an “anchor day” when everybody was expected to be in the office, or more offsite team-building opportunities. The employees&#39; preference was that the company create an anchor day, which it did. This intervention led to a statistically significant drop in proximity bias that was observable in the next performance-review cycle. In addition to having employees post their current projects on a virtual whiteboard each week, teams were also asked to hold weekly meetings during which they would discuss three achievements from the previous week, their goals for the current week, and three challenges they were facing in trying to achieve them. By drawing more equal attention to the work that everybody was doing, no matter where they did it, these meetings helped the company resist proximity bias.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;In-group/out-group bias&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The third form of bias that was creeping into remote-work performance evaluations was &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-08465-006&quot;>;&lt;em>;in-group/out-group bias&lt;/em>;,&lt;/a>; or giving preferential treatment to people you feel belong to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11752497/&quot;>;group you identify with&lt;/a>;. Not surprisingly, employees who were working remotely, and particularly those who had moved away from the office and across state lines, were increasingly seen as members of the out-group — and they had annual performance review scores that were lower by an average of 20%. Benefits would accrue to those in the in-group, including vertical promotions, horizontal promotions (providing employees with new opportunities to learn new skills and take on more prized tasks that would position them well for vertical promotions), and bonuses, such as equity shares in the company. Both men and women were subject to this form of bias, but because men tend to be seen more readily as leaders, they were more easily able to join the in-group than women.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To increase a sense of belonging, the company launched a campaign called “I am HAPI Consulting, We are HAPI Consulting.” One element of the campaign asked employees to answer simple, sometimes silly questions so that teams could come to know the commonalities among them. For example, when providing updates at meetings, employees might also have to tack on the answer to the question, “Dog or cat?” or “What is on your bucket list this year?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Questions like these provided some memorable moments that everyone could share, no matter whether they worked in the office or remotely, and they allowed more people to experience in-group moments. Strikingly, this practice led to a 14% increase in feelings of belonging to the in-group, and a 17% increase in employees&#39; perceptions of which &lt;em>;other&lt;/em>; employees belong to the in-group. At performance-review time, reviewers were also asked to recall one thing they had in common with the person they were about to review. We found that this simple intervention, which meant that reviews began from a point of commonality, decreased the gender discrimination in the company&#39;s performance reviews by several percentage points.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Men and women often experience the workplace differently, whether in-person or virtually. To include and support the best talent for your company in a dynamic environment, it&#39;s important to take a careful look at the data, be alert to the three kinds of biases discussed in this article, and identify practices that are leading you to overvalue the efforts of certain groups. The insights you gain from doing so will not only help you treat women more fairly but also will lead to fewer predictable surprises, more productive work hours, and increased efficiency in smoothly leading teams — and your company — to success.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 26 Jun 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[28 Questions to Ask Your Boss in Your One-on-Ones]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/28-questions-to-ask-your-boss-in-your-one-on-ones]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_23_1398880959.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;NicoElNino/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Good one-on-one meetings between managers and their direct reports address the practical and personal needs of the employee, benefitting their performance, growth, and well-being, as well as the success of their team and the broader organization. However, since managers are typically the ones who run these meetings, the employee&amp;#8217;s needs are often forgotten. Then it&amp;#8217;s up to the employee to ask questions to get the attention they need. The authors&amp;#8217; research points to twenty-eight questions that can drive the best conversations.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/28-questions-to-ask-your-boss-in-your-one-on-ones?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/28-questions-to-ask-your-boss-in-your-one-on-ones?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When she started a new role, Brianna was told she would be having regular one-on-one meetings (1:1s) with her manager, Jayden. She welcomed this news; she saw it as a great opportunity to get aligned with and supported and mentored by her new boss. But her hopes were quickly dashed. In their initial meeting, Jayden focused only on project updates and then assigned her a few additional tasks. This pattern continued over the weeks and Brianna routinely left their meetings feeling both micro-managed and unsupported in her development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This story is, sadly, a composite of many we have heard from employees in our research on 1:1s between managers and their direct reports. As one of us (Steve) described in a new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Glad-Met-Art-Science-Meetings/dp/0197641873&quot;>;&lt;em>;Glad We Met: The Art and Science of 1:1 Meetings&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; a good one-on-one meeting addresses both the practical and personal needs of the employee (practical: information, instruction, alignment; personal: the need to be treated with consideration, respect, trust, and support). As such, these meetings are a critical source of growth and support for the employee and promote the thriving and success of teams and the broader organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But these benefits are only realized when the meeting includes frequent conversations that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/make-the-most-of-your-one-on-one-meetings&quot;>;address those employee needs&lt;/a>;. And as 1:1s are typically facilitated by managers, they often devolve into addressing what is front of mind for them, rather than the employee. That&#39;s especially true because it is very rare for managers to receive training on how to run these meetings well, so they often simply recycle dysfunctional practices they themselves have experienced.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are in Brianna&#39;s position — if your boss&#39;s approach to your 1:1s has left you feeling unsupported and unheard — you should feel empowered to direct the conversation toward your needs yourself. You can do this by asking smart questions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Questions to Ask&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Based on published research as well as data we collected from nearly 200 employees on important topics to broach in a 1:1, we have identified 28 key questions in seven broad categories to help you get the most value from your check-ins with your boss. You can use, adapt, and put these into your own voice as you see fit.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Ask for Guidance and Input&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Use these questions to get help from your manager on any tasks or projects you are having difficulty with, or to express your need for additional resources, input, or support.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;I am having some challenges and struggles with X. Can you help me think about how to navigate and address X successfully?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Could you suggest any ideas and thoughts around how I could get more support (people, time, funding) to help with Y?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What do you think of my idea Z? Do you have any suggestions for how to improve it? Or, might you have an alternative idea I should consider?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Clarify Priorities and Expectations&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To be sure you are on track and working efficiently, make sure you and your manager are on the same page. Ask for clarification on what tasks need your most focused attention from their point of view.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;>; &lt;li>;Given what is on my plate, what should I be prioritizing right now, and can you help me understand why?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;As you review my workload, am I taking on on the right projects and tasks?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Am I on track for meeting my goals and your expectations from your perspective? Is any any refocusing necessary?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is there any context I might be missing about the projects I am working on? For example, what is the reasoning for doing project X?&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Align with the Organization and Its Strategy&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Ask questions to understand how your role relates to the broader strategic goals of the organization and the way its leaders are thinking about the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;>; &lt;li>;What is going on further up the tree (or in other parts of the organization) that would be helpful for me to know as I work on my key tasks?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;To better help me understand the big picture, how does the work I&#39;m doing or the assignment you just gave me fit into the broader goals and strategy?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is there anything that the management team is working on or considering that you think I should know about at present given its potential impact on my role?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What is new in our strategic priorities as a company that you feel I should know about, if anything?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Seek Growth Opportunities and Career Advancement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Come to the meeting with your thinking (however inchoate) around your professional short-term and long-term goals and ask your manager what steps you should take to get there.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol start=&quot;12&quot;>; &lt;li>;I would value your counsel. What can I do to prepare myself for greater opportunities or to pursue X interest of mine?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;As you reflect on where the organization is going, do you have any thoughts on how I should improve and develop to best align?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What strengths do you think I have and how might they be helpful in the future?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;From your perspective, what should I be targeting as my next career move and why do you recommend that position?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How can we make sure that my skillset is put to the best use to support the team and the organization?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How can we make sure that my full potential is achieved?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Get Feedback on Your Performance&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Check in with your manager to see how you are doing, performance-wise. You shouldn&#39;t make every meeting into an official performance evaluation, but it is important to periodically check in and calibrate if your manager isn&#39;t doing that themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol start=&quot;18&quot;>; &lt;li>;Am I meeting your expectations? I would relish learning your perspective on my work performance.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What feedback might you be able to share with me about how I&#39;m doing at X or Y task?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do you feel I have any spots I&#39;m overlooking when it comes to A or B?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;As you reflect on what I do at work, what should I start, stop, or continue doing?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Build a Relationship&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your 1:1 is a critical place for you to build and nurture your relationship with your manager. Allocate time at the beginning or end of the meeting to connect with your manager personally.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol start=&quot;22&quot;>; &lt;li>;How is your day going?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How are things going for you overall? Are you doing ok?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What is something you are excited about outside of work?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is there anything you would like to know about me? (If needed, be prepared to say “I don&#39;t feel comfortable sharing that, but here&#39;s something else you should know about me.”)&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Offer Support&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Consider ways in which you can help your manager achieve their goals and fulfill their role. Managers need assistance, reassurance, and support to optimize their efficiency and performance. Just like you&#39;d expect your manager to support you, see how you can lend them a hand. This will also increase the chances of you getting what you need in the 1:1.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol start=&quot;26&quot;>; &lt;li>;What are your priorities over the next X days? What can I do to help you with this?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Where can I offer you support?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is there anything keeping you up at night that I can help with?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to Use the Questions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For each 1:1 meeting, pick a category or two to focus on. You can&#39;t address them all in every meeting, so you will need to rotate or pick the most relevant at a given time. Likewise, choose sparingly from among the questions — no need to ask them all at one time. You&#39;ll simply want to sample from all categories over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t hesitate to follow up on your manager&#39;s responses to your questions. A great follow-up is often simply “why?” You&#39;ll glean strategic insights into the rationale, motives, assumptions, and big picture behind your day-to-day work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Good 1:1 meetings with your manager are critical for your success and the success of your team and organization. Asking the right questions to make sure those meetings give you what you need can have a huge impact on your work experience — helping you stay engaged, developing your understanding of your role and place in the organization, and improving your relationship with your manager — not to mention enhancing your well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 23 Jun 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Companies That Replace People with AI Will Get Left Behind]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/companies-that-replace-people-with-ai-will-get-left-behind]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_23_1300035600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;piranka/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies are integrating AI into their operations so quickly that job losses are likely to mount before the gains arrive. White-collar workers might be especially vulnerable in the short-term.The speed of this adoption presents an opportunity for companies to step up their pace of innovation, however &amp;#8212; and if enough companies to go on offensive, then we won&amp;#8217;t have to worry about AI unemployment. Adopting a bias for boldness and a startup mentality will help companies find the agility to make the most of this moment, and protect jobs as a result.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/companies-that-replace-people-with-ai-will-get-left-behind?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/companies-that-replace-people-with-ai-will-get-left-behind?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;After much discussion, the debate over job displacement from artificial intelligence is settling into a consensus. Historically, we&#39;ve never experienced macro-level unemployment from new technologies, so AI is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/long-run-ai-job-creator-destroyer-babak-pahlavan%3FtrackingId=6uoHh%252F4yS9uf2vTJPHE1vA%253D%253D/?trackingId=6uoHh%2F4yS9uf2vTJPHE1vA%3D%3D&quot;>;unlikely to make&lt;/a>; many people jobless in the long term — &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/05/24/artificial-intelligence-ai-eric-schmidt-demographic-crisis-babies-labor-shortage/&quot;>;especially since&lt;/a>; most advanced countries are now seeing their working-age populations decline. However, because companies are adopting ChatGPT and other generative AI remarkably fast, we may see &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/ripple-effect/rise-of-ai-are-robots-taking-our-jobs-lynn-wu/&quot;>;substantial job displacement in the short term&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compare AI with the rise of electricity around the turn of the twentieth&amp;nbsp;century. It took factories decades to switch from steam-powered central driveshafts to electric motors for each machine. They had to reorganize their layout in order to take advantage of the new electric technology. The process happened slowly enough that the economy had time to adjust, only new factories adopting the motors at first. As electricity created new jobs, laid-off workers in steam-powered factories could move over. Greater wealth created entirely new industries to engage workers, along with higher expectations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Something similar happened with the spread of computing in the middle of the twentieth century. It went at a faster pace than electrification, but was still slow enough to prevent mass unemployment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI is different because companies are integrating it into their operations so quickly that job losses are likely to mount before the gains arrive. White-collar workers might be especially vulnerable in the short-term. Indeed, commentators are describing an “AI gold rush” rather than a bubble, powered by advanced chipmakers such as Nvidia. Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65102150&quot;>;recently predicted&lt;/a>; that companies would use it to eliminate a quarter of all current work tasks in the United States and Europe. That probably means tens of millions of people out of work — especially people who thought their specialized knowledge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-negative-impact-middle-class-white-collar-workers-2023-5?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Insider%20Today%2C%20June%202%2C%202023&amp;amp;utm_term=INSIDER%20TODAY%20SEND%20LIST%20-%20ALL%20ENGAGED&quot;>;gave them job security&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That leaves two possibilities to mitigate this risk. The first is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/business/jobs-protections-artificial-intelligence.html&quot;>;governments step in&lt;/a>;, either to slow down the commercial adoption of AI (highly unlikely), or to offer special welfare programs to support and retrain the newly unemployed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there&#39;s another, often neglected possibility that comes without the unintended consequences of governmental intervention. Some companies are rapidly integrating generative AI into their systems, not just to automate tasks, but to empower employees to do more than they could before — ie, making them more productive. A &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/how-ai-is-helping-companies-redesign-processes&quot;>;radical redesign&lt;/a>; of corporate processes could spark all sorts of new value creation. If many companies do this, then as a society we&#39;ll generate enough new jobs to escape the short-term displacement trap.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But will they? Even the least aggressive company tends to be pretty good about cutting costs. Innovation, however, is another matter. We didn&#39;t worry about this in the past, because we had enough time for a few aggressive companies to gradually change industries. They innovated over time to make up for the slow loss of displaced jobs. That innovation created new jobs and kept unemployment low. But macroeconomically speaking, we don&#39;t have the luxury of time with the AI transition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the alternative to relying on the government is to have many companies innovating fast enough to create new jobs at the same pace that the economy as a whole eliminates existing ones. Generative AI is spreading fast in business and society, but that speed also means an opportunity for companies to step up their pace of innovation. If we get enough companies to go on offense in this way, then we won&#39;t have to worry about AI unemployment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, companies won&#39;t — and shouldn&#39;t — lean into AI in order to solve macroeconomic problems. But fortunately they have good business reasons to do so. The companies that create opportunities from AI will also position themselves to thrive in the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Going on the Offensive with AI&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Already we can point to aggressive companies looking to innovate in AI. Having become a trailblazer in reusable rockets and electric cars, Elon Musk is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-elon-musk-linda-yaccarino-spacex-244f0125?mod=series_elonmuskcompanies&quot;>;promising to make&lt;/a>; Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-wants-to-see-an-ai-rival-to-google-microsoft-a299e27f?mod=hp_lista_pos1&quot;>;as much of a leader&lt;/a>; in AI as Microsoft and Google. Musk, however, is &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/does-elon-musk-have-a-strategy&quot;>;a famous outlier&lt;/a>; and the jury is still out on Twitter. So what does it mean for a company to go on offense with AI?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To answer this question, let&#39;s look at what makes companies adept at navigating the kinds of changes we&#39;re seeing now. One of us (Tabrizi) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Going-Offense-Playbook-Perpetual-Innovation/dp/1646871375/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1686679313&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;>;assembled a team&lt;/a>; of researchers to study 26 sizable companies with good data from 2006–2022. The team divided the companies into groups of high, medium, and low agility and innovation over time, with comparable data and case studies of each.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What set the agile, innovative companies apart from those who remained neutral or defensive? The team narrowed the differentiators down to eight drivers of agile innovation: existential purpose, obsession with what customers want, a Pygmalion-style influence over colleagues, a startup mindset even after scaling up, a bias for boldness, radical collaboration, the readiness to control tempo, and operating bimodally. Most leaders praise those attributes, but it turns out it&#39;s remarkably hard for big organizations to sustain any of them over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tabrizi has written &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/how-microsoft-became-innovative-again&quot;>;elsewhere&lt;/a>; about how Microsoft went on offense to become a corporate leader by overhauling its hierarchy and pursuing partnerships such as with Open AI. But other companies have done something similar with AI as a result of those drivers. Let&#39;s focus on two of the most important drivers here — the bias for boldness and the startup mentality. Getting those drivers in place can take a company far into agile innovation, because these force changes throughout the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Bias for Boldness&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Any company that invests in AI in the near future is likely to make money from it. Yet mere investment is likely to offer only incremental gains. The numbers might look good, especially in cutting costs. But the company will miss the opportunity for big gains by creating substantial value — or a defensible future niche. Cautious investment won&#39;t protect you in the long run from competition, and certainly won&#39;t help us with the macroeconomic challenge we&#39;re facing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s the problem with any new technology: You can proceed cautiously and probably do just fine. Big companies hate risk, &lt;a href=&quot;/2000/03/meeting-the-challenge-of-disruptive-change&quot;>;which is why&lt;/a>; they operate as well-oiled machines churning out reliable products at an affordable cost. That&#39;s also why many of them outsource their innovation by acquiring startups — and even that approach often leads to timid improvements. All successful organizations, especially at size, prefer to minimize risk and daring. But as Brené Brown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rising-Strong-Reckoning-Rumble-Revolution/dp/0812995821/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1686679119&amp;amp;sr=1-7&quot;>;points out&lt;/a>;, “You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boldness has become a corporate cliché, with leaders protesting too much, but with AI we need companies to really mean it — to embrace rather than minimize risk. Take Adobe, whose Photoshop program has long held the largest share of the photographic design market. Adobe could have played it safe as generative AI emerged, adopting it in small areas while waiting to see how the technology worked out. That&#39;s what Kodak did with digital photography, and what Motorola did with digital telephony. But instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFFnEEBmgB0scn3E8AJ0XdH6erPefJ5euQ%22%5D&amp;amp;heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFFnEEBmgB0scn3E8AJ0XdH6erPefJ5euQ&amp;amp;keywords=jj%20delgado%F0%9F%A4%99&amp;amp;position=0&amp;amp;searchId=a8067e47-50fe-43fd-a269-0d80da62e1f5&amp;amp;sid=8k2&amp;amp;update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7066792598446743552%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)&quot;>;Adobe has pushed&lt;/a>; generative AI deeply into Photoshop, to the point that ordinary users can create all sorts of videos they couldn&#39;t before. Adobe could have seen AI as a threat or distraction, and it has continued to improve Photoshop without AI. But its leaders had the courage to invest aggressively in AI to elevate what users can do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deeper in the technology, Nvidia, the chipmaker, has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-03/chips-inside-nvidia-s-30-year-ride-to-overnight-ai-success?sref=bsFVYL6k&quot;>;getting headlines&lt;/a>; for offering the best semiconductor chips for AI. To outsiders, the company might just seem lucky, with the right technology at the right time. But Nvidia&#39;s current success is no accident: In the past decade, it aggressively acquired and developed expertise in AI, including creating customized chips and software. We can expect that aggressiveness to continue, enabling not only higher-value offerings for Nvidia, but better uses for AI than simple cost-cutting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boldness won&#39;t work every time. But a bias for boldness is essential to overcome the deep-seated risk aversion in corporate hierarchies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Startup Mentality&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Similar to boldness, and equally important for successful AI, is adopting the mentality of a startup company, no matter your company&#39;s age or size. Startups excel in looking widely at markets and pivoting quickly to what customers are wanting now. Big companies have the resources to apply to those opportunities, but they usually move so slowly, with so many barriers (and lack of boldness), that startups get to markets faster. Open AI, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2022/12/29/openai-positioned-itself-as-the-ai--leader-in-2022-but-could-google-supersede-it-in-23/?sh=b69aaa953216&quot;>;beat out&lt;/a>; Google with ChatGPT, had the best of both worlds: a startup mentality free of the hesitations that hampered Google, but with ample resources supplied by Microsoft and other investors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The startup mindset is not just about courage and flexibility; it also involves a ferocious commitment to big achievement, a kind of hero&#39;s journey to address a great challenge. Instead of predictability churning out good products at scale — though that&#39;s a perfectly worthwhile goal — startups want to create something extraordinary. So they put a premium on looking around, flexibly partnering with others. They dispense with existing structures and biases, no matter how old and respected, in order to get done what needs to be done.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amazon, the e-commerce giant, demonstrated a startup mentality in its embrace of AI. As the technology developed over a decade ago, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-amazon-made-alexa-smarter/&quot;>;saw an opportunity&lt;/a>; in creating a “smart speaker” as a new interface to the web. Amazon had no expertise in AI, but it picked up what it needed through hiring, acquisition, and internal development. The result was the Echo speaker and Alexa digital assistant, which did far more than simply help people order more items for purchase. It opened a new channel for adding value (and jobs) in many areas. Amazon has gone on to invest aggressively in AI beyond Alexa, with CEO Andy Jassy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/amazons-alexa-head-defends-companys-work-on-ai-amid-chatgpt-boom.html&quot;>;saying&lt;/a>; the technology promises to “transform and improve virtually every customer experience.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies can&#39;t adopt these drivers overnight, but they can start moving toward a point of serious commitment to new possibilities. Most of those drivers also work at the level of individuals looking for purpose and achievement in their own careers. They can embrace boldness, adopt a startup mentality, and other imperatives. Like companies, employees can invest aggressively in AI by acquiring the requisite skills and experience — thereby not just protecting their careers, but adding value &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-boom-share-profits-workers-productivity-wages-2023-5?inline-endstory-related-recommendations=&quot;>;at a higher level&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Much of corporate life has quite properly been about churning out reliable products at low cost. What we need now, to prevent mass unemployment, is for many firms to break out of this discipline and speed up the AI future. The great danger is that most companies will play it safe, make the easy investments, and do fine in the short term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humanity never thrives when it fears innovation. Imagine if the first humans feared fire; yes, they got burned sometimes, but without harnessing the power of it, we might have gone extinct. We think the same applies to AI. Rather than fear it, we need to harness its power. We must put it in the hands of every human being, so we collectively can achieve and live at this higher level.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 23 Jun 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Start Your New Leadership Role with the End in Mind]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/start-your-new-leadership-role-with-the-end-in-mind]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/June23_22_Carlo_Cadenas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Carlo Cadenas&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;To successfully step into a new role and set yourself up for long-term success, you must balance &amp;#8220;now-forward&amp;#8221; planning with &amp;#8220;future-back&amp;#8221; visioning. That is, you must start with the end in mind, envisioning what you want to accomplish during this era of your leadership and what needs to happen before for can take the next step. This mindset will empower you to make early decisions that will accelerate your transition, pave the way for long-term impact in the new role, and contribute to your continued career growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/start-your-new-leadership-role-with-the-end-in-mind?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/start-your-new-leadership-role-with-the-end-in-mind?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When taking on a new leadership role, it&#39;s&amp;nbsp;natural to focus on the immediate challenges of making a successful transition, including accelerating your learning, building relationship with stakeholders, and securing early wins. However, it is essential to complement this “now-forward” planning with “future-back” thinking about your desired destination and what it will take to get there. As Stephen Covey expressed in his best-selling book, &lt;em>;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/em>;, you want to “start with the end in mind.” This means envisioning what you want to accomplish in the new role so you will be ready to move beyond it and then working backward to map out how you will get there. In so doing, you can shape your early actions to lay the foundation for long-term success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The starting point is to engage in what Dan Ciampa, the noted executive coach, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danciampa.com/more-designated-successors.php&quot;>;defined as “era planning&lt;/a>;.” Your era is the anticipated duration of time you think you will be in the new position. Of course, you may end up staying longer or leaving earlier, but try to make a rough guess about when you will have accomplished enough to be “done.” You&#39;ll want to ask yourself two key questions: “As I wrap up this job, what will be true?” and “What will be possible?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Envisioning &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Your Leadership Legacy &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The first question — “What will be true?”&amp;nbsp;— asks you to outline the legacy you aspire to create and the story you will tell about your achievements. Focus on what you want to be remembered for in your new position and what you want your team and peers to say about your leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider key areas such as:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Performance outcomes:&lt;/strong>; What are the tangible results — for example, in terms of increased productivity or profitability — you will achieve?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Organizational transformation:&lt;/strong>; How will you reshape the team and its culture?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Innovation:&lt;/strong>; What will you do to foster creativity and develop new areas for growth?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Talent development:&lt;/strong>; How will you hire and train people to take the organization into the future?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Distill these into a concise, written personal narrative. Then, think about what you need to do, starting now, to realize this legacy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Creating&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; Future Possibilities &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The second question — “What will be possible?” — encourages you to envision futures beyond your current role and strategize the steps you&#39;ll take to turn them into viable options. This process involves identifying multiple potential paths forward and pinpointing the skills you&#39;ll need to acquire and the connections you&#39;ll need to establish over the course of this era to make those viable options. By exploring different scenarios and actively planning your development, you&#39;ll be better equipped to adapt and seize emerging opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take these steps:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Create a list of potential futures, considering logical next steps in your organization and your industry, as well as less conventional but still attractive options that would take you in different directions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Assess whether there are skill gaps you need to close to achieve some or all of those futures by reflecting on your existing strengths and areas for improvement.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Identify the bridges — the steps and connections — that would allow you to transition from your current role to your desired future options. These might include expanding your professional network, deepening your industry knowledge, or engaging in what Ken Banta and Orlan Boston &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/the-strategic-side-gig&quot;>;described as “strategic side gigs&lt;/a>;,” such as teaching or working on boards of directors.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Develop a plan for how you&#39;ll acquire the skills and build the bridges to make the potential futures you have identified realistic options, setting specific goals and holding yourself accountable for achieving them.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;As Peter Drucker said, “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” By imagining multiple potential futures and working toward them, you&#39;ll create real options for yourself when you&#39;re ready to move on from your current role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To successfully step into a new leadership role and set yourself up for long-term success, you must balance “now-forward” planning with “future-back” visioning. This mindset will empower you to make early decisions that will accelerate your transition, pave the way for long-term impact in the new role, and contribute to your continued career growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 22 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Roles Could Generative AI Play on Your Team?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/what-roles-could-generative-ai-play-on-your-team]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_22_1273134318.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Normform/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The recent advances in ChatGPT are merely the first application of new AI technologies. As such, companies and leaders need to think about the various applications outlined here and use the framework described in the article to develop applications for your own company or organization. In the process, they will discover new types of GPTs. By classifying these different GPTs in terms of potential value to businesses and the cost of developing them, applications that begin with a single human initiating or participating in the interaction (GroupGPT, CoachGPT) will probably be the easiest to build and should generate substantial business value, making them the perfect initial candidates. In contrast, applications with interactions involving multiple entities or those initiated by machines (AutoGPT, BossGPT, and ImperialGPT) may be harder to implement, with trickier ethical and legal implications.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-roles-could-generative-ai-play-on-your-team?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-roles-could-generative-ai-play-on-your-team?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The frenzy surrounding the launch of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other types of Generative AI (GenAI) isn&#39;t going to fade anytime soon. Users of GenAI are discovering and recommending new and interesting use cases for their business and personal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/14/upshot/up-ai-uses.html&quot;>;lives&lt;/a>;. Many recommendations start with the assumption that GenAI requires a human prompt. Indeed, &lt;em>;Time&lt;/em>; magazine recently proclaimed “prompt engineering” to be the next hot job, &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6272103/ai-prompt-engineer-job/&quot;>;with salaries reaching $335,000&lt;/a>;. Tech forums and educational websites are focusing on prompt engineering, with Udemy already offering a course &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/course/master-prompt-engineering-with-chatgpt&quot;>;on the topic&lt;/a>;, and several organizations we work with are now beginning to invest considerable resources in training employees on how best to use ChatGPT.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it may be worth pausing to consider other ways of interacting with GPT technologies, which are likely to emerge soon. We present an intuitive way to think about this issue, which is based on our own survey of GenAI developments, combined with conversations with companies that are seeking to develop some versions of these.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Framework of GPT Interactions&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A good starting point is to distinguish between who is &lt;em>;involved in the interaction&lt;/em>; — individuals, groups of people, or another machine — and &lt;em>;who starts the interaction,&lt;/em>; human or machine. This leads to six different types of GenAI uses, shown below. ChatGPT, where one human initiates interaction with the machine is already well-known. We now describe each of the other GPTs and outline their potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;CoachGPT&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;is a personal assistant that provides you with a set of suggestions on managing your daily life. It would base these suggestions not on explicit prompts from you, but on the basis of observing what you do and your environment. For example, it could observe you as an executive and note that you find it hard to build trust in your team; it could then recommend precise actions to overcome this blind spot. It could also come up with personalized advice on development options or even salary negotiations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CoachGPT would subsequently see which recommendations you adopted or didn&#39;t adopt, and which benefited you and which ones didn&#39;t to improve its advice over time. With time, you would get a highly personalized AI advisor, coach, or consultant.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations could adopt CoachGPT to advise customers on how to use a product, whether a construction company offering CoachGPT to advise end users on how best to use its equipment, or an accounting firm proffering real-time advice on how best to account for a set of transactions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To make CoachGPT effective, individuals and organizations would have to allow it to work in the background, monitoring online and offline activities. Clearly, serious privacy considerations need to be addressed before we entrust our innermost thoughts to the system. However, the potential for positive outcomes in both private and professional lives is immense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;GroupGPT &lt;/strong>;would be a bona fide group member that can observe interactions between group members and contribute to the discussion. For example, it could conduct fact checking, supply a summary of the conversation, suggest what to discuss next, play the role of devil&#39;s advocate, provide a competitor perspective, stress-test the ideas, or even propose a creative solution to the problem at hand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The requests could come from individual group members or from the team&#39;s boss, who need not participate in team interactions, but merely seeks to manage, motivate, and evaluate group members. The contribution could be delivered to the whole group or to specific individuals, with adjustments for that person&#39;s role, skill, or personality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The privacy concerns mentioned above also apply to GroupGPT, but, if addressed, organizations could take advantage of GroupGPT by using it for project management, especially on long and complicated projects involving relatively large teams across different departments or regions. Since GroupGPT would overcome human limitations on information storage and processing capacity, it would be ideal for supporting complex and dispersed teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;BossGPT&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;takes an active role in advising a group of people on what they could or should do, without being prompted. It could provide individual recommendations to group members, but its real value emerges when it begins to coordinate the work of group members, telling them as a group who should do what to maximize team output. BossGPT could also step in to offer individual coaching and further recommendations as the project and team dynamics evolve.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The algorithms necessary for BossGPT to work would be much more complicated as they would have to consider somewhat unpredictable individual and group reactions to instructions from a machine, but it could have a wide range of uses. For example: an executive changing job could request a copy of her reactions to her first organization&#39;s BossGPT instructions, which could then be used to assess how she would fit into the new organization — and the new organization-specific BossGPT.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the organizational level companies could deploy BossGPT to manage people, thereby augmenting — or potentially even replacing — existing managers. Similarly, BossGPT has tremendous applications in coordinating work across organizations and managing complex supply chains or multiple suppliers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies could turn BossGPT into a product, offering their customers AI solutions to help them manage their business. These solutions could be natural extensions of the CoachGPT examples described earlier. For example, a company selling construction equipment could offer BossGPT to coordinate many end users on a construction site, and an accounting firm could provide it to coordinate the work of many employees of its customers to run the accounting function in the most efficient way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AutoGPT&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;entails a human giving a request or prompt to one machine, which in turn engages other machines to complete the task. In its simplest form, a human might instruct a machine to complete a task, but the machine realizes that it lacks a specific software to execute it, so it would search for the missing software on Google before downloading and installing it, and then using it &lt;a href=&quot;https://autogpt.net/auto-gpt-vs-chatgpt-how-do-they-differ-and-everything-you-need-to-know/&quot;>;to finish the request&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a more complicated version, humans could give AutoGPT a goal (such as creating the best viral YouTube video) and instruct it to interact with another GenAI to iteratively come up with the best ChatGPT prompt to achieve the goal. The machine would then launch the process by proposing a prompt to another machine, then evaluate the outcome, and adjust the prompt to get closer and closer to the final goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the most complicated version, AutoGPT could draw on functionalities of the other GPTs described above. For example, a team leader could task a machine with maximizing both the effectiveness and job satisfaction of her team members. AutoGPT could then switch between coaching individuals through CoachGPT, providing them with suggestions for smoother team interactions through GroupGPT, while at the same time issuing specific instructions on what needs to be done through BossGPT. AutoGPT could subsequently collect feedback from each activity and adjust all the other activities to reach the given goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the above versions, which are still to be created, a version of AutoGPT has been developed and was rolled out in April 2023, and it&#39;s quickly gaining broad acceptance. The technology is still not perfect and requires improvements, but it is already evident that AutoGPT is able to complete a set of jobs that requires the completion of several tasks one after the other.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We see its biggest applications in complex tasks, such as supply chain coordination, but also in fields such as cybersecurity. For example, organizations could prompt AutoGPT to continually address any cybersecurity vulnerabilities, which would entail looking for them — which already happens — but then instead of simply flagging them, AutoGPT would search for solutions to the threats or write its own patches to counter them. A human might still be in the loop, but since the system is self-generative within these limits, we believe that AutoGPT&#39;s response is likely to be faster and more efficient.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ImperialGPT&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;is the most abstract GenAI — and perhaps the most transformational — in which two or more machines would interact with each other, direct each other, and ultimately direct humans to engage in a course of action. This type of GPT worries most AI analysts, who fear losing control of AI and AI “going rogue.” We concur with these concerns, particularly if — as now — there are no strict guardrails on what AI is allowed to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, if ImperialGPT is allowed to come up with ideas and share them with humans, but its ability to act on the ideas is restricted, we believe that this could generate extremely interesting creative solutions especially for “unknown unknowns,” where human knowledge and creativity fall short. They could then easily envision and game out multiple black swan events and worst-case scenarios, complete with potential costs and outcomes, to provide possible solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given the potential dangers of ImperialGPT, and the need for tight regulation, we believe that ImperialGPT will be slow to take off, at least commercially. We do anticipate, however, that governments, intelligence services, and the military will be interested in deploying ImperialGPT under strictly controlled conditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Implications for your Business&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;So, what does our framework mean for companies and organizations around the world? First and foremost, we encourage you to step back and see the recent advances in ChatGPT as merely the first application of new AI technologies. Second, we urge you to think about the various applications outlined here and use our framework to develop applications for your own company or organization. In the process, we are sure you will discover new types of GPTs that we have not mentioned. Third, we suggest you classify these different GPTs in terms of potential value to your business, and the cost of developing them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We believe that applications that begin with a single human initiating or participating in the interaction (GroupGPT, CoachGPT) will probably be the easiest to build and should generate substantial business value, making them the perfect initial candidates. In contrast, applications with interactions involving multiple entities or those initiated by machines (AutoGPT, BossGPT, and ImperialGPT) may be harder to implement, with trickier ethical and legal implications.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You might also want to start thinking about the complex ethical, legal, and regulatory concerns that will arise with each GPT type. Failure to do so exposes you and your company to both legal liabilities and — perhaps more importantly — an unintended negative effect on humanity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our next set of recommendations depends on your company type. A tech company or startup, or one that has ample resources to invest in these technologies, should start working on developing one or more of the GPTs discussed above. This is clearly a high-risk, high-reward strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, if your competitive strength is not in GenAI or if you lack resources, you might be better off adopting a “wait and see” approach. This means you will be slow to adopt the current technology, but you will not waste valuable resources on what may turn out to be only an interim version of a product. Instead, you can begin preparing your internal systems to better capture and store data as well as readying your organization to embrace these new GPTs, in terms of both work processes and culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The launch and rapid adoption of GenAIs is rightly being considered as the next level in the evolution of AI and a potentially epochal moment for humanity in general. Although GenAIs represent breakthroughs in solving fundamental engineering and computer science problems, they do not automatically guarantee value creation for all organizations. Rather, smart companies will need to invest in modifying and adapting the core technology before figuring out the best way to monetize the innovations. Firms that do this right may indeed strike it rich in the GenAI goldrush.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 22 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
