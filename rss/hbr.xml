&lt;span>;&lt;p>;您的团队是否忘记了自己的宗旨和共同努力的目标？如果是这样，那么可能是时候进行团队重组，重点是重新调整。或者，也许你的团队感觉不再像一个团队了？也许团队成员感到脱节、无效或沮丧，甚至小问题也会产生摩擦？在这种情况下，你的重置必须集中于重振团队活力。本文重点介绍管理者可以用来解决一致性差距的一些方法，以启动新的、更健康、更快乐的团队动态。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt; div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/20-questions-to-ask-when-your-teams-vibe-is-off?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href =&quot;/2023/07/20-questions-to-ask-when-your-teams-vibe-is-off?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;您的团队感觉如何被卡住、受阻，或者只是有点陈旧？您是否陷入了不再为您服务的日常生活中？没关系;即使在平静的水域中，团队也需要偶尔修正路线。在当今波涛汹涌的大海中，当我们处理重返办公室和混合工作安排时，您可能需要制定全新的路线。好消息是，重置团队可能比您想象的更容易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您的第一步是反思感觉不对的地方。您可以从两大类来思考它。首先，问题是你的团队忽视了你的目的和你正在努力实现的目标吗？如果是这样，你的重置将需要集中于重新调整。另一种可能性（也可能两者兼而有之）是你们不再感觉自己像一个团队了。也许团队成员会感到孤立、无效或沮丧——以至于即使是小问题也会产生摩擦。在这种情况下，你的重置必须集中于重振团队活力。以下是如何驾驭这两种方法：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;重新调整&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;出于两个原因，您需要优先考虑重新调整而不是振兴。首先，许多团队功能障碍表现为信任问题，而实际上，它们源于目标、优先事项或期望的差异。消除这些误解通常可以解决您认为的人际问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从重新调整开始的另一个原因是，它可以让您将重置与外部转变而不是个人行为问题联系起来，从而不太可能触发防御性。当你重新调整时，你不是在评判任何人；而是在评判任何人。相反，您会问自己需要如何发展才能利用机遇并减轻新出现的风险。以下是一些重新调整的锚点。选择最适合您情况的选项。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置团队的任务。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;第一种可能性是您团队的目标需要发展。你可以通过这些问题探讨这种可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;哪些外部趋势需要我们适应？&lt;/strong>;外部环境最显着的变化是什么，它们是如何变化的您的团队的背景？例如，如果您是内容营销团队，ChatGPT 如何改变您团队的价值？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;公司战略的转变如何影响您的角色？&lt;/strong>;您的组织是否有新的愿景、战略或 KPI 会改变您的团队需要交付的内容吗？例如，如果您是人力资源团队，开设欧洲办事处是否需要新的能力或活动？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您在组织中的价值如何演变？&lt;/strong>;随着组织的发展和变化，团队的角色可以演变。您的组织结构的变化将如何要求您重新关注？例如，如果您的研发团队现在支持两个单位而不是一个单位，您将如何定制您的产品？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置团队的目标。&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h3>; &lt;p>;如果您的任务发生了变化，您肯定需要重新审视您的目标，但即使您的目的没有改变，您的目标也可能需要更新。因此，请将这些视为移动目标的理由。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您将如何在先前成果的基础上继续发展？&lt;/strong>;您在上个季度取得了哪些成就，以及这些变化有何变化您希望未来几个季度的发展轨迹是什么？如果您已经实现了目标，它们是否足够雄心勃勃？另一方面，如果您一直未能实现目标，您是否需要降低目标或冒着让所有人士气低落的风险？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;外部因素将如何影响您的目标？是否有任何外部因素可能表明目标发生变化？例如，您是否需要根据经济衰退、供应链积压或劳动力短缺来调整预期？另一方面，如果您的团队受益于新技术进步，您能否完成比计划更多的任务？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您可以采取哪些措施来改进措施？&lt;/strong>;您的目标是否模糊，或者你的指标模糊吗？提高一致性的最快方法可能是收紧您的定义或调整您的指标，使您是否获得吸引力更加明显。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置您的战略和战术。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置您的战略和战术。 strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;基于您的任务或目标的任何变化都将需要重新检查您的策略。但不要将策略更新限制在目标发生变化的情况下；考虑新的可能性可以随时进行良好的重置。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您的策略与您的任务一致吗？&lt;/strong>;如果您的任务或目标发生了变化，您的策略必须如何改变以应对？例如，如果您的团队的任务是为您的软件产品添加专业服务，那么如何才能使该业务模式取得成功？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您需要在哪些方面修改策略？&lt;/strong>;如果您仍在朝着现有目标努力，那么哪些措施有效，您可以在哪些方面改变策略？反过来说，你需要放弃什么？您可以在哪些方面加倍努力？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;可能会出现什么意外情况？&lt;/strong>;即使您坚持现有的任务、目标、战略和战术，您也可以通过考虑新的场景来重新设置并准备您的应急计划。您当前的计划包含哪些假设？什么会否定这些假设？表明某些事情正在发生变化的领先指标是什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置您的角色。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;您的团队可能走在正确的轨道上但你并没有优化团队成员的精力和才能。在这种情况下，请考虑有关个人责任的这些问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;人们需要角色改变吗？&lt;/strong>;角色或责任是否有任何改变会导致人们在你的团队中更有效吗？您需要更改某人的投资组合吗？您能否改变谁担任什么角色以获得多技能、发展或继任优势？谁可能会因新的挑战而重新焕发活力？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;如何使责任更加直接？&lt;/strong>;是否有机会微调人们的责任，使其更具吸引力？是否存在共同责任削弱人们义务感的地方？如何通过明确谁拥有哪些决策来提高一致性、效率和有效性？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;重新调整团队的最具建设性的方法之一是重新关注组织、同事和客户的职责指望你去做。重新点燃团队的热情并提醒他们你正在为了什么而奋斗是最好的起点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;振兴&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;第二种类型的重置是振兴你的团队活力。是否感觉你已经从一个真正的团队变成了一群松散的人，整体只不过是各个部分的总和？或者更糟糕的是，不信任或不健康的冲突是否会让团队合作产生负面影响？在这种情况下，您的重置可能需要更少关注您的团队需要做什么，而更多地关注您如何做。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置你的沟通习惯。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;随着时间的推移，团队可能会变得懒惰并陷入稀释联系的沟通模式。重新审视您的沟通习惯可以帮助您重新建立联系。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您可以重置您的沟通渠道吗？&lt;/strong>;您是否默认使用某些未针对内容进行优化的沟通模式？例如，如果您使用 Zoom 来通知并通过电子邮件进行辩论，那么您就已经落后了。您能否使用更丰富的沟通工具来处理更新颖的内容、更有争议的讨论和不熟悉的参与者？您可以将信息项目分流到电子邮件吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;什么保证同步通信？&lt;/strong>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/hybrid-tanked-work-life-balance-heres-how -microsoft-is-trying-to-fix-it&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;表明，普通人的会议时间比大流行之前增加了一倍多。您可以异步共享哪些类型的信息，而不是让人们更好地控制自己的日程安排？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;如何实施停电期？&lt;/strong>; 除了大量的会议之外，大多数人还也被大量的电子邮件淹没。您的团队如何强制执行封锁期，让人们可以关闭通知并在没有通信义务的情况下工作？如何增加人们&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/to-control-your-life-control-what-you-pay-attention-to&quot;>;不受干扰&lt;/a>;工作的机会？&lt;/ li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置您的会议。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;如何优化您的常设会议？&lt;/strong>; 会议往往更频繁当它们具有同质含量时有效。您能否清理&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/a-step-by-step-guide-to-structuring-better-meetings&quot;>;会议结构&lt;/a>;，以区分需要不同心态和行为的内容？ &lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;参与者列表需要更改吗？&lt;/strong>;重置对话的一种方法是更改​​参与方。是时候退出一些会议并让您的团队掌控一切了吗？新的声音和新的观点会带来一些&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/if-your-team-agrees-on-everything-working-together-is-pointless&quot;>;富有成效的冲突&lt;/a>;吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您需要更好地准备吗？&lt;/strong>;低效的会议会让人恼火。您如何使用&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/02/how-to-create-the-perfect-meeting-agenda&quot;>;更好的入门文档&lt;/a>;来帮助团队成员做好准备，以基于证据和深思熟虑的方式做出贡献？ &lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;重置你的团队动力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;你的新基本规则是什么？&lt;/strong>;也许你您已经制定了&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/10/write-down-your-teams-unwriting-rules&quot;>;基本规则&lt;/a>;，但不再遵守它们，或者您从未制定过任何规则。哪些行为是你一直容忍而需要停止的？什么是受欢迎的补充？重新审视团队成员行为准则可能是一种很好的重置方式。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;您如何解决冲突债务？&lt;/strong>;如果您的团队一直在避免有关优先事项和交易的困难对话 -如果您的团队动力受到影响，您需要将问题公开化以解决问题。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;哪些活动可以增进对彼此的了解？&lt;/strong>; ，您可能希望在正式的团队开发活动中寻求外部帮助。例如，心理测量工具或团体辅导可以培养信任并促进坦诚。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;如果您的团队取得了很多成就，但发现这比必要的困难，那么这些不同的方法将启动一个新的、更健康的团队，更快乐的团队活力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，个人说明。当您考虑重新调整团队时，现在是考虑是否需要重新调整自己的方法的绝佳时机。例如，工作是否开始消耗比健康更多的时间和精力？你是否承担太多而委派太少？这也是考虑&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/more-than-50-of-managers-feel-burned-out&quot;>;作为团队领导者需要进行哪些重置&lt;/a>;的绝佳机会。&lt;/a>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;content js-target=&quot;article-content&quot; data-键=“3YweJvAl88VPtB91vUfc8eiQ​​wZ6y55E1LT/zYwnBXzZvF5uvZxGgZrY4wBFPptO7”数据索引=“BM5l29iJY6Ee+8B2yfNlrdgbvN4VLOJhHh/T44P8lW5iAHwuINYiqwQMPfwPWVfV/ 65Pc5IKYusMxkDTiCutYg==&quot;

&lt;p>;如果员工屡次失败，则说明他们缺少一个或多个基本支柱。你的工作是创建一个流程，作为绩效脚手架，以加强他们的一致性、能力和动力。从您分配任务的那一刻到他们交付任务的那一刻，此过程应该为该人员提供支持。它还应该否定他们的标准借口。但是，当然，您在该脚手架中到底需要哪些木板取决于该人的具体缺点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;明确目标&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;员工这样做的原因之一让你失望的是他们不知道出现会是什么样子。管理者常常以速度的名义缩短前期的协调对话。但这种仓促可能会让你付出代价，尤其是对于一个不可靠的员工。预先对一致性的投资可以实现良好的绩效，并且还提供了解决绩效不佳（如果绩效持续不佳）的框架。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先关注工作的目的。确立目标后，就不会为不同的观点、动机或最终目标留下任何借口。如果这个人没有战略眼光，看不到大局，或者他们自私自利，倾向于将自己的成功置于团队的成功之上，那么从目标开始也是有帮助的。你需要清楚地说明你想要实现的目标。这是给谁的？受益人如何定义成功？这项工作与其他举措或承诺有何契合点？回答这些问题可以减少对方声称他们不知道你想要什么的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦你对工作的目的达成一致，你就可以描绘出什么是好的、坏的、和不可接受的结果看起来像。但不幸的是，这是管理者经常跳过的另一个步骤。我将其称为情人节效应；无法清楚地表达出你想要什么，并且当对方没有做到时感到失望。对于你已经心存疑虑的员工来说，未能明确你的期望几乎肯定会让你失望。 To provide a rubric for their work, describe the minimum standard. What would you consider a home run? What outcomes would be worrisome or would you see as a failure?&amp;nbsp; Answering these questions eliminates the possibility that the person will pass off shoddy work as “good enough.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you make the goals clear, you remove the alignment excuses.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Align on the Optimal Approach &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A second major reason an employee might be making excuses for poor performance is that they don&#39;t have the skills or knowledge to do what you ask. If your trepidation is tied to gaps in the person&#39;s capability, your process must go beyond what they need to achieve and explore how they&#39;ll achieve it. Depending on your specific concerns, there are a few ways to broach this.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you suspect that the person might take shortcuts or neglect essential components, get into some detail about the required steps. Share effective approaches and provide precedents from previous projects. But don&#39;t make the mistake of doing all the talking; their nodding head cannot be interpreted as understanding. Instead, find out how they&#39;re processing the request by asking them to share their plan. Then you can provide any required course corrections with questions that direct their attention, such as, “What steps will you take to ensure finance is on board?” Answering these questions will remove the excuse that they didn&#39;t know how to tackle the project.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another possibility is that you&#39;re worried not about their technical but their people skills. If you&#39;re nervous that they&#39;ll botch the stakeholder relationships, make the interpersonal issues as salient as the technical ones. Work together to map the key stakeholders, their stake in the project, and any idiosyncrasies you might know. Who has sway over the decision? What are they looking for? What influences them? And beyond the decision makers and influencers, encourage the person to think about other people with valuable perspectives they need to include. Answer these questions to avoid excuses about insufficient support or ornery partners.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can also mitigate capability gaps by contemplating the decisions they might have to make and pre-qualifying the decision criteria. That way, you can be more confident that they&#39;ll make calls you&#39;d endorse. You can broach the subject in various ways, including asking about the criteria the person will use to evaluate any decisions or trade-offs. How will they prioritize the criteria when there isn&#39;t a perfect option? And lest they get stuck trying to have it all, it&#39;s helpful to clarify which criteria should influence how they implement the decision but not which decision they take.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you agree on the process, you strip away many of the capability excuses.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Raise the Stakes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve discussed alignment and capability issues. The third possibility for their failure is that they lack the motivation to get the job done. If your loss of faith is associated with their lack of oomph, emphasize their obligation and clarify what&#39;s at stake if they fail to deliver.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You have both carrot and stick options if you need to add a little incentive. Dangling the carrot would connect the successful delivery of the work to a variety of positive outcomes, such as how it will affect their reputation or future opportunities. On the other hand, wielding the stick entails listing negative ramifications if they don&#39;t deliver. And if possible, add some intrinsic rewards to those extrinsic consequences by talking about what the person enjoys about this kind of work and what reward they&#39;d get from doing it well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s one other motivation issue to prepare for; the person who starts full of vim and vigor but throws up their hands at the first hint of adversity. In that case, your process should inoculate the person against setbacks by preparing a plan B upfront. Spend some time anticipating what could go wrong and creating a game plan. What issues do you anticipate arising? How might they handle those types of problems? Be sure to specify which circumstances warrant the person escalating to you and which you&#39;d expect them to tackle independently. Addressing the contingencies and potential pitfalls will make it clear that you expect the person to persevere.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you articulate the consequences, you bolster the motivation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re managing a person who keeps letting you down and making excuses for why it wasn&#39;t their fault, don&#39;t waste your energy hoping they&#39;ll miraculously become trustworthy. Instead, work through a process that sets them up for success and removes the excuses in the process. Then if the employee fails to deliver and falls back on the “but, but, but…,” you&#39;ve got all the fodder you need for a performance management conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 17 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Software Companies Can Enter the U.S. Defense Market]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-software-companies-can-enter-the-u-s-defense-market]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_14_1374800771_1423913682.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/fad1986/Flavio Coelho/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Pentagon procurement procedures have long complicated commercial software companies&amp;#8217; entrance into the defense market difficult, but the authors&amp;#8217; experience working with both tech startups and the defense industry leads them to believe that now is a good time for companies to enter the market. They recommend starting by using commercial success to prompt small, one-time defense contracts, partnering with existing defense channels, and building a dedicated sales team. These tactics will bring the company recurring revenue and venture funding more quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-software-companies-can-enter-the-us-defense-market?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-software-companies-can-enter-the-us-defense-market?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When US software firms consider their primary markets, many largely avoid the defense sector. That&#39;s true whether they are established tech companies or early-stage startups. The reasons are clear: Pentagon &lt;a href=&quot;https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10599.pdf&quot;>;procurement&lt;/a>; has historically, and largely, focused only on the acquisition of physical supplies and equipment, yielding processes unsuited to software licensing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/us/politics/start-ups-weapons-pentagon-procurement.html&quot;>;Bureaucratic challenges&lt;/a>; also frustrate companies because they lead to long sales cycles. And many tech employees have refused to work on defense projects, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html&quot;>;citing cultural and ethical concerns&lt;/a>;. With these challenges, funding through venture capital and other sources has been hard to come by for firms operating in or looking to expand into the defense market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there have always been exceptions, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud services — or early-stage emerging technology startups, like the 50-person startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pendulum.global/&quot;>;Pendulum&lt;/a>; — that expanded to the defense market soon after finding commercial product-market fit. These exceptions prove that US software companies can succeed in the defense market. In addition, multiple factors are making the Defense Department&#39;s $800 billion budget more accessible to these firms. (We focus on the US in this article because it&#39;s hard to draw parallels to other countries&#39; very different startup cultures and defense markets.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our experience working with both startups and the defense industry leads us to believe that now is the time for founders of expanding software firms to consider the defense market. In this article we&#39;ll explain why and lay out a plan for selling to the government while attracting funding along the way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Why now?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Three factors make the defense market a much more appealing vertical for US software startups today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the Pentagon is a motivated customer and has already made some moves to court software vendors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2567486/artificial-intelligence-key-to-maintaining-military-economic-advantages-leaders/&quot;>;Determined&lt;/a>; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/china-acquiring-new-weapons-five-times-faster-than-us-warns-top-official&quot;>;keep pace&lt;/a>; with China&lt;u>;,&lt;/u>; it has increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1771387/faster-smarter-speed-is-key-in-acquisition-reform/&quot;>;the speed&lt;/a>; at which it procures and integrates emerging technologies by revising a number of its existing acquisition processes. The Defense Department has also established commercial-friendly organizations (such as the Defense Innovation Unit and AFWERX) and software-specific procurement processes (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.cyber.mil/connect/faq-connection-approval/&quot;>;Authority to Operate&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.af.mil/team/platformone/&quot;>;Platform One&lt;/a>;). It has created cloud software certifications such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedramp.gov/&quot;>;FedRAMP&lt;/a>; and partnered with AWS to offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/&quot;>;GovCloud&lt;/a>; to make it easier for software vendors to satisfy the security requirements to get their product in front of government employees. These changes have made it possible to spread commercial software to the government.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the defense market is stable amidst many commercial market headwinds. Widespread layoffs and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank have roiled commercial markets. For software companies, the market &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/22/why-a-downturn-can-separate-the-recession-proof-startups-from-the-hacks/&quot;>;downturn&lt;/a>; has caused return on sales spending to &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/report-in-face-of-recession-67-of-businesses-skip-customer-acquisition-turn-to-customer-retention/&quot;>;drop&lt;/a>;, customers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/surviving-the-saas-tsunami-optimize-renewal-processes-to-reduce-risk-and-free-up-cash-flow/&quot;>;slash&lt;/a>; IT budgets, and large enterprise sales to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/2022-saas-crash&quot;>;take longer&lt;/a>; to close. In contrast, the Defense Department is a stable customer. The Pentagon maintains a consistent and large budget, with high switching costs for their software solutions. Once a company lands a recurring revenue contract, annual revenue allocations are significant and low risk. This gives the Pentagon qualities similar to the largest, most attractive enterprise-sized commercial customers while also making it a more stable customer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, private capital investors are increasingly supporting companies in the defense market. The value of venture capital deals into aerospace and defense tech was &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/defense-space-vc-ukraine-recession&quot;>;greater&lt;/a>; in each of 2021 and 2022 than in all of 2010 through 2019 combined. We believe that the upward trend is caused by investor desire to engage a critical, yet digitally undisrupted industry. And it seems to be working: Defense contracts in areas like cybersecurity and AI are enabling investors to capture returns on investment. Landing recurring revenue from federal government contracts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense-c3ai&quot;>;shows&lt;/a>; enterprise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense-c3ai&quot;>;company&lt;/a>; maturity and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense-c3ai&quot;>;the&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense-c3ai&quot;>; ability to address complex needs&lt;/a>;. For AI data labeling startup Scale AI, for example, expanding into defense meant a trajectory-defining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedscoop.com/scale-ai-awarded-250m-ai-contract-by-department-of-defense/&quot;>;$250 million contract&lt;/a>; a year after their Series E. Top-tier firms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2022/01/14/building-american-dynamism-2/&quot;>;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundersfund.com/&quot;>;Founders Fund&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/josh-wolfes-war-the-lux-capital-founder-blazes-a-controversial-path-in-defense-tech&quot;>;Lux Capital&lt;/a>; and defense-focused firms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://americasfrontier.org/&quot;>;America&#39;s Frontier Fund&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shieldcap.com/&quot;>;Shield Capital&lt;/a>; are among those investing in the space.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to tackle the defense marketplace&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Despite the attraction, thousands of startups &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndia.org/policy/publications/vital-signs&quot;>;leave&lt;/a>; the defense market. Companies fail in the defense market because they mistake non-recurring revenue from the Pentagon as success and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dau.edu/library/defense-atl/blog/Valley-of-Death&quot;>;get trapped in the “valley of death,”&lt;/a>; crumbling before they build a scalable product worthy of recurring software subscriptions. (While most software companies aim for a recurring revenue model to gain stability and scale, this is even more critical for companies in the defense market, in which new contracts present even higher up-front R&amp;amp;D and customer acquisition costs.) On the other hand, companies also fail by focusing exclusively on generating annual recurring revenue through big-ticket sales like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dau.edu/glossary/Pages/GlossaryContent.aspx?itemid=28274&quot;>;programs of record&lt;/a>;, running out of money chasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KTmBoyle/status/1466845125884227587?s=20&amp;amp;t=CX4OlsZJ60ayi8D8delnUA&quot;>;long federal sales cycles&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Or they redesign their commercial products to meet the specific needs of individual defense customers. Such bespoke specifications limit the utility of the product to other defense customers, preventing scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, we&#39;ve observed that companies which have successfully scaled within the defense market have taken these three tactics:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Use Commercial Traction to Secure Early Defense Revenue &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A commercial company should enter the defense market only after it has achieved commercial product-market fit, where growth efforts are clearly resulting in customer traction. This allows the company to focus on defense customers that align most closely with its commercial customers while preventing &amp;nbsp;it from over-specializing specific defense products that are incapable of wider scale. In addition, commercial sales help these companies stay afloat during long federal sales cycles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For such an early-stage company, the first step into the defense market must be to secure non-recurring revenue, ie, one-time grants, such as Small Business Innovation Research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbir.gov/&quot;>;SBIR&lt;/a>;) awards and/or Accelerate the Procurement and Fielding of Innovative Technologies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3098211/dod-announces-first-set-of-projects-to-receive-funding-from-the-pilot-program-t/&quot;>;APFIT&lt;/a>;). These opportunities provide the funding necessary for companies to avoid what is called the “valley of death” — in which a company perpetually achieves one-time revenue contracts that are unable to deliver sufficient returns on investment to justify costs — by identifying defense revenue potential and possible defense product-market fit while mitigating the costs startups face in the defense market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key, however, is to not mistake non-recurring revenue for success, or even meaningful business. Rather, non-recurring revenue comprises the training wheels for the earliest-stage companies to first find defense product-market fit and build relationships before taking the next steps to secure recurring revenue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Use Existing Channels to Get to Recurring Revenue Faster&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A company can cut down the time required to move from non-recurring revenue to recurring revenue by leveraging existing sales channels — big players already in the business of selling to the defense market. The most common channel partners are prime defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman. “Primes” are intimately familiar with procurement processes and control multiple channels for delivering solutions through the Pentagon&#39;s 2.2-million-person bureaucracy. Partnering with these primes enables companies to quickly deliver product to government employees so they can validate product-market fit as soon as possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The primes&#39; sales channels offer several opportunities to validate product-market fit. For example, Applied Intuition, an autonomy software company, started in the automotive sector but identified a defense market need for its offerings. As a first foray into defense, they subcontracted with prime contractor and vehicle manufacturer General Dynamics to &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/omfv-gd-emphasizes-ai-adaptability-for-bradley-replacement/&quot;>;bid on an autonomous vehicle design in 2021&lt;/a>;. Since then, they&#39;ve been able to win meaningful &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.applied.co/blog-post/department-of-defense-bpa&quot;>;direct defense business&lt;/a>;. Primes also offer an opportunity for software companies to integrate their product within a prime&#39;s hardware platforms so companies don&#39;t have to build their own hardware or convince government buyers to sign up for annual software subscriptions. Overwatch Imaging, for example, puts their imaging software on cameras that prime contractor L3Harris sells directly to the government, bypassing the need to have government buyers subscribe to Overwatch Imaging&#39;s software directly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are some downsides to working with primes. As hardware or services businesses, their meager software-reselling efforts may generate revenue at levels that are uninteresting to startups; they also often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2023/06/05/the-pentagon-is-to-blame-for-industrial-base-failures/?&quot;>;squeeze their suppliers on payment terms&lt;/a>;. Companies may also get stuck as subcontractors only to be acquired for a middling price. For companies that decide that partnering with a prime is too risky, there are other existing channels to explore, such as big tech platforms like AWS and Snowflake. Their marketplaces tend to work better with software partners — though big tech platforms offer less value to startups in the defense marketplace than primes..&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless, the value companies find in working with any of these existing sales channels is saving time and money in learning whether selling to the Defense Department is a compelling business strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Build a Dedicated Team to Scale Defense Sales &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Successful commercial-first companies with validated defense product-market fit can scale their product and achieve sustainable recurring revenue by establishing a dedicated federal sales team. Properly setting up a federal team allows companies to chase recurring revenue opportunities and create a steadfast defense software business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Commercial deals close &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/new-insight-into-key-sales-metrics&quot;>;in a matter of months&lt;/a>; and larger deals take closer to a year, while federal deals typically take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2020/9/14/the-shape-of-the-federal-sale&quot;>;well over a year&lt;/a>;. Thus successful commercial companies entering the defense market compensate their federal sales teams through multi-year quotas and pay commissions on renewals to ensure deep, long-term product deployment. These companies measure federal sales success by focusing on upcoming pipeline and customer touchpoints.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Federal sales require salespeople who possess the rare combination of having federal customer knowledge and relationships (usually through public sector experience), as well as a personality suited for the team-based environment necessary to close complex federal deals, relative to commercial salespeople, who tend to be territorial and competitive.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The objective of the sales team is to achieve the annual recurring revenue necessary to grow a strong defense business. The most popular goal is for the company to be included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.defense.gov/Portals/57/Documents/BPII-MPTW17%20slides/Tuesday/Yarmie_Finding%20The%20Right%20Transition%20Path.pdf?ver=2017-09-11-143251-370/#:~:text=A%20Program%20of%20Record%20(POR,response%20to%20an%20approved%20need.&quot;>;Programs of Record&lt;/a>;, meaning that they are working on a project tied into a line item written in the Defense Department&#39;s annual budget. However, there are other options to capture recurring revenue. One popular pathway is through the decentralized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dau.edu/acquipedia/pages/ArticleContent.aspx?itemid=339&quot;>;Operations &amp;amp; Maintenance (O&amp;amp;M) contracts&lt;/a>; widely available across the Department. Accessing these types of funds requires consistent coordination with operational military personnel, but obtaining the contracts can be incredibly simple (for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsa.gov/buy-through-us/purchasing-programs/gsa-multiple-award-schedule/about-gsa-schedule#:~:text=The%20GSA%20Schedule%2C%20also%20known,reasonable%20prices%20to%20the%20government.&quot;>;GSA schedule&lt;/a>;). This is analogous to bottoms-up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.productled.org/foundations/what-is-product-led-growth&quot;>;product-led&lt;/a>; growth rather than a centralized approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Finding the right investor backing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While companies can seek investor support at any of these steps, companies have the greatest likelihood of raising funding after finding product-market fit in the defense market. Three categories of venture capital (VC) firms operate in the defense market: Large firms, defense-oriented firms, and strategic investors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large VC firms are generalist firms possessing billion-dollar-funds, such as Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and Founders Fund. They fund companies that can become category-defining unicorns. The reason for this is that VC returns are driven by a few successful outliers (often called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/057ced93-4211-444a-9fcc-1714e1d35c79&quot;>;Power Law&lt;/a>;): The larger the fund size, the bigger individual companies need to become to return the fund&#39;s capital. Therefore, headline-grabbing VC defense investments often highlight companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/24/filing-anduril-is-raising-up-to-1-2b-sources-say-at-a-7b-pre-money-valuation-for-its-defense-tech/&quot;>;Anduril&lt;/a>; that only pursue defense sales because they are capable of challenging existing prime contractors. But commercial companies entering the defense market can also secure checks from large VC firms after demonstrating the potential for massive scale across the Pentagon. For example, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://scale.com/&quot;>;Scale AI&lt;/a>; only had a $750,000 non-recurring SBIR before raising their $325 million Series E, the additional funding helped them get a $250 million defense contract a year later.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many defense investments also come from specialist mid-sized VC firms that explicitly help companies scale in defense. For example, America&#39;s Frontier Fund and Shield Capital have traditional venture capital fund structures but dedicate their resources and networks to support companies selling to defense. Specialist VCs do not need category-defining success to make the same return allowing them to support a wider range of companies selling to defense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strategic corporate investors such as Lockheed Martin Ventures and Boeing&#39;s HorizonX-AE Industrial study emerging technologies and offer strategic partnerships on top of earning returns. For example, Lockheed Martin Ventures&#39; efforts to scout AI/ML tech &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2020/08/lockheed-martin-ventures-scouts-next-gen-ai-ml-tech/&quot;>;led to its investment&lt;/a>; in Fiddler. Strategic investors look after their parent corporation&#39;s strategic interests and can even help startups become a vendor to their parent corporation (L3Harris invested in Overwatch Imaging while adopting their technology). Strategic government investors such as In-Q-Tel, the US intelligence community&#39;s venture capital outfit, prioritize technology relevance. Strategic investors can often help with getting non-recurring funding, being a channel partner at the earliest stages, and providing credibility for the next round.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defense market is primed to be transformed by cutting-edge software. This sea change need not be limited to a select few defense-only tech startups or contractors. Defense can be a lucrative additional vertical, for today&#39;s US commercial software companies—one that looks particularly attractive today.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 14 Jul 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Reenergize Your Team When Morale Is Low]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_14_200215009-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Tara Moore/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Employees everywhere are suffering from chronic low engagement and productivity levels, while stress and burnout continue to rise. Add to this the pressures of economic uncertainty and a potential recession, the threat of artificial intelligence automating jobs and skills and disrupting entire industries, and the sense of languishing and loneliness that increasingly permeate the work experiences of many, and the overall picture is rather bleak. If you want to compete for talent, and create truly appealing environments in your team and organization, where people thrive and excel, you must help them rediscover the human (and humane) qualities that make work more than just work. This is particularly critical for those who manage people, with meta-analytic studies showing that around 30% to 40% of the variability in team morale, performance, and critical organizational behaviors (both good and bad) can be explained by what managers and leaders do. Simply put: bosses play a key role impacting the well-being and success of teams.

There is no shortage of historical examples to illustrate this consistent research finding: from Catherine the Great&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnodo-newtonic.com/catherine-the-great-accomplishments&quot;>;nation building&lt;/a>;, to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/10/fergusons-formula&quot;>;Sir Alex Ferguson&#39;s record-breaking Manchester United&lt;/a>;, to Satya Nadella&#39;s radical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/22/how-satya-nadella-turned-microsoft-around&quot;>;transformation &lt;/a>;of Microsoft, effective collaboration between people is dramatically enhanced with effective leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With that, we see three potential action areas for managers and leaders who want to enhance their team&#39;s morale, well-being and performance, particularly during tough or uncertain times.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Revitalizing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In any organization, the level of energy and output differs as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08959280701332968&quot;>;much &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08959280701332968&quot;>;within&lt;/a>; as between individuals. The same employee may be highly productive one year and unproductive the next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the presence of adverse circumstances (eg, economic crisis, political instability, a global pandemic, etc.) dips in morale and performance are likely in many teams. Thus, managers and people leaders should focus on revitalizing their teams, which is fundamentally about energizing and motivating people again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good way to achieve this is to start with the why, consistent with the notion that a critical aspect of leadership is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002188638201800303?journalCode=jaba&quot;>;“manage meaning&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002188638201800303?journalCode=jaba&quot;>;.&lt;/a>;” Humans crave meaning, and leaders are well positioned to shape meaning, helping us make sense of the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important task is to emphasize — often — why the work a team is doing matters. Even in tough economic conditions, most people have alternative options for their careers, bringing doubt and uncertainty about where to go, what to do next, and how to decide.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When leaders help people to remember and embrace the why&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; they are more likely to believe that they matter to the success of the company&#39;s goals. This is energizing, and can make people feel re-energized. One way to do this is to celebrate past achievements and link them to future objectives and successes. Emphasize social ties among team members and remind team members of their shared history and past challenges, to help them feel connected to each other, and to the team&#39;s mission.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What can you do to revitalize?&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Emphasize and re-emphasize the team&#39;s or organization&#39;s purpose.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Ask people what matters to them, what they really care about/believe in.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Ask people to describe how what they do (their role) affects the team and ultimately the customers (or those served by the organization&#39;s work)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Invite people to say what they get from each other — what they appreciate about working together.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;Repairing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This is about using the power of leadership to heal existing and past wounds, restore wellbeing, and address human rather than business problems. All human relationships are subject to breakdown via misunderstanding, disagreement, conflict, and failures. Smart leaders help their &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/04/strategies-for-learning-from-failure&quot;>;teams learn from failures&lt;/a>; and turn them into valuable lessons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To achieve this, vulnerability goes a long way, enabling &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Edmondson%20Psychological%20safety.pdf&quot;>;psychological safety&lt;/a>; and candor in your team. Be open, transparent, honest, and self-critical, all in the interest of fostering an open dialogue and uniting the team to pursue collaboration and progress. In our view, one of the best ways to assess your leadership talent is by examining the proportion of bad news to good news you receive as a manager or leader: If it&#39;s lower than 2-to-5, you probably have room for improvement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What can you do to repair?&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Suggest to your team that you all take a look at some of their recent struggles/breakdowns. Identify one or two that stand out in importance, or that are simply recent enough to be conducive to an honest conversation.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Next, ask each person to consider what they did, or failed to do, that in some small or larger way may have played a role in the breakdown.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Listen, understand, forgive, recommit.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;Refocusing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Help your team regain focus by aligning team members on key priorities. Remember that less is more, especially when teams are tired and fatigued.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also remember that you can never over-communicate, while under-communicating is easier than you think and a major cause of most team problems. In particular, shying away from difficult conversations and being conflict avoidant are sure-fire ways to ensure worse conflict in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider ending each year (or starting the new year) with a clear strategy session, aligning people on key goals and execution plans. Remember that, as Michael Porter &lt;a href=&quot;/1996/11/what-is-strategy&quot;>;noted&lt;/a>;, strategy is as much about deciding what &lt;em>;not to do&lt;/em>; as what to do. Your key objective should be to ensure everybody understands the what, why, and how, to get them excited about being on the bus, going into an enticing destination, and playing their role to help everybody achieve challenging goals together. In this way, the journey can even be enjoyable.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What can you do to refocus?&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Ask your team the following questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What can we do better?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What can we let go of?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What is truly essential for achieving the work that we really believe matters&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;A final consideration pertains to you … not as a manager, but as a human. Just as on a plane, we are instructed to put on our oxygen masks before we can help others, we must help ourselves first. Your ability to energize your team will depend on whether you can stay sane, calm, and energized yourself. There&#39;s no substitute for working on your own wellness, and managing yourself is a critical pre-condition for managing others. In that sense, the worst leadership mistake you can make is to prioritize your team over yourself, for it is only once you can revitalize, repair, and refocus yourself, that you&#39;ll be able to help your people follow suit.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 14 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Build a Winning AI Strategy for Your Business]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/build-a-winning-ai-strategy-for-your-business]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_14_1494647585.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Artur Debat/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Artificial intelligence is a kind of catalyst; it&amp;#8217;s the next wave of truly transformative technology with potential we cannot yet fully envision or appreciate.

They should: start by experimenting, deploy for productivity, transform experiences, and then try to build new things.

It was pretty uneventful and not something I gave much thought. Ride-sharing is simple and convenient, and it&#39;s now an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/02/22/2612873/0/en/Ride-Sharing-Market-Size-worth-USD-242-73-Billion-Globally-by-2028-at-a-CAGR-of-16-3.html&quot;>;$80+ billion&lt;/a>; industry. But it wasn&#39;t that long ago that it didn&#39;t even exist. We had cars, we had riders, and we had drivers; but to work, ride-sharing needed smartphones. When they arrived, so did an enormous variety of conveniences and new experiences — some that became entire industries — that we never could have imagined.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Artificial intelligence is a similar kind of catalyst; it&#39;s the next wave of truly transformative technology with potential we cannot yet fully envision or appreciate. It is the defining technology of our time, changing the way we live and work. In my entire career in tech, I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/2023/05/how-generative-ai-changes-strategy&quot;>;never been more excited&lt;/a>; and optimistic than I am now. I have a colleague at Microsoft who talks about AI like this: You&#39;ve got to use the “new thing” to do old things better. Then, you use the new thing to … do new things. &lt;em>;He&#39;s right.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider an example from health care. &lt;a href=&quot;https://paige.ai/&quot;>;Paige&lt;/a>; is a software company using AI to change the way doctors identify, diagnose, and treat cancers. With properly trained and tuned models, AI can look at thousands of digital pathology images, pixel by pixel, and detect abnormalities faster and with more accuracy. Imagine what these tools can unlock not only for pathologists and doctors, but for patients, too. It means earlier disease detection, healthier lives, and more time with loved ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now every company, no matter the size or industry, should be thinking about AI. AI is moving from its auto-pilot phase, which was all about narrow, purpose-built tools that use machine learning models to make predictions, recommendations, and automate, to its copilot phase, where there&#39;s tremendous opportunity to revolutionize how &lt;em>;just about everything&lt;/em>; gets done. Leaders who embrace AI now and take action to understand it, experiment with it, and envision how it can solve hard problems are going to run companies that thrive in an AI world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But where should they start? Nearly every day, I talk with business leaders who ask important questions about AI&#39;s potential. No matter where you are in your AI journey, it&#39;s incumbent upon every leader to embrace this unique time and take advantage of this powerful technology. If you feel unsure how to start, or how to move forward, you&#39;re not alone. Like any business-planning exercise, think about your AI strategy in phases. Embrace agility and change, and keep a continuous learning mindset, calibrating and adjusting your gameplan as you go.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Start by Experimenting&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The best way to learn about AI is to use it. It&#39;s rare for new and disruptive technology to be immediately accessible. This is. Most of the leaders I talk with have tried popular AI applications like ChatGPT or the new Bing. There are many other options out there, but the point is to get curious.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Try applying it to whatever task is in front of you and see what it&#39;s good at and what it&#39;s not. Use it to generate interview questions, write a memo, research and summarize a topic you want to learn more about, or get thought starters for a document. I used Bing and ChatGPT to help me get ideas for a speech. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve used Microsoft 365 Copilot, the AI integration across Microsoft apps to generate slides, to find and summarize documents that share a topic, and to recap email exchanges with colleagues. By using and experimenting with AI, you&#39;ll be in a better position to imagine how it could be used in your organization — and you likely know better than anyone where opportunities and potential exist.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Deploy for Productivity&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When it comes to productivity, AI copilots — from Microsoft and from others — can be deployed or embedded in applications to assist or simplify certain tasks. Less than two years since its launch, GitHub&#39;s Copilot is already writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/github-copilot-generates-up-to-46-of-all-code-but-you-re-not-out-of-a-job/#:~:text=46%25%20of%20all%20code%20created,61%25%20of%20suggestions%20from%20Copilot.&quot;>;46%&lt;/a>; of the code on its repository and helps developers code up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/github-copilot-generates-up-to-46-of-all-code-but-you-re-not-out-of-a-job/#:~:text=46%25%20of%20all%20code%20created,61%25%20of%20suggestions%20from%20Copilot.&quot;>;55%&lt;/a>; faster. Imagine what developers are doing with that extra time. Three out of four users say it helps them conserve mental energy and focus on more satisfying work. Said another way: Creating new things and solving new problems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider the workflows and process-driven activities in your business: things like payroll, on-boarding, or IT help desk support. These are all repeatable, rules-based processes that can be streamlined with AI. This is the driver behind an entire new category of AI software that can handle manual tasks and reshape scores of business processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s another way to think about AI for productivity: time. If you&#39;re in fraud detection, or you&#39;re a security analyst, time can be your biggest asset or your biggest challenge. If you can shorten the amount of time it takes to comb through lots of data-rich, time-sensitive information, you&#39;re already better and more effective at your job.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Transform Experiences&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Today, AI is already impacting how businesses deliver experiences that are better, faster, more efficient, or entirely new, from predictive text on your phone to chatbots on websites to suggested searches when you open a browser.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-us-makes-billion-investment-in-ai-capabilities.html&quot;>;PwC&lt;/a>; is using Azure OpenAI Service to expand and scale its own AI offerings while also helping clients in industries like insurance or healthcare reimagine their businesses by leveraging the power of generative AI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1501304071775762777-carmax-retailer-azure-openai-service&quot;>;CarMax&lt;/a>; is using it to analyze hundreds of thousands of customer reviews and surface key takeaways for buyers about every make, model, and year of vehicle in its inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in its early stages, AI is making employee experiences better too. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/four-ways-leaders-can-empower-people-for-how-work-gets-done&quot;>;recent Microsoft survey&lt;/a>; found that 89% of employees and business decision makers with access to automation and AI-powered tools feel more fulfilled. They say it&#39;s because they can spend time on work that truly matters. Nine out of 10 said they want the opportunity to apply AI solutions to &lt;em>;even more&lt;/em>; tasks and activities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I see that happening already in some of the organizations I work with. They&#39;re pursuing more advanced AI in use cases like customer support, writing assistance, or data extraction and classification. The common thread in each of these involves using AI to leverage resources or information &lt;em>;you already have &lt;/em>;to transform experiences for people.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Build New Things&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The above steps are versions of using the “new thing” to do old things better, to borrow my colleague&#39;s turn of phrase. But how can you use the new thing to actually do new things? What can you do that&#39;s completely different? How can you delight customers and create new lines of business and, with them, new revenue?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the challenge before business leaders right now; and it&#39;s a hard one. The answer starts with integrating AI into your organization and iterating from there. Because while AI will enable people and organizations to achieve more, we&#39;re at the very beginning of defining what “more” looks like. But to move ahead, we need to put in place the conditions that we help us discover what comes next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the really exciting things about using AI to be more efficient — whether that&#39;s using generative AI to get ideas or &amp;nbsp;to conduct research — is that it allows you to think more deeply about a concept or a problem you&#39;re trying to solve. It&#39;s not a far leap to imagine how this level of concentrated effort is going to enable companies to develop truly new and innovative solutions faster; and then take advantage of the snowball effect of that speed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Throughout: Prioritize Security &amp;amp; Responsible AI&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Alongside all of AI&#39;s promise, one thing is certain. We will not realize AI&#39;s full potential without safeguards. Technology has always been an accelerator and an enabler. AI is no different, but it does present potential risks that have to be managed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For any company, the success of Responsible AI initiatives depends on at least three things. First, it takes committed and involved leadership. (Microsoft&#39;s Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith, and our Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, chair our Responsible AI Council.) Second, companies must build inclusive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1:primaryr6&quot;>;governance models&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai-resources&quot;>;actionable guidelines&lt;/a>;, as we have done. Finally, they must also invest in responsible AI in the form of new engineering systems, incubations that are research-led, and in the people who will ensure that responsible AI principles are put into practice. At Microsoft, we have hundreds of people working on this, and for many of them, it&#39;s their full-time job. Beyond that, we&#39;ve adopted the mindset that using AI responsibly is a responsibility we all share, no matter your role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The AI roadmap will be different for every organization, and it looks different depending on whether you&#39;re a tech company or not. Tech companies are more likely to have already implemented some form of intelligent agent into their software experiences, for example. But for everyone, the potential is massive, and the time to start is now.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like ride-sharing needed smartphones, there are as-yet conceived industries that will need AI to get off the ground. Most of us recognize that AI will be completely game-changing. We see the practical applications — not only for the tech landscape but for humanity, and that&#39;s what&#39;s truly profound about this.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The AI market is moving quickly, and the cycles in and around AI are faster than we&#39;ve ever seen. Right now, there is tremendous opportunity for business leaders to embrace AI and adapt to the profound changes that are coming. There is exponentially greater opportunity for the businesses that use AI to lead and drive that change.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 14 Jul 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
