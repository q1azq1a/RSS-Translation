&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;设定净零目标只是气候战略的开始。现在面临着取得实质性进展的压力。对于许多公司来说，大部分温室气体 (GHG) 排放位于其供应链业务范围之外，称为“范围 3”排放。了解、量化并最终管理这些排放是很困难的。虽然这些影响超出了公司的直接控制范围，但利益相关者的期望、报告框架和业务需求要求大公司激活其合作伙伴并取得进展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你能做对，回报会很高。这不仅是为了减少对地球的影响，也是为了建立一个价值链，使我们能够实现未来的增长，并能够应对气候变化。全球气候危机是我们启动&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pepsico.com/who-we-are/our-commitments/pepsico-positive&quot;>;百事积极 (pep+) &lt;/a>;转型的催化剂并设定了到 2040 年实现净零排放的目标。从那时起，百事公司已将供应链关系提升到新的协作水平，并制定了一系列战略，旨在让供应商合作伙伴加入我们的旅程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从根本上说，百事公司的业务植根于农业。气候变化将影响农作物，也会影响农民及其所能提供的产量。我们必须制定明确的业务战略，以管理我们对气候的影响，并使我们的公司在未来更具弹性和竞争力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在内部，我们不断努力将净零思维融入我们的团队。例如，百事公司通过将范围 1 和范围 2 的减排量纳入公司 200 名高管薪酬审查流程的一部分来激励进步，我们正在努力能够更准确地量化范围 3 的排放量，以便我们可以将该指标纳入其中&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;运营新时代&quot; dek=&quot;提高效率并增强弹性”。 cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>;

提高效率并增强弹性。 &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;在我们的价值链中，拥有超过 100,000 个不同规模和能力的供应商，一个一刀切的方法无法实现净零所需的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以采取的方法有很多，我们也在此过程中吸取了教训。但我们相信，为了成功实现供应链合作伙伴的参与，以及更重要的是供应链合作伙伴的行动，您必须正确把握三个基本要素——期望、经济性和支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>; &lt;strong>;期望&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;与供应链合作伙伴设定明确且一致的期望是成功的基础。公司必须让供应商知道减排的重要性，特别是当它需要随着时间的推移进行衡量时。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，在我们的农业供应链中，农民对排放的理解程度不同。有些人意识到气候变化及其影响，而另一些人甚至没有意识到这一点。作为领导者，我们必须为我们的供应商和其他供应链合作伙伴提供清晰一致的指导方针，以便他们能够了解自己在我们现在和未来的旅程中所扮演的角色。我们在年度全球供应商峰会上提出了这些期望，并要求我们的合作伙伴采取四项具体的近期行动：&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;报告范围 1 和报告范围 2到 2023 年底向我们排放 2 份。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;设定或承诺设定&lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebasedtargets.org/how-it-works&quot;>;基于科学的目标（ SBT）&lt;/a>;，到 2023 年底。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;在 2023 年底之前，将百事公司的部分电力负荷转换为可再生电力（如果有）。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;对于农业供应商，合作与我们一起制定可持续成分行动计划，并在 2023 年底前建设再生农业面积。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;制定减排 SBT 提供了明确的结构和框架。跟踪整个价值链的数据对于了解进展的广度和速度至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这对于我们一些供应商的运营来说是一个重大转变。在某些情况下，这不仅涉及投资，还涉及改变运营方式。供应商关系比以往任何时候都更需要从交易关系转变为伙伴关系。企业可以利用自己的规模和知识来帮助供应商转型——作为合作伙伴并一路提供支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;经济&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在参与供应时对于连锁合作伙伴，公司经常犯这样的错误：仅通过经济激励（或抑制）来支持他们。虽然经济因素当然很重要，但它们只有在基础和期望确定之后才能发挥作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最有力的事情之一就是向供应商阐明经济现实以及温室气体减排带来的权衡。脱碳可能成本高昂，但现实情况是，成本并不总是更高。减少水和肥料等投入、尽量减少塑料的使用以及投资可再生能源都可以节省资金。公司可以帮助供应商进行计算并了解他们可以取得领先的具体方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公司还必须考虑如何更好地构建合作伙伴关系，以实现可持续转型。激励和支持可持续转型的长期协议可以成为强大的催化剂。百事公司与 ADM 签署了为期七年半的战略商业协议，以分担成本和资源，并在项目上密切合作，旨在到 2030 年将我们共享的北美供应链中的再生农业面积大幅扩大至 200 万英亩。合同的期限有助于增强投资可持续实践以及实现碳减排目标的信心。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;启用&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;当谈到净零时，挑战过于复杂且相互关联，不能让实施靠运气。作为合作伙伴，我们提供了指导，帮助我们的供应商掌握战略的相互作用，以便他们能够更轻松地实现我们的共同目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，我们创建了一些计划来指导制定 SBT 并提供资源，概述不同的减排方案，特别是转向可再生电力，因为这可能会根据每个供应商的情况而有所不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像百事可乐这样的公司还可以通过以下方式帮助解决可持续发展挑战：利用其规模和网络投资和扩大有前景的初创企业，并利用与世界上一些最大公司的关系。这样做可以使它们更具成本效益并且可供我们的合作伙伴使用。对于农业技术，我们正在世界各地的示范农场试验有前景的解决方案，并对我们认为能够产生真正影响的供应商进行投资。对于农民来说，行之有效的方法是获得认可并快速有效地实施解决方案的关键。通过我们的 pep+ REnew 计划，我们还致力于帮助我们的供应链合作伙伴聚合购买可再生能源，以创造单个供应商无法单独实现的规模和成本效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;创建可持续的价值链虽然很困难，但只要采取正确的方法，它就是实现可持续发展目标、创建更具弹性的组织并推动提高业务绩效的强大手段。在百事公司，这就是我们的最终目标，三个基本要素——期望、经济和支持——将使我们以及我们的供应链合作伙伴走上真正可持续增长的道路。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用- ->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Stop Overworking After Vacation]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/stop-overworking-after-vacation]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;假期结束后，人们很容易加倍努力工作，试图弥补“失去的”。时间，或者尝试快点度过恢复速度所需的时间。其他时候，过度工作的冲动源于善意的努力，以减轻团队成员为你承担的额外工作，或者渴望证明即使你不在，你的承诺仍然很高，并且你在工作中。对组织仍然有价值。无论假期后过度工作背后的动机是什么，它都会让你从一个极端转向另一个极端，这会增加压力，实际上会破坏你追赶进度的努力。那么，如何才能既保留工作恢复的所有好处，又避免再次陷入困境呢？作者提供了几种策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/stop-overworking-after-vacation?language =es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/stop-overworking-after-vacation?language=pt&quot;>;阅读葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p >;随着夏季的结束，我们的许多辅导客户和研究参与者正在度假归来，我们发现重返工作岗位的焦虑程度有所增加。正如一位客户“Leslie”所说：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;度假回来几乎让[这]看起来不值得。对我来说，这就像在心理上从 30 英里/小时的巡航速度加速到 80 英里/小时，这样我就可以浏览收件箱，赶上我错过的所有会议，并与我被忽视的客户重新联系。除了让我的团队负担过重而感到内疚之外，他们一直在为我提供掩护。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;像莱斯利那样，通过扔东西来回应这些强烈的感觉很容易当你禁用不在办公室的应答器时，你就会陷入&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/why-we-glorify-overwork-and-refuse-to-rest&quot;>;过度工作&lt;/a>;、过度补偿和超额完成——尤其是在一开始就不鼓励休假的工作文化中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，有一种更健康、更平衡的方法可以帮助您轻松恢复日常工作，同时又不会失去所有的减压和表现-增强脱离工作的好处。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;休假至关重要&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首先，我们要明确的是，定期休息可以从工作压力中重新调整和恢复（研究人员称之为“休息”） &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-012420-091355&quot;>;工作恢复&lt;/a>;)并不是“有就很好”——它对于持续的业绩和增长。正如运动员定期休息和恢复以发挥最佳表现并避免受伤一样，工人也需要一段时间离开工作岗位来从工作压力中恢复过来，补充体力和精神能量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-012420-091355&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;表明那些不趁机休息的人、充电和恢复的人面临更高的疲惫、动力不足、表现不佳和倦怠的风险，而那些定期进行工作恢复的人则享有更好的睡眠、更高的工作满意度、更多的参与度和更高的工作绩效。人体和大脑根本无法承受长期压力，并且有大量证据表明，脱离工作压力和要求不仅可以减轻压力，还可以增加压力&lt;a href=&quot;https://kops.uni-konstanz .de/server/api/core/bitstreams/63f6ae78-86f7-47fc-96b1-17654a0d2bf6/content&quot;>;生产力&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc /articles/PMC8733151/&quot;>;提高创造力&lt;/a>;。即使是整个工作日的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9432722/&quot;>;微休息&lt;/a>;，例如伸展运动、做一些深呼吸练习，或走出去呼吸新鲜空气，可以停止压力循环并使您恢复到基线。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管离开时间有明显的好处，但是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org /social-trends/2023/03/30/how-americans-view-their-jobs&quot;>;近一半&lt;/a>;的美国工人并没有完全享受雇主提供的带薪休假。他们的主要原因是担心自己会落后，或者担心休假会损害他们的晋升机会，甚至增加失去工作的风险，以及对同事不得不承担额外工作的内疚感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些是我们经常听到的情绪，包括来自我们的高级管理客户的情绪，他们经常表示担心如果离开就会失去动力。作为高管教练，我们的部分职责是通过定期工作恢复实践，帮助客户投资于自己和自己的表现。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;抵制休假后过度工作的冲动&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;假期后，人们可能会很容易加倍努力工作，试图弥补“失去的”时间，或者试图尽快恢复正常状态。其他时候，过度工作的冲动源于善意的努力，以减轻团队成员为你承担的额外工作，或者渴望证明即使你不在，你的承诺仍然很高并且你仍然有价值&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论假期后过度工作背后的动机是什么，它都可能让你从一个极端转向另一个极端，这会增加压力，实际上会破坏你追赶进度的努力。那么，如何才能既保留工作恢复的所有好处，又避免再次陷入困境呢？以下是一些对我们的研究参与者和客户有效的策略：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;转向绩效思维。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;高绩效和充分恢复从来都不是单独发挥作用的，但在企业中在世界范围内，往往过分强调业绩而忽视复苏。不要只在你精疲力尽、效率低下之后才将休假视为最后的手段，或者当你的待办事项清单最终完成时作为一种特殊奖励，而是向顶级运动员学习并包括工作恢复作为高绩效战略的&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/how-to-recover-from-work-stress-according-to-science&quot;>;重要组成部分&lt;/a>;。定期、持续地练习，工作恢复效果最佳。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;预防或缓解“再入休克”。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;“再入休克”是指当您从某个地方过渡到某个地方时感到的混乱。平静和平衡将你拉入疲惫和争吵之中。您可以通过使用缓冲区来防止这种情况。在假期归来和返回工作之间安排一天的空闲时间，以便您可以在精神上和身体上为环境的变化做好准备。回来后保持日程安排简单，这将使您有机会重新适应并避免过度劳累。例如，我们的一位客户在回来后有两天“不开会”的缓冲期。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;带一些假期魔法回家。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;您的月经期间到底发生了什么帮助您减压并感觉更像自己的恢复过程？是锻炼吗？与亲人重新联系？在工作周中被忽视的艺术追求或爱好？只是享受一些计划外的休闲时间吗？尽可能将这些活动和条件纳入您每周的日常活动中。请记住，即使是少量的停工也会产生影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;在返回工作岗位时对新请求说“是”之前，请考虑一下是什么阻碍了你说“不”。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;您担心吗没有得到认可、奖励或晋升？如果是这样，停下来，深呼吸，检查你的假设。您可能会获得您想要的认可和奖励，而无需过度投入自己并牺牲您的健康和福祉。如果您无法确定问题所在，或者需要帮助弄清楚如何解决这些问题，请考虑与教练合作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;审查、沟通并保持您的界限。&lt;/h3>; &lt;从恢复期回来是回顾和刷新工作界限的好时机。让每个人都知道您什么时候可以工作、什么时候不可以工作，以及如果工作要求开始超出您的角色或您的舒适水平，请与领导层讨论转移职责的问题，或者看看您是否可以委派工作。界限应该有助于定义其他人对你的角色的期望，它们应该保护你的休息时间，让你在精神上脱离工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;离开一个有毒的工作环境，这种环境会阻止你离开工作时间，或者奖励员工超时工作，自我牺牲。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;这种不健康的工作环境会让你疲惫不堪。如果您不能立即离开，请开始制定退出策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;防止在休假前过度工作的冲动&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;下次您打算休假时，尝试一下前进，让未来的你变得更容易。在您离开前几周，安排谁在您缺席期间承担您的职责，并将他们的联系信息包含在您的外出消息中。对于假期期间何时/是否应联系您设定明确的期望。提前构建重新进入例程，以便您可以插入现有流程并更轻松地返回工作模式。最后，考虑在最终确定计划之前进行事前分析。您可能预期或想象到哪些具体的挑战或失败？&amp;nbsp;其主要原因是什么？什么还没有计算在内？最后，您现在可以采取哪些额外的预防措施？这个简单但功能强大的过程有助于进一步完善您的休假前计划，从而防止大多数重新进入问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;定期离开工作是确保您能够维持精力和生产力的最佳方法之一。通过在休假前进行一些计划以及在返回后进行一些合理的防护，您可以将工作恢复带来的所有减轻压力的好处带回来。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div >;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Accelerating Digital Integration in Africa]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/accelerating-digital-integration-in-africa]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;2021 年，合并后的&lt;a href=&quot;https://statisticstimes.com /economy/africa-gdp.php#:~:text=GDP%20of%20Africa&amp;amp;text=The%20African%20economy%2C%20comprising%2054,largest%20economy%20in%20the%20world.&quot;>;非洲 54 国的 GDP国家&lt;/a>;的 GDP 不到美国的 15%。非洲大陆由许​​多相对较小的国家、经济体和市场组成，这在世界舞台上处于劣势，而人口和国内生产总值庞大的国家影响力最大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;非洲更深层次的经济一体化提供了一条途径共同繁荣和增强全球影响力。与欧盟类似，区域一体化具有&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/importance-of-regional-and-Continental-integration-for-africas-development -18773&quot;>;被认为&lt;/a>;是创造稳定、发展经济、提高市场效率、分担大型基础设施项目成本以及解决和平与安全问题的关键。由于世界日益数字化，数字一体化对于区域一体化的成功至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此背景下，“数字一体化”是指为整个非洲的数字化创建共享系统和标准规则。它需要数字合作，特别是在金融、治理和安全方面。在实践中，数字一体化的概念包括协调的数字金融系统、一致的非洲大陆数字活动法律以及身份验证、电子税务和商业登记系统等共享监管技术。除其他外，数字一体化将促进最佳贸易，从而节省成本，改善信息流以改善全球商业的参与，并扩大市场准入，特别是对于小型企业而言，&lt;a href=&quot;https://unctad.org/ edar2022&quot;>;主导非洲贸易&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;私营部门合作、建立可互操作系统以及关注电力和互联网基础设施是有助于加速数字一体化的三个关键理念。&lt; /p>; &lt;h2>;私营部门合作&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;许多非洲私营组织在营利野心的驱动下，不受官僚机构或政治的限制，成功地跨越国界建立了自己的组织。尽管存在固有的挑战，但像 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/organizations/naspers-limited&quot;>;Naspers&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mtn.com/about例如，/&quot;>;MTN Group&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecobank.com/group/about-us/history&quot;>;Ecobank&lt;/a>; 已经找到了跨国扩张的方法。它们可以作为非洲经济数字一体化的参考点和潜在合作伙伴。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;促进数字一体化需要这些私营参与者、政府和区域机构之间的合作。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://papss.com/&quot;>;泛非支付结算系统&lt;/a>;（PAPSS）证明这种做法是可行的。虽然 PAPSS 是非洲联盟和非洲进出口银行之间合作的产物，但它依赖于非洲一些最大的私营商业银行的网络。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个针对非洲联盟内部的集中支付和结算系统。非洲商业 PAPSS 于 2022 年 1 月正式推出，促进非洲大陆商业和更深层次的经济一体化。它可以用当地货币（非洲大约有42种货币）进行非洲内部贸易交易的支付，从而减少费用并加速贸易结算和支付。在 PAPSS 之前，两个非洲国家之间的典型支付路径要求首先将一种非洲货币兑换成美元、英镑或欧元，然后第二次兑换成另一种非洲货币。这提高了非洲内部货币交易的成本 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Digital-Journeys-Africa-freeing-foreign-exchange -wellisz&quot;>;估计每年 50 亿美元&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;构建互操作性&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;构建全大陆的数字系统需要时间和大量资源，但立即优先考虑互操作性可以创造数字化集成的基础。因此，非洲国家正在建设的公共数字系统应该具有互操作性，即具有与其他国家的其他类似系统交换和使用信息的能力。不可避免的是，一些经济体和行业在数字化方面比其他经济体和行业发展得更快。因此，在构建时考虑到互操作性将有助于在不久的将来轻松集成。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，对于身份系统，理想的情况是在尼日利亚获得的 ID 可以由尼日利亚的银行轻松进行数字验证。纳米比亚。如果尼日利亚的数字身份系统具有互操作性，这将是可能的。此外，整个非洲大陆的可互操作 ID 系统将允许在整个非洲大陆建立“了解你的客户”系统，从而使非洲任何地方都能获得金融服务，从而使非洲内部的商业变得更加容易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，可互操作的公共身份系统系统需要重大的政策和监管干预。各国政府和区域机构必须应对协调标准、加强现行法律框架以及采用网络安全、消费者和数据保护法规等挑战，以促进成功的互操作性。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;电力和互联网&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;数字如果像许多非洲国家那样只有一小部分人能够获得数字服务，那么一体化就没有机会。虽然连接非洲大陆的公路、铁路和港口等实体基础设施对于非洲的实体一体化至关重要，但电力和互联网将决定数字一体化的成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多非洲国家的人口仍不足其一半。作为互联网用户，布隆迪和中非共和国等国家的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1124283/internet-penetration-in-africa-by-country/&quot;>;少于15%&lt;/a>; 互联网普及率。同样，有 6 亿人，即&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings&quot;>;非洲总人口的 43%&lt;/a>;大多数人生活在撒哈拉以南非洲地区，无法获得电力。因此，加速普及电力和互联网应成为当务之急。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;非洲迫切需要数字一体化，但认识到其固有的困难至关重要，例如对主权的担忧和不同的国家目标。此外，迈向数字一体化的积极步骤需要政府的深思熟虑的承诺，这需要政府认识到其重要性并拥有资源来实现它们。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Negotiate Your Salary in the Age of Pay Transparency Laws]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-negotiate-your-salary-in-the-age-of-pay-transparency-laws]]><description> &lt;div>;

were in the dark about what comparable employees made and how the company benchmarked salaries to the rest of the market,” he says. “Now, &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;having a pay range takes away some of those unknowns.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

requires information, tact, confidence — and the right mindset, says &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Medvec.&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; “Knowledge is power, and&lt;/span>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;y&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;ou now have an advantage because you know what&#39;s possible.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;While some salary bands might seem too broad to be useful, they underscore the power of negotiation, she says. “&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;The range exists because &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;negotiation is a dynamic interaction between the employee and employer and &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;some people do it more effectively.” &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;After all, she says, it&#39;s not &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/how-women-can-get-what-they-want-in-a-negotiation&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;just about being willing to ask for more&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;, it&#39;s also about having the information and self-assurance to make your case.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Don&#39;t get in your own head and don&#39;t be intimidated or discouraged — even if a certain number feels out of reach, &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;adds Buckmaster. For example, if you make $70,000 and you&#39;re being offered a comparable job with a listed range of $100,000-$150,000, you might feel as if you can&#39;t ask for the top of the range. But the fact is, your current salary has little bearing on what another company is willing to pay you, he says: “What you made before &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;doesn&#39;t matter.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;Do your research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Your goal is to go into the negotiation with an objective, realistic understanding of how the employer views your market value. &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;This requires some homework to figure out where you might land within the company&#39;s published&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; compensation &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;bands: at the top, in the middle, or toward the bottom. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“Before pay transparency laws existed, people may have assumed that HR has been randomly throwing darts at a dartboard to determine what people got paid, but there&#39;s rigor behind the numbers,” says Buckmaster. He says that behind the listed range lies an “approval matrix” that&#39;s invisible to candidates. “Every company has a trigger point that requires extra approvals to justify placing someone at the very top of the range.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;D&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;on&#39;t be disheartened; rather, use that &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/work-speak-the-right-way-to-negotiate&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;knowledge to make a compelling case&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; for yourself. Visit j&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;ob search websites and databases, such as Glassdoor, Ladders, and Salary.com, and talk to recruiters and industry colleagues. &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Take a good, hard look at your experience and qualifications and be honest about your work history. &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“Evaluate your actual job level and the scope of your past responsibilities. De-emphasize titles. Being a director at a startup is not the same as being one at a large company,” Buckmaster says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;Be savvy about the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Many, but not all, &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;salary negotiations take place&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; after the company has extended an offer. But you might consider signaling your salary expectations earlier in the process if you think your pay ought to be on the high-end of the range, says Buckmaster. He suggests saying something along the lines of, “I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the offer and trust that my starting position in your pay range will align with my significant experience doing this work at XYZ company.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Once the company has made an offer, the opportunity to negotiate for more is usually quite narrow, so Buckmaster advises making your case wisely. &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“Don&#39;t go back multiple times, otherwise it might affect your reputation on the way in,” he says. “You don&#39;t want to come across as being challenging to work with.” Make your argument concise, crisp, and reasonable. “Most companies don&#39;t want to have custom, complicated negotiations with everyone who comes in.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;State your case…&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Negotiating a higher salary requires clearly articulating why you&#39;re worth more. Medvec recommends&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; focusing on your &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;differentiators: your background, skill set, and special abilities that match the company&#39;s needs. You&#39;ve &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/5-ways-to-stand-out-in-your-next-job-interview&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;already outlined your past achievements&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; in the hiring process&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;, of course. Now it&#39;s time to talk about how you&#39;ll add value in the future — and how that should be reflected in your pay. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Medvec suggests laying out how you&#39;ll help the company generate new lines of revenue, cut costs, attract talent, or enter new markets. “Talk about your exact role and responsibilities, including what specifically you&#39;ll be doing,” she says. &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Pinpointing how &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/to-land-a-great-job-talk-about-why-you-love-your-work&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;you&#39;re going to tackle their challenges&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; puts you in a stronger position, she says. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Bear in mind that approval matrix, adds Buckmaster. “&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Help the recruiter tell your story internally,” he says. “Make their job easier with solid arguments oriented around the business. Otherwise they&#39;re going to have a hard time getting it approved.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;… and bring your A-game if you&#39;re aiming extra high.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;While it&#39;s possible to &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;negotiate above the stated pay range, your case has to be bulletproof. Many companies are comfortable with roughly 5% of their employees being paid over the maximum, according to Buckmaster. Pay bands are not an exact science and “sometimes people break the system and end up with higher salaries,” he says. This can happen for many reasons. Perhaps the new hire is joining a smaller company, or maybe their manager is more like a peer, or maybe the new employee is taking on a specialized role, or perhaps they know esoteric coding language that the company needs. “Or it could be that they&#39;re uniquely gifted and hard to get,” he says. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;A word of warning though: If you&#39;re paid over the maximum, you might be ineligible for salary increases in the future, so be sure to inquire about the company&#39;s policies. &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For senior roles, &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Medvec&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; recommends booking a half hour with an employment lawyer in the city where the company is based. “Find out not just how much others ask for, but also what&#39;s in their contracts, like stock, equity, and employment guarantees,” she says. “It will be an expensive 30 minutes, but well worth it for senior-level jobs.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;Don&#39;t focus on “fairness,” but rather mutual interests.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;P&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;ay-transparency laws were created to help ensure equitable compensation, but it&#39;s not a good idea to frame your individual negotiation around fairness, &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;according to Medvec. “Don&#39;t create a rationale based on what&#39;s right or what&#39;s fair,” she says. Instead, “reference information about what others earn to anchor your request, but keep the conversation focused on the employer&#39;s interests.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For example, Medvec recommends saying something along the lines of: “I know from publicly available information that this role pays up to $190,000. I believe I&#39;m at the top end of that pay range because I&#39;m uniquely positioned to do XYZ, and I&#39;m confident in what I bring to the table. But I&#39;m also comfortable getting a base salary of $160,00 with a $50,000 annual bonus when I achieve the objectives that are important to you.” &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;This way, you&#39;re making strategic compromises that benefit both you and the organization.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Principles to Remember&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;Do&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Appreciate your newfound advantage. Pay transparency empowers you with information about what&#39;s possible.&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Carve out time to do your homework so you can build a strong argument for the salary you want.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Make sure the recruiter can tell your story to the decision-makers by framing your argument in terms of the business.&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;Don&#39;t&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Doubt yourself even if a certain number feels out of reach.

There&amp;#8217;s good reason to think that this latest round of Indo-optimism might be different than previous iterations, but the country still has major challenges to address to make good on this promise. In terms of drivers, demand &amp;#8212; in the form of a consumer boom, context appropriate innovation, and a green transition &amp;#8212; and supply &amp;#8212; in the form of a demographic dividend, access to finance, and major infrastructure upgrades &amp;#8212; are helping to push the country forward. This is facilitated by policy reforms, geopolitical positioning, and a diaspora dividend. Even so, the country faces barriers to success, including unbalanced growth, unrealized demographic potential, and unrealized ease-of-business and innovation potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/is-india-the-worlds-next-great-economic-power?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/is-india-the-worlds-next-great-economic-power?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In 2002, India&#39;s government launched a ubiquitous international tourism campaign known as “Incredible India.” Were it to launch a similar campaign today, it might as well be called “Inevitable India.” Not just enthusiasts within the country, but a chorus of global analysts, have declared India as the next great economic power: Goldman Sachs has predicted it will become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy.html&quot;>;world&#39;s second-largest economy by 2075,&lt;/a>; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/c9de715e-2e29-4a7f-880b-1509c04bf11b&quot;>;FT&#39;s Martin Wolf suggests&lt;/a>; that by 2050, its purchasing power will be 30% larger than that of the US&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have been through similar surges of Indo-optimism before. But the on-the-ground reality has continued to frustrate even the most ardent of India&#39;s champions. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/28/india-revolutions-economy-growth-future/&quot;>;bold predictions&lt;/a>; that it would overtake China (an economy still five times larger than India&#39;s), to McKinsey&#39;s 2007 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/asia-pacific/the-bird-of-gold&quot;>;“bird of gold”&lt;/a>; promise of the Indian consumer that never quite panned out, to deregulation followed by policy reversals and crises of confidence in doing business with India, to devastating periods through the pandemic, the country&#39;s promised inevitable rise has remained elusive. What&#39;s different now?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are several positive trends converging, from different sides of the Indian business ecosystem: demand, supply, and the system-wide facilitating factors; in combination, they can transcend economic cycles, macro shocks, and policy reversals. Some are new, and the older ones are reaching critical mass and they can finally reinforce each other to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html&quot;>;growth flywheel&lt;/a>;. But as with all flywheels, it is important to remain vigilant about rattling noises and burning smells, and in India&#39;s case, these exist in abundance. It&#39;s essential for both business and government leaders to pay attention and act before the flywheel breaks.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Demand&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Three forces are converging on the demand side to fuel India&#39;s economic growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Consumer boom&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The starting point for any discussion of India&#39;s promise is, invariably, the promise of the Indian consumer. With 1.4 billion people and myriad unmet needs, India&#39;s growth is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy.html&quot;>;driven mainly&lt;/a>; by domestic consumption and investments. Real wages are expected to grow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/apac-salary-asia-leads-2023-real-wage-growth-jumps-in-india-china.html&quot;>;at 4.6%,&lt;/a>; whereas disposable income will continue to grow in excess of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/india/disposable-personal-income&quot;>;15%&lt;/a>;. Industries that are mature in the West are fast-growing in India: Private health insurance, for example, has almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/health-insurance/health-insurance-statistics/&quot;>;tripled between 2015 and 2021&lt;/a>;, while consumer durables were expected to grow between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crisil.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2022/09/volume-vault-to-lift-consumer-durables-revenue-15-18-percent.html&quot;>;15% and 18%&lt;/a>; this year.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Context-appropriate innovation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;International companies have struggled to grasp what constitutes India&#39;s “middle class” and craft the appropriate value propositions. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/middle-class-nearly-1/3rd-of-indias-population-to-be-2/3rds-by-2047-report/articleshow/95239621.cms&quot;>;some analysts&lt;/a>; argue that one out of every three Indians is “middle class,” only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/18/in-the-pandemic-indias-middle-class-shrinks-and-poverty-spreads-while-china-sees-smaller-changes/&quot;>;66 million&lt;/a>; are genuinely “middle income” by global standards, while a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/18/in-the-pandemic-indias-middle-class-shrinks-and-poverty-spreads-while-china-sees-smaller-changes/&quot;>;1.16 billion&lt;/a>; are low income. However, many in this second group constitute a vast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/be53790c-ea16-4e5c-9410-bac189fb2636&quot;>;aspirational consuming class&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has many implications. For one, competing in India means selling at much lower price points, which in turn requires reconfiguring activities, production, and supply chains in ways that are hard for competitors to mimic. India&#39;s best-selling car is Wagon R, priced at $7,000 and made by Japan&#39;s Suzuki, a company whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/31/business/corporate-business/suzuki-india-market-share/&quot;>;41% market share&lt;/a>; in India is an outlier in the auto industry globally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/explained-why-netflix-is-failing-big-time-in-india-10580421.html&quot;>;Netflix discovered&lt;/a>; through its stumbles in the country, it takes more than low prices to win in India. Localizing the content, working in multiple Indian languages, and leveraging synergies across products that Indian consumers want, as Amazon or Disney can do, is essential. In a very different sector, McDonald&#39;s, has incorporated vegetarian options, Indian snacks, and menus for multi-generational families, building a contextualized value proposition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those that can crack the code of the Indian consumer are handsomely rewarded: Many McDonald&#39;s franchisees in India are billionaires. The home appliances manufacturer Havells introduced a product line with “India-friendly” offerings such as water purifiers and compressor-less air coolers, relevant to both the Indian consumers&#39; needs and affordability. Since its listing 30 years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/havells-india-ltd/stocks/companyid-10507.cms&quot;>;Havells&#39;&lt;/a>; profits have grown 826 times, and its market cap has jumped 5,800 times.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Green transition&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A burgeoning new source of demand growth comes from India&#39;s urgent need for a green transition. The scale of its economic potential means that its energy demand will be enormous. As the third-largest energy-consuming nation, it is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investindia.gov.in/sector/renewable-energy#:~:text=India&#39;s%20installed%20renewable%20energy%20capacity,additions%20of%209.83%25%20in%202022.&quot;>;4th in the world&lt;/a>; in renewable energy installed capacity. The country has set &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/commentaries/india-s-clean-energy-transition-is-rapidly-underway-benefiting-the-entire-world&quot;>;ambitious targets&lt;/a>;: installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, producing 5 million tons of green hydrogen annually, cutting emissions by 45%, along with a billion tons of CO2 — all by 2030. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Mission_2070_A_Green_New_Deal_for_a_Net_Zero_India_2021.pdf&quot;>;2021 report&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;by the World Economic Forum projects 50 million net new “green economy” jobs in India — which means more consumers — and $15 trillion in economic opportunity by 2070, with $1 trillion by 2030.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Supply&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;There are several positive forces converging on the supply side as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Demographic dividend&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One part of the supply-side story is old news: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_in/india-at-100/reaping-the-demographic-dividend&quot;>;By 2030&lt;/a>;, India&#39;s working-age population is expected to be 1.04 billion with a dependency ratio to be the lowest in its history at 31.2%, contributing just under a quarter of the incremental global workforce. The working-age population bulge is expected to last till 2055.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “Asian Miracle” was built on harnessing this trend: Japan entered this sweet spot in 1964, South Korea in 1967 and China in 1994. Additionally, India also has the largest pool of English-speaking STEM graduates in the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Access to finance&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;India&#39;s financial markets are in a better state than ever before. With the China opportunities cooling, investors need alternatives, and India comes closest. The MSCI India Index is up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/india-investing-china-stocks-growth-exports-demographics-31252a80&quot;>;12%&lt;/a>; this year, compared to 2% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bank balance sheets are &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-stronger-balance-sheets-indias-banking-sector-at-an-inflection-point/articleshow/96702845.cms&quot;>;stronger&lt;/a>; and credit markets are functioning well. It&#39;s telling that many Indian banks are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.in/finance/banks/news/indian-banks-better-placed-than-their-us-peers-due-to-attractive-valuations-and-stickier-deposits/articleshow/98859627.cms&quot;>;valued higher&lt;/a>; than US peers. &amp;nbsp;HDFC Bank — which merged with its parent, mortgage lender HDFC — has a market capitalization of $171 billion, making it the 4&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.3333px;&quot;>;th &lt;/span>;largest financial company in the world. Even before the merger, the 29-year-old upstart was more valuable than the 154-year-old Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change can be seen even in the traditionally underfinanced informal sector, comprising over 86% of India&#39;s workforce. Avendus, a leading Indian investment bank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avendus.com/crypted_pdf_path/msme-lending-report-formattedvf-img-642a719b97ccc-.pdf&quot;>;calculated&lt;/a>; that Indian small-and-medium-enterprise sector&#39;s total demand for debt is $1.5 trillion. Of this, $725 billion is unaddressable because of lack of collateral, and formal credit is only available to the tune of $289 billion. This is motivating lenders to deepen their offerings. New-to-credit customers are at 34% up from 9% of customers for small business lenders in 2017. Loans by small business lenders have jumped 43% annually in the past two years.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Infrastructure upgrades, both physical and digital&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A critical barrier that sticks in the mind of anyone who has visited India is its lagging infrastructure. Historically, &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9483756.stm&quot;>;investing in handouts&lt;/a>; may have been more politically expedient, but the current administration&#39;s popularity gives it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/modi-should-focus-on-people-not-just-big-projects/2023/02/06/ceb85dc4-a66b-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html&quot;>;greater leeway&lt;/a>; to invest in infrastructure. Capital expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure has increased from 11% in 2010 to a projected 22% this year. Infrastructure expenditure this year will see a 33% hike to $122 billion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outcomes have been striking. India has been adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade&quot;>;10,000 km of highway&lt;/a>; annually. Since 2014, the number of Indian airports has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade&quot;>;doubled&lt;/a>; and an upgraded train system will have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade&quot;>;new high efficiency “freight corridors&lt;/a>;” connecting the economic centers of India.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, one of most distinctive changes has been in the digital infrastructure. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/indias-internet-subscribers-increased-to-88125-million-as-of-march-end-trai-report/article67219636.ece&quot;>;881.25 million&lt;/a>; internet subscribers, India has the second-highest internet-enabled population in the world behind China&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.scio.gov.cn/m/pressroom/2022-11/07/content_78506468.htm&quot;>;1.05 billion&lt;/a>;. Riding on this access, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/the-case-for-investing-in-digital-public-infrastructure&quot;>;digital public infrastructure&lt;/a>; — a model being studied by other countries — that combines a population-scale unique identity system, a payments interface that makes digital payments seamless, and a data management system, whereby citizens can access essential documents online, such as tax documents, vaccination certificates, etc. All of this helps make public services and credit more easily accessible to a wider swath of the population.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an indicator of the resulting change, India has &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/india-tops-world-ranking-in-digital-payments-beats-china-by-huge-margin-report/articleshow/100944643.cms&quot;>;topped the list&lt;/a>; for digital payments beating China by a huge margin. Interestingly, India&#39;s payments are more than the digital payments made in the next four leading countries combined.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Facilitators&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;On top of these forces in motion, there are several system-wide facilitators in the mix.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Domestic policy reforms&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/india/1734728/india-may-soon-achieve-modis-ease-of-doing-business-goal&quot;>;regulatory and policy reforms&lt;/a>; have been put in place, from implementation of the 2016 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to the elimination of more than 39,000 regulations to foster ease of doing business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many other reforms, such as construction permits and power connections, are the domain of state governments and there is a drive towards change at these levels as well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/11/how-indias-states-compete-for-investment&quot;>;State governments are competing&lt;/a>; by helping speed up the process of setting up businesses, providing incentives for investment and even attracting clusters of competing companies, which enables more business-friendly environments in more regions across the country.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Geopolitical sweet spot&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Another transformation is a more distinctive geopolitical positioning for India, triggered, most significantly, by the growing rift between China and Western economies, particularly the US This is translating into new business opportunities for India, most visibly — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65784719&quot;>;manufacturing of Apple&#39;s smartphones&lt;/a>;. With a goal of producing 20 million iPhones a year, 50,000 new jobs will be created by one such project alone. In addition, when it comes to military-grade technology used for space launches, there is greater confidence in India as a host than China and there is already a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/business/india-space-startups.html&quot;>;thriving ecosystem&lt;/a>; in place. India has hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_satellites_launched_by_India&quot;>;111 international space launches&lt;/a>; since 2020, and successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/science/india-moon-landing-photos.html&quot;>;landed a rover on the moon&lt;/a>; in late August.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To consider another prominent example, chipmaker, Micron Technology, &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-new-semiconductor-assembly-and-test-facility&quot;>;announced&lt;/a>; plans to build a new assembly and test facility, as part of moves to diversify beyond China. In fact, the new president of the World Bank has suggested that there is a narrow window for India to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-should-cash-china-plus-one-strategy-world-bank-chief-2023-07-19/#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20many%20companies,World%20Bank%20chief%20last%20month.&quot;>;“cash in”&lt;/a>; on the growing trend behind companies seeking to diversify their supply chain and manufacturing beyond a massive dependence on China.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Diaspora dividend&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It is interesting to note that both the CEO of Micron Technology and the World Bank chief are Indian-born, which brings us to the third key facilitator: the Indian diaspora, now the world&#39;s largest and influential in ways that it had never been before. In the business world alone it is telling that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2023/06/12/indias-diaspora-is-bigger-and-more-influential-than-any-in-history&quot;>;25 of S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a>; company CEOs are Indian-born. Beyond this, senior management ranks of numerous companies are populated by Indians. It&#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.economictimes.com/tech/startups/indians-are-driving-the-us-startup-story-nfap-study/india-is-the-leading-country-of-origin-for-immigrant-founders-of-us-unicorns/slideshow/93165270.cms&quot;>;leading country of origin&lt;/a>; for immigrant founders of US unicorns. These connections help build global connectivity to Indian business and facilitate India&#39;s integration into global value chains.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Barriers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While these factors reinforce each other, many barriers remain – and they could cause the multiplier effect to stall. Consider three major bumps in the road and the actions needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unbalanced growth&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Despite impressive growth numbers at the national level, the economic benefits have been highly unequal. The top 10% of Indians hold &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfam.org/en/india-extreme-inequality-numbers&quot;>;77%&lt;/a>; of the national wealth. Almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfam.org/en/india-extreme-inequality-numbers&quot;>;2 people every second&lt;/a>; are pushed into poverty because of health care costs alone. India&#39;s population density — amongst the highest in the world — exacerbates the zero-sum nature of resource allocation and environmental stresses. Regional imbalances — southern and western India growing 12% faster than northern and eastern India — will magnify over time. Superimpose on this linguistic fault-lines, new inter-regional tensions could surface. Handling these will require deft management of the political economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other imbalances are growing because of divisive politics. An increasingly assertive form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-this-side-ganesh-devy-putting-the-useless-to-use-the-divisive-politics-of-the-word-hindutva/article67045226.ece&quot;>;Hindutva ideology&lt;/a>; is overshadowing core issues such as job-creation, enhancing productivity and shared economic benefits. The root cause of this problem was a belief in large sections of society that what started as affirmative action projects in a newly independent India should have had sunset clauses leading to discontent over minority appeasement by political leaders. The pendulum has now swung in the other direction creating new challenges of exclusion and identity politics. For many India-watchers it hasn&#39;t helped that India has declined in its position on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rsf.org/en/index&quot;>;World Press Freedom Index&lt;/a>;. Consequently, potentially, bottled-up sentiments in large sections of the disaffected and minority segments of the population can explode, triggering a downward spiral. Such developments can undermine objectives of shared prosperity. For international investors and trade partners, this can add a risk premium of majoritarianism in a country with as much religious, linguistic and socio-cultural diversity as India. More significantly, these developments exhaust political capital, which can otherwise be leveraged for social and economic transformation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are at least two solutions to these challenges. One is of political parties moving away from identity politics to inclusive growth and job-creation as the most reliable means of winning over the widest swath of the country&#39;s vast population. Two, India sees a constant flow of state-level elections, which distorts public dialogue by skewing it away from longer-term economic growth-oriented perspectives. Streamlining and bunching elections will give breathing space to public discourse and push political leadership and voters toward longer-term horizons.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unrealized demographic potential&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/india/despite-world-beating-growth-indias-lack-jobs-threatens-its-young-2023-05-30/&quot;>;Less than half&lt;/a>; of urban workers have full-time jobs, while far too much of India&#39;s employment is in under-productive informal sectors. Education, skill-building, and health care are grossly inadequate. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://do3n1uzkew47z.cloudfront.net/siteassets/pdf/ISR_Report_2023.pdf&quot;>;India Skills Report 2023&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;found only half of young Indians are employable. Even the “crown jewels” technology services sector is vulnerable; demand for outsourcing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/ai-why-india-risks-falling-behind-in-the-tech-race/d8236bc2-16bb-11ee-9de3-ba1fa29e9bec_story.html&quot;>;falling&lt;/a>; and the labor-cost arbitrage model will be disrupted by secular shifts towards cloud computing and AI for coding and routine functions. Alarmingly, India&#39;s female labor participation rate has been in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?locations=IN&quot;>;steady decline&lt;/a>;, having dropped from 32% in 2005 to 19% in 2021.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emulating, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rmresults.com/a-spotlight-on-vietnams-transformation-in-education&quot;>;Vietnam&lt;/a>;, public and private investment in upskilling must be prioritized, which could add &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/india-youth-lack-skills/a-56879385&quot;>;$570 billion&lt;/a>; to the Indian economy. A major handicap has been manufacturing — a key jobs creator in comparable economies — which has plateaued at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/india-must-abandon-protectionism&quot;>;13.3% of GDP&lt;/a>;. The current infrastructure thrust, policy reforms, geopolitical drivers and capital influx could help unlock Indian manufacturing, but the barriers discussed here must be removed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In emerging sectors, the surge of potential in AI could be an opportunity for India to take leadership in a cutting-edge area, given the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/50-global-hubs-for-top-ai-talent&quot;>;emergent AI talent hubs&lt;/a>; in the country that can be massively expanded, paired with the &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/which-countries-are-leading-the-data-economy&quot;>;vast pools of data&lt;/a>; that accumulate in India. Cultural and organizational changes are needed to create on-ramps for women in the workforce and retain them. Such projects have long gestation periods, so a focused and disciplined long-term plan is required.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unrealized ease-of-business and innovation potential&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Doing business in India has improved, but many challenges remain. Land acquisition can stall construction projects and the courts are slow-moving institutions. Land records may be non-existing or outdated and environmental clearances have created additional barriers. On top of this, contract enforcement remains challenging. According to an index created by The Economist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/02/the-2023-crony-capitalism-index&quot;>;India ranks 10th&lt;/a>; in the prevalence of crony capitalism, in spite of the large-scale liberalization of the past three decades. A legacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/india-must-abandon-protectionism&quot;>;protectionism&lt;/a>; still persists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India&#39;s state capacity needs change. Contrary to popular perception, the Indian state is not big and bungling, but weak and waning. Institutions — from regulators to civic bodies to the judiciary — often juggle conflicting demands and are playing catch-up to market and social realities. Many important decisions are made with a crisis as a frame of reference and India&#39;s story of victories is often of individual heroism amidst institutional failure. Making India&#39;s state machinery cutting-edge may well be India&#39;s pivotal project.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In sum, while barriers remain, the positive forces can, indeed, create a domino effect: “Inevitable India” is within reach. India&#39;s greatest challenge will be to make its inevitability tangible and believable to the many constituencies that wish to see India succeed. To get from “Incredible India” — aimed at tourists — to now bring the global economy to its door, India next campaign ought to be “Credible India.”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[AI and the New Digital Cold War]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_02_792DVvbiBBo-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Globalization is not dead, but it is changing. The United States and China are creating two separate spheres for technology, and artificial intelligence is on the front lines of this new &amp;#8220;Digital Cold War.&amp;#8221; If democracies want to succeed in this new era of &amp;#8220;re-globalization&amp;#8221; they will need to coordinate across governments and between the private and public sectors. AI is coming, whether we like it or not. We are at a fork in the road and all segments of society will need to pitch in to build AI systems that contribute to a just and democratic future where humans can thrive.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;We are entering a new world order, one marked by increased nationalism and greater geopolitical competition. While countries are not going to undo all of the global economic systems that took shape under American unipolarity for the past three decades, certain critical sectors will become decoupled in a process we have previously referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/geopolitics-are-changing-venture-capital-must-too&quot;>;“re-globalization.”&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most significantly, the technology ecosystem will be split largely into two spheres dictated by the world&#39;s two economic powerhouses, the United States and China. Other states will need to decide which sphere they want to be part of, putting pressure on the United States and China to outpace the other and establish their technological dominance. Unfolding before us is a heightened form of economic competition we understand as the “Digital Cold War.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Digital Cold War will be an economic war, with technological innovations increasingly determining geopolitical prowess. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its capacity to rapidly and radically transform society, will be the most decisive technology in this arena. AI feeds on information, and its most powerful use cases will emerge through its applications across public and private sectors. For the democratic world to pull ahead, companies and countries need to adopt a new approach that prioritizes collaboration and transformation over competition and disruption.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A New Era of Democratic Coordination&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Everywhere we are seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/dealbook/globalization-fink-marks.html&quot;>;claims&lt;/a>; that “globalization is dead.” Such declarations are fundamentally misguided. The system we are moving toward is more complicated than a reversion of global interconnection. In many cases, trade is simply being rerouted rather than shut down. Most commercial industries will remain open and global, but certain critical sectors will turn inward, toward localized supply chains.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend began not with the United States and its policies but rather with Xi Jinping and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latest_releases/2015/05/19/content_281475110703534.htm&quot;>;2015 Made in China plan&lt;/a>;, which made clear that the Chinese government had begun prioritizing national resilience over market efficiency. Xi laid out a plan to outcompete the United States and other global powers in the commanding areas of the economy, most of all high technology. Indeed, China continues to march towards its goal of 70% self-sufficiency in critical technology by 2025. Since then, the United States has responded with its own series of ambitious measures to retain technological supremacy. This reality leads us into a bipolar high technology future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to AI — arguably the most decisive technology in this global contestation — we are heading toward two hermetically sealed ecosystems: one that supports open systems but is also associated with democracy, privacy, and individual rights, versus one that supports state control, information-flow restriction, and politically imposed limits on openness. As much as we might hope that China&#39;s political model will evolve and that its technology will be subject to democratic feedback, we should not be naïve: That is not the trajectory that it is on. For a future to prevail that prizes openness and individual rights, democratic nations need to be market leaders in AI. The only way to ensure this is by promoting international collaboration, especially between democracies and other defenders of the rules-based order.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the previous era, the United States could innovate on a technology and other countries would simply adopt it. When American technology leaders made groundbreaking advancements with personal computers and the internet, they operated under the assumption that American companies could work in isolation and spread their technologies across the world in a top-down fashion. The cloud revolution amplified this further, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google owning 65% of the global market for cloud computing. This strategy may have worked when technologies were intended for pure disruption. AI, however, is geared for societal transformation. This requires a new kind of collaboration across stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along with computing capabilities, the power of AI is based on the amount of aggregated data that is fed to it. This means that the United States, or any country, working in isolation with restricted data flows will fail to maximize the potential of its technology — and yet data localization policies &lt;a href=&quot;https://itif.org/publications/2021/07/19/how-barriers-cross-border-data-flows-are-spreading-globally-what-they-cost/&quot;>;doubled worldwide&lt;/a>; from 2017 to 2021, further obstructing cross-border collaboration. The summation of human knowledge and capabilities is not siloed in any one country or culture. Even Wikipedia&#39;s knowledge base is only 11% in the English language. For AI to thrive in its ability to help us solve our hardest problems, we have to unlock the world&#39;s capacity — from French nuclear scientists to Korean philosophers, from Indian researchers to Kenyan artists, and indeed to Chinese researchers who choose to leave China and work and live in the West.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus, the capital requirements for investments in the sector are so large at present that very few national markets are big enough to succeed with AI on their own. For example, consider investment in semiconductors — a key input into AI progress. The UK&#39;s recently announced 100 million GBP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/initial-100-million-for-expert-taskforce-to-help-uk-build-and-adopt-next-generation-of-safe-ai&quot;>;AI plan&lt;/a>; and 1 billion GBP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-1-billion-strategy-for-uks-semiconductor-sector&quot;>;semiconductor investment&lt;/a>; pale in comparison to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-approves-280-billion-bill-to-boost-us-science-chip-production-11658942295&quot;>;US&#39;s&lt;/a>; $280 billion and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/eu-enacts-43-billion-chips-act-in-bid-to-boost-production&quot;>;EU&#39;s&lt;/a>; 43 billion EUR chips packages — and even these packages are constrained compared to the scale of the investment required to fully develop these technologies. Certainly, few investors globally can support fundraising rounds for startups like the one-year-old Inflection AI&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/inflection-ai-raises-13-bln-funding-microsoft-others-2023-06-29/&quot;>;$1.3 billion round&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the center of this all, a disjointed approach with various patchworks of regulatory frameworks across the West will harm any ability to compete and win against Chinese AI systems. It is not just a function of population, but a function of data points. Chinese society,&amp;nbsp;with a population more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-population-of-china-compared-with-the-rest-of-the-world/&quot;>;four times larger&lt;/a>; than the US&#39;s, &amp;nbsp;has become so digitized with data freely shared between its government and domestic technology champions. Soon their models, based largely on American and foreign research, can leapfrog the capabilities of those in the West.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With its size, centralized government, and inroads in other countries, China has the potential to develop one comprehensive AI model that outcompetes the multiplicity of models coming out of democratic nations if there is no international coordination. While the United States is still the AI leader — with the companies that are doing the most cutting-edge research — and while AI seems to have a bias toward open systems with unfettered access to information, the United States risks losing its edge if it fails to coalesce around a uniform strategy with other democratic nations. If this were to happen, Chinese companies could bring their technology to Western markets, influencing democratic politics and signaling to the world China&#39;s economic dominance — and its broader colonization of digital infrastructure around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI is becoming an increasingly critical part of this global infrastructure, and the West must act swiftly and in a unified fashion to ensure the technology remains open and democratically controlled. To develop the most powerful AI models across sectors, the United States will need to collaborate with other allied countries — to name a few, India, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and European nations — by adopting data-sharing policies and encouraging the co-creation of technological innovations. Much can be gleaned from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.european-data-governance-act.com/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20European%20Data,of%20EU%20citizens%20and%20businesses.&quot;>;European Data Governance Act&lt;/a>; approved by the EU in 2022, which facilitates data-sharing across member countries to maximize benefits for its citizens and businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Failure to course correct will severely limit the impact of AI. For models tackling climate change, siloed data is an immediate death sentence. Medical and healthcare data and innovations are not limited to any one country, nor any one research institution. Industrial AI powering global supply chains cannot be effective without the constant flow of interconnected data. In consumer applications, varying copyright frameworks would stymie cultural relevance and influence, favoring those with free access to data over others. Moreover, piecemeal data regulation and sovereignty requirements raise compliance costs and complexity, harming the innovation economy&#39;s ability to succeed.&amp;nbsp;This is not to suggest that governments should abstain from regulating AI, but rather that they should work together to establish uniform standards and practices across countries. Coordination among democratic nations will empower each country to individually feel resilient when it comes to AI, but also elevate the West as a bloc to be the leader in AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Responsible Innovation for AI Transformation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In addition to collaborating across states, if Western companies want to become true market leaders, they will also need to collaborate within states, namely with governmental institutions and civil society. While most of the current discourse surrounding AI focuses on large language models and other generative capabilities, AI&#39;s most significant long-term impacts will come from the ways in which it transforms industries and society as a whole. And genuine transformation cannot come about if private actors are disconnected from the wider society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Already we are seeing AI&#39;s transformative potential beginning to take shape. AI has the capacity to massively level the playing field for who has access to information and insights. In the classroom, AI can give&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/30/tech/ai-industry-statement-extinction-risk-warning/index.html&quot;>;recent attention&lt;/a>; has fixated on the existential threat AI could pose to humanity in the somewhat distant future. But AI is also destabilizing democratic systems in the here and now, providing new avenues for mis- and dis-information through sophisticated bots and realistic deep-fakes. AI will also throw into question the value of democracy itself. What happens when authoritarian systems, augmented by AI, can outperform their democratic counterparts, for instance by massively reducing crime with expanded surveillance? Or by providing vastly better healthcare because of access to centralized information with no restrictions for privacy? Undemocratic alternatives will only become more tempting as AI develops, and these possibilities are not too far off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are at a fork in the road when it comes to AI. We can go down the path that leads to automation and destruction, replacing human work and meaning, or we can go down the path that leads to copiloting and enablement, making us more productive, helping us live more balanced lives, and becoming greater masters of our craft. Unlike the social media revolution, which, if regulators really wanted to, they could have slowed or redirected, the AI revolution can only charge forward. Unlike previous &lt;em>;platform&lt;/em>; revolutions, this is a &lt;em>;technological&lt;/em>; revolution, and its mantle has already been picked up by stakeholders across society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most successful companies will be those that embrace this forward-looking vision and build to endure, by centering a core set of values that align with society and abide by self-regulatory mechanisms. Taking the further step of partnering with the public sector and incumbent ecosystems is also crucial. We cannot risk AI going awry and putting democracies off track in this competitive race. Since the impacts of AI will be felt across every sector of society, accounting for broad stakeholder interests is both a moral responsibility and the only way to bring about sustainable transformation. In the age of AI, companies will need to pursue an agenda of responsible innovation, working outside of the usual technological silos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To win the Digital Cold War, the United States and its allies must be the market leaders in AI. And to build the best AI companies, they need to prioritize international collaboration and engender a new mindset — one that aims to innovate responsibly and unleash human potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Challenges of Networking as an Executive]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_02_200428479-007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Martin Barraud/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Networking is critical for senior executives who are making job and career transitions, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to find advice on how best to manage the process. In this article, the authors &amp;#8212; who have decades of experience working with executives during periods of transition &amp;#8212; identify six networking hurdles that executives often encounter, and they provide guidance on how to get over them.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Look online at any of the thousands of articles available on the challenges of networking for a job, and you&#39;ll find that 100% of them give advice on how relatively junior professionals can network “up.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But surprisingly little advice is available for senior executives, who experience a different but equally challenging set of networking hurdles. That&#39;s a problem, because knowing how to reap networking&#39;s full benefits is crucial for people at the top of the pyramid, especially a time when CEO turnover is at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/04/27/ceo-turnover-high-pandemic/&quot;>;record high&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have decades of experience working with and studying senior executives who are making career changes. In this article, we&#39;ll identify six common hurdles that that they often struggle with when it comes to career networking, and we&#39;ll provide some guidance on how to get over them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1) Reluctance to ask for help&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Networking for a next role means asking for help. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597897927461&quot;>;Research in social psychology&lt;/a>; shows that people with high status are more apt to feel pressure to maintain an image of strength and competence and to value self-reliance, all of which can make them reluctant to seek assistance. They fear rejection and worry that asking for help might expose perceived weaknesses, potentially undermining their status, position, or reputation. This is ego-driven reluctance, and we see it frequently. As one of Herminia&#39;s students put it, “I give help — I don&#39;t ask for it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way around this tendency, which is a natural one, is to start your networking process by reaching out to lower-risk (and lower-yield) contacts — ideally, executives who you know well, who have done their own networking, and who can share not only how they approached others for help but also what they got out of asking for it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can probably do this with more people than you realize: As the Stanford social psychologist Xuan Zhao has found, people regularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976221097615?journalCode=pssa&quot;>;underestimate&lt;/a>; others&#39; willingness to help, because they don&#39;t realize how happy it makes those others to do so. Low-risk warm-ups and rehearsal practice — what Spish calls “hearing the dreaded words come out of your mouth” — will help you fine-tune your message, defuse your emotions, and experience success. And having a few positive experiences under your belt will make your later, more-challenging calls and emails easier.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2) &amp;nbsp;Prioritizing secrecy &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The more senior an executive, the more likely they are to want secrecy, especially if they&#39;ve been laid off. One of Spish&#39;s clients, for example, asked: “How do I go out into the market without letting the market know that I&#39;m looking? I&#39;d like to reach out to people, but I don&#39;t want them to know that I&#39;m interested in looking.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such worries limit your exposure to others, which is a problem in its own right. But they also force you to be secretive as you work on networking and career change — a process, according to Herminia&#39;s research, that often takes far longer than people expect. That burden of secrecy, carried for a long time, can exact a significant psychological toll.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Limiting your exposure to others can be especially pernicious when it keeps you from stepping back and exploring broadly what you would really like to do next. And try as you might, you won&#39;t fool people by obfuscating. At senior levels, it&#39;s a small world: The people you talk to can figure out what you&#39;re up to, perhaps by making a call to a source in their own network, or perhaps just by doing a search online. If you do succeed in concealing your story, it&#39;s likely to tax your nerves and cost you a lot of energy to get the same result that just speaking honestly and directly would have gotten you. With rare exceptions, honesty is the best policy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3) &amp;nbsp;Unrealistic expectations &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Because they&#39;re reluctant to ask for help and don&#39;t want word to get out that they are in the market for a new role, senior executives typically want to get their networking done fast. Or they simply assume that because they&#39;re senior, the process won&#39;t take very long. Unfortunately, the more senior you are, the more time you&#39;re likely to need to find and align on the right fit. In Spish&#39;s experience, the shortest possible search is about three months, and the longer ones can take as much as 18 months.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only does effective networking take a long time, it also involves a great deal of work, stamina, efficiency, and patience. There are three primary reasons for this.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, as both of us have found, only a small percentage of people looking for their next role know exactly which handful of companies they&#39;d like to work for. Because they don&#39;t know enough about the market or what they really want to be able to come up with a targeted search, they have to start with research and very general exploratory networking. That all takes time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, what you want and are best suited for may not actually be available to you. Both of us have seen highly qualified and experienced people take an excruciatingly long time to find their next role. &lt;span>;O&lt;/span>;ne executive that Herminia recently observed thought, given his past experience, that he&#39;d be an ideal candidate for the audit committee of a big corporate board, but as the selection criteria shifted to include a greater diversity of professional profiles, he found himself waiting to get a nod.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, most companies today have elaborate, time-consuming, and unpredictable vetting processes, which can often add months at the tail end of the hiring process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the senior-executive job market, it helps to recognize that in the messy meeting of supply and demand you have surprisingly little control. A great proactive tactic that can help you compensate for that as you do your networking is to fill your calendar with stimulating, parallel activities (community work, pro-bono consulting, short-term advising, adjunct teaching) in which you can have a more immediate impact and receive a more gratifying response. This compensates for the tedium, if not burden, of asking and waiting for help. It also provides battered egos with positive, if provisional, identities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4) Not wanting to put in the work &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Executives who are used to having things done for them often balk at devoting time to tedious work that they can&#39;t delegate. But to network successfully, you need to treat the task as fully worth your time and energy — and you need to be methodical and organized about it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help with that, Spish has developed a networking process that consists of identifying and then contacting three kinds of contacts: information givers, door openers, and decision makers. Information givers are people who can tell you about the market, companies, and hiring trends; they can help you get smart and get over your fear of networking. Door openers are typically people you&#39;ve worked with in the past. They&#39;re responsive, and because they know you and your work style, they&#39;re willing to vouch for you and can introduce you to the decision makers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;d like to use this process, the best way to start is by first making a list of all your employers, clients, and customers, and then by writing down the names of the people you met in those roles. You might find you easily come up with 100 names.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what approach you use to organizing, targeting, and segmenting your search, you&#39;ll always need to start by generating a long list of people you&#39;ve worked with and then methodically following a system for reaching out to them. Because it&#39;s a learning process, you can&#39;t plan it all out in advance; you&#39;re better off adopting a “snowball” approach” in which you ask each contact who else you should meet. This is especially true if you&#39;re looking in markets that are unfamiliar to you. In that case, you&#39;ll need to network in what Spish calls “the valleys below the clouds.” There are lots of opportunities in these valleys, but they unfamiliar and require exploration. If you don&#39;t explore them, you limit your options and can hurt your career growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a high-cost, high-yield game, but it pays off. Spish has found that once you&#39;ve reached out to 50 or more contacts on your list, the network will start to reach out to you, at which point you can let the process carry you forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5) Overly focusing on “the narrative” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve made a contact, there is the important matter of what to say. All too often, executives spend the bulk of a networking conversation in small talk about shared contacts or experiences without getting to the point (that they need a new job) until the very end of the conversation. This is especially common when they feel they need to conceal the reality of what&#39;s going on — that they don&#39;t get along with their boss, say, or that they&#39;ve been fired. When that happens, they often enter into the conversation already on the defensive, they speak evasively, and they devote their energy to protecting their public image instead of learning all they can. The end result is that they waste a lot of their — and their contacts&#39; — time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another unproductive tack is to spend 80% of your time trying to explain why you&#39;re unhappy, or leaving, or got fired — a negative approach that anchors your conversation in the past when it should be positive and focused on the future. You&#39;re much better off spending 20% of your allotted time explaining your situation and focusing the remaining 80% on what you&#39;re looking for instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best practice in networking conversations is to be direct, succinct, and positive. People want to know why you&#39;re calling them and what you want from them, and the more senior they are, the more likely they&#39;ll be to expect a brief, executive summary of this sort: “This is why I&#39;m calling you. This is what I want from you. I hope that there&#39;s enough in these two points for us to have a 10-minute conversation.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6) &amp;nbsp;Failing to tailor your story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Executives looking to make a transition often spend inordinate amounts of time perfecting a single script — the fabled “elevator pitch” about their “core skills and abilities.” They do this assuming that this script will make them universally relevant, but almost invariably what they end up with just isn&#39;t satisfactorily tailored to the needs of the receiver.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve seen a lot of executives try to approach networking the way they would work with head-hunters: They write a generic email, just changing the name and one or two sentences, attach their resume, and send it out to a bunch of people. Likewise, many walk into a meeting and robotically state their one-minute pitch even if it doesn&#39;t fit the unique circumstances and requirements of the person who&#39;s listening.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That just doesn&#39;t work. Yes, figuring out your core storyline (Who am I, and why am I here?) is important. But you can&#39;t assume that you&#39;re going to be saying the same thing about yourself to every person you meet. Nor can you assume that every listener is capable of translating your pitch into their own business context.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, here&#39;s what you need to remember: It&#39;s not about you. If you hope to clinch a role for which you&#39;re truly well suited, you need to figure out how to make the switch from talking about yourself to talking knowledgeably about the company and its problems — and then to articulating how well equipped you are to solve those problems. As Spish has found, that&#39;s how you create opportunities for yourself: A large percentage of the most senior executives he&#39;s coached have ended up moving into roles that didn&#39;t even exist before they had their conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;* * *&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re a senior executive, networking is a delicate, complex, and time-consuming task. Ego and impatience, left unchecked, will sabotage your success. The best approach is to think of networking as an opportunity not just to scout out your next role but also to strengthen or deepen relationships you already have — and, even better, to add new relationships that will help you be a better professional in your new job and the others that come after it.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When Your Vacation Wasn&rsquo;t Exactly Relaxing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/when-your-vacation-wasnt-exactly-relaxing]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_05_82836891.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Williams+Hirakawa/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Time off doesn&amp;#8217;t always go as planned.

Take inventory of your health and energy.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Unless you&#39;ve been on a rejuvenating health retreat, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;ve veered away from your healthy routines, maybe skipping out on physical activity or finding yourself caught up in a full schedule and indulging a bit too much.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On your return, assess and acknowledge your energy levels, taking inventory of how you&#39;re feeling to determine what you need.

Then identify where you would like to be in each domain and one action you can take to reinforce or improve each of these elements of your wellbeing. Reassess daily for a week, tracking how your energy shifts as you re-engage in healthier habits.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.

Block time out on your calendar also for activities that energize you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Reflect on the positives; reframe, and learn from the negatives.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s easy to get overwhelmed or disappointed by things that may not have gone as well as you had hoped — but there are likely some positive memories to hold onto. Take some time to reflect and savor those experiences, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/the-mental-benefits-of-vacationing-somewhere-new&quot;>;lessons and insights gained&lt;/a>;. Capture them on paper, so you can share them with your team members, and reinforce the benefits of your time away. If the trip left you feeling in a rut, maybe you can find solace in the fact that you&#39;re home again getting back to normal.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Use the fresh start effect to set new habits and routines&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fresh start effect is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/research-explores-how-fresh-starts-affect-our-motivation-at-work&quot;>;the phenomenon of increased success in behavioral change&lt;/a>; associated with new beginnings, such as birthdays, the new year, and other milestones. You can harness this effect by using your return to work as an opportunity to reset.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coming back from a vacation is a good time to establish new practices that further enhance your energy and productivity, like &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/to-improve-your-work-performance-get-some-exercise&quot;>;exercising&lt;/a>;, shutting off notifications, blocking distractions, or writing in a journal each night. Seek out habits and routines that feel replenishing in your day-to-day life. You can leverage practices such as &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive&quot;>;timeboxing&lt;/a>; to optimize your energy for the things that matter to you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be tempting to try to overcompensate but don&#39;t let remorse drive your actions. Rather think about the routines that will work within the context of your daily life so that your habits can be sustainable.&amp;nbsp; Determine what you need to do today to &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/09/is-your-motivation-still-on-vacation&quot;>;get back on track&lt;/a>;, leave remorse out of the equation and do what you need to create forward momentum.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Clarify what you need for future time off.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Use this experience as a learning opportunity to set the ground for a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-taking-a-vacation-improves-your-well-being&quot;>;more replenishing vacation in the future&lt;/a>;. Decide how much structure was energizing versus draining on your energy. Who do you want to spend time with and how far do you want to travel? How much &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/set-these-5-boundaries-before-you-go-on-vacation&quot;>;communication with your team&lt;/a>; do you need for your own wellbeing and connection needs?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even a good vacation can sometimes be exhausting. If you don&#39;t properly manage your time and energy when returning, your exhaustion can have a cumulative impact on your wellbeing, work, relationships, and performance. If you didn&#39;t get what you needed from this vacation, use it as motivation to ensure that you build sustainable, energy-preserving practices into your daily life.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Avoid These Pitfalls When Measuring Your Strategy&rsquo;s Performance]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/avoid-these-pitfalls-when-measuring-your-strategys-performance]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sept23_01_1391375157.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Luis Alvarez/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;This article explores three common traps that managers fall into when measuring their strategy&amp;#8217;s performance and explains how to avoid them. The first trap is when the strategic framework and measurement system don&amp;#8217;t align. To fix it, you must organize both around key stakeholders. The second trap is when companies measure what they do rather than what they achieve. To fix this, focus on stakeholder outcomes. The third trap is a lack of focus. To fix it, cascade rather than amalgamate your metrics.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/avoid-these-pitfalls-when-measuring-your-strategys-performance?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/avoid-these-pitfalls-when-measuring-your-strategys-performance?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Measuring the performance of a business goes hand in glove with its business strategy. Or it should. But surprisingly, as I&#39;ve witnessed firsthand over an extended period, organizations in all sectors struggle to match their strategy design with their performance measurement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is hugely important because it&#39;s almost impossible to track the success of a business strategy if there are no reliable key performance indicators (KPIs). Conversely, poor performance measurement can encourage misdirected strategic targets. Both can lead to repeat performances of the same failed decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here I explore three common traps that managers fall into when measuring their strategy&#39;s performance and explain how to avoid them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. Non-matching frameworks&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Roger is the CEO of a state government&#39;s main roads department. When he was appointed, he installed his favored strategy framework based on “areas.” These came with their own acronym – KRAs, key result areas. So, he organized the main roads strategic plan under items such as energy reduction, governance, and material sourcing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trouble was that it didn&#39;t match main roads&#39; existing performance measurement framework, which was organized around programs such as road safety, road efficiency, and road maintenance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The disconnect was hugely dysfunctional with much executive time and energy expended trying to make things work. As one executive wryly observed, “it was like trying to put parts of a Ford into a Mercedes Benz. They just wouldn&#39;t fit.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How to fix it: Organize around key stakeholders.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Marjorie heads up a not-for-profit entity which looks after people with autism. When she joined the organization as CEO, she was faced with what she describes as “a disconnect between our strategic planning framework and how our KPIs were assembled.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The organization&#39;s strategic plan was structured around “key issues” like budget overruns, obtaining grants, and hiring staff. The KPIs were a hotchpotch of metrics drawn from a variety of sources including HR, accounting and finance, and operations including operating expenses and the number of staff training courses run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her solution was to refocus both strategy and the KPIs around the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;organization&#39;s key stakeholders.&lt;/a>; These were people with autism and their families, government, donors and supporters, and staff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the case of the stakeholder staff, Marjorie&#39;s organization wanted to ratchet up innovation around the services they provided for people with autism and their families. This required attracting first-rate clinicians by boosting the organization&#39;s position on employment conditions. One indicator of success was an increase in the number of job applications from suitably qualified psychologists. “At last,” she says, “our organization&#39;s strategic plan and scorecard can speak to each other.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Measuring activity&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s how I illustrate this problem to groups of managers at my workshops. I say to them: “I propose to measure my performance today by measuring the number of slides I use. And if I&#39;m really tired at the end of the day I&#39;ll know I&#39;ve done a good job. Would you be happy with those as measures of my performance?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My audience always says no. “为什么？”我问。 “Because they&#39;re measures of activity, not of results,” they say. “And who decides on those results ?” I inquire. “We do,” comes the universal response. In that moment my audience “gets it.” I can see it in their faces.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How to fix it: Focus on outcomes.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Angelo heads up the national office of a well-known brand of construction tools. When it came to measuring the performance of his business, he explained: “We would get together and focus on what we do. The KPIs we produced were invariably about processes.” They broke this fixation by focusing on the outcomes his organization produced for its key stakeholders – customers, suppliers, employees, and the parent company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Measuring this performance involves a two-way street with outcomes going both ways – for the business and for stakeholders. Angelo and his team avoided making assumptions about what the outcomes would be for their stakeholders. Instead, they interviewed key stakeholders to learn if the outcomes important to them had been identified. The interviews also revealed new KPIs that Angelo and his team would never have thought of.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. Lack of focus&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sebastian is CEO of a suburban council. He wanted to develop a scorecard of the council&#39;s performance linked to the council&#39;s strategic plan. So, he collected measures from departments below him, such as community development, environment and planning, and corporate services, and he created a composite list. This list was long and left him dissatisfied. Many of the measures didn&#39;t seem at all related to the council&#39;s objectives.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How to fix it: Cascade rather than amalgamate your metrics.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Helen is a newly installed principal of a large, prestigious, and very expensive private girls&#39; school. To develop a scorecard for the school, she gathered measures from academic departments such as science, English and mathematics. But, as with Sebastian, the composite set of KPIs didn&#39;t work as measures of the school&#39;s performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She fixed this by starting again. This time, rather than amalgamating measures from bottom to top, she developed KPIs in the reverse order — from top to bottom. The process she says, “allowed me to kill two birds with the one stone. It uncovered gaps in the KPI set for the school and provided a fit between the school&#39;s strategic plan around students, parents, teachers and staff, government, [and] the community… [It also] provided an effective scorecard based on the results for these same groups.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Helen had learned a fundamental concept in performance measurement – level of analysis. Measures that apply at one level, eg, profit at the corporate level, don&#39;t apply at another level, eg, an internal department like HR. Similarly, measures that are apt at a department level are not appropriate at the corporate level.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s easy for gaps to develop between your strategic plan and your KPIs if you don&#39;t apply a framework consistently across both – and you&#39;re certainly not alone if this has happened to you.&amp;nbsp; As you close the gaps, however, remember above all that measuring performance is fundamentally about measuring your relationships with your &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;organization&#39;s key stakeholders.&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp; Your KPIs, therefore, need to be shaped by what those stakeholders expect from you and not by what you think you should be doing.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Harvard&rsquo;s Arthur C.

Brooks has a message for you: change your behavior before it&#39;s too late. Brooks was one of you: a pace-setting boss who expected others to work 80-hour weeks just like him, leaving little time for friends and family. He says he was addicted not to work, but to success. And he missed watching his kids grow up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today he classifies behavior like his as a pathology that can lead to misery. And he has concrete, actionable advice for increasing your life&#39;s happiness. In fact, he writes about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;in a regular column&lt;/a>; for &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Brooks, co-author (with Oprah Winfrey) of the forthcoming book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot;>;&lt;em>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s caused the severe dip in general happiness in the last few years?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The two traits of those who find true happiness in their work&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The difference between “deal friends” and “real friends”.

BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And the truth is that the book is based on a lot of the things I&#39;ve been teaching at the Harvard Business School, a class I teach called “Leadership and Happiness”, which is a very oversubscribed class. It has 180 in the seats, 400 on the waiting list, and there&#39;s even a secret Zoom link they think I don&#39;t know about. I&#39;m happy to talk about what I talk about with my students, with our wonderful viewers here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope a few of the students were just horrified to hear that you know about the Zoom link. But let&#39;s set some context. Start with some data.

BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s true.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the US at least, the number of cases of depression are up, the number of people who self-report themselves to be happy is down. I know it&#39;s impossible to say exactly why, but what&#39;s your hunch? What&#39;s going on here?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We do have a pretty good idea of what&#39;s going on. You find that happiness started to go into a little bit of a malaise, a bit of a decline, in the late &#39;80s, early &#39;90s, but then it took a real big dip when social media came along.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media was catastrophic for happiness. Part of the reason is we distract ourselves when we&#39;re lonely with something that&#39;s the equivalent of burgers and fries for a social life. They give you lots of calories and not very much nutrition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a lot of neuroscience behind this, but everybody knows that when you&#39;re bored or you&#39;re lonely and you start looking at your devices and at your phone, you actually get more bored and you get more lonely. This is a huge problem, especially for young adults.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the coronavirus came along, and this was the most catastrophic event for public happiness that we&#39;ve seen in a long time worldwide. Ordinarily, about 30% of people would say they&#39;re very happy about their lives, and 15% would say they&#39;re not happy. The rest are in the middle. Those are flipped. Now it&#39;s about 30% who are not happy and 15% who are very happy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those trends have not actually turned around. We know that it has everything to do with social life. It has everything to do with our love relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We know the habits that bring the happiest life—your philosophical or your faith life, your family life, your real friendships, and work that serves others in person—these have been in decline. When those things go in decline, there&#39;s no tech that&#39;s going to solve the problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You do have your finger on it. I want to focus on the world of work. I think this is drawing from stats in the book, I think you say just 16% of employees self-report that they&#39;re very satisfied with their work. I want to ask about that because we&#39;re spending half our waking hours in the office, and yet we&#39;re not getting the kind of fulfillment and satisfaction that we deserve. So what&#39;s happening here and how can we think about moving the needle?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been studying what brings work satisfaction for the longest time, and when I first started off, I was a fresh PhD. I thought, well, let&#39;s see if for-profit versus nonprofit versus government work: which brings the most happiness? Turns out, that&#39;s insignificant. So I said, well, high salaries versus low salaries. Above a certain level of subsistence, it&#39;s a wash. College educated, not college educated, white collar, blue collar, none of it matters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two things show up on the happiest workers, the people who have the greatest happiness from work. They feel like they&#39;re earning their success, which is to say that they&#39;re creating value with their lives and with their work lives, that their accomplishments are moving the needle and they&#39;re being recognized for those accomplishments. And number two, they feel like they&#39;re serving people so that they&#39;re needed. These are the two big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of people are watching us right now who are employers, and I&#39;ve been a CEO too. The number one thing that you can do for recruitment, for retention, the ultimate rewards that go far beyond money are making sure that you have a system where people are earning their success through their merit and personal accomplishment. They know it, they see it, and so do their friends. And they actually feel like they&#39;re serving other people and they can see the faces of the people for whom they&#39;re creating value. These are the big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One more thing to keep in mind, those things are easiest to do when we&#39;re in person. That&#39;s just it. You said we spend half of our lives with our coworkers at work. Well, I don&#39;t know, man, not anymore. A lot of people are spending half of their lives in front of a Zoom screen where it&#39;s hard to earn your success, it&#39;s hard to feel like you&#39;re serving other people, and you don&#39;t even get to see your work buddies. That&#39;s tough stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re right, then there must be some self-deception here. If you ask people, they like hybrid. They like working from home. They talk about it giving them a better work-life balance, all of that we think would translate into fulfillment and happiness. But do you think we&#39;re fooling ourselves?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, there&#39;s a set of biases that are at play here. For example, one of the things we find is that when you&#39;re really lonely, it impairs the executive centers of your brain. We know this. This is the reason that when you&#39;re really sad and lonely, you cocoon on the couch with a comfortable blanket streaming Netflix and eating Haagen-Dazs. What you should do is get up and go outside and get some vitamin D and ride your bike and call your friends, but you&#39;re impaired at that particular moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the pandemic people started to become more isolated. They made the best of that isolation by creating lives that were very, very convenient, I have to say.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, some people do have a way better work-life balance because they want to spend all that time with their families. The problem is all of the people that are separated from their family and their friends and actually not seeing people at work, that&#39;s really catastrophic when it comes to happiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book in many ways is about agency: happiness and fulfillment are not based on external variables or things that happen to us, but all very much within our control. The problem is it&#39;s very hard to take dramatic actions to reorder one&#39;s life. How do you get people who understand they should be doing this, but who don&#39;t? How do you make that leap?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the problem is that a lot of people notice that they can manage their money and they can manage their company, but they can&#39;t manage their feelings. Or they can manage their home and they can manage their family life, but they can&#39;t manage their emotions. The reason is that emotional life is a different species of problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stuff around us in our work, these are complicated problems, meaning they&#39;re hard to figure out. But once you do, you can master them and repeat the solutions over and over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life and your emotions, the affairs of the heart and the feelings that you&#39;re getting, positive and negative, they&#39;re not complicated at all. They&#39;re what mathematicians would call a complex problem. That&#39;s a problem that&#39;s very easy to understand and that no amount of computational horsepower can solve it for you. You can only get in it and experience it and work with it in real time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cat is a complex problem. A toaster is a complicated problem. Your job is more like a toaster and your relationships are more like a cat. Your feelings are highly complex. The result is that I can master all these highly complicated things, but I can&#39;t get my mind around my feelings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution starts with understanding the science of human emotion. This is what I&#39;m doing in a lot of my work. This is when my HBS students come to me, these phenomenally talented and successful MBA students, really at the best business school in the world. And they&#39;ll say, “My biggest problem is I can&#39;t manage how I feel, and I feel like I&#39;m really out of control.” So the number one skill that we get is to treat your emotional system, the limbic system of your brain, like anything else that you would be managing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about it as a complex system that you&#39;re participating in, and using the techniques that we talk about in the class, which start with basically this idea of learning how to experience your emotions, not as they&#39;re delivered to you, but in the prefrontal cortex of your brain so that you can decide how to react, substitute emotions, and even disregard the emotions, but on purpose. That&#39;s a specific set of techniques called metacognition that I walk through based on cutting-edge neuroscience. Anybody can do it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is, we don&#39;t teach kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach school kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach business people to do this. If I had my way, every business school and every high school would have this class, and when you came to work for a big company, they would have a class in metacognition and emotional self-management that you have to go through for the first week in orientation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I assume these business students are, as you said, incredibly successful by any measure. There&#39;s probably a split, but do you find they crave what you&#39;re teaching or that they come in skeptical of what you&#39;re teaching?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They really crave it. I mean, the most skeptical ones are probably not taking the class. It&#39;s an elective, after all. The ones who are really skeptical are across the hall in supply chain management or something. But the truth is that they really crave it and it&#39;s because they want it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My approach is basically this: you can be happier, but you have to understand the science. You need to use the science to change your habits and your lifestyle, and then you need to teach it to other people to make it permanent in your life. The class is called “Leadership and Happiness” because I want every leader to become a happiness teacher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m doing 175 talks a year outside of Harvard, talking to business audiences primarily. And I say, “Look, I&#39;m going to show you a bunch of PowerPoints on the science of happiness, and what I want you to do is to take these slides, take my name off, put your name on, and I want you to teach it to somebody so that you permanently understand this technology and you don&#39;t forget it in your own life.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s the way to get it done. That&#39;s the way that we teach it at Harvard, and it really, really works. I&#39;m telling you, Adi, I am my own first patient in this work, quite frankly. Because I wanted to be happier. As a social scientist, I applied my own toolkit to myself. I wanted to be a happier person. And since I&#39;ve been writing about the science of happiness, guinea-pigging it on myself, everything that I suggest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; and to my students, I do myself first to make sure that I actually believe it works. I&#39;m not just reading academic journal articles and then teaching it to other people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My happiness has risen by 60% in the last four years. In just four years. To be sure it started at kind of a low baseline, but 60% is a lot based on the best measurement techniques for happiness. So I know it works, and I see the results of this every day among my students as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s keep you on the couch a bit more. You come across as a positive, presumably happy person. I know first impressions can be off, but even the sentence, “My happiness is up 60%,” I can&#39;t imagine really what you&#39;re measuring to come up with such a specific figure. What are some measurements? Why have your numbers changed and how?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are some general wellbeing surveys people can take. They&#39;re all over the Internet. And if they&#39;re psychometrically robust, they can do a good job. What I like to look at, however, is I pull apart the negative and positive intensity levels in affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affect means mood. What we find is that if you have a little bit of a malaise, if you&#39;re kind of a melancholic person, either your happiness levels are too low or your unhappiness levels are too high.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, it seems like I&#39;m splitting hairs here, but I&#39;m not. A lot of people think happiness and unhappiness are opposites: that if you&#39;re unhappy, it means you have a lack of happiness. That&#39;s completely wrong. Happiness and unhappiness, or positive and negative emotion, they largely exist in different hemispheres of the brain. They&#39;re produced for different reasons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The negative emotions of fear and anger and disgust and sadness, these are evolved to keep you alive. You should be very, very grateful for your negative emotions. But if they&#39;re too intense, they can hurt your quality of life. Your positive emotions of joy and love and interest in things, again, these are evolved and they&#39;re really good things to have.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that some people, their happiness levels are too low. Other people, their unhappiness levels are too high. I have a test that I administer to my students. I didn&#39;t develop it. It was developed by psychometricians about 20 years ago. But it&#39;s called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psytests.org/emo/panasen.html&quot;>;PANAS test&lt;/a>;, the positive affect negative affect series, and it separates out the intensity of your positive and negative emotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happens is effectively that you have four different characteristics. You can be high positive and high negative. You can be low positive and low negative. You can be high positive and low negative, and of course you could be high negative and low positive. These are a quarter of the population each.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High, high, this is a high affect person, it&#39;s called the mad scientist. That&#39;s me. My problem with wellbeing is not that I&#39;m unhappy or that I&#39;m not happy enough. On the contrary, it just means that I need to manage my high levels of negative affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other people have different issues. Everybody wants to be high positive and low negative. That&#39;s called the cheerleader. It turns out cheerleaders have problems, too. If two cheerleaders meet each other and marry, for example, they won&#39;t be able to bear any threat or listen to any bad news or think that anything bad might happen in the future. They&#39;ll spend all the money and go bankrupt. Cheerleaders, they tend to be pretty rocky CEOs because they will not listen to bad news, and they tend to get wiped out by threats.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High negative, low positive, these are poets. They tend to be extremely creative, but they suffer a lot from sadness and these negative emotions. They have to manage that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last, low, low, these people are not horribly unhappy or low quality of life. They have low intensity affect. These are judges. These are people who are sober. They make great surgeons, they make great litigators and judges. They make great parents of teenagers, high stress professions, etc. But they tend to look a little unenthusiastic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I give these tests to my students so they can know who to marry, how to manage themselves, how to build a management team around them that complements them. It&#39;s really, really instructive, and this is one of the ways that I measure my own happiness and the management techniques that I need, using the neuroscience for my life, and that I can apply to the lives of others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To what extent do we need to be happy at work? I mean, one approach to work could be I do it, I am hopefully making decent money to be able to sustain myself, and I&#39;m focusing on my personal development, on my happiness outside of work. Obviously in an ideal world, we&#39;re happy and contented everywhere, but do we need to be happy at work? How critical is that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s an empirical question about whether or not people that have a high quality of life tend to be happy at work or it doesn&#39;t matter. And the truth is, if you&#39;re unhappy at work, you&#39;re probably unhappy in life. It&#39;s simple. I mean, it&#39;s like nobody works an hour a day. Maybe you&#39;re one of these lucky people that can be on the four-hour work week. My friend Tim Ferriss wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357&quot;>;that famous book&lt;/a>;, and the truth is, a lot of people could get their work done in a lot less time than they do. But most of us don&#39;t have that luxury.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been working 80-hour weeks my whole career, and part of it is a pathology. I&#39;m not going to kid you, I talk a lot in my research about self-objectification, workaholism, which is all based on success addiction, and fears of failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And everybody out there watching, you know I&#39;m talking about you too. So take care of these pathologies because these are addictions like anything else, and there&#39;s a lot of brain chemistry in that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is, you&#39;re going to spend a ton of time doing that. And if it&#39;s drudgery, that&#39;s bad. You don&#39;t want drudgery. At very least it should be something that&#39;s pleasant and making it pleasant sometimes it&#39;s completely out of our grasp. If you have a job that you truly hate and a boss who&#39;s just the worst, well, that&#39;s no good. But a lot of it is in our hands, and this is a lot of what I&#39;m working on and what I&#39;m trying to help people understand they can actually manage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You just mentioned workaholism. I think many of us suspect we suffer from it, but maybe aren&#39;t willing to look too closely at whether that&#39;s true. But the workaholism is a high, we get a sense of who we are, a sense of accomplishment, etc. But surely it&#39;s not fully a good thing. What is your advice to workaholics who may not realize that that is what they are?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To begin with, workaholism is actually horrible for your quality of life. The problem is that when you&#39;re a workaholic, people congratulate you. Nobody says, “Man, you are so good at drinking gin.” Nobody ever says, “Dude, you&#39;re unbelievable at how much methamphetamine you can consume.” These are not compliments. People feel sorry for you when you&#39;re addicted to other substances or gambling or pornography or anything else that&#39;s deleterious, dangerous, and addictive, that captures your brain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But workaholism, man, you work all night, you work 100-hour weeks, people are like, “Dude, you&#39;re killing it.” And you&#39;re like, “Yeah, I feel so good about myself, but how come I can&#39;t maintain a proper relationship?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The truth of the matter is that there are really a portfolio of four things that go into having a truly happy life, and they need to be in both in abundance and in balance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Number one is faith and philosophy, whether it&#39;s religious or not religious, it has to be something that zooms you out on the majesty of life and makes you small so that you have yourself in perspective. You&#39;re going to have peace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, you&#39;ve got to be paying serious attention to your family relationship. No joke, family relationships are the most mystical kind of love, and you can&#39;t substitute anything for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your friendships, now, this is a really bad one for workaholics. Workaholics have a lot of deal friends, but not very many real friends. Everybody watching us knows the difference between real and deal. And if you don&#39;t, take the fellow workaholics, take the 10 people that you see most and spend most of your time with and write real or deal after each one, and see for yourself that you need to tune this up. Deal friends are useful, real friends are beautifully useless to you. Do you have enough useless people? That&#39;s the question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least is work. The two parts of work that really matter are not title, not money, not admiration, not power, [but] earned success and serving other people. Workaholism militates against these sources of fulfillment in our lives. It impoverishes. It makes us poorer so that we actually can&#39;t pursue these other pillars. The result is we just don&#39;t have a balanced portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look, if everything you do for your happiness is work, that&#39;s like putting your entire pension into Greek bonds. It might work out, but I&#39;m an economist. I don&#39;t recommend it. That&#39;s not a diversified strategy. You&#39;re most likely not going to retire the way you want to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Saudi Arabia, it&#39;s a simple, intriguing question. Is happiness contagious?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, happiness is absolutely contagious because social contagion is a real thing. There&#39;s a really great study, Adi, more or less in our neighborhood, they&#39;re called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/&quot;>;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a>; from Framingham, Massachusetts. It looks over 50 years. It was set up to look at people&#39;s lives, at how different social aspects of life are contagious for physical stuff, whether obesity is socially contagious, etc. But they started to look at other things like happiness, and they found that just being in the vicinity of a happy person makes you happier. Having your spouse get happier makes you happier. Having your best friend get happier makes you a lot happier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even more contagious is misery. That&#39;s the reason you don&#39;t want your teenage kids to hang out with a kid who wears all black and looks bummed all the time. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s like, “Oh, that sucks. Everything sucks.” You don&#39;t want that because that&#39;s so socially contagious that your kid is going to become unbelievably negative and become sad. And nobody wants this for their children because they have a sense of the social contagion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number one issue that I see in family dynamics is a social contagion of negativity. That&#39;s what each one of us has to turn around, is to try to inject the happiness virus into our family and to basically do it on purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a question from Nepal that picks up on your themes. You&#39;ve talked about people taking agency in their own life and their own fulfillment and sense of happiness. But how should we deal with people in leadership who don&#39;t believe in any of this stuff, who don&#39;t believe in work-life balance? You can work on yourself, but as you said, misery and all this stuff is contagious. How can you move the needle on leadership that doesn&#39;t appreciate any of this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to leadership, leader lead thyself. Your number one employee is you. Don&#39;t be the pace-setting leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember when Daniel Goleman wrote that famous book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Results-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/1633692620&quot;>;&lt;em>;Leadership That Gets Results&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;? It was about the six types of leaders, and the number one leadership characteristic that everybody thinks is great—but is actually horrible—is workaholic pace-setting leaders that are in the office all the time and saying, “Look, if I&#39;m going to ask people to work hard, I have to work even harder.” It&#39;s incredibly dispiriting for other people. It lowers their quality of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a CEO, I&#39;m telling you, somebody on my executive team says, “Arthur, you got to stop sending email at 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM because people are going to stay up wondering if they&#39;re going to have to answer your email.” I said, “I don&#39;t expect anybody to…” That&#39;s not the point. So I put timers on my email to do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even better was when my wife started clamping down and saying, “You need to sleep more. You need to go to the gym more. You need to have more of a life.” So number one, if you&#39;re a leader, you need to get a hold on this problem because you&#39;re going to be hurting yourself, wrecking your relationships, and disheartening all the people around you. This is a big problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, don&#39;t work for a workaholic. Don&#39;t work for them if you can. And again, not everybody&#39;s got all these degrees of freedom, but most of us have a few choices in what we can do for work. And by the way, if it turns out that your boss is abusing you and hopelessly addicted to drugs, you got to change circumstances. That&#39;s an abusive relationship. I recommend steering clear of workaholics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, what&#39;s behind workaholism, fellow workaholics? It&#39;s the success addiction. Workaholism is a secondary addiction to the addiction of success, and a lot of that&#39;s based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/10/howto-arthurbrooks-happiness-identity-drshefali-mindfulness-meaning-2021/620282/&quot;>;objectification of yourself&lt;/a>;, which is a bad thing to do, and a deep, deep set of fear of failure. Those are the things to actually start working on. You can&#39;t just say, “Work less, what&#39;s the problem?” It&#39;s self-objectification and fear of failure, almost always.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you think of new entries to the workforce, and some of them are your HBS students who are working for investment banks, who are working for law firms, and there is this expectation of exploitation where, yes, I&#39;m working around the clock. It is killing me, but it is getting me to where I will be rich, fulfilled, happy. How can people who are ambitious in those fields do otherwise?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that I tell my students is you&#39;ve got to have a balanced happiness portfolio, and killing all of your relationships to spend 110 hours in an investment bank is the worst, most unbalanced happiness portfolio you can possibly get. Plus, you&#39;re losing your best years to establish the relationships that you&#39;re going to want to cultivate for the rest of your life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People say, “Okay, I&#39;m 28. I&#39;m going to go get an investment bank job, they&#39;re going to expect me to work a hundred hours a week. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll look for a spouse when I&#39;m 35.” Probably not. I got the data, and the data don&#39;t lie. You&#39;re more and more likely to actually not have the thing that&#39;s going to give you the most happiness in your life, which is your marriage. We actually have to think in a balanced-portfolio approach to the happiness that we&#39;re trying to get, and making those sacrifices are really bad sacrifices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, guys like you and me, our age, in our fifties, you notice that we don&#39;t make those sacrifices anymore. And the reason is because our time parameters are shorter. But also we&#39;ve had bitter experience with these types of things. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s like I&#39;m a grandfather now and my grandson was born and suddenly I was a lot less interested in working. But part of it was the bitter experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ll tell you a story actually that will motivate this. When I was interviewing this woman for my last book, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Finding-Success-Happiness-Purpose-ebook/dp/B08WCKY8MB&quot;>;&lt;em>;From Strength to Strength&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, about how to get happier as you get older, a titan of Wall Street. This woman was just famous and rich, a billionaire, and she was horribly unhappy. She was my age, late fifties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What&#39;s wrong?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “Well, my husband and I were roommates. I&#39;m kind of cordial with my adult kids, but it&#39;s not close. I&#39;m getting bad reports from the doctor. I think I drink too much. I need to go to the gym. My employees are starting to doubt the wisdom of my decision-making. And I don&#39;t know, what do I do?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What do you mean? You don&#39;t need a Harvard professor to tell you what to do. You&#39;re prescribing to yourself, stepping back, going away with your husband. You&#39;re already rich. Why don&#39;t you do that?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “It&#39;s true, but I guess I&#39;ve always chosen to be special rather than happy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boom, man. It was like a knife to my heart, Adi. All these years when I was running a company and the 14th hour at the office before the first hour with my kids, well, news flash man, they grew up. They grew up and I missed a lot of it. And I really, really regret that. Now I&#39;m not going to miss it with my grandkids, I get a do-over. I&#39;m not going to screw that up twice. That&#39;s a really important thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I could have had a little bit more perspective, I would not have been less successful. The data don&#39;t lie on this either. The 14th hour is not productive. It&#39;s just compulsive. Just like any other addiction, the 14th drink doesn&#39;t give you more joy. Stop at two, is the bottom line, because you need the balance in this part of your life as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At HBR we try to be super practical, so before you go, can you leave the audience shortcuts to happiness, or just things that viewers can think about or do today that can be a meaningful step in that direction?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in the Atlantic&lt;/a>;, every Thursday morning, I have a big topic and I do talk about the science, but then I always give three ways to live this thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just in general, since we&#39;re on the meta topic of happiness, the way to think about happiness is that it&#39;s not a feeling. If happiness were a feeling, that would be very disappointing. It would depend on how you slept last night and what you ate for breakfast and no good. If your spouse yelled at you this morning, no good. Don&#39;t chase the feeling. Feelings are evidence of happiness, like the smell of the turkey is evidence of your Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is three things that we need to be thinking about and managing in our lives. Enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose. Those are the three big things that we need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enjoyment is not pleasure, pleasure is an animal thing. Enjoyment is the pleasure you get plus the people that you enjoy it with and the memories that you&#39;re making. That&#39;s why beer commercials don&#39;t have a guy alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack. They have people enjoying a few beers together because it&#39;s pleasure plus people plus memory. Don&#39;t do the stuff that makes you feel good alone. That&#39;s the rule of thumb.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second is satisfaction. Satisfaction is the joy you get when you struggle for something and you get that. Now fellow strivers, the striver&#39;s curse is you get on something called the hedonic treadmill where you struggle and struggle and achieve it, but then it doesn&#39;t give you very much satisfaction for very long and so you keep trying and trying and trying again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution to that is not to have more, it&#39;s to want less. Your satisfaction is your haves divided by your wants. Manage your denominator with a wants-management strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least, it&#39;s meaning, it&#39;s purpose in your life. The way to figure out if you have a purpose crisis is asking yourself two simple questions. There&#39;s no right answers, but you have to have answers. “Why am I alive, and for what am I willing to die today?” And if you don&#39;t have answers, go looking for the answers with introspection. When you see somebody that finds those answers, it&#39;s like an actual miracle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the three things practically to think about. “Do I have enjoyment or just pleasure? Am I managing my wants or my haves, so I can have satisfaction? And do I have enough meaning in my life by answering those two questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s great.

But implicit and unconscious biases &amp;#8212; not to mention the constant juggling of priorities required at work &amp;#8212; can lead to inequitable decision-making. In this article, drawing on recent research, the authors suggest that this problem can be addressed by making DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, to managers immediately before they need to make consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation. The authors discuss three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Most people don&#39;t think of themselves as biased or prejudiced, and people often explicitly endorse diversity as something companies should strive for. But many organizations struggle with DEI. Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implicit or unconscious biases can lead to inequitable decision-making. More mundanely, people are just busy. They have lots of competing priorities and lots to occupy their brains. Even if they care about DEI, they might not have it top of mind as they go about their work. As a result, they might not see how their decisions are relevant for DEI and so might inadvertently make inequitable decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fix this, managers and organizations should make DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, when it matters most — that is, when consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation are being made. Our academic research and experiences partnering with companies suggest that to make real progress on DEI, managers and organizations need to make DEI salient in those moments of consequential decision-making. We&#39;ve identified three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Ask managers to hire for more than one job at a time. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many hiring decisions are made in isolation, with only one person being hired at a time. When this is the case, diversity simply just isn&#39;t that salient to decision-makers, who are often thinking not about diversity but instead about technical skills, cultural fit, or how quickly a candidate can start. This shouldn&#39;t be surprising, because diversity is a property of groups, not individuals. You can describe a group of people as “diverse” or “homogeneous,” after all, but not an individual person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, when people make collective hiring decisions — when they hire multiple people at a time — our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3533&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that people select more diversity. They start thinking about the candidates they&#39;re selecting as a group, which makes diversity more salient and leads to hiring decisions that improve it. For example, rather than hiring one person every month, a company might benefit from grouping these decisions together and hiring three people very quarter. The total number of people hired will be the same, but making collective decisions every quarter should lead to more diversity. Relatedly, it might also be beneficial to give one person oversight over hiring decisions across teams or departments, enabling that person to make collective hiring decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Ask managers to make diversity more salient in the promotion process. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This recommendation comes from work that we&#39;ve done at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morethannow.co.uk/single-post/2022/8/22/the-inclusion-lab&quot;>;Inclusion Lab at MoreThanNow&lt;/a>;, a collaboration of academics and consultants focused on generating empirical evidence about what actually works at improving DEI in the workplace. Specifically, it grows out of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/why-you-should-start-ab-testing-your-dei-initiatives&quot;>;field experiment&lt;/a>; we conducted with a global management, engineering, and development consultancy that wanted to know if we could help it increase equity in its promotions process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this company, promotions are made by a group of high-level senior managers in a bi-annual promotions process, during which managers can nominate their employees for promotion. Managers justify their nominations in a statement of 50 words or less in an online form. In our experiment, 116 of these senior managers were randomly assigned to receive one of two messages in advance of submitting their nominations. The control group was asked to consider promoting people who had displayed excellent performance and competence beyond their current grade. The treatment group was asked to consider the same criteria — but also to consider the diversity of their nominees as a whole, and whether their choices would help to close representation gaps. In other words, we made DEI more salient for this group of managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened when we did this? Although the sample for this experiment was small (which means some caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings), we found that making diversity salient increased the number of employees promoted from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. The effects seem to be driven by male senior managers, who at baseline may have been less likely to think spontaneously about diversity. We did not find any statistically significant positive or negative treatment effects on the promotion rates of female employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Ask managers to view a short diversity training video right before formal people decisions. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This suggestion uses salience to help organizations dramatically rethink how they implement diversity training. Prior research suggests that training is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/does-diversity-training-work-the-way-its-supposed-to&quot;>;largely ineffective at actually changing behavior&lt;/a>;. However, we think this may be because it doesn&#39;t make DEI salient in the moment of consequential decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In most organizations, people are given diversity training when they get onboarded, or perhaps on an annual basis. That&#39;s often months or years before they actually make consequential hiring, promotion, or performance-evaluation decisions for the company, which means they&#39;re extremely unlikely to have the messages of the training in mind when they make those decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine instead if an organization had managers take a short training immediately prior to making a consequential HR decision. Because the training happens just before the decision, it has a much higher likelihood of ensuring that DEI remains salient and encourage managers to make more equitable choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have evidence of exactly this finding from a field experiment that we at the Inclusion Lab have been conducting with Ericsson, a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Sweden. We delivered an automated 5-minute DEI training to some managers before they screened resumes and found that the managers who got this training were significantly more likely to hire people from underrepresented groups at Ericsson.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experiment suggests that the significant amount of time and cost we invest into DEI training can indeed pay off — but only when organizations choose the right moment for it. One-off “blanket” training may well not be the way forward. Instead, organizations may want to consider how to use repeated smaller training modules in advance of key decision points to make DEI salient and therefore effective. We see this as fertile ground for further experimentation in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most people really do want to do the right thing when it comes to DEI, but they often just need a nudge or prompt to keep DEI top of mind at the right time. Our research strongly suggests that managers and organizations can do this by making DEI more salient at moments of consequential decision-making.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
