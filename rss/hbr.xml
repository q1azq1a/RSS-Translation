&lt;span>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;>;当您看到一名员工在一项您可以轻松完成的任务上苦苦挣扎时，它&amp;#8217想要介入并提供帮助是很自然的。但从另一方面来看，这更像是微观管理而不是支持。当领导者因给自己保留太多工作而过度运作时，他们就会让周围的人无法发挥作用。我们都知道委派是多么重要既可以帮助员工成长，又可以创建一个更具协作性、授权性和生产力的团队。您如何才能更好地掌握这项关键的领导技能？&amp;#160;首先，从实干者心态转变为领导者心态。其次，拥抱学习过程中的不适。第三，确定委托风险较小的低风险任务。最后，保持好奇心和促进性，而不是规定性。&amp;#160;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; “你如何证明销售和费用估算的合理性？”首席执行官问道。我的脸红得结结巴巴。我的心跳加快，喉咙发紧。我看着我的老板瓦莱丽。她进行了眼神交流，温柔地注视着，什么也没说。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;她本可以缓解我的一些热情。她插话救了我，但她没有。那是因为我请求瓦莱丽给我一个向我们组织的领导团队展示的机会。在会议之前，她通知我们银行部门的负责人和首席执行官，我将承担这项延伸任务，而她将担任观察员。因此，当我面临棘手的问题时，她并没有接管我的工作，而是让我自己想办法摆脱不适。&lt;/span>;这让我为下次与他的会面做好了更好的准备。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;我记得瓦莱丽是一位好老板，因为她经常给我这样的发展机会。风险通常很低，就像小型内部会议一样，每个人都知道我仍然是新手并且会提供支持。瓦莱丽在场，但在幕后，让我成功或失败，但无论哪种方式都可以从经验中学习。后来，她再也没有给我一长串如何改进的建议。相反，她提出了很好的问题，促使我思考我可以采取哪些不同的做法。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;理论上，大多数领导者知道将具有挑战性的任务委派给员工是多么重要，这不仅可以帮助他们成长，还可以创建一个协作、授权、高效的团队。但是，面对真实的工作场所需求，将其付诸实践可能很困难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;我的许多客户都会说“我是唯一能胜任这项工作的人”或“如果这个项目进展不顺利，整个项目就会失败”。团队将会受苦。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;同理心可以&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/connect-with -empathy-but-lead-with-compassion&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;妨碍&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; ， 也。当您看到员工陷入困境时，您很自然地想要介入并提供帮助。但从另一方面来看，这更像是微观管理而不是支持。当领导者因承担太多任务而过度运作时，他们就会导致团队运作不足。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这里有一些您可以用来简化授权的策略。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;从实干者心态转变为领导者心态&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400 ;&quot;>;在我的公司工作中，我们将最优秀的实干家提拔为领导者。这是基于这样一种假设，即他们会神奇地从擅长并受卓越绩效和奖励激励转变为擅长并深切关心开发他人的潜力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;心态转变可能是最困难的部分。那么，你如何才能自己促进这一点呢？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;注意您所做的事情的回报。&lt;em>;&lt;/em>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;成就的快感提供了快速&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noesislearning.com/2019/11/19/the -neuroscience-of-achievement/&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;多巴胺命中&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;。但你需要抵制这种情绪，才能获得帮助他人进步的更大成就感。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;通过明确价值观来彰显您的领导身份。问问自己：我希望人们用哪三个词来描述我的领导风格？例如：我想要以控制力、紧迫感和专业知识来领导吗？或者，有耐心、好奇心和授权？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;有意识地回应，而不是反应。当您被触发介入的时刻，问问自己：这符合我的价值观以及我想成为的领导者吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;接受学习过程中的不适&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;许多领导告诉我，在目睹员工犹豫不决后，收回工作感觉是最支持的事情。我也感受到了这种紧张。但瓦莱丽教会了我保持斗争空间的力量。是的，这会给领导者和员工带来不适，因为这对每个人来说都是一种新的工作方式。但是，如 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallup.com/workplace/389807/top-things-employees-next-job.aspx&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;盖洛普提醒我们&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;，工作投入的关键之一是提供刺激挑战的机会。当你完成斗争时，结果就是各方的成长。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;如何才能拥抱而不是抵制，学习的不适？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;说出您的情绪&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/3-ways-to-better-understand- your-emotions&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;根据&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;心理学家 Susan David，提供了清晰度和弹性，可以让您有意识地做出回应，并符合您的价值观。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;将不舒服正常化。 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edutopia.org/article/neuroscience-behind-productive-struggle/&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;神经科学家知道&lt;/span>; &lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这是学习和培养毅力的时期。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400；” aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;重新构建情况。一个潜在的重构是：“我被允许去奋斗，这就是我对自己的技能充满信心的地方。因此，我将给予我的员工同样的时间来自己解决问题。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;区分高风险任务和低风险任务&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;领导者经常告诉我，他们仍然被困在实干家的行列中，因为员工犯了太多需要干预的高影响力错误。但这种情况通常发生在老板自己把所有工作都抓了太久，然后被迫在错误的时间委派出去的时候。关键是在风险较低且可以容忍甚至预期出现失误时转交任务。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;是什么让环境低风险？失败对学习的支持大于对声誉的损害。错误不会影响团队或公司的成功。环境对于停留和重来是安全的。相关人员对学习曲线上经验不足的同事表示支持和同情。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;要了解哪些任务适合委派，请考虑哪些任务现在你觉得很容易或死记硬背，但对你团队中的人来说是很好的发展机会吗？还要考虑一下那些会耗尽您精力、与您的技能、才能和优势不相符，但可能会令人兴奋并感觉非常适合其他人的工作。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;例如，如果您的员工的目标是培养更好的演讲技巧，请尝试先进行低风险活动，例如要求他们主持下一次员工会议，然后再进行高风险活动，例如主持客户会议会议。或者，如果他们想更好地影响他人，请挑战他们在使用新工具或工作流程方面获得小团队的支持，然后再要求他们说服整个部门实施它。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp ;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;保持好奇心并提供帮助&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;在我的企业职业生涯的早期，作为一名培训师，人们告诉我，我在主持的课程中明显感到紧张。我向老板解释说，我担心无法回答参与者的问题。她的回答是：“如果你的角色不是获得所有答案而是促进房间里的专业知识怎么办？”这改变了我的观点。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;像培训师一样，领导者不能指望拥有所有答案。但他们确实需要有耐心和好奇心，并提出有洞察力的问题来促进学习。例如：您目前的做法是什么？你能应用过去的经验来解决这个问题吗？这种情况教会了你什么？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;最后，练习慈悲和恩典。这并不意味着要容忍不努力或粗心的错误。相反，它意味着当某人没有完全按照您的方式做事时提供理解和通融。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Valerie&#39;s那天与我们首席执行官的接触当时感觉不太好。但如果她介入，我就不会学会如何回答意想不到的问题，也不会在事后反思如何更好地准备高管演讲。如果她遵循建议，我就不会发现自己真正的改进方法。直到今天，我仍然相信她帮助我培养了在高风险情况下冷静表达的能力。她也是我有勇气将工作委托给同事和团队成员的原因，即使这意味着看着他们挣扎。这是我们所有人（领导者和员工）成长的唯一途径。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/ div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-train-generative-ai-using-your-companys-data?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>;

&lt;p>;利用公司的专有知识对其竞争能力至关重要并创新，尤其是在当今动荡的环境中。组织创新是通过知识资产和专有技术的有效和敏捷的创建、管理、应用、重组和部署来推动的。然而，组织内的知识通常是通过各种来源和形式生成和捕获的，包括个人思想、流程、政策、报告、运营交易、讨论区以及在线聊天和会议。因此，公司的综合知识往往下落不明，并且难以以有效或高效的方式组织和部署在需要的地方。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以大型语言和图像生成人工智能模型形式出现的新兴技术为以下领域提供了新的机遇：知识管理，从而提高公司绩效、学习和创新能力。例如，在财富 500 强业务流程软件提供商进行的一项&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;中，基于生成式 AI 的客户支持系统提高了客户支持代理的工作效率并提高了保留率，同时也为客户带来了更高的积极反馈。该系统还加快了新手代理的学习和技能发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像该公司一样，越来越多的组织正在尝试利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的语言处理技能和一般推理能力来捕获并为内部（或客户）提供广泛的获取其自身智力资本的途径。他们将其用于向面向客户的员工通报公司政策和产品/服务建议、解决客户服务问题或在员工离开组织之前获取知识等目的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些目标也是在 20 世纪 90 年代和 2000 年代初“知识管理”运动的鼎盛时期，大多数公司发现当时的技术不足以完成这项任务。然而，如今，生成式人工智能正在重新点燃在整个组织及其外部获取和传播重要知识的可能性。正如一位为此目的使用生成式人工智能的经理所说，“我感觉喷气背包刚刚进入我的生活。”尽管目前取得了进步，但过去导致知识管理困难的一些因素仍然存在。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;基于人工智能的生成式知识管理技术&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p >;将组织的特定领域知识纳入法学硕士的技术正在迅速发展。目前，将专有内容合并到生成模型中的方法主要有三种。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;从头开始训练法学硕士&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;一种方法是从头开始创建和训练自己的特定领域模型划痕。这不是一种常见的方法，因为它需要大量高质量的数据来训练大型语言模型，而大多数公司根本不具备这种能力。它还需要获得相当大的计算能力和训练有素的数据科学人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彭博社是采用这种方法的公司之一，该公司最近宣布，它已经为特定于金融的内容和自然的内容创建了 BloombergGPT。与其数据终端的语言接口。彭博社拥有 40 多年的财务数据、新闻和文件，并结合了来自财务备案和互联网数据的大量文本。彭博社的数据科学家总共使用了 700 个令牌，即约 3500 亿个单词、500 亿个参数和 130 万小时的图形处理单位时间。很少有公司拥有这些资源。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;微调现有的法学硕士&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;第二种方法是“微调”培训现有的法学硕士，将特定领域的内容添加到系统中，已经接受过一般知识和基于语言的互动方面的培训。这种方法涉及调整基本模型的一些参数，通常需要更少的数据（通常只需要数百或数千个文档，而不是数百万或数十亿），并且比从头开始创建新模型所需的计算时间更少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;例如，Google 在其 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/sharing-google-med-palm-2-medical- Large-language-model&quot;>;Med-PaLM2&lt;/a>;（第二版）医学知识模型。该研究项目从 Google 的通用 PaLM2 LLM 开始，并根据来自各种公共医疗数据集的精心策划的医学知识对其进行了重新培训。该模型能够回答 85% 的美国医疗执照考试问题，比系统的第一个版本提高了近 20%。尽管进展如此之快，但当根据科学事实、精确性、医学共识、推理、偏见和伤害等标准进行测试，并由来自多个国家的人类专家进行评估时，开发团队认为该系统在应用于临床之前仍需要大幅改进。实践。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，微调方法有一些限制。尽管比培训法学硕士所需的计算能力和时间要少得多，但培训成本仍然很高，这对谷歌来说不是问题，但对许多其他公司来说却是问题。它需要大量的数据科学专业知识；例如，Google 项目的&lt;a href=&quot;chrome-extension://bdfcnmeidppjeaggnmidamkiddifkdib/viewer.html?file=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09617.pdf&quot;>;科学论文&lt;/a>; 31 位共同作者。一些数据科学家认为，最适合的不是添加新内容，而是添加新的内容格式和风格（例如像威廉·莎士比亚那样聊天或写作）。此外，一些 LLM 供应商（例如 OpenAI）不允许对其最新的 LLM（例如 GPT-4）进行微调。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;提示调整现有的 LLM&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;也许为非云供应商公司定制 LLM 内容的最常见方法是通过提示进行调整。通过这种方法，原始模型保持冻结状态，并通过包含特定领域知识的上下文窗口中的提示进行修改。经过及时调整后，模型可以回答与该知识相关的问题。这种方法是三种方法中计算效率最高的，并且不需要在新内容域上训练大量数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，摩根士丹利使用即时调优来训练 OpenAI 的 GPT -4 模型使用精心策划的 100,000 个文档集，其中包含重要的投资、一般业务和投资流程知识。目标是为公司的财务顾问提供关于他们在为客户提供建议时遇到的关键问题的准确且易于获取的知识。经过及时培训的系统在私有云中运行，只有摩根士丹利员工才能访问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然这可能是组织采用的三种方法中最简单的一种，但它并非没有技术挑战。当使用文本等非结构化数据作为 LLM 的输入时，数据可能太大且包含太多重要属性，无法直接在 LLM 的上下文窗口中输入。另一种方法是创建向量嵌入——由另一个预先训练的机器学习模型从文本生成的数值数组（摩根士丹利使用 OpenAI 中的一个称为 Ada 的模型）。向量嵌入是该数据的更紧凑的表示，它保留了文本中的上下文关系。当用户在系统中输入提示时，相似性算法会确定哪些向量应提交给 GPT-4 模型。尽管一些供应商正在提供工具来简化这一快速调整过程，但它仍然足够复杂，以至于大多数采用该方法的公司都需要拥有大量的数据科学人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，这种方法不需要如果所需的内容已经存在，这将非常耗时或昂贵。例如，投资研究公司晨星 (Morningstar) 在其基于生成人工智能的 Mo 研究工具中使用了即时调整和向量嵌入。它包含了超过 10,000 项晨星研究成果。经过大约一个月的系统工作后，晨星就向其财务顾问和独立投资者客户开放了 Mo 的使用。它甚至将莫附加到一个可以说出答案的数字化身上。这种技术方法并不昂贵；在使用的第一个月，Mo 回答了 25,000 个问题，每个问题的平均成本为 0.002 美元，总成本为 3,000 美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;内容管理和治理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;与传统知识管理（其中文档被加载到 Microsoft Sharepoint 等讨论数据库中）一样，使用生成式 AI，在以任何方式定制法学硕士之前，内容需要是高质量的。在某些情况下，就像 Google Med-PaLM2 系统一样，已经有广泛可用的医学知识数据库。否则，公司需要依靠人工管理来确保知识内容准确、及时且不重复。例如，摩根士丹利在菲律宾有一个由 20 名左右的知识经理组成的团队，他们不断地根据多种标准对文档进行评分；这些决定了是否适合纳入 GPT-4 系统。大多数没有精心策划内容的公司会发现仅出于此目的而这样做具有挑战性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;摩根士丹利还发现，如果内容作者意识到，保持高质量的知识会容易得多如何创建有效的文档。他们需要参加两门课程，一门是关于文档管理工具的课程，另一门是关于如何编写和标记这些文档的课程。这是该公司内容治理方法的一个组成部分，内容治理方法是一种捕获和管理重要数字内容的系统方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在晨星，内容创建者正在学习什么类型的内容适合 Mo 系统，以及什么不。他们将内容提交到内容管理系统中，内容会直接进入提供 OpenAI 模型的矢量数据库。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;质量保证和评估&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一个重要的内容管理生成式人工智能内容的一个方面是确保质量。众所周知，生成式人工智能有时会产生“幻觉”，自信地陈述不正确或不存在的事实。此类错误可能会给企业带来问题，但在医疗保健应用程序中可能是致命的。好消息是，根据特定领域信息调整法学硕士的公司发现，幻觉比开箱即用的法学硕士问题要小，至少在没有扩展对话或非业务提示的情况下是这样。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;采用这些方法进行生成式人工智能知识管理的公司应制定评估策略。例如，对于旨在回答金融和投资问题的 BloombergGPT，该系统在公共数据集金融任务、命名实体识别、情感分析能力以及一组推理和通用自然语言处理任务上进行了评估。 Google Med-PaLM2 系统最终旨在回答患者和医生的医疗问题，具有更广泛的评估策略，反映了医疗领域准确性和安全性的重要性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生死攸关。这是摩根士丹利的一个问题，但对金融和投资问题做出高度准确的回答对于公司、其客户和监管机构来说非常重要。系统提供的答案在发布给任何用户之前都经过了人工审核员的仔细评估。然后由 300 名财务顾问进行了几个月的试点。作为持续评估的主要方法，摩根士丹利制定了一组 400 个已知问题的“黄金问题”。每次对系统进行任何更改时，员工都会用黄金问题进行测试，看看是否存在任何“回归”或不太准确的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;法律和治理问题&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;与 LLM 部署相关的法律和治理问题非常复杂且不断变化，导致涉及知识产权、数据隐私和安全、偏见和道德以及虚假/不准确输出的风险因素。目前，LLM输出的法律地位仍不清楚。由于法学硕士不会生成用于训练模型的任何文本的精确副本，因此许多法律观察家认为版权法的“合理使用”条款将适用于他们，尽管这尚未在法庭上得到测试（并且没有经过法庭测试）。所有国家的版权法中都有此类规定）。无论如何，对于任何广泛使用生成式人工智能来管理知识（或大多数其他目的）的公司来说，让法律代表参与调整后的法学硕士的创建和治理过程是一个好主意。例如，在晨星公司，该公司的律师帮助创建了一系列“预先提示”，告诉​​生成人工智能系统应该回答哪些类型的问题以及应该礼貌地避免哪些类型的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;用户提示公开- 可用的LLM用于训练系统的未来版本，因此一些公司（&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-ai-like-例如，chatgpt-for-staff-after-misuse-of-chatbot.html&quot;>;三星&lt;/a>;）担心机密和私人信息的传播，并禁止员工使用法学硕士。然而，大多数公司用特定领域内容调整法学硕士的努力都是在公共用户无法访问的模型的私有实例上进行的，因此这应该不是问题。此外，一些生成式人工智能系统（例如ChatGPT）允许用户关闭聊天记录的收集，这即使在公共系统上也可以解决机密性问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了解决机密性和隐私问题，一些供应商为法学硕士提供先进和改进的安全功能，包括删除用户提示、限制某些主题以及防止将源代码和专有数据输入到可公开访问的法学硕士中。此外，企业软件系统供应商正在其产品和服务中纳入“信任层”。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-aims-to-plug-ai-trust-gap-with-new-tech-tools-19e11750?mod=djemCIO&quot;>;Salesforce&lt;/a >; 例如，将 Einstein GPT 功能纳入其 AI Cloud 套件中，以解决希望快速部署 LLM 功能的公司与这些系统在业务环境中带来的上述风险之间的“AI 信任差距”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 >;&lt;strong>;塑造用户行为&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;易于使用、广泛的公众可用性以及跨越各个知识领域的有用答案，导致了基于人工智能的生成知识的快速、无指导和有机采用由员工管理。例如，最近的一项调查表明，超过三分之一的受访员工在工作中使用生成式人工智能，但 68% 的受访者没有告知主管他们正在使用该工具。为了抓住生成式人工智能应用知识管理的机遇并管理潜在风险，公司需要培养一种透明和问责的文化，使基于生成式人工智能的知识管理系统取得成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了政策的实施之外和指南，用户需要了解如何安全有效地将生成式人工智能功能融入到他们的任务中，以提高性能和生产力。生成式人工智能能力，包括对背景和历史的感知、通过聚合或组合各种来源的知识生成新内容以及数据驱动的预测，可以为知识工作提供强大的支持。基于生成式人工智能的知识管理系统可以自动化信息密集型搜索过程（例如法律案例研究）以及大容量和低复杂性的认知任务，例如回复常规客户电子邮件。这种方法提高了员工的效率，使他们能够将更多的精力投入到工作中复杂的决策和解决问题方面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些可能需要通过培训或政策灌输的具体行为— 包括：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;了解系统可以提供哪些类型的内容；&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;如何创建有效的提示；&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;提示的类型以及允许对话，哪些不允许对话；&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;如何请求将额外的知识内容添加到系统中；&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;如何使用系统的响应来与客户和合作伙伴打交道； &lt;/li>;

The CDC has set a target for air changes in occupied spaces to reduce the risk of airborne infections such as Covid-19. The federal Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which took effect on June 27, 2023, mandates that employers provide &amp;#8220;reasonable accommodations&amp;#8221; for pregnant workers. And the recent intense air pollution from Canadian wildfires that extended across much of the United States highlighted yet another reason: forest fires. This article describes three steps that organizations can take to improve air quality in a cost-effective fashion.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/making-the-air-in-the-office-cleaner?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/making-the-air-in-the-office-cleaner?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set five air changes per hour (ACH) as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html&quot;>;target&lt;/a>; amount of ventilation needed in occupied indoor spaces, such as offices and stores, to better reduce the risk of airborne infections such as Covid-19. This level will better protect everyone and is especially important for immunocompromised and other at-risk groups who can&#39;t be adequately protected by vaccines. (The CDC still advises both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-who-are-immunocompromised.html&quot;>;immunocompromised&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html&quot;>;pregnant&lt;/a>; people to avoid crowded or poorly ventilated indoor spaces.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond this recommendation, there are additional reasons that organizations should take this target seriously. One is the federal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-pregnant-workers-fairness-act&quot;>;Pregnant Workers Fairness Act&lt;/a>;, which took effect on June 27. Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws&quot;>;Americans with Disabilities Act&lt;/a>;&#39;s required protections for the immunocompromised, it mandates that employers provide “reasonable accommodations” for pregnant workers. (Like those who are immunocompromised, pregnant people and their developing babies are also at greater risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/special-populations/pregnancy-data-on-covid-19/what-cdc-is-doing.html&quot;>;serious complications&lt;/a>; from Covid-19.) Another is a phenomenon that seems to be occurring much more frequently: forest fires. The recent intense &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-06-16/air-quality-new-york-pollution-wildfires-climate-change&quot;>;air pollution&lt;/a>; from Canadian wildfires that extended across much of the United States is a glaring case in point.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Upgrading central air systems to achieve five ACH would, for many buildings, require extensive and costly renovations. Even once completed, these systems would incur exorbitant &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CathNoakes/status/1586299281752920064&quot;>;energy costs&lt;/a>; to cycle large amounts of air through them. Alternatively, businesses could take three steps to readily achieve five ACH by using cost-effective in-room, portable air cleaners.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Install portable air cleaners (purifiers).&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722029813&quot;>;Portable, low-noise air cleaners&lt;/a>; such as HEPA purifiers and do-it-yourself (DIY) air cleaners &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patientknowhow.com/safe.html&quot;>;assembled&lt;/a>; from box fans, filters, and other off-the-shelf materials are a cost-effective method to implement the CDC target by recycling the air in each room. Based on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/san-francisco-unified-seeks-nearly-3-million-to-buy-air-purifiers-for-every-classroom/2639904/&quot;>;experience&lt;/a>; in San Francisco schools, three DIY purifiers can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.05.22281734v1&quot;>;exceed&lt;/a>; the CDC target for as little as $250 to $400 (about $0.25 to $0.50 per square foot) for a typical 900-square-foot &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtmnUc8cBE&quot;>;classroom&lt;/a>; with 10-foot ceilings — and a monthly energy bill of less than $10. Since HEPA can be store bought and DIY &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN3kYm7bXJs&quot;>;quickly&lt;/a>; constructed, they can be implemented as an effective clean air solution within a matter of days — results that have been verified by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132322011507&quot;>;CDC&lt;/a>; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.13163&quot;>;US Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a>;. DIY air cleaners are being offered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectn95.org/free-air-purifiers/&quot;>;for free&lt;/a>; to organizations that serve the disadvantaged. Even more energy-saving DIY models using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cleanairkits.com/&quot;>;personal computer cooling fans&lt;/a>; have recently come to market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the number of purifiers needed and their total cost rises in proportion to both room volume and air exchange target. Many purifiers come with variable speeds. They need to be set to run at a speed needed reach the CDC target of five ACH; otherwise they will be less effective and may not reach the intended target. Once installed and running, the air exchange rate can be checked using handheld &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278555v10&quot;>;particle counters&lt;/a>; to measure the change in air particles present in a room.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Exceed the new CDC target with 12 ACH in crowded situations.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To limit bacterial growth, fish tanks typically use filtration systems to clean water at least four times an hour (every 15 minutes), analogous to four air ACH for air in a room. Until recently, there has been a lack of clarity on the degree of air cleaning needed to effectively reduce viral transmission in buildings. So in 2022 we &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2799161&quot;>;wrote to the CDC&lt;/a>; in the Journal of the American Medical Association, asking it to say clearly how many ACH are necessary to stop Covid. CDC researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2799159&quot;>;replied&lt;/a>; that although they were not aware of Covid-19 outbreaks in spaces with five to six ACH, 12 ACH or more (like an airplane inflight or airborne isolation room in a hospital) may be needed in some situations. As the number of people in the space increases, the probability of transmission increases, which could require more ACH and distancing to reduce risk. For example, the California Department of Public Health &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/EHLB/IAQ/CDPH%20Document%20Library/School_ventilation_and_filtration_ADA.pdf&quot;>;recommends&lt;/a>; a minimum of six and ideally 12 ACH in schools.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Run air cleaners during business hours to reduce costs and replace filters periodically.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Filters and fans can either be replaced on a regular schedule recommended by the manufacturer or, if an organization wants to be conservative, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722029813&quot;>;testing&lt;/a>; shows that their performance has dropped below acceptable levels. Testing can reveal when filter or fan lasts longer than expected or if its performance dips sooner than expected (eg, a filter has clogged up with particles or has lost its ability to filter particles after an intense wildfire smoke event). In some places, such as hospitals, they may need to be run 24×7, but for many businesses, if turned on only during typical business hours (eg, 9 am to 5 pm) when people are present, they can last up to four times longer and consume four times less power. They can either be turned on and off manually by someone in the room or via low-cost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009KSECO8&quot;>;motion sensors&lt;/a>;, which can be set to turn them off automatically after 20 minutes of inactivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businesses can implement these three steps to cost effectively support the new CDC standard and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/air-purifier-smoke-covid-best/2021/08/29/28ea4176-0740-11ec-a266-7c7fe02fa374_story.html&quot;>;protect&lt;/a>; people from Covid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-21-03-tn-0046&quot;>;wildfire smoke&lt;/a>;, allergens, and any other airborne dangers that might arise. These simple steps to clean the air will end up benefiting everyone and create a much more inclusive environment for at-risk groups of people, including the immunocompromised, pregnant people, the elderly, children, and those with chronic heart and lung conditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 05 Jul 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Does Your Company Have a Culture of Quiet Retaliation?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/does-your-company-have-a-culture-of-quiet-retaliation]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jul23_05_1423429755.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Quiet forms of retaliation are incredibly common and can be contagious in the workplace. The organizations that accept this form of retaliation as a standard practice have difficulty hiring and retaining great people. Retaliation &amp;#8212; in all its forms &amp;#8212; not only harms current team members, but a culture that tolerates retaliation results in harm to the mission and the organization&amp;#8217;s ability to deliver to its customers and stakeholders.

Overt, loud moments of retaliation absolutely do happen, like when someone is fired after speaking up or formally sharing a concern. However, in our work with teams, we often witness much more subtle forms of retaliation that occur frequently and are commonly dismissed or ignored. Subtle, often silent, retaliation destroys careers, erodes the targeted individual&#39;s sense of worth, and damages the team&#39;s effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have yet to meet any leaders who would describe themselves as retaliatory, but we regularly see retaliation occurring on teams. When the leader only sees retaliation through the lens of overt and audacious actions, they&#39;re overlooking its more subtle manifestations, whose consequences are just as serious. If leaders are unable to recognize these behaviors in themselves and others, they risk causing both short- and long-term harm to individuals, teams, and the organizations they serve. To create cultures where psychological safety is the norm, innovation thrives, and team effectiveness is high, we must tune into the retaliation that happens in the shadows.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Reality of Retaliation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the United States, employee retaliation was cited in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-releases-fiscal-year-2020-enforcement-and-litigation-data&quot;>;55.8% of claims&lt;/a>; filed with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in FY20 — and that&#39;s just what gets reported. Reporting retaliation can come with significant risk to individuals&#39; financial stability, future career advancement, and reputation. And the amount of time and emotional energy required to report it serves as a deterrent for many people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the most common acts of retaliation involve actions managers &lt;em>;don&#39;t&lt;/em>; take.&amp;nbsp;This quiet — sometimes covert — retaliation is incredibly harmful because it can continue undiscovered, unnamed, or unreported for years. And it doesn&#39;t just impact the targeted individual, but can decrease the level of trust, creativity, and productivity in team members who witness it and perpetuate a culture of abuse. In her article “&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/06/times-up-for-toxic-workplaces&quot;>;Time&#39;s up for Toxic Workplaces&lt;/a>;,” Villanova professor Manuela Priesemuth shares how a culture of abuse and retaliation can “spread throughout the organization, creating entire climates of abuse. Because employees look to and learn from managers, they come to understand that this type of interpersonal mistreatment is acceptable behavior in the company.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are five specific examples of covert retaliation we&#39;ve observed in our work coaching leaders and the teams they serve:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Withholding coaching, feedback, or professional development opportunities&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Withholding resources for a project or division&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Intentionally giving a challenging assignment with little support or giving a challenging assignment that&#39;s destined to fail&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Discouraging others from listening to or valuing a team member&#39;s voice, expertise, or contributions&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Excluding a team member from essential meetings or withholding information that&#39;s essential to their job function&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Mark*, who was known to be retaliatory, served as the CEO of a large retail company for over a decade before retiring. As we worked with the remaining leadership team under the new CEO, it quickly became clear that Mark&#39;s departure alone wasn&#39;t enough to quell employees&#39; fears. Even though Mark was no longer there, an observable level of fear continued in the company. We heard from several leaders that any disagreement with Mark would mean the end of your growth within the company. “He had a look he would get when he was disappointed with someone for speaking up,” we heard from several leaders. “He would draw a line through your name instead of under it. Everyone knew and it was basically game over. You&#39;re stuck.” For Mark, retaliation took the covert forms of social undermining and exclusion. The impacts on the organization were significant: Innovation stalled, the culture suffered, and the business stagnated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Julia is the CFO of a midsize technology company. When she received notification of a hostile work environment complaint from within her department, she shared that she was aware of the issues because they had been occurring for years but had avoided addressing them. Julia had always been vocal about not wanting people on her team to discuss any problems with HR. “Why can&#39;t people just put their heads down and get their work done? And why is it my job to deal with their childish behavior?” she asked her peers. Julia proceeded to strip the complaining team member of her access to information and documentation that were essential to performing her job. Julia also stopped responding to her emails in a timely fashion and hoped the lack of correspondence would lead to delays in projects being completed on time to further make the team member look bad in front of her peers. When questioned about these actions, Julia responded, “It can&#39;t be retaliation because I didn&#39;t fire them.” We often see leaders engaging in quiet acts of retaliation that carry big impacts, but they don&#39;t see them as retaliation because they narrowly define retaliation as terminating the employee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ron had served as the charge nurse in a hospital emergency room for 15 years and was favored for a substantial promotion within the year. While the formal leaders within the hospital appreciated Ron&#39;s strict, traditional style of management, the other ER staff had a very different experience. “If you do something that bothers him — maybe express a concern or point out that certain supplies are low — you can expect that everything you say or do in the future will be scrutinized. He can&#39;t take any feedback, even about straightforward things like the inventory of masks or gloves,” we heard from one shift leader. In this particular situation, the negative impact on the culture and the logjam created by the ongoing negative scrutiny impacted not only the department, but also jeopardized public safety.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How Leaders Should Self-Assess Their Impact&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Leaders often see themselves as the gatekeepers of what is right in their department or organization. In each of the situations we just described, the leaders believed that&#39;s what they were doing. The danger lies not in failing to see the disconnect between your intention and your impact. The ripple effect of a leader&#39;s retaliation is immense. When leaders lack the tools needed to deepen the self-awareness of their actions and their impact, the consequences can be dire for all stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We tend to judge ourselves by our good intentions and others by their impact. One of our guiding leadership principles is: You don&#39;t determine your impact; other people do. So how can you better assess the impact of your actions and understand the root cause of your behavior? Start with these three practices:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Conduct a courageous audit.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Examine your own behavior and dig deep into the motives behind your actions. We highly recommend the practice of a “courageous audit” grounded in the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/hgse100/story/changing-better&quot;>;Immunity to Change&lt;/a>; by Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey. The Immunity to Change model is particularly effective in this situation because it challenges us to think about how our actions (or lack thereof) are getting in the way of creating a psychologically safe work environment. Think about the situations with team members that have frustrated you the most and look for ways you behaved that were unproductive or potentially retaliatory. Challenge yourself to curiously ask and courageously answer: What am I doing or not doing that&#39;s getting in the way of a safe culture?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Becoming aware of counterproductive behaviors is the first step to changing them. We hear regularly from leaders that reflecting on themselves in this way feels too vulnerable in front of colleagues, so working with an experienced coach is an effective way to enhance your self-awareness around your thoughts and actions in the workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Identify your shadow intentions.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Shadow intentions are when we act (consciously or unconsciously) from a place of ego and self-protection. Push back on your own stated desire to “be helpful” or to “protect your department.” In what ways have your thoughts or actions been intended to hurt a team member through covert or passive methods? When have you been driven by self-protection in a way that has gone unchecked? When might you have allowed your first, stress-driven reaction to negatively affect the impact you&#39;re making on others?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Elizabeth was part of a growing IT company and by all accounts a vital member of the leadership team. She was also passed over for promotion numerous times when mergers occurred and “room had to be made for the incoming leaders.” While she wanted to continue to prove her worth and lead her team well, she needed support to actively untangle from her shadow intentions of wanting the new leaders to fail so she could be rewarded for her excellence and ongoing commitment. By working to loosen the grip her shadow intentions had on her, she was able to bring more of her focus back to her own division and better supporting innovation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Explore your in-group/out-group.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Assess your thoughts and assumptions about those around you. Who gets to be honest with you, even disagree with you? Whose opinions do you value?为什么？ Whom do you struggle with? What commonalities exist between the people in your in-group versus your out-group?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Identifying your own patterns is the pivotal first step of working toward a team where everyone is included and can contribute fully. Dan, the CEO of a midsize firm, wanted to think differently about several leadership changes that were occurring due to retirements. He wanted to bring the new executives in and build a cohesive team with the remaining members. In an audit of his own in- and out-groups, he discovered that two leaders of the executive team were in his out-group. Both had started during the pandemic, and Dan hadn&#39;t had the one-on-one time with them he usually invests in new executives on his team. Dan decided to start building connections with them more intentionally by scheduling individual lunches once a month and initiating a 15-minute one-on-one with each of them once a week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many strategies help leaders in connect with their out-group, but the most important point thing to keep in mind is that the person with the most power must initiate the connection.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Quiet forms of retaliation are incredibly common and can be contagious in the workplace. The organizations we serve that accept this form of retaliation as a standard practice have difficulty hiring and retaining great people. Retaliation — in all its forms — not only harms current team members, but a culture that tolerates retaliation results in harm to the mission and the organization&#39;s ability to deliver to its customers and stakeholders. Organizations are defined by what they celebrate and what they tolerate. Leaders who engage in or tolerate retaliation can create lasting scars on individuals and organizations alike. The humans we serve deserve better.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;em>;* Names have been changed throughout to protect privacy.&lt;/em>; &lt;/div>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 05 Jul 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Removing the Roadblocks That First-Generation Americans Face at Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/removing-the-roadblocks-that-first-generation-americans-face-at-work]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jul23_03_1369183308.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Many first-generation Americans face a cultural seesaw effect when trying to be successful in Western workplaces. For example, members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community can find it challenging to self-promote, as it goes against their values. They&amp;#8217;re taught from a very young age to be humble, to stay under the radar, and to never correct authority figures, as a sign of respect. They hope their hard work will simply speak for itself. But self-promotion and voicing opinions have become key elements needed to thrive in Western workplaces, which clearly advantages some and disadvantages others. Further, first-generation Americans and other marginalized communities endure numerous generational, societal, and workplace traumas that create mental health disparities, which can result in an apprehension to advocate for themselves in work environments. While leaders cannot control how their employees will cope with societal and generational trauma, it is their responsibility to foster environments where all employees can feel secure in raising their hands for support. In order for this to successfully occur, organizations should closely look at whether current employee behaviors are in fact promoting inclusivity, or if processes and norms need to be modified to provide an equitable landscape for all workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/removing-the-roadblocks-that-first-generation-americans-face-at-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/removing-the-roadblocks-that-first-generation-americans-face-at-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When my family immigrated from India to the US nearly four decades ago, they had no indication of what a new world would bring. They were filled with hope that this relocation would provide a surplus of opportunities unavailable before. With that hope came a justified reservation about acceptance in a new community, so they applied a strategy many immigrant families deploy: assimilate and prosper.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The goal was not to suppress our identities. In contrast, it was to engage in a new environment with foreigners in a non-burdensome way. Rather than demanding a promotion at their jobs, my parents patiently waited until their hard work was finally rewarded — years after their American peers. Instead of asking for support in their daily duties, they silently took on additional responsibilities to prove their worth. Both of my parents wore their sense of altruism, undying commitment, and unwavering devotion as a badge of honor — blissfully passing these values onto me in hopes that I would replicate their work ethic in my career.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I entered the workforce with my parents&#39; worth ethic, fearless spirit, and integrity to carry me through my future endeavors. Unfortunately, history repeated itself in an unexpected way. I was exploited for my hard work. My boundaries were constantly being violated by senior leadership. I was petrified when it came to seeking support from my team because I was convinced that this would be a sign of weakness and would tarnish my professional image, ultimately hindering growth opportunities. It created a version of me that I despised: insecure, hesitant, and incredibly docile.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Working as a First-Generation American &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;My formative years were spent thinking my family environment was unique, but this was far from the truth. Many first-generation Americans face similar challenges as they navigate the societal expectations of two cultures at a very young age, resulting in a unique phenomenon called the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdep.12071&quot;>;immigrant paradox&lt;/a>;“.&amp;nbsp;First-generation Americans experience diminishing developmental outcomes, educational achievements, and even mental health challenges because of the racial and ethnic disparities in the US — challenges our parents or even recent immigrants do not face since they immigrate normally post-adolescence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To exacerbate this experience, first-generation Americans also face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/mental-health-children-of-immigrants-wellness/index.html&quot;>;immigrant guilt&lt;/a>; as they try to desperately hold onto the traditions they inherited while harmonizing within a culture their families could not provide any guidance about. Adapting to the Western culture while feeling “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-othering-5084425&quot;>;othered&lt;/a>;” can lead to the inability to forge an identity that neatly falls within both cultures, traditions, and experiences. While our families may have had the best intentions in providing us with their wisdom and perceived values of success, it did not translate well into a workplace construct that was built for people who never shared our identities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the cultural seesaw effect that many first-generation Americans face when trying to be successful in the workplace. The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community (and many cultures alike) find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-we-need-to-talk-about-asian-american-mental-health?cid=other-eml-dre-mip-mck&amp;amp;hlkid=a774e1a8976d4a078406df70a8406fd5&amp;amp;hctky=12012649&amp;amp;hdpid=9ae1a3af-4f90-48c7-84bd-0389613c0228&quot;>;challenging to self-promote&lt;/a>;, as it goes against our values. We&#39;re taught to be humble and stay under the radar. We have been taught from a very young age to never correct authority figures, as a sign of respect. Similar to how my parents navigated their careers, many AAPI community members hope their hard work will simply speak for itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So why is this important for workplaces and leaders to consider as they seek to create equitable and inclusive work environments? &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/savvy-self-promotion&quot;>;Self-promotion&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2012/03/19/6-reasons-employees-must-speak-up-to-thrive-at-work/&quot;>;voicing your opinion&lt;/a>; have become key elements needed to thrive in Western workplaces, but this clearly advantages some and disadvantages others. Further, first-generation Americans and other marginalized communities endure numerous generational, societal, and workplace traumas that create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/cultural-competency/education/mental-health-facts#:~:text=Racial%2Fethnic%2C%20gender%2C%20and,of%20awareness%20about%20mental%20health&quot;>;mental health disparities&lt;/a>;, which can result in an apprehension to advocate for themselves in work environments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if employers take an approach that commits to prioritizing inclusivity across all identities and backgrounds, then we can make progress in our distorted definition of success.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How Leaders Can Change the Narrative and Help Fix a Flawed System&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Leaders cannot control how their employees will cope with societal and generational trauma. Yet, it is their responsibility to foster environments where all employees can feel secure in raising their hands for support. In order for this to successfully occur, organizations should closely look at whether current employee behaviors are in fact promoting inclusivity, or if processes and norms need to be modified to provide an equitable landscape for all workers. In my experience in working with global organizations, taking this critical pause before churning out solutions has proven to be a pivotal factor in revamping inclusion.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Assess Your Inclusion Efforts &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In order to understand what practices are supportive of inclusion and which are not, a thorough assessment is required. In previous leadership roles, I have successfully conducted this assessment that ultimately evaluates inclusion across organizational and management practices through three specific dimensions: Co-creating success as a team, fostering communities with purpose, and evaluating the effectiveness of feedback mechanisms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These three dimensions serve as a comprehensive approach to further understanding the organization&#39;s context, culture, and intent in creating substantive inclusion. It also serves as a foundation for leaders to deep dive into prevailing processes to determine if the current company climate integrates the differences first-generation employees bring to the table, and allows them to be part of the decision-making process to achieve strategic objectives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once each dimension is thoroughly examined, taking action and prioritizing specific areas that need immediate attention is key. It will foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement from an organizational level, while simultaneously creating new practices where first-generation employees have the security to thrive.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Co-Create Success as a Team&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;We start with this dimension because our traditional workplace practices define success by emphasizing specific individual behaviors, instead of creating practices that benefit the entire employee population. This &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/how-to-infuse-liberatory-practices-into-work-practices&quot;>;divide and conquer&lt;/a>; approach specifically prevents first-generation employees from determining what success looks like for them, furthering the narrative that their unique insights are less important than the dominant group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As leaders, you can rectify these practices by first evaluating the level of collaboration and inclusion you provide for your own team. Commence reparative practices and invite all team members to define what success looks like for them. By doing so, you are providing first-generation employees the permission to relinquish their previous notions of the perfect employee, and create a culture of solidarity where they will be more likely to voice their opinions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, forging rules of engagement, understanding preferred communication styles with others, and finalizing what support leadership should provide at the start of a project maintains boundaries for each first-generation employee. Eventually, if you keep inviting opinions to the table — and revisit conversations about success definitions on an agreed-upon timeline — the stigma associated with raising concerns will slowly diminish. Further, maintaining these work relationships and reciprocally committing to meet each other&#39;s needs will allow for an equitable decision-making process and boost morale among all team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Foster Communities With Purpose&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Arguably, this may be the most important component of the inclusion assessment, because it offers up a safe haven for first-generation employees to discuss how they navigate unique workplace stressors that only apply to them. Employee resource groups (ERGs), for example, have been incredibly popular for organizations trying to increase their inclusion efforts. However, they often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/effective-employee-resource-groups-are-key-to-inclusion-at-work-heres-how-to-get-them-right&quot;>;fall short&lt;/a>; because they lack accountability or a specific mission. In my experience, I have seen ERGs solely being leveraged as an after-work social gathering — which is important, but does not cultivate corrective practices in the workplace that first-generation employees deserve. In order to make these communities more effective, I recommend finding a business sponsor who is already practicing &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/why-inclusive-leaders-are-good-for-organizations-and-how-to-become-one&quot;>;inclusive leadership&lt;/a>; to lead the ERG with empathy and strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a previous role, I acted as the business sponsor and supported the launch of a similar ERG with a six-month action plan. The first two months were to simply connect as a community — to decompress and speak about how our community is marginalized in particular ways. The third and fourth months were used to transition into strategy. We examined questions such as: &lt;em>;How can we empower ourselves to ask for support? What specific actions do we need leadership to take for us to continuously feel empowered in order to bring value back to the organization? &lt;/em>;These conversations were often difficult, and sometimes quite emotionally draining because it required many of us to revisit how our immigrant guilt manifests itself in the workplace. This is why the business sponsor of any ERG should be well-equipped and skilled to facilitate these conversations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lastly, the fifth and sixth months were dedicated to building a case to senior leadership in the specific work practices that needed to be amended in order for us to feel valued, included, and guarded in the workplace. A specific proposal was then developed with a coherent communication plan derived from the roundtable discussions we had in previous months. As we co-created this plan, each member of the ERG was invited to provide feedback and voted for the top concerns we wanted to address.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this collective support of the ERG community, we were able to establish new norms across client projects to address capacity constraints, enhance cross-collaboration with teams, and determine accountability measures across all levels. For many of the ERG members, this success came with a unique sense of ownership of their careers that had seemed foreign before. People in the community had been accustomed to remaining silent, trailing back to the generational trauma many of us carried as we navigated through various challenges into the workforce. However, this success was a glimmer of hope that self-promotion could actually lead to tangible results, fundamentally changing the way the business operates.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Evaluate the Effectiveness of Feedback Mechanisms &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While employee feedback through engagement surveys has become popular over the years as a definitive measure for enhancing inclusion, many first-generation employees will hesitate to offer their insights. Due to our complex identities, feeling othered, and lack of role models that share our identity, we feel compelled to assess the work environment first to determine if speaking up will be celebrated or punished — regardless of whether the feedback is imperative to change working conditions. To counteract this, leaders should actively analyze what type of culture they are promoting in order to retrieve an accurate glimpse of the work environment. Without this core component in psychological safety, employee engagement surveys will remain a false illusion of the organization&#39;s actual reality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if your goal is to decrease employee burnout by seeking suggestions through engagement surveys, evaluate the type of behavior you are celebrating prior to seeking feedback. If you are amplifying an employee working at all hours, allowing others to accept every client demand, or creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90662451/its-very-time-sensitive-why-a-fast-paced-work-environment-hurts-all-employees&quot;>;a false sense of urgency&lt;/a>;, you are not fostering an inclusive environment for others to raise their hand for support. In fact, you are telling your employees that this is the golden rule for everyone to follow. First-generation employees will not feel safe to provide feedback in addressing these negative workplace stressors because the organization inadvertently supports this type of burnout behavior. Regardless of how well-intentioned your surveys are, harmful work environments will negate any efforts to make substantial change and eradicate any creditability amongst your first-generation employees. However, if the end goal is to create sustainable and inclusive work environments, call out toxic behaviors as regularly as you can, making it known these are not expectations for employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once there has been a careful examination of workplace practices, seeking individual feedback via engagement surveys, team forums, or even via 1:1 meetings can further prove to empower first-generation employees. This continued course of action achieves a positive cycle of consistency where self-advocacy is encouraged, rather than expecting first-generation employees to overcome their reservations without the proper groundwork.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, as you seek feedback, carefully analyze the perspectives of your first-generation employees. You may not always agree with their feedback or even fully understand their point of view. However, it is still your responsibility to do your best to implement changes if your end goal is inclusivity. Once this process is underway, an important consideration is not to have the feedback stay idle. Ultimately, if feedback goes unheard, it can create an environment of mistrust between you and first-generation employees. Keep in mind that this specific group would have done a great deal to overcome their own internalized stigma in providing the feedback, in hopes that the culture of work would be transformed. Communicate how you will address the feedback and remain agile. It may be possible that you will need to spend some time deciphering feedback from your first-generation employees or have another follow-up questionnaire to clarify points when it comes to their working conditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As organizations continue to correct a flawed system by building inclusion for all communities, it is imperative to support those who may not be able to advocate for themselves. First-generation employees sit at a unique juncture in applying determination and diligence in a new era of work, continuously shifting between cultures. Organizations need to create an environment where we can shed our layers and authentically thrive in the hopes of creating a more equitable world.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 05 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Benefits of Being Bored at Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/the-benefits-of-being-bored-at-work]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_29_XLRivrl9mNI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;While boredom can be an unpleasant feeling, it can also be an opportunity to reflect on your interests, values, and goals. By recognizing the type of boredom you&amp;#8217;re experiencing and identifying the underlying causes, you can take steps to address them and find new ways to engage with the world around you. Working with your boredom can also help you develop creativity, resilience, and the ability to adapt to new situations. So rather than trying to avoid or ignore your boredom, consider working with it as a valuable tool for personal growth and a way to lead a more fulfilling life. Based on the body of research exploring this emotion, the authors highlight some of boredom&amp;#8217;s benefits and detriments and offer insights into how you might harness the best of boredom.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/the-benefits-of-being-bored-at-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/the-benefits-of-being-bored-at-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Bored at work?我们都去过那里。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691612456044&quot;>;Boredom&lt;/a>; is that experience of wanting to be occupied in a satisfying activity, yet somehow being unable to do so. And being busy is no antidote: You may be both very busy — and very bored — simultaneously.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early in life we learn that boredom is no fun, and as we age we might begin to see it as a waste of time, or a missed opportunity to do something more productive (or at least more interesting). At best, boredom has been considered an unpleasant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691612456044?journalCode=ppsa&quot;>;aversive &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/152c9TgGipX6UOMCIbfTdrGy_vN6kopCv/view?usp=share_link&quot;>;experience&lt;/a>;, and at worst, a state that evokes a deep sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/journal/13164&quot;>;meaninglessness&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXpz4j8kTTtUdXJdlak3e3_kuIJLNskz/view?usp=share_link&quot;>;.&lt;/a>; In addition, when feeling the discomfort of boredom, time &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNy8bUlah9IHjM1CZZjkS6EnRV7AxXzX/view?usp=share_link&quot;>;tends to pass slowly&lt;/a>;, which can make work days seem endless.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering this, it&#39;s no surprise that boredom often triggers an intense desire to escape the situation (or job!) that evokes it. In today&#39;s ultra-connected world, this escape is just one tap away. At your fingertips, you find a world of data, breaking news, shows and stories, messages from friends and family, or gifs, memes, and video clips that help you avoid feeling bored — at least at the surface level. Research shows that use of smartphones not only distracts the mind, it offers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJPHM-08-2016-0044/full/html&quot;>;addictive hit&lt;/a>; of dopamine, which &lt;em>;temporarily&lt;/em>; replaces the discomfort of boredom with pleasure. However, this&amp;nbsp;feeling is short lived, as this mindless scrolling results in long-term decreases in overall mental health and quality of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next time you&#39;re feeling that creeping sense of boredom at work, pause before you pick up your phone. Boredom can have important benefits, and you&#39;ll miss them if you&#39;re not tuned in to what you&#39;re feeling and why.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Pros and Cons of Workplace Boredom&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Boredom has a negative reputation for a reason. At work, it&#39;s often viewed as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053482222000766&quot;>;counterproductive state&lt;/a>; that ignites discomfort, desperation for a new role, or perhaps simply a desire for the day to end. Boredom at work has been linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bdm.2160&quot;>;risky decision-making&lt;/a>;, costly mistakes, and accidents triggered by inattention or lack of focus — and that&#39;s not to mention the fatigue that being bored can generate. Boredom can also incite other types of problematic behavior, such as “cyberloafing” (that is, non-work-related browsing) and childish emotional responses. Prolonged exposure to monotonous activities can even cause &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-pathology-of-boredom/&quot;>;hallucinations&lt;/a>;. In addition, when it comes to well-being, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187912200118X&quot;>;one recent study found&lt;/a>; a linkage between boredom at work and burnout, as well as decreases in job satisfaction and increased desire to quit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the flip side, recent research shows that boredom — when handled constructively — has big “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053482222000766&quot;>;bright sides&lt;/a>;.” Moments of boredom can offer a pause, or a short respite for your brain and body in a world designed to distract, overwhelm, and overstimulate. A sense of boredom can create the space to daydream, which can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073&quot;>;hatch creativity&lt;/a>;, new ideas, and innovation. Prolonged boredom can prompt you to reflect and ask yourself, “Am I on the right path? Am I doing the right thing?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Your Boredom for the Better&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re not advocating that you seek out jobs where you&#39;ll spend large parts of the day feeling bored. However, getting better at working &lt;em>;with&lt;/em>; your boredom — and harnessing it for the good — can help you capture its bright sides. Here&#39;s how:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Notice.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When you feel that discomfort of boredom setting in, avoid acting on it immediately. The fact that you&#39;ve noticed you&#39;re bored means that you&#39;ve managed to (briefly) resist the urge to instantly engage in mindless scrolling. Noticing and naming your boredom in order to intentionally direct it opens up the opportunity to develop your resilience and the potential to use boredom for positive ends. Most importantly, in a bout of boredom, don&#39;t make snap decisions (like to quit your job) as a way to escape the discomfort.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Decipher.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Not all experiences of boredom are the same — &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-013-9385-y&quot;>;research shows&lt;/a>; that various “types” of boredom manifest differently in the body and mind, giving rise to different behaviors. Decoding which types you&#39;re feeling early on can help you make a game plan to deal with boredom, or prevent it from escalating or clouding your decision making.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ask yourself what your boredom is telling you. Could it be that you simply need a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-to-take-better-breaks-at-work-according-to-research&quot;>;micro-break&lt;/a>; because you&#39;ve worked too long without pausing and you&#39;re tiring? Or maybe your tasks are becoming monotonous and you&#39;re losing motivation and energy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider what you&#39;re bored with specifically: Is it your role, the content or form of the work, or your prospects for the future in your job that bore you? Can you decipher a pattern with a typical type of work that ignites this uncomfortable feeling? This can be an opportunity to consider your goals and values and whether you feel you&#39;re moving forward or feel “stuck.” Here are five research-based types of boredom to consider as you work to decipher yours:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Indifferent boredom.&lt;/strong>; This is one of the more positive types of boredom. It can feel like relaxation or a sense of cheerful fatigue and reflects a general indifference to (and withdrawal from) the external world. This type of boredom can help boost rest and recovery, particularly during busy days.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Calibrating boredom.&lt;/strong>; This one&#39;s slightly more unpleasant and is one of the most common types. It occurs when you&#39;re not fully engaged in a task or activity and your mind starts to drift. It can show up as wandering thoughts or not knowing what to do to change the situation, yet wanting to get out of it somehow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Searching boredom.&lt;/strong>; This type reflects a restlessness and active search for alternative actions and distractions to ease the negative experience (eg, through other activities, leisure pursuits, interests, and hobbies). While unpleasant, this type of boredom ignites activity and the pursuit of change and often has positive outcomes, such as creativity, innovation, and personal growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Reactive boredom.&lt;/strong>; Reactive boredom arises in situations where a person is required to do a repetitive or tedious task (such as being stuck in a long and ineffective meeting with no chance of escape). It&#39;s an action-oriented and deeply unpleasant type of boredom, which causes restlessness and frustration that might be expressed in a more angry or aggressive fashion toward others or toward the boring experience. Those experiencing it may persistently fantasize about other options and feel anxious to make a change or escape quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Apathetic boredom.&lt;/strong>; This can relate to feelings of disinterest, lack of motivation, and emotional detachment toward activities or events one would normally find stimulating or enjoyable. Apathetic boredom isn&#39;t necessarily accompanied by feelings of frustration or restlessness but rather a sense of disengagement and indifference. It can occur as a result of chronic stress, depression, or other mental health issues and can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. People experiencing apathetic boredom may feel like they&#39;re going through the motions of life without any real purpose or enjoyment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Decide what to do.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Based on the type of boredom and what it&#39;s telling you about yourself or your situation, decide what to do about it. Maybe your boredom is simply allowing you to relax and unwind after a period of intensity at work. Or perhaps it&#39;s telling you something about your role itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All roles have certain elements that are monotonous, frustrating, or simply boring, and sometimes these tasks must be done to get to the “good stuff.” If you find yourself persistently bored, try to harness the boredom to catalyze change, perhaps by engaging in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2001.4378011&quot;>;job crafting&lt;/a>; to bring out the elements of your role that you really enjoy. This could involve, for example, making changes to the type, variety, complexity, or significance of your tasks. You might intentionally evade boredom by seeking out, envisioning, and championing new ideas at work, which can also boost your leadership abilities and potential. Reflecting and engaging in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23163710/&quot;>;nostalgia&lt;/a>; can also counteract the sense of meaninglessness you might feel when bored.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Cultivate mindful boredom.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Moments of boredom can be opportunities to help you unwind from a fast-paced and hyper-connected world and allow you the opportunity to simply be in the present moment. Use moments of boredom for positive intentions rather than mindless distraction, for example, by taking a moment to breathe, doing another activity you find simulating, or simply mindfully allowing the discomfort to pass. As boredom can spark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200522-how-boredom-can-spark-creativity&quot;>;creativity&lt;/a>;, you could even include space for it as unstructured time in your work routine, for example, before you&#39;re required to innovate, come up with new ideas, and be at your best.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While boredom can be an unpleasant feeling, it can also be an opportunity to reflect on your interests, values, and goals. By recognizing the type of boredom you&#39;re experiencing and identifying the underlying causes, you can take steps to address them and find new ways to engage with the world around you. Working with your boredom can also help you develop creativity, resilience, and the ability to adapt to new situations. So rather than trying to avoid or ignore your boredom, consider working with it as a valuable tool for personal growth and a way to lead a more fulfilling life.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 04 Jul 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[4 Ways to Earn the Respect of a More Powerful Colleague]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/4-ways-to-earn-the-respect-of-a-more-powerful-colleague]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_03_144694173.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;retales botijero/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When you are stuck in an unequal power dynamic, it helps to remember that not only is the placement of power temporary, but you can equalize it. In this article, the author outlines four strategies you can use to creatively pivot in the moment and frame the connection differently, so that you are building the respect you deserve and positively shifting the perception of your power.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/4-ways-to-earn-the-respect-of-a-more-powerful-colleague?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/4-ways-to-earn-the-respect-of-a-more-powerful-colleague?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether we want to acknowledge it or not, in many colleague relationships there is a power differential, often based on each party&#39;s status in the organization and who has more control over what the other needs at a given time. For instance, the engineering leader whose team ultimately determines a product line&#39;s time-to-market may hold more power over the sales leader trying to deliver for impatient customers, and the leader of a mature and “unexciting” business unit may find their needs consistently deprioritized by the IT department, which is rushing to support a fast-growing division, instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a deeply frustrating dynamic for those in the “inferior” position — but to develop a mutually respectful relationship with colleagues (and perhaps even claim more relative power), it&#39;s vital to take steps toward rebalancing the equation. With a willingness to assert yourself in creative ways, you develop more agency for yourself, particularly at times when feeling dismissed or dependent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_pushing_up_to_a_point.pdf&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; there is a “Goldilocks” effect when it comes to assertiveness in interpersonal relationships, where you&#39;re able to hit a sweet spot between being too assertive and not enough. When done properly, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/why-we-should-be-disagreeing-more-at-work&quot;>;healthy dissent&lt;/a>; can lead to deeper trust and mutual respect. Based on my work as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.partnerexec.com/&quot;>;executive coach&lt;/a>; for senior leaders at global companies, here are four strategies you can deploy in your relationships to distribute power more evenly.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Choose to decline certain requests. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It may feel incredibly challenging to decline a more powerful colleague&#39;s request. But in any interaction, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)&quot;>;framing effect&lt;/a>; takes place where each party is sizing up who has more power and influence. Since power is comprised of many factors and is situational, even if you find yourself typically powerless relative to a colleague, there do emerge situations where they need something from you just as much as you need them. Even if you&#39;ve always acceded in the past, in occasional moments, it&#39;s important to capitalize on the opportunity to politely refuse the more powerful person&#39;s demands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201602/4-truths-about-power-in-relationships-including-yours&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; on relationships defined power as not only having a greater ability to influence the other, but also having the stronger &lt;em>;resistance to the other&#39;s influence&lt;/em>;. So, the next time you sense your colleague is overly exerting their power over you (for instance, making another last-minute request even though they have been inaccessible for yours), it may be a good idea to not immediately drop what you&#39;re doing and jump to the rescue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once coached a leader whose peer often dumped work on her but managed to stay above the fray when others needed her help. This colleague would frequently cite her interactions with their shared boss as a way of justifying her power and drop their name while making requests that purely served her.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are in a similar position as my client, respond to your colleague by saying something like, “I wanted to let you know I got your request. I&#39;m happy to help but have other commitments I must address at the moment. In the meantime, feel free to send me more information in case I can suggest another solution.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ideally, you want to send a message that you expect them to invest their limited time as well into the relationship. If you are true to the minimum promises you&#39;ve made, then you can confidently hold your ground as an equal partner. This not only encourages them to respect you but forces them to make sacrifices as needed for the relationship as much as you do.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Connect them to other people in power who value you.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Another way to shift the power in the relationship is by subtly reminding them of your social value by connecting them to other people they respect, with whom you&#39;ve cultivated a relationship. This does three valuable things: first, it shows them (through the principle of social proof) that you must have something to offer if people they admire see value in you; second, it may tip the scales in your relationship dynamic because you possess access they&#39;d like to enjoy; and third, it sends a signal that you already have high-profile access, so are not desperate to chase their approval.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I worked with a leader who struggled to be seen as a “strategic” executive and was continuously downplayed for higher level roles by HR when succession planning discussions took place. But in truth, he was quite innovative and eager to contribute to more forward-looking aspects of the business; it was because he was so good at operational execution that HR and his boss didn&#39;t want to rock the boat through a promotion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To disrupt this power dynamic, which was limiting his advancement, my client started to develop relationships with other senior leaders and socialized ideas that could help their business needs. And then he started making introductions between his new contacts and some of the colleagues in HR and his business who held influence over his career. By showing his access to other powerful leaders and sharing it as well through connecting others, his brand began to rise toward the perception of an enterprise-level leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Help them surface their blind spots as a way of supporting them.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Even the most powerful people can&#39;t see themselves exactly the way other people perceive them. In other words, they have blind spots just like the rest of us. And when you can help them gently recognize an aspect of their thinking or behavior that is getting in the way of their goals, they can begin to view you as a highly trusted partner, rather than someone below their level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of my clients was an SVP at a technology company who was privy to the chatter across the organization about the CEO&#39;s lack of decisiveness and how it was creating confusion for employees and teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While she agreed with the general sentiment, she was happy with how the CEO treated her. While he had more power than her, she generally accepted the idea of working under his leadership and meeting his expectations as best as she could. After all, she thought, why risk her relationship with the CEO and give him tough feedback that could backfire on her for being the messenger?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she also recognized that to become a trusted partner to him, she would need to truly be in his corner, through good and bad, and that required being honest with him for his benefit. So, she decided in her next one-on-one to share her observations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The SVP said, “I know how important it is to you to do the right thing for the business and our people. And sometimes our strengths can be over-leveraged to the point of becoming a weakness. I think because you care so much about listening to all sides of an issue, it&#39;s starting to delay making decisions. And I wanted to offer this possibility because you may be too close to this style to see how it&#39;s impacting others.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In taking the risk of putting a mirror up to the CEO, the SVP earned a high measure of respect and gratitude from him. Their relationship became one of trusted advisor and not just direct report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you meet with people in power and simply tell them everything they&#39;ve heard before or the same things as others in your position, you will be forgotten and relegated to the status quo. But by stepping out of your comfort zone to — kindly, but assertively — point out something that the powerful person had not noticed, you not only become memorable but start to gain influence and respect with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make them work to earn your attention.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Gaining the respect of colleagues more powerful than you is an interesting paradox: by putting them in a position to work for your approval, you earn more of their respect. So, a fourth strategy is to create conditions where they must “sell” their value to you. Basically, work less at earning their respect and put the burden on them to explain why they should be worth your attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the years, I&#39;ve coached leaders at companies that had undergone a merger or reorganization that required many employees and leaders to “reapply” for a job, either within their division or in a new part of the company. This experience can be unsettling, not just because they are back to being a candidate competing against others for a job, but because unlike applying to a new company from the outside, their reputations precede them and provide more subjective input that will influence interviewers when evaluating them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The natural mistake many people make in these situations is to overprepare for the questions they think they will be asked and try their best to hedge their answers to please the hiring colleague. This seems like the path of least resistance but in fact positions them as forgettable and unremarkable in the eyes of the other party.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, find ways to be generous with your answers but unafraid to also ask questions that put them a bit on their heels. When your colleague asks you that oft-repeated question, “Why should we hire you for this job?” your first instinct may be to prove your value to their satisfaction, even though you and they know that most everyone is applying for jobs because of the reorganization, not because they wanted to try something new.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, take a beat and say something like, “Actually, I&#39;m not sure you should hire me just yet. I&#39;d like to explore if there&#39;s a mutual fit between my experience and your vision of where this team is going. Anything you could share about your management style would be helpful as I&#39;m exploring my next steps.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Expecting people in power to “earn” your interest rather than take it for granted can bring positive results. Not only can it set you apart from the competition, but it can ensure you are working with colleagues who respect you rather than keep you under their power and whims.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you are stuck in an unequal power dynamic, it helps to remember that not only is the placement of power temporary, but you can equalize it. By adopting these strategies, you can creatively pivot in the moment and frame the connection differently, so that you are building the respect you deserve.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 03 Jul 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Explain a Gap in Your Resume]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-explain-a-gap-in-your-resume]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_30_1105032.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Audshule/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Since the pandemic, most employers have been more understanding and less discriminating regarding resume gaps &amp;#8212; but you have to be ready to explain the gaps clearly, confidently, and without stumbling. Owning your career trajectory means connecting all the dots for the recruiter and hiring manager. Shaping the narrative around any gaps yourself will help make them a non-issue. The author discusses five common reasons for work-history gaps &amp;#8212; and how to own the gap during the interview process.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-explain-a-gap-in-your-resume?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-explain-a-gap-in-your-resume?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;At least once in every interview process you&#39;ll be asked some version of, “Can you walk me through your resume?” In addition to your skills and experience, you need to be able to explain your transitions between jobs, including gaps. This is critical: When you ignore gaps between jobs when discussing your resume, you lose the opportunity to control the narrative about your job transitions or time away from the commercial workforce.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on my research of employment gaps for my book, &lt;em>;Wanted → A New Career: The Definitive Playbook for Transitioning to a New Career or Finding Your Dream Job&lt;/em>;, here are five common reasons for work-history gaps — and how to own the gap during the interview process:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Stay-at-home parenting&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you took time off from the commercial workforce &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/helping-stay-at-home-parents-reenter-the-workforce&quot;>;to raise children&lt;/a>;, explain how you used that time to gain skills, knowledge, or experience that&#39;s relevant to the job. For example, did you volunteer at your kids&#39; school? Organize events or fundraising efforts? Were you the parent who arranged travel for sports team activities? All of those things can be translated to the job you&#39;re applying for. For example, say you&#39;re looking to continue your career in global fundraising. You could tell the interviewer, “I took time off to care for our children but I was able to keep my skills fresh while volunteering for the kids&#39; sports league, developing fundraising goals and helping the team successfully achieve fundraising quotas to provide financial assistance for those who needed it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Bereavement or caring for a sick family member&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you took time away to care for a parent or family member, own the choice you made to spend that important time with them. Take a look at that experience through the lens of the job. For example, if you&#39;re trying to move back into a customer service role, you could focus on your role as a liaison with your family member&#39;s health care providers:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I took time off to care for my father. During that time I was able to leverage my effective communication skills with multiple health care providers, as well as my organization skills in coordinating meetings with his financial planner, brokers, and legal representation, which gave him peace of mind. I would like to use those same problem-solving skills plus my ability to remain calm under pressure in this job.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re applying for a finance job, you could focus on your role as executor:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I took time off to spend with my mother before she passed away. I was named executor because I am highly responsible, organized, and have financial acumen. I was able to leverage my finance skills in reconciling her estate as well as soft skills, such as using effective communication with multiple creditors, including utilities, credit card companies, medical facilities, and banking institutions. My skills enabled me to quickly and efficiently close out the estate, and now I&#39;m looking to bring my skills to a new challenge.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h2>;Traveling the world&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When moving back into a corporate work setting after taking time off to explore, focus on how you used that time to gain new perspectives. For example, if you&#39;re interviewing with a multinational company, you could discuss the nuances of interacting with people from different cultures and how experiencing life in other countries gave you a perspective many people don&#39;t have in the workplace. If you&#39;re pursuing an operational role, you could focus on your efficiency in travel planning, budgeting as it relates to a P&amp;amp;L, and how you used critical thinking to determine where to travel to next. If you spent time learning a second, third, or fourth language, explain how your ability to be conversational or fluent will make you a higher-performing candidate than those who aren&#39;t multilingual.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Going back to school&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Perhaps you went back to school to obtain an MBA or doctorate. If you went to school full time, explain how specific projects you worked on are directly relevant to the job and how they, along with any past work experience, will allow you to bring unique value to the position. Perhaps you achieved an MBA and want to work in business operations. Did you work on projects for real companies? Include them on your resume to so you can discuss them during an interview.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you developed your skills &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/5-ways-to-acquire-new-skills-without-going-back-to-school&quot;>;without going back to school&lt;/a>; for a traditional degree — for example, by taking a course or getting a certification — describe how those skills apply to the prospective job and set you apart from other candidates. If you read specific books to gain a new perspective on your field or enhance your leadership capabilities, talk about how you would apply the principles you learned at work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Terminated employment&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you were &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/what-to-do-after-being-laid-off&quot;>;impacted by a mass layoff&lt;/a>; that wasn&#39;t performance related, explain to the interviewer that the business strategy changed and your department or team were let go in the latest wave of layoffs. You can even position the unfortunate situation positively: “But it has been a blessing because I was considering looking for a new challenge.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you were terminated for performance, clearly your employer didn&#39;t think you were successful in your job, but perhaps you have a different perspective or didn&#39;t feel the role was what you expected. In this case, you can explain that the job was different than you believed it to be and didn&#39;t leverage your skills and capabilities in the most effective way. Always explain what you learned from the experience and how you&#39;re actively working to make sure your next move is closer to your expectations. For example:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I knew soon after I started that the job wasn&#39;t as described, but since I committed to the company, I wanted to give it my best effort. In the end, my skills of A, B, and C weren&#39;t being utilized effectively to bring value to the business. So we amicably separated, which is allowing me to take the time to find the right job where I can bring the most value based on business need.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;If you were in a toxic environment or decided to quit for any other reason, don&#39;t bring that negativity into job interviews. Find a positive perspective on why you departed — for example, “I needed focused time to find a job that&#39;s more in line with my values, and I couldn&#39;t find the time to do it while working 60 hours a week.” Most importantly, don&#39;t ever badmouth anyone, because that behavior makes you look like someone who blames others without taking accountability — and who could do the same at the new company. This is the time to take the high road.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Since the pandemic, most employers have been more understanding and less discriminating regarding resume gaps — but you have to be ready to explain the gaps clearly, confidently, and without stumbling.

Known and emerging concerns associated with AI in the workplace include the spread of misinformation, copyright and intellectual property concerns, cybersecurity, data privacy, as well as navigating rapid and ambiguous regulations. To mitigate these risks, we propose thirteen principles for responsible AI at work.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/13-principles-for-using-ai-responsibly?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/13-principles-for-using-ai-responsibly?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Love it or loath it, the rapid expansion of AI will not slow down anytime soon. But AI blunders &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2022/01/the-reputational-risks-of-ai/&quot;>;can quickly damage a brand&#39;s reputation&lt;/a>; — just ask Microsoft&#39;s first chatbot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;>;Tay&lt;/a>;. In the tech race, all leaders fear being left behind if they slow down while others don&#39;t. It&#39;s a high-stakes situation where cooperation seems risky, and defection tempting. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/the-prisoners-dilemma/&quot;>;“prisoner&#39;s dilemma”&lt;/a>; (as it&#39;s called in game theory) poses risks to responsible AI practices. Leaders, prioritizing speed to market, are driving the current AI arms race in which major corporate players are rushing products and potentially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/tech-companies-cut-ai-ethics/&quot;>;short-changing critical considerations&lt;/a>; like ethical guidelines, bias detection, and safety measures. For instance, major tech corporations are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/tech-companies-cut-ai-ethics/&quot;>;laying off their AI ethics teams&lt;/a>; precisely at a time when responsible actions are needed most.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also important to recognize that the AI arms race extends beyond the developers of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. It encompasses many companies utilizing LLMs to support their own custom applications. In the world of professional services, for example, PwC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/pwcs-4000-legal-staffers-get-ai-assistant-law-chatbots-gain-steam-2023-03-15/&quot;>;announced&lt;/a>; it is deploying AI chatbots for 4,000 of their lawyers, distributed across 100 countries. These AI-powered assistants will “help lawyers with contract analysis, regulatory compliance work, due diligence, and other legal advisory and consulting services.” PwC&#39;s management is also considering expanding these AI chatbots into their tax practice. In total, the consulting giant plans to pour $1 billion into “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/x/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai&quot;>;generative AI&lt;/a>;” — a powerful new tool capable of delivering game-changing boosts to performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a similar vein, KPMG launched its own AI-powered assistant, dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/custom-chatgpt-tool-to-help-kpmg-s-consultants-win-new-work-20230321-p5cu3m&quot;>;KymChat&lt;/a>;, which will help employees rapidly find internal experts across the entire organization, wrap them around incoming opportunities, and automatically generate proposals based on the match between project requirements and available talent. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/media/press-releases/2023/03/kpmg-unveils-cutting-edge-private-chatgpt-software-march-2023.html&quot;>;AI assistant&lt;/a>; “will better enable cross-team collaboration and help those new to the firm with a more seamless and efficient people-navigation experience.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slack is also incorporating generative AI into the development of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-gpt&quot;>;Slack GPT&lt;/a>;, an AI assistant designed to help employees work smarter not harder. The platform incorporates a range of AI capabilities, such as conversation summaries and writing assistance, to enhance user productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Soon hundreds of millions of Microsoft 365 users will have access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/&quot;>;Business Chat&lt;/a>;, an agent that joins the user in their work, striving to make sense of their Microsoft 365 data. Employees can prompt the assistant to do everything from developing status report summaries based on meeting transcripts and email communication to identifying flaws in strategy and coming up with solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This rapid deployment of AI agents is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/04/20/ibm-ceo-work-ai-artificial-intelligence-careers-tech-arvind-krishna/&quot;>;Arvind Krishna&lt;/a>;, CEO of IBM, recently wrote that, “[p]eople working together with trusted AI will have a transformative effect on our economy and society … It&#39;s time we embrace that partnership — and prepare our workforces for everything AI has to offer.” Simply put, organizations are experiencing exponential growth in the installation of AI-powered tools and firms that don&#39;t adapt risk getting left behind.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;AI Risks at Work&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, remaining competitive also introduces significant risk for both employees and employers. For example, a 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380861&quot;>;UNESCO publication&lt;/a>; on “the effects of AI on the working lives of women” reports that AI in the recruitment process, for example, is excluding women from upward moves. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6491&quot;>;One study the report cites&lt;/a>; that included 21 experiments consisting of over 60,000 targeted job advertisements found that “setting the user&#39;s gender to &#39;Female&#39; resulted in fewer instances of ads related to high-paying jobs than for users selecting &#39;Male&#39; as their gender.” And even though this AI bias in recruitment and hiring is well-known, it&#39;s not going away anytime soon. As the UNESCO report goes on to say, “A &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3450077&quot;>;2021 study&lt;/a>; showed evidence of job advertisements skewed by gender on Facebook even when the advertisers wanted a gender-balanced audience.” It&#39;s often a matter of biased data which will continue to infect AI tools and threaten key workforce factors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raconteur.net/responsible-business/ais-threat-to-diversity-equity-inclusivity/&quot;>;diversity, equity, and inclusion&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Discriminatory employment practices may be only one of a cocktail of legal risks that generative AI exposes organizations to. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/openai-hit-with-first-defamation-suit-over-chatgpt-hallucination&quot;>;OpenAI is facing its first defamation lawsuit&lt;/a>; as a result of allegations that ChatGPT produced harmful misinformation. Specifically, the system produced a summary of a real court case which included fabricated accusations of embezzlement against a radio host in Georgia. This highlights the negative impact on organizations for creating and sharing AI generated information. It underscores concerns about LLMs fabricating false and libelous content, resulting in reputational damage, loss of credibility, diminished customer trust, and serious legal repercussions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to concerns related to libel, there are risks associated with &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem&quot;>;copyright and intellectual property infringements&lt;/a>;. Several &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/&quot;>;high-profile legal cases&lt;/a>; have emerged where the developers of generative AI tools have been sued for the alleged improper use of licensed content. The presence of copyright and intellectual property infringements, coupled with the legal implications of such violations, poses significant risks for organizations utilizing generative AI products. Organizations can improperly use licensed content through generative AI by unknowingly engaging in activities such as plagiarism, unauthorized adaptations, commercial use without licensing, and misusing Creative Commons or open-source content, exposing themselves to potential legal consequences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The large-scale deployment of AI also &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2023/06/06/new-report-warns-cybersecurity-risks-generative-ai-technology/&quot;>;magnifies the risks of cyberattacks&lt;/a>;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Generative-AI-the-next-biggest-cyber-security-threat&quot;>;fear amongst cybersecurity experts&lt;/a>; is that generative AI could be used to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_e69b334f-36d8-44b0-9f52-93ea6089aa5a&quot;>;identify and exploit vulnerabilities&lt;/a>; within business information systems, given the ability of LLMs to automate coding and bug detection, which could be used by malicious actors to break through security barriers. There&#39;s also the fear of employees accidentally sharing sensitive data with third-party AI providers. A notable instance involves Samsung staff unintentionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-generative-ai-tools-like-chatgpt-after-april-internal-data-leak/&quot;>;leaking trade secrets&lt;/a>; through ChatGPT while using the LLM to review source code. Due to their failure to opt out of data sharing, confidential information was inadvertently provided to OpenAI. And even though Samsung and others are taking steps to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/19/apple-joins-a-growing-list-of-companies-cracking-down-on-use-of-chatgpt-by-staffers-heres-why/&quot;>;restrict the use of third-party AI tools&lt;/a>; on company-owned devices, there&#39;s still the concern that employees can leak information through the use of such systems on personal devices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On top of these risks, businesses will soon have to navigate nascent, varied, and somewhat murky regulations. Anyone hiring in New York City, for instance, will have to ensure their AI-powered recruitment and hiring tech doesn&#39;t violate the City&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-york-city-s-automated-employment-6844706/&quot;>;automated employment decision tool&lt;/a>;” law. To comply with the new law, employers will need to take various steps such as conducting third-party bias audits of their hiring tools and publicly disclosing the findings. AI regulation is also scaling up nationally with the Biden-Harris administration&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/&quot;>;Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights&lt;/a>;” and internationally with the EU&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/&quot;>;AI Act&lt;/a>;, which will mark a new era of regulation for employers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This growing nebulous of evolving regulations and pitfalls is why thought leaders such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/your-7-biggest-chatgpt-questions-answered&quot;>;Gartner&lt;/a>; are strongly suggesting that businesses “proceed but don&#39;t over pivot” and that they “create a task force reporting to the CIO and CEO” to plan a roadmap for a safe AI transformation that mitigates various legal, reputational, and workforce risks. Leaders dealing with this AI dilemma have important decision to make. On the one hand, there is a pressing competitive pressure to fully embrace AI. However, on the other hand, a growing concern is arising as the implementation of irresponsible AI can result in severe penalties, substantial damage to reputation, and significant operational setbacks. The concern is that in their quest to stay ahead, leaders may unknowingly introduce potential time bombs into their organization, which are poised to cause major problems once AI solutions are deployed and regulations take effect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/08/1180838096/an-eating-disorders-chatbot-offered-dieting-advice-raising-fears-about-ai-in-hea&quot;>;National Eating Disorder Association&lt;/a>; (NEDA) recently announced it was letting go of its hotline staff and replacing them with their new chatbot, Tessa. However, just days before making the transition, NEDA discovered that their system was promoting harmful advice such as encouraging people with eating disorders to restrict their calories and to lose one to two pounds per week. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/13/1074551/an-algorithm-intended-to-reduce-poverty-in-jordan-disqualifies-people-in-need/&quot;>;World Bank&lt;/a>; spent $1 billion to develop and deploy an algorithmic system, called Takaful, to distribute financial assistance that Human Rights Watch now says ironically creates inequity. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-courts-e15023d7e6fdf4f099aa122437dbb59b&quot;>;two lawyers from New York&lt;/a>; are facing possible disciplinary action after using ChatGPT to draft a court filing that was found to have several references to previous cases that did not exist. These instances highlight the need for well-trained and well-supported employees at the center of this digital transformation. While AI can serve as a valuable assistant, it should not assume the leading position.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Principles for Responsible AI at Work&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To help decision-makers avoid negative outcomes while also remaining competitive in the age of AI, we&#39;ve devised several principles for a sustainable AI-powered workforce. The principles are a blend of ethical frameworks from institutions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/od/recr.jsp&quot;>;National Science Foundation&lt;/a>; as well as legal requirements related to employee monitoring and data privacy such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1285&quot;>;Electronic Communications Privacy Act&lt;/a>; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecpra.org/&quot;>;California Privacy Rights Act&lt;/a>;. The steps for ensuring responsible AI at work include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Informed Consent. &lt;/strong>;Obtain voluntary and informed agreement from employees to participate in any AI-powered intervention &lt;em>;after&lt;/em>; the employees are provided with all the relevant information about the initiative. This includes the program&#39;s purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Aligned Interests. &lt;/strong>;The goals, risks, and benefits for both the employer and employee are clearly articulated and aligned.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Opt In &amp;amp; Easy Exits. &lt;/strong>;Employees must opt into AI-powered programs without feeling forced or coerced, and they can easily withdraw from the program at any time without any negative consequences and without explanation.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Conversational Transparency. &lt;/strong>;When AI-based conversational agents are used, the agent should formally reveal any persuasive objectives the system aims to achieve through the dialogue with the employee.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Debiased and Explainable AI. &lt;/strong>;Explicitly outline the steps taken to remove, minimize, and mitigate bias in AI-powered employee interventions—especially for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups—and provide transparent explanations into how AI systems arrive at their decisions and actions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;AI Training and Development. &lt;/strong>;Provide continuous employee training and development to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI-powered tools.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Health and Well-Being. &lt;/strong>;Identify types of AI-induced stress, discomfort, or harm and articulate steps to minimize risks (eg, how will the employer minimize stress caused by constant AI-powered monitoring of employee behavior).&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Data Collection. &lt;/strong>;Identify what data will be collected, if data collection involves any invasive or intrusive procedures (eg, the use of webcams in work-from-home situations), and what steps will be taken to minimize risk.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Data. &lt;/strong>;Disclose any intention to share personal data, with whom, and why.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Privacy and Security. &lt;/strong>;Articulate protocols for maintaining privacy, storing employee data securely, and what steps will be taken in the event of a privacy breach.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Third Party Disclosure. &lt;/strong>;Disclose all third parties used to provide and maintain AI assets, what the third party&#39;s role is, and how the third party will ensure employee privacy.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Communication.&lt;/strong>; Inform employees about changes in data collection, data management, or data sharing as well as any changes in AI assets or third-party relationships.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Laws and Regulations. &lt;/strong>;Express ongoing commitment to comply with all laws and regulations related to employee data and the use of AI.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;We encourage leaders to urgently adopt and develop this checklist in their organizations. By applying such principles, leaders can ensure rapid &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; responsible AI deployment.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 30 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Make Leadership Positions More Enticing to Primary Care Physicians]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-make-leadership-positions-more-enticing-to-primary-care-physicians]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_29_1293518427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/The Good Brigade/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Primary care in the US is being pushed to the brink of collapse due to historic highs of physician stress, burnout, and exhaustion; mass departures from the profession; and the inability to care for vulnerable populations due to an inequitable health system. These problems are compounded due to a lack of effective advocacy to improve primary care on a national scale and a reimbursement system that chips away at time with patients while keeping primary care physicians (PCPs) on a volume-based hamster wheel.

The end result is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-is-it-so-challenging-to-find-a-primary-care-physician-202209282822&quot;>;shortage of doctors who want to practice primary care&lt;/a>; under these challenging circumstances, which can lead to potentially devastating consequences for the future of healthcare in America.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If primary care is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/opinion/pandemic-recovery-primary-care.html&quot;>;touted as the foundation of a well-functioning health care system&lt;/a>; — the front line of clinical care and the initial point of contact for most patients — how can it be allowed to deteriorate without unified and passionate intervention? Our research suggests that the answer may be straightforward. While primary care accounts for roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/workforce/data/active-physicians-largest-specialties-major-professional-activity-2021&quot;>;one in three&lt;/a>; practicing physicians and is seen as the bedrock of the health care system, it is also the most overlooked and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jabfm.org/content/primary-care-physician-leadership-top-ranked-us-hospitals&quot;>;underrepresented in the realms of health care leadership&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Transformational changes to primary care will require leadership with holistic training, a clear vision, an insider&#39;s perspective, and skin in the game. PCPs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/early/2022/05/19/leader-2022-000591.abstract&quot;>;uniquely positioned to lead&lt;/a>; this change. They are the Swiss Army Knives of medicine, offering an increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfp.ca/content/68/11/801&quot;>;rare generalist perspective, requiring strong communication skills, and a community-focused&lt;/a>; approach to care delivery. Not only are they responsible for managing day-to-day concerns for their patients, they also coordinate care across specialties and organizations for those who may have medically complex diagnoses. These clinicians are accustomed to leading teams every day to care for their patients, and must be adaptable, thoughtful, and flexible, given their vast breadth of clinical responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is paradoxical that those best poised to lead are often reluctant to do so. In fact, many physicians are not only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2014/sep/01/nhs-leadership-doctors-reluctant-manage-lead&quot;>;reluctant&lt;/a>; but &lt;em>;averse&lt;/em>; to taking on leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We interviewed PCPs in leadership roles to better understand what they believe prevents so many other physicians from pursuing such positions. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/jhmonline/Abstract/2022/08000/Engaging_Physicians_in_Leadership__Motivations,.6.aspx&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; highlights three key deterrents:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;PCPs viewed leadership roles as a path to losing autonomy and limiting their ability to develop long-term therapeutic relationships with patients — a key reason many physicians chose careers in medicine in the first place.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;PCPs associated leadership roles with major resource constraints, evaporating both time and earnings potential.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;PCPs lamented the loss of camaraderie with other physicians when taking on leadership roles, feeling that the roles interrupted collaboration with peers and generated uncomfortable conflict.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Despite these concerns, PCPs are fundamentally poised to make an impact on the organizations they lead. Health care organizations who understand and work to address these deterrents will have a distinct competitive advantage. They will be able to better engage and recruit PCPs in leadership and thereby reap the benefits of better &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1097/HMR.0000000000000173&quot;>;quality of care, higher patient satisfaction, and decreased provider burnout&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are three ways that health organizations can counteract these disincentives and support PCPs embracing leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Provide the On-Ramp&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs crave system change and personal growth, but often feel disempowered. They see their experience as valuable and want to leverage it to make a positive impact on the health care system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives and health administrators can tap into this motivation by framing leadership as a constructive opportunity to be a change agent. While organizations may not have the ability to alter a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/creative-job-titles-can-energize-workers&quot;>;position&#39;s specific title&lt;/a>;, the job description can be used to reflect openness to an entrepreneurial mindset and an opportunity for improving perceived system deficits. Instead of drafting a typical (and often dry) administrative job description, frame it to emphasize how the role will enact change or address major obstacles in health care. Postings should speak to a PCP&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicfootprints.org/7-top-tips-on-recruiting-doctors-to-non-clinical-or-leadership-roles/&quot;>;adaptability based on the breadth of their training and diversity of practice experience&lt;/a>;, and PCPs should be encouraged to apply.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using the frustration PCPs experience with the status quo and their frontline experience, health care organizations can promote vacant or novel leadership roles as opportunities to expand the impact on patients and to garner a broader scope of knowledge and expertise for PCPs identified as having leadership interest or potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Role Design and Definition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs want to grow and develop professionally, but our study showed that they also identified clear disadvantages in taking on leadership roles. They identified the least attractive aspect of leading, in a word, as “loss.” They feared the loss of autonomy, time, close patient relationships, and camaraderie with peers. This can be due, in part, to their exposure to disappointing experiences observed in peers who have assumed leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives and health administrators can help mitigate this with the use of strategic &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/why-managers-design-jobs-to-be-more-boring-than-they-need-to-be&quot;>;job design&lt;/a>;, where organizations create an optimal job role, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2001.4378011&quot;>;job crafting&lt;/a>;, which allows PCPs to define and customize their role themselves. These two complementary pieces of the puzzle yield large gains in employee satisfaction and fulfillment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When organizations realize that fear of loss is a major barrier, they are better positioned to design purposeful and motivating work for PCPs taking on leadership roles. To address the concern for loss of autonomy, the role should be intentionally constructed to allow PCPs the agency to make decisions per their expertise. For those apprehensive about losing time, the role can be devised to encourage a flexible approach in how goals are achieved, including the freedom to decide how they will balance their clinical responsibilities with their new leadership role. In order to address concerns about losing relationships, organizations must provide opportunities for leaders to meet with their colleagues in informal settings and encourage leaders to continue to be actively engaged as a member of their clinical team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empowering PCPs to engage in job crafting allows them to adjust aspects of the job to suit individual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-job-crafting-how-to-do-it-work-satisfaction-2022-6&quot;>;interests, values, and passions&lt;/a>;, making them more likely to be&lt;a href=&quot;https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Job-Crafting-and-Why-Does-it-Matter1.pdf&quot;>; engaged and more likely to thrive&lt;/a>; at work, while being successful in their leadership role. PCPs can independently alter the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/03/what-job-crafting-looks-like&quot;>;type and scope of tasks; relationships and with whom they work; and how to think&lt;/a>;, communicate about, or conceive of the job. When PCPs have some degree of ownership and authority over how the job is defined, they will have the opportunity to include more of their passion points, while also thoughtfully reducing those aspects of the job that are seen as pain points.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Tools, Training, and Mentorship&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs may want system change and growth, but they also need the tools, training, and mentorship to be successful. In most cases, PCPs &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/most-doctors-have-little-or-no-management-training-and-thats-a-problem&quot;>;aren&#39;t taught finance, accounting, management, or leadership skills&lt;/a>; in medical school, nor is there an emphasis on systems operations, despite the fact that, as physicians enter residency, they immediately begin leading medical teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are stark contrasts, both operationally and culturally, between &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/04/turning-doctors-into-leaders&quot;>;business and medicine&lt;/a>;. Executives and health administrators should provide opportunities for PCPs to cross-train with current administrators and to have access to mentors who can help with the transition. Providing resources to support the transition into leadership can help highly qualified and motivated PCPs avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpearl/2016/02/04/five-reasons-why-even-the-best-of-physicians-may-fail-as-leaders/?sh=1c79323bce22&quot;>;common pitfalls than can derail&lt;/a>; their ability to influence others and be successful in their expanded role. This may include offering or supporting continuing medical education (CME) or credentialing opportunities that feature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mgma.com/practice-resources/human-resources/the-importance-of-physician-leadership-education&quot;>;management and leadership skills building&lt;/a>;, partnering with institutions of higher education to create pathways into &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.nejmcareercenter.org/article/eyeing-physician-career-boost-via-formal-business-education/&quot;>;graduate business or policy programs&lt;/a>;, or engaging with organizations that specialize in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physicianleaders.org/about&quot;>;physician leadership training&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having PCPs in leadership roles has never been more important. Without a highly functioning and sustainable primary care system, all health care in the US will suffer. If we want a system that promotes effective and sustainable primary care, PCPs need to be involved in co-designing that system and leading change. Ultimately, this will benefit the entire health care system, and all of us who will, at any stage of our lives, depend on it for our own care and that of our families and communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Nail Your Presentation to the Board]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/June23_29_1296672467-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;sturti/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The boardroom is a distinct forum that requires a different type of presentation and preparation. In this article, the author outlines three practices every business leader should embrace to enhance their board presentations: 1) Start with a governing thesis: a big idea or perspective that captures the main point of the discussion. Presentations that start this way leave the audience with a compelling message. 2) Understand that the CEO is not the target audience. A board presentation has to provide some quick refreshers on the operating environment and &amp;#8212; more importantly &amp;#8212; identify the biggest problems that need fixing. 3) Steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback. Instead of concluding remarks that restate key business results, share two or three important ideas that will drive future success and concerns that could benefit from director input. The goal: Get the board&amp;#8217;s validation or critiques of a proposed course of action. The result, invariably, is a mix of candid feedback and intelligent, probing questions that create thoughtful board engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For most executives, even those at the most senior level, a presentation to the board of directors is the most demanding test of leadership communications. Very few succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conversations with more than 100 public and private boards directors over the last decade reveal that dissatisfaction with presentations is nearly universal. PowerPoint decks are too long, too granular, or simply uninformative, they report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet the feedback most senior executives receive — “Make it crisper,” “Fewer slides,” “Don&#39;t get caught up in operational details,” or even “More details, fewer headlines” — is often generic and unhelpful. Operators are told they are insufficiently strategic; strategic leaders are criticized for having insufficient operational depth. Both directors and presenter leave frustrated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the advice offered by professional speaking coaches is just as likely to lead senior executives astray. “Enhance vocal delivery,” “Use fewer bullet points,” “Tell a story,” or similar well-worn coaching points are rooted in the belief that a board presentation is simply a matter of stagecraft — a variation of a keynote presentation to a customer audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This counsel reveals a misunderstanding about the purpose and value of board meetings. The boardroom is a distinct forum that requires a different type of presentation and preparation. It demands elevated exchanges that leverage both the knowledge of senior leaders and the objectivity of seasoned directors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having coached executives preparing board-level presentations for more than 15 years — including senior leaders auditioning to become the next CEO — I have concluded that the executive&#39;s most important task is to share their thinking about the business they lead. The goal is not just to report the results of the last quarter. (Directors can read that on their own.) Instead, the senior leader should engage the board by discussing the most pressing challenges they face and how they intend to respond.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While each board has unique needs shaped by the company&#39;s operating environment, below I suggest three practices every business leader should embrace to enhance their board presentations — and their own value within the upper levels of the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Bring a compelling message.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The senior executive who arrives in the board room has typically submitted a set of slides well in advance that has been carefully vetted by the CEO and the legal team. In most cases, directors will have already studied the material, or at least flipped through the main points. What, then, is the purpose of the 10 to 30-minute slot that has been allotted to the nervous presenter?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rushing through a slide review might be useful as a quick refresher, but it neither deepens the board&#39;s understanding of the topic nor showcases the leadership skills of the executive. Instead, every presentation should start with a governing thesis: a big idea or perspective that captures the main point of the discussion. Presentations that start this way leave the audience with a compelling message.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anne Mulcahy, who has served on multiple boards, including J&amp;amp;J, Target, LPL Financial, and Williams-Sonoma, has felt frustrated by the executives who want to convey too much data and information with a series of dense slides. “It almost seems like the objective is to demonstrate how much they know about their business, she says. “It has the opposite outcome. Directors don&#39;t know what the point of the presentation is supposed to be.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By contrast, a “thesis mindset” forces the presenter to confront the future rather than just reciting the facts of the past. The thesis-driven board presentation doesn&#39;t need to be an audacious proposal or a request for more funding. But it ought to frame an issue that requires board attention. At a minimum, the governing thesis tells directors: This is where I see my part of the company going. That idea can&#39;t be slipped into slide 19. It has to be stated unambiguously and boldly at the outset. At the very least, it provides insurance against off-topic interruptions or mid-presentation dozing.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Understand that the CEO is not the target audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;By the time they are asked to present to the board, a member of a senior leadership team has had plenty of practice leading discussions with the CEO. They may even be very comfortable updating their boss, in an informal way, with little preparation. Unfortunately, bringing the same mindset and habits to the boardroom is a crucial mistake.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I am always struck by how often business unit leaders come to the boardroom and direct their talk to their boss, rather than the directors assembled around the table,” said Scott Miller, who has been serving on public and private company boards for more than two decades. Miller&#39;s point is not merely a criticism of presentation style, but a recognition that senior officers rarely consider the needs of directors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The board of directors is a unique audience with no comparison to the groups most executives regularly engage. They are not customers who need to be sold. And they are not true business colleagues, where strategy alignment and deep familiarity with the operational details of the business can be assumed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A public company board may be compromised of business leaders, academics, former CEOs, current financial officers, and executives who bring expertise from entirely different industries. As a rule, their range of knowledge about the company and any given topic will vary greatly. Some have been serving on the board for well over a decade; others may be attending their third or fourth meeting. There is also an unspoken (and sometimes unknowable) hierarchy on the board, with its own unstated group of alliances and range of authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ron Sugar, the lead director of Uber who also serves on the boards of Apple, Chevron, and Amgen, advises that the job of the presenter “is to fly at the right altitude” in the boardroom: “Dumb it down too much, and you risk insulting the directors. On the other hand, no board wants to be a working group. They want to understand what issues need to be on their radar screen.” He suggests planning to use half the allotted time so that the main point is reached quickly and discussion can follow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugar&#39;s advice is sound. A board presentation has to provide some quick refreshers on the operating environment and — more importantly — identify the biggest problems that need fixing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These problems will be familiar to the CEO (who should never be taken by surprise in the boardroom). The directors, however, need both a reminder of the core issues in an executive&#39;s portfolio (talent, operations, regulation, or a particular geography) along with looming challenges. Too many executives miss the opportunity to frame problems in the right way — and make their presentations far less engaging than they should be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of presenting challenges is not to frighten the board but to enlighten them and engage them in the operational and strategic questions that preoccupy the person presenting the material.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_us/board-matters/how-to-increase-the-boards-impact-and-value&quot;>;2022 study&lt;/a>;, EY&#39;s Center for Board Matters found that public company directors felt confident they added value to discussions of capital allocation and succession. But very few felt the top value they delivered came in areas such as revenue growth, innovation, or disruption. Ironically, these latter topics are most frequently what executives are asked to address when they invited into the boardroom.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Effective leaders can help rebalance the value that directors ought to derive from a board meeting by setting up genuine discussions that invite reaction and input. Alas, too many board presentations come to an abrupt conclusion followed by a quick call for “any questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following a presentation, many business unit leaders complain they find themselves falling down a rabbit hole of technical details triggered by an unexpected and mostly irrelevant question from a persistent director. In most instances, the blame is entirely on the presenter. They are ones who failed to set up the right conversation and missed the opportunity to steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback from the board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Randy Foutch, the former CEO of Laredo Petroleum, who has sat on many small and large company boards, believes that many executives “miss the opportunity to solicit feedback from the directors with relevant experience.” He has seen so many executives wary of raising questions with directors that they leave directors silent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet driving a sophisticated conversation that promotes “good questions” is the unspoken mandate of robust board presentations. Instead of concluding remarks that restate key business results, a confident executive should share two or three important ideas that will drive future success and concerns that could benefit from director input. In other words, the presenter must sincerely seek out the board&#39;s point of view by posing questions that remain unresolved or business risks that will persist. The goal: Gt the board&#39;s validation or critiques of a proposed course of action. The result, invariably, is a mix of candid feedback and intelligent, probing questions that create thoughtful board engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During an interview, Frank Blake, the former CEO of The Home Depot, described the typical tone of a meeting between an on-the-ground store team and chief executive who has stopped by for a visit. “What the CEO will always hear is some version of: &#39;You&#39;re doing great. We&#39;re doing great. Now leave.&#39;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same tone of forced cordiality — and unproductive feedback — has become the all-too-common standard for board presentations delivered by senior executives. They represent missed opportunities to elevate a company&#39;s board discussions and ensure that both the top team and the directors are getting the greatest intellectual value and leadership insight from every conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
