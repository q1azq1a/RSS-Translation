Psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201602/4-truths-about-power-in-relationships-include-yours&quot;>;关于关系的研究&lt;/a>;将权力定义为不仅拥有更大的权力影响他人的能力，但对他人影响的&lt;em>;抵抗力&lt;/em>;也较强。因此，下次当你感觉到你的同事对你过度施加权力时（例如，即使你无法联系到他们，但又在最后一刻提出了另一个请求），最好不要立即放弃你的请求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾经指导过一位领导者，她的同事经常把工作推给她，但当其他人需要她的帮助时，她却设法置身事外。这位同事经常引用她与共同老板的互动来证明自己的权力，并在提出纯粹为她服务的请求时放弃他们的名字。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您的处境与我的客户类似，请回复你的同事可以这样说：“我想让你知道我收到了你的请求。我很乐意提供帮助，但目前我还有其他必须履行的承诺。同时，请随时向我发送更多信息，以便我提出其他解决方案。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;理想情况下，您希望传达这样的信息：您希望他们也将有限的时间投入到这段关系中。如果您忠实于做出的最低承诺，那么您就可以自信地坚持作为平等合作伙伴的立场。这不仅会鼓励他们尊重您，还会迫使他们像您一样为这段关系做出必要的牺牲。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;将他们与其他重视您的有权势的人联系起来。&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;改变关系中权力的另一种方法是通过将他们与他们尊敬的其他人联系起来，巧妙地提醒他们你的社会价值，并且与他们建立了关系。这做了三件有价值的事情：首先，它向他们表明（通过社会证明的原则），如果他们敬佩的人看到你的价值，你必须提供一些东西；其次，这可能会扭转你们关系动态的天平，因为你拥有他们想要享受的机会；第三，它发出了一个信号，表明您已经拥有高调的访问权限，因此不必急于寻求他们的认可。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾与一位领导者共事，他努力被视为“战略”高管，并且在进行继任计划讨论时，人力资源部门不断淡化更高级别的职位。但事实上，他非常具有创新精神，并渴望为业务更具前瞻性的方面做出贡献；正是因为他非常擅长运营执行，人力资源部和他的老板不想通过晋升来搅局。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了打破这种限制他进步的权力动态，我的客户开始与其他高级领导者建立关系并传播有助于他们业务需求的想法。然后他开始在他的新联系人和人力资源部门以及他的业务部门的一些对他的职业生涯有影响的同事之间进行介绍。通过展示他与其他强大领导者的接触并通过与他人联系来分享，他的品牌开始逐渐提升为企业级领导者的形象。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;帮助他们发现作为领导者的盲点。支持他们的方式。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;即使是最有权势的人也不能完全按照其他人看待他们的方式来看待自己。换句话说，他们和我们其他人一样也有盲点。当您可以帮助他们温和地认识到他们的思维或行为中阻碍其目标的某个方面时，他们就会开始将您视为高度信任的合作伙伴，而不是低于他们水平的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;我的一位客户是一家科技公司的高级副总裁，她了解整个组织内关于首席执行官缺乏果断力以及这如何给员工和团队造成混乱的讨论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然她同意总体而言，她对首席执行官对待她的方式感到满意。虽然他比她拥有更大的权力，但她总体上接受了在他的领导下工作并尽可能满足他的期望的想法。毕竟，她想，为什么要冒着与首席执行官的关系的风险，向他提供强硬的反馈，因为她作为信使，可能会适得其反？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但她也认识到，要成为他值得信赖的合作伙伴，她需要无论好坏，都需要真正站在他的立场上，这需要为了他的利益而对他诚实。因此，她决定在下一次一对一的谈话中分享她的观察结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位高级副总裁说：“我知道为企业和我们的员工做正确的事情对你来说有多重要。有时我们的优势可能会被过度利用，以致成为劣势。我认为，因为你非常关心倾听问题各个方面的意见，所以开始推迟做出决定。我想提供这种可能性，因为你可能太接近这种风格，无法看到它如何影响其他人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在冒着给首席执行官树立镜子的风险时，高级副总裁赢得了很高的评价来自他的尊重和感激。他们的关系成为值得信赖的顾问之一，而不仅仅是直接报告。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你会见有权势的人，并简单地告诉他们他们以前听到的一切或与你职位上的其他人相同的事情，你就会被遗忘并维持现状。但是，通过走出你的舒适区，友善而自信地指出有权势的人没有注意到的事情，你不仅会变得令人难忘，而且会开始获得他们的影响力和尊重。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong >;让他们为赢得你的关注而工作。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;获得比你更有权力的同事的尊重是一个有趣的悖论：通过让他们为你的认可而工作，你可以获得更多的利益他们的尊重。因此，第四个策略是创造条件，让他们必须向你“出售”他们的价值。基本上，减少为赢得他们的尊重而付出的努力，并让他们承担解释为什么他们应该值得你关注的负担。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多年来，我曾为那些经历过合并或重组的公司的领导者提供过指导，要求许多员工和领导者“重新申请”工作，无论是在他们的部门还是在公司的新部门。这种经历可能会令人不安，不仅因为他们又重新成为与其他人竞争工作的候选人，而且因为与从外部申请新公司不同，他们的声誉先于他们，并提供更主观的信息，这将影响面试官评估时&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多人在这些情况下犯的自然错误是对他们认为会被问到的问题做好过度准备，并尽力回避自己的答案以取悦招聘同事。这似乎是阻力最小的途径，但实际上在对方眼中它们是容易被遗忘且不起眼的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相反，想办法慷慨地回答，但也不要害怕提出问题他们有点跟不上。当你的同事问你这个经常重复的问题时：“我们为什么要雇用你来做这份工作？”你的第一反应可能是向他们证明你的价值，让他们满意，尽管你和他们都知道大多数人申请工作是因为重组，而不是因为他们想尝试新事物。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相反，稍稍停顿一下，然后说：“事实上，我还不确定你是否应该雇用我。我想探讨一下我的经验和您对这个团队的发展方向的愿景是否相互契合。当我探索下一步时，您可以分享的有关您的管理风格的任何内容都会有所帮助。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;期望掌权者“赢得”您的兴趣而不是认为这是理所当然的，可以带来积极的结果。它不仅可以让您在竞争中脱颖而出，还可以确保您与尊重您的同事一起工作，而不是让您受制于他们的权力和突发奇想。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当您陷入不平等的权力动态时，记住，权力的分配不仅是暂时的，而且你可以平衡它。通过采用这些策略，您可以创造性地把握当下并以不同的方式构建联系，从而建立您应得的尊重。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;摘要。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;自疫情爆发以来，大多数雇主对简历差距更加理解，更少歧视。但你必须准备好清楚、自信、不结巴地解释这些差距。掌握自己的职业轨迹意味着为招聘人员和招聘经理连接所有点。自己围绕任何差距进行叙述将有助于使它们不再成为问题。作者讨论了工作经历差距的五个常见原因以及如何在面试过程中掌握差距。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to- explain-a-gap-in-your-resume?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-explain-a-gap-in-your -resume?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在每个面试过程中，至少有一次你会被问到某种版本的问题，“你能带我浏览一下你的简历吗？”除了您的技能和经验之外，您还需要能够解释您在工作之间的转换，包括差距。这一点至关重要：当您在讨论简历时忽略工作之间的差距时，您就失去了控制有关工作转变或离开商业劳动力的时间的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于我对以下行业就业差距的研究：在我的书《想要→新职业：过渡到新职业或寻找梦想工作的权威手册》中，以下是工作经历差距的五个常见原因，以及如何在新职业生涯中承认差距面试流程：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;在家养育子女&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您从商业劳动力中休假&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/helping-stay-at-home- parents-reenter-the-workforce&quot;>;养育孩子&lt;/a>;，请解释您如何利用这段时间来获得与工作相关的技能、知识或经验。例如，您在孩子的学校做过志愿者吗？组织活动或筹款活动？您是为运动队活动安排旅行的家长吗？所有这些都可以转化为您正在申请的工作。例如，假设您希望继续从事全球筹款事业。你可以告诉面试官：“我请假去照顾我们的孩子，但我能够在为儿童体育联盟做志愿者、制定筹款目标并帮助团队成功实现筹款配额为儿童提供经济援助的同时，保持自己的技能新鲜。”那些需要它的人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;丧亲或照顾生病的家庭成员&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您抽出时间去照顾父母或家庭成员，请拥有您花这段时间的选择和他们在一起的重要时光。从工作的角度来审视这段经历。例如，如果您想重新担任客户服务角色，您可以专注于与家人的医疗保健提供者联络的角色：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;我请假去护理为了我的父亲。在那段时间里，我能够利用我与多个医疗保健提供者的有效沟通技巧，以及我的组织能力来协调与他的财务规划师、经纪人和法律代表的会议，这让他安心。我想在这份工作中运用同样的解决问题的技能以及在压力下保持冷静的能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;如果您正在申请财务工作，您可以专注于您的角色作为遗嘱执行人：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;在我母亲去世之前，我抽出了时间陪伴她。我被任命为执行人是因为我高度负责、有组织性并且具有财务头脑。我能够利用我的财务技能以及软技能来协调她的遗产，例如与多个债权人（包括公用事业公司、信用卡公司、医疗机构和银行机构）进行有效沟通。我的技能使我能够快速有效地关闭遗产，现在我希望将我的技能运用到新的挑战中。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h2>;环游世界&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;何时在抽出时间去探索之后回到公司工作环境，专注于你如何利用这段时间来获得新的视角。例如，如果您正在面试一家跨国公司，您可以讨论与来自不同文化的人互动的细微差别，以及体验其他国家的生活如何为您提供许多人在工作场所所没有的视角。如果您正在寻求运营职位，您可以重点关注旅行计划、与损益表相关的预算的效率，以及如何使用批判性思维来确定下一步要去哪里。如果您花时间学习第二、第三或第四语言，请解释一下您的会话或流利能力如何使您成为比不会多语言的人表现更好的候选人。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;回到学校&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;也许您回到学校是为了获得 MBA 或博士学位。如果您是全日制学生，请解释您从事的具体项目如何与工作直接相关，以及这些项目以及过去的工作经验将如何让您为该职位带来独特的价值。也许您获得了 MBA 学位并想从事商业运营工作。您为真正的公司做过项目吗？将它们包含在您的简历中，以便您可以在面试时讨论它们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您发展了自己的技能&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/5-ways-to-acquire-new-skills-without -going-back-to school&quot;>;无需返回学校&lt;/a>;获得传统学位 - 例如，通过参加课程或获得认证 - 描述这些技能如何应用于未来的工作，并使你与众不同其他候选人。如果您阅读特定书籍是为了获得对您所在领域的新视角或增强您的领导能力，请谈谈您将如何应用您在工作中学到的原则。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;终止雇佣关系&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/what-to-do-after-being-laid-off&quot;>;受到与绩效无关的大规模裁员的影响&lt;/a>;，向面试官解释业务策略发生了变化，您的部门或团队在最新一波裁员浪潮中被解雇。您甚至可以积极地看待不幸的情况：“但这一直是一件幸事，因为我正在考虑寻找新的挑战。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您因表现而被解雇，显然您的雇主并不认为您是这样你的工作很成功，但也许你有不同的观点，或者觉得这个角色不是你所期望的。在这种情况下，您可以解释说这份工作与您想象的不同，并且没有以最有效的方式利用您的技能和能力。始终解释您从这次经历中学到了什么，以及您如何积极工作以确保您的下一步行动更接近您的期望。例如：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;我刚开始工作不久就知道这份工作并不像描述的那样，但既然我对公司做出了承诺，我想尽我最大的努力。最终，我的 A、B、C 技能没有得到有效利用，为业务带来价值。因此，我们友好地分开了，这使我能够花时间找到合适的工作，根据业务需求，我可以带来最大的价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;如果您处于有毒环境中或决定因任何其他原因辞职，不要将这种消极情绪带入工作面试中。从积极的角度看待你离职的原因，例如，“我需要集中时间来找到一份更符合我价值观的工作，但每周工作 60 小时，我找不到时间去做这件事。”最重要的是，永远不要说任何人的坏话，因为这种行为会让你看起来像一个只责备别人而不承担责任的人——而在新公司也可以这样做。现在是走正路的时候了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;自大流行以来，大多数雇主对简历差距更加理解和更少歧视 - 但你必须准备好清楚、自信、不绊倒地解释这些差距。掌握自己的职业轨迹意味着为招聘人员和招聘经理连接所有点。自己围绕任何差距进行叙述将有助于使它们不再成为问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;人工智能开发的竞争性质给组织带来了困境，因为优先考虑速度可能会导致忽视道德准则、偏见检测和安全措施。与工作场所人工智能相关的已知和新出现的问题包括错误信息的传播、版权和知识产权问题、网络安全、数据隐私，以及快速而模糊的法规。为了减轻这些风险，我们提出了在工作中负责任的人工智能的十三个原则。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/ 13-principles-for-using-ai-responsively?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/13-principles-for-using-ai-responsively?language =pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;无论你喜欢还是讨厌，人工智能的快速扩张不会很快放缓。但人工智能的失误&lt;a href=&quot;https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2022/01/the-reputational-risks-of-ai/&quot;>;可能会迅速损害品牌声誉&lt;/a>;——问问微软的第一个聊天机器人就知道了，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;>;泰&lt;/a>;。在科技竞赛中，所有领导者都担心如果自己放慢速度而其他人却没有放慢速度，就会被甩在后面。这是一个高风险的局面，合作似乎有风险，叛逃也很诱人。这种&lt;a href=&quot;https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/the-prisoners-dilemma/&quot;>;“囚徒困境”&lt;/a>;（博弈论中的说法）给负责任的人工智能实践带来了风险。优先考虑上市速度的领导者正在推动当前的人工智能军备竞赛，主要企业参与者都在竞相推出产品，并可能&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/tech-companies -cut-ai-ethics/&quot;>;短期改变关键考虑因素&lt;/a>;，例如道德准则、偏见检测和安全措施。例如，大型科技公司正在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/tech-companies-cut-ai-ethics/&quot;>;解雇人工智能道德团队&lt;/ a>; 正是在最需要采取负责任行动的时候。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样重要的是要认识到人工智能军备竞赛超出了 OpenAI、Google 和 Meta 等大型语言模型 (LLM) 的开发人员的范围。它包括许多利用法学硕士来支持自己的定制应用程序的公司。例如，在专业服务领域，普华永道 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/pwcs-4000-legal-staffers-get-ai-assistant-law-chatbots-gain- steam-2023-03-15/&quot;>;宣布&lt;/a>;正在为分布在 100 个国家/地区的 4,000 名律师部署人工智能聊天机器人。这些人工智能助理将“帮助律师进行合同分析、监管合规工作、尽职调查以及其他法律咨询和咨询服务。”普华永道的管理层也在考虑将这些人工智能聊天机器人扩展到他们的税务实践中。这家咨询巨头总共计划向“生成人工智能”（一种强大的新技术）投入 10 亿美元。工具能够提供改变游戏规则的绩效提升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样，毕马威推出了自己的人工智能助手，名为&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/companies/ professional-services/custom-chatgpt-tool-to-help-kpmg-s-consultants-win-new-work-20230321-p5cu3m&quot;>;KymChat&lt;/a>;，这将帮助员工快速找到整个组织的内部专家，将它们围绕即将到来的机会，并根据项目要求和可用人才之间的匹配自动生成提案。他们的&lt;a href=&quot;https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/media/press-releases/2023/03/kpmg-unveils-cutting-edge-private-chatgpt-software-march-2023.html&quot; >;人工智能助手&lt;/a>;“将更好地实现跨团队协作，并帮助公司新员工获得更无缝、更高效的人员导航体验。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slack 还将生成式人工智能融入到开发中&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-gpt&quot;>;Slack GPT&lt;/a>; 的一款人工智能助手，旨在帮助员工更聪明地工作，而不是更辛苦地工作。该平台整合了一系列人工智能功能，例如对话摘要和写作辅助，以提高用户的工作效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些示例只是冰山一角。很快，数亿 Microsoft 365 用户将可以访问 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work /&quot;>;商务聊天&lt;/a>;，一个让用户参与工作的代理，努力理解他们的 Microsoft 365 数据。员工可以提示助理做所有事情，从根据会议记录和电子邮件通信制定状态报告摘要，到识别策略中的缺陷并提出解决方案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能代理的快速部署就是&lt;a href= “https://fortune.com/2023/04/20/ibm-ceo-work-ai-artificial-intelligence-careers-tech-arvind-krishna/&quot;>;IBM 首席执行官 Arvind Krishna&lt;/a>; 最近写道“人们与值得信赖的人工智能合作将对我们的经济和社会产生变革性的影响……现在是我们拥抱这种伙伴关系的时候了——让我们的员工为人工智能所提供的一切做好准备。”简而言之，组织在安装人工智能驱动的工具方面正在经历指数级增长，而那些不适应的公司则面临着落后的风险。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;工作中的人工智能风险&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;不幸的是，保持竞争力还给雇员和雇主带来了重大风险。例如，2022 年&lt;a href=&quot;https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380861&quot;>;联合国教科文组织出版物&lt;/a>;关于“人工智能对女性工作生活的影响”报告称，人工智能例如，在招聘过程中，将妇女排除在晋升之外。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6491&quot;>;报告引用的一项研究&lt;/a>;，其中包括 21 项实验，涉及超过 60,000 个有针对性的招聘广告，发现“将用户的性别设置为‘女性’会导致与选择“男性”作为性别的用户相比，与高薪工作相关的广告实例较少。”尽管人工智能在招聘和聘用方面的偏见众所周知，但它不会很快消失。正如联合国教科文组织的报告接着指出的那样，“一项 &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3450077&quot;>;2021 年研究&lt;/a>;的证据表明，招聘广告因性别而存在偏差。即使广告商想要性别平衡的受众，Facebook 也是如此。”这通常是一个有偏见的数据问题，它将继续影响人工智能工具并威胁关键的劳动力因素，例如&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raconteur.net/responsible-business/ais-threat-to-diversity-equity-包容性/&quot;>;多样性、公平性和包容性&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;歧视性就业做法可能只是生成式人工智能使组织面临的一系列法律风险之一。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/openai-hit-with-first-defamation-suit-over-chatgpt-hallucination&quot;>;OpenAI 正面临着第一次因指控 ChatGPT 产生有害的错误信息而提起诽谤诉讼&lt;/a>;。具体来说，该系统生成了一个真实法庭案件的摘要，其中包括对佐治亚州一名电台主持人的挪用公款的捏造指控。这凸显了创建和共享人工智能生成信息对组织的负面影响。它强调了对法学硕士捏造虚假和诽谤性内容的担忧，从而导致声誉受损、信誉丧失、客户信任度下降以及严重的法律后果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了与诽谤相关的担忧之外，还存在与&lt; a href=&quot;/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem&quot;>;侵犯版权和知识产权&lt;/a>;。几个&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/&quot;>;备受瞩目的法律案件&lt; /a>; 已经出现，生成人工智能工具的开发者因涉嫌不当使用许可内容而被起诉。版权和知识产权侵权的存在，加上此类侵权行为的法律影响，给使用生成式人工智能产品的组织带来了重大风险。组织可能会在不知不觉中参与抄袭、未经授权的改编、未经许可的商业使用以及滥用知识共享或开源内容等活动，从而通过生成人工智能不当使用许可内容，从而使自己面临潜在的法律后果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能的大规模部署也放大了网络攻击的风险&lt;/a>;。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Generative-AI-the-next-biggest-cyber-security-threat&quot;>;网络安全专家担心&lt;/a>;可以使用生成式人工智能&lt;a href=&quot;https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_e69b334f-36d8-44b0-9f52-93ea6089aa5a&quot;>;识别和利用业务信息系统中的漏洞&lt;/a>;，给定法学硕士自动编码和错误检测的能力，恶意行为者可以利用它来突破安全障碍。人们还担心员工不小心与第三方人工智能提供商共享敏感数据。一个值得注意的例子是三星员工无意中 &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-generative-ai-tools-like-chatgpt-after-april-internal- data-leak/&quot;>;在使用 LLM 审查源代码时通过 ChatGPT 泄露商业秘密&lt;/a>;。由于他们未能选择退出数据共享，机密信息无意中被提供给了 OpenAI。尽管三星和其他公司正在采取措施&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/19/apple-joins-a-forming-list-of-companies-cracking -down-on-use-of-chatgpt-by-staffers-heres-why/&quot;>;限制在公司自有设备上使用第三方人工智能工具&lt;/a>;，但仍然存在员工可能通过以下途径泄露信息的担忧：在个人设备上使用此类系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了这些风险之外，企业很快将不得不应对新生的、多样化的且有些模糊的法规。 Anyone hiring in New York City, for instance, will have to ensure their AI-powered recruitment and hiring tech doesn&#39;t violate the City&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-york-city-s-automated-employment-6844706/&quot;>;automated employment decision tool&lt;/a>;” law. To comply with the new law, employers will need to take various steps such as conducting third-party bias audits of their hiring tools and publicly disclosing the findings. AI regulation is also scaling up nationally with the Biden-Harris administration&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/&quot;>;Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights&lt;/a>;” and internationally with the EU&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/&quot;>;AI Act&lt;/a>;, which will mark a new era of regulation for employers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This growing nebulous of evolving regulations and pitfalls is why thought leaders such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/your-7-biggest-chatgpt-questions-answered&quot;>;Gartner&lt;/a>; are strongly suggesting that businesses “proceed but don&#39;t over pivot” and that they “create a task force reporting to the CIO and CEO” to plan a roadmap for a safe AI transformation that mitigates various legal, reputational, and workforce risks. Leaders dealing with this AI dilemma have important decision to make. On the one hand, there is a pressing competitive pressure to fully embrace AI. However, on the other hand, a growing concern is arising as the implementation of irresponsible AI can result in severe penalties, substantial damage to reputation, and significant operational setbacks. The concern is that in their quest to stay ahead, leaders may unknowingly introduce potential time bombs into their organization, which are poised to cause major problems once AI solutions are deployed and regulations take effect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/08/1180838096/an-eating-disorders-chatbot-offered-dieting-advice-raising-fears-about-ai-in-hea&quot;>;National Eating Disorder Association&lt;/a>; (NEDA) recently announced it was letting go of its hotline staff and replacing them with their new chatbot, Tessa. However, just days before making the transition, NEDA discovered that their system was promoting harmful advice such as encouraging people with eating disorders to restrict their calories and to lose one to two pounds per week. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/13/1074551/an-algorithm-intended-to-reduce-poverty-in-jordan-disqualifies-people-in-need/&quot;>;World Bank&lt;/a>; spent $1 billion to develop and deploy an algorithmic system, called Takaful, to distribute financial assistance that Human Rights Watch now says ironically creates inequity. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-courts-e15023d7e6fdf4f099aa122437dbb59b&quot;>;two lawyers from New York&lt;/a>; are facing possible disciplinary action after using ChatGPT to draft a court filing that was found to have several references to previous cases that did not exist. These instances highlight the need for well-trained and well-supported employees at the center of this digital transformation. While AI can serve as a valuable assistant, it should not assume the leading position.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Principles for Responsible AI at Work&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To help decision-makers avoid negative outcomes while also remaining competitive in the age of AI, we&#39;ve devised several principles for a sustainable AI-powered workforce. The principles are a blend of ethical frameworks from institutions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/od/recr.jsp&quot;>;National Science Foundation&lt;/a>; as well as legal requirements related to employee monitoring and data privacy such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1285&quot;>;Electronic Communications Privacy Act&lt;/a>; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecpra.org/&quot;>;California Privacy Rights Act&lt;/a>;. The steps for ensuring responsible AI at work include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Informed Consent. &lt;/strong>;Obtain voluntary and informed agreement from employees to participate in any AI-powered intervention &lt;em>;after&lt;/em>; the employees are provided with all the relevant information about the initiative. This includes the program&#39;s purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Aligned Interests. &lt;/strong>;The goals, risks, and benefits for both the employer and employee are clearly articulated and aligned.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Opt In &amp;amp; Easy Exits. &lt;/strong>;Employees must opt into AI-powered programs without feeling forced or coerced, and they can easily withdraw from the program at any time without any negative consequences and without explanation.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Conversational Transparency. &lt;/strong>;When AI-based conversational agents are used, the agent should formally reveal any persuasive objectives the system aims to achieve through the dialogue with the employee.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Debiased and Explainable AI. &lt;/strong>;Explicitly outline the steps taken to remove, minimize, and mitigate bias in AI-powered employee interventions—especially for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups—and provide transparent explanations into how AI systems arrive at their decisions and actions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;AI Training and Development. &lt;/strong>;Provide continuous employee training and development to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI-powered tools.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Health and Well-Being. &lt;/strong>;Identify types of AI-induced stress, discomfort, or harm and articulate steps to minimize risks (eg, how will the employer minimize stress caused by constant AI-powered monitoring of employee behavior).&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Data Collection. &lt;/strong>;Identify what data will be collected, if data collection involves any invasive or intrusive procedures (eg, the use of webcams in work-from-home situations), and what steps will be taken to minimize risk.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Data. &lt;/strong>;Disclose any intention to share personal data, with whom, and why.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Privacy and Security. &lt;/strong>;Articulate protocols for maintaining privacy, storing employee data securely, and what steps will be taken in the event of a privacy breach.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Third Party Disclosure. &lt;/strong>;Disclose all third parties used to provide and maintain AI assets, what the third party&#39;s role is, and how the third party will ensure employee privacy.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Communication.&lt;/strong>; Inform employees about changes in data collection, data management, or data sharing as well as any changes in AI assets or third-party relationships.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Laws and Regulations. &lt;/strong>;Express ongoing commitment to comply with all laws and regulations related to employee data and the use of AI.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;We encourage leaders to urgently adopt and develop this checklist in their organizations. By applying such principles, leaders can ensure rapid &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; responsible AI deployment.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 30 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Make Leadership Positions More Enticing to Primary Care Physicians]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-make-leadership-positions-more-enticing-to-primary-care-physicians]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_29_1293518427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/The Good Brigade/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Primary care in the US is being pushed to the brink of collapse due to historic highs of physician stress, burnout, and exhaustion; mass departures from the profession; and the inability to care for vulnerable populations due to an inequitable health system.

Our research suggests that the answer may be straightforward. While primary care accounts for roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/workforce/data/active-physicians-largest-specialties-major-professional-activity-2021&quot;>;one in three&lt;/a>; practicing physicians and is seen as the bedrock of the health care system, it is also the most overlooked and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jabfm.org/content/primary-care-physician-leadership-top-ranked-us-hospitals&quot;>;underrepresented in the realms of health care leadership&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Transformational changes to primary care will require leadership with holistic training, a clear vision, an insider&#39;s perspective, and skin in the game. PCPs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/early/2022/05/19/leader-2022-000591.abstract&quot;>;uniquely positioned to lead&lt;/a>; this change. They are the Swiss Army Knives of medicine, offering an increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfp.ca/content/68/11/801&quot;>;rare generalist perspective, requiring strong communication skills, and a community-focused&lt;/a>; approach to care delivery. Not only are they responsible for managing day-to-day concerns for their patients, they also coordinate care across specialties and organizations for those who may have medically complex diagnoses. These clinicians are accustomed to leading teams every day to care for their patients, and must be adaptable, thoughtful, and flexible, given their vast breadth of clinical responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is paradoxical that those best poised to lead are often reluctant to do so. In fact, many physicians are not only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2014/sep/01/nhs-leadership-doctors-reluctant-manage-lead&quot;>;reluctant&lt;/a>; but &lt;em>;averse&lt;/em>; to taking on leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We interviewed PCPs in leadership roles to better understand what they believe prevents so many other physicians from pursuing such positions. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/jhmonline/Abstract/2022/08000/Engaging_Physicians_in_Leadership__Motivations,.6.aspx&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; highlights three key deterrents:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;PCPs viewed leadership roles as a path to losing autonomy and limiting their ability to develop long-term therapeutic relationships with patients — a key reason many physicians chose careers in medicine in the first place.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;PCPs associated leadership roles with major resource constraints, evaporating both time and earnings potential.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;PCPs lamented the loss of camaraderie with other physicians when taking on leadership roles, feeling that the roles interrupted collaboration with peers and generated uncomfortable conflict.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Despite these concerns, PCPs are fundamentally poised to make an impact on the organizations they lead. Health care organizations who understand and work to address these deterrents will have a distinct competitive advantage. They will be able to better engage and recruit PCPs in leadership and thereby reap the benefits of better &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1097/HMR.0000000000000173&quot;>;quality of care, higher patient satisfaction, and decreased provider burnout&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are three ways that health organizations can counteract these disincentives and support PCPs embracing leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Provide the On-Ramp&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs crave system change and personal growth, but often feel disempowered. They see their experience as valuable and want to leverage it to make a positive impact on the health care system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives and health administrators can tap into this motivation by framing leadership as a constructive opportunity to be a change agent. While organizations may not have the ability to alter a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/creative-job-titles-can-energize-workers&quot;>;position&#39;s specific title&lt;/a>;, the job description can be used to reflect openness to an entrepreneurial mindset and an opportunity for improving perceived system deficits. Instead of drafting a typical (and often dry) administrative job description, frame it to emphasize how the role will enact change or address major obstacles in health care. Postings should speak to a PCP&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicfootprints.org/7-top-tips-on-recruiting-doctors-to-non-clinical-or-leadership-roles/&quot;>;adaptability based on the breadth of their training and diversity of practice experience&lt;/a>;, and PCPs should be encouraged to apply.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using the frustration PCPs experience with the status quo and their frontline experience, health care organizations can promote vacant or novel leadership roles as opportunities to expand the impact on patients and to garner a broader scope of knowledge and expertise for PCPs identified as having leadership interest or potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Role Design and Definition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs want to grow and develop professionally, but our study showed that they also identified clear disadvantages in taking on leadership roles. They identified the least attractive aspect of leading, in a word, as “loss.” They feared the loss of autonomy, time, close patient relationships, and camaraderie with peers. This can be due, in part, to their exposure to disappointing experiences observed in peers who have assumed leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives and health administrators can help mitigate this with the use of strategic &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/why-managers-design-jobs-to-be-more-boring-than-they-need-to-be&quot;>;job design&lt;/a>;, where organizations create an optimal job role, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2001.4378011&quot;>;job crafting&lt;/a>;, which allows PCPs to define and customize their role themselves. These two complementary pieces of the puzzle yield large gains in employee satisfaction and fulfillment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When organizations realize that fear of loss is a major barrier, they are better positioned to design purposeful and motivating work for PCPs taking on leadership roles. To address the concern for loss of autonomy, the role should be intentionally constructed to allow PCPs the agency to make decisions per their expertise. For those apprehensive about losing time, the role can be devised to encourage a flexible approach in how goals are achieved, including the freedom to decide how they will balance their clinical responsibilities with their new leadership role. In order to address concerns about losing relationships, organizations must provide opportunities for leaders to meet with their colleagues in informal settings and encourage leaders to continue to be actively engaged as a member of their clinical team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empowering PCPs to engage in job crafting allows them to adjust aspects of the job to suit individual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-job-crafting-how-to-do-it-work-satisfaction-2022-6&quot;>;interests, values, and passions&lt;/a>;, making them more likely to be&lt;a href=&quot;https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Job-Crafting-and-Why-Does-it-Matter1.pdf&quot;>; engaged and more likely to thrive&lt;/a>; at work, while being successful in their leadership role. PCPs can independently alter the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/03/what-job-crafting-looks-like&quot;>;type and scope of tasks; relationships and with whom they work; and how to think&lt;/a>;, communicate about, or conceive of the job. When PCPs have some degree of ownership and authority over how the job is defined, they will have the opportunity to include more of their passion points, while also thoughtfully reducing those aspects of the job that are seen as pain points.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Tools, Training, and Mentorship&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs may want system change and growth, but they also need the tools, training, and mentorship to be successful. In most cases, PCPs &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/most-doctors-have-little-or-no-management-training-and-thats-a-problem&quot;>;aren&#39;t taught finance, accounting, management, or leadership skills&lt;/a>; in medical school, nor is there an emphasis on systems operations, despite the fact that, as physicians enter residency, they immediately begin leading medical teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are stark contrasts, both operationally and culturally, between &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/04/turning-doctors-into-leaders&quot;>;business and medicine&lt;/a>;. Executives and health administrators should provide opportunities for PCPs to cross-train with current administrators and to have access to mentors who can help with the transition. Providing resources to support the transition into leadership can help highly qualified and motivated PCPs avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpearl/2016/02/04/five-reasons-why-even-the-best-of-physicians-may-fail-as-leaders/?sh=1c79323bce22&quot;>;common pitfalls than can derail&lt;/a>; their ability to influence others and be successful in their expanded role. This may include offering or supporting continuing medical education (CME) or credentialing opportunities that feature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mgma.com/practice-resources/human-resources/the-importance-of-physician-leadership-education&quot;>;management and leadership skills building&lt;/a>;, partnering with institutions of higher education to create pathways into &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.nejmcareercenter.org/article/eyeing-physician-career-boost-via-formal-business-education/&quot;>;graduate business or policy programs&lt;/a>;, or engaging with organizations that specialize in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physicianleaders.org/about&quot;>;physician leadership training&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having PCPs in leadership roles has never been more important. Without a highly functioning and sustainable primary care system, all health care in the US will suffer. If we want a system that promotes effective and sustainable primary care, PCPs need to be involved in co-designing that system and leading change. Ultimately, this will benefit the entire health care system, and all of us who will, at any stage of our lives, depend on it for our own care and that of our families and communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Nail Your Presentation to the Board]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/June23_29_1296672467-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;sturti/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The boardroom is a distinct forum that requires a different type of presentation and preparation. In this article, the author outlines three practices every business leader should embrace to enhance their board presentations: 1) Start with a governing thesis: a big idea or perspective that captures the main point of the discussion. Presentations that start this way leave the audience with a compelling message. 2) Understand that the CEO is not the target audience. A board presentation has to provide some quick refreshers on the operating environment and &amp;#8212; more importantly &amp;#8212; identify the biggest problems that need fixing. 3) Steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback. Instead of concluding remarks that restate key business results, share two or three important ideas that will drive future success and concerns that could benefit from director input. The goal: Get the board&amp;#8217;s validation or critiques of a proposed course of action. The result, invariably, is a mix of candid feedback and intelligent, probing questions that create thoughtful board engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For most executives, even those at the most senior level, a presentation to the board of directors is the most demanding test of leadership communications. Very few succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conversations with more than 100 public and private boards directors over the last decade reveal that dissatisfaction with presentations is nearly universal. PowerPoint decks are too long, too granular, or simply uninformative, they report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet the feedback most senior executives receive — “Make it crisper,” “Fewer slides,” “Don&#39;t get caught up in operational details,” or even “More details, fewer headlines” — is often generic and unhelpful. Operators are told they are insufficiently strategic; strategic leaders are criticized for having insufficient operational depth. Both directors and presenter leave frustrated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the advice offered by professional speaking coaches is just as likely to lead senior executives astray. “Enhance vocal delivery,” “Use fewer bullet points,” “Tell a story,” or similar well-worn coaching points are rooted in the belief that a board presentation is simply a matter of stagecraft — a variation of a keynote presentation to a customer audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This counsel reveals a misunderstanding about the purpose and value of board meetings. The boardroom is a distinct forum that requires a different type of presentation and preparation. It demands elevated exchanges that leverage both the knowledge of senior leaders and the objectivity of seasoned directors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having coached executives preparing board-level presentations for more than 15 years — including senior leaders auditioning to become the next CEO — I have concluded that the executive&#39;s most important task is to share their thinking about the business they lead. The goal is not just to report the results of the last quarter. (Directors can read that on their own.) Instead, the senior leader should engage the board by discussing the most pressing challenges they face and how they intend to respond.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While each board has unique needs shaped by the company&#39;s operating environment, below I suggest three practices every business leader should embrace to enhance their board presentations — and their own value within the upper levels of the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Bring a compelling message.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The senior executive who arrives in the board room has typically submitted a set of slides well in advance that has been carefully vetted by the CEO and the legal team. In most cases, directors will have already studied the material, or at least flipped through the main points. What, then, is the purpose of the 10 to 30-minute slot that has been allotted to the nervous presenter?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rushing through a slide review might be useful as a quick refresher, but it neither deepens the board&#39;s understanding of the topic nor showcases the leadership skills of the executive. Instead, every presentation should start with a governing thesis: a big idea or perspective that captures the main point of the discussion. Presentations that start this way leave the audience with a compelling message.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anne Mulcahy, who has served on multiple boards, including J&amp;amp;J, Target, LPL Financial, and Williams-Sonoma, has felt frustrated by the executives who want to convey too much data and information with a series of dense slides. “It almost seems like the objective is to demonstrate how much they know about their business, she says. “It has the opposite outcome. Directors don&#39;t know what the point of the presentation is supposed to be.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By contrast, a “thesis mindset” forces the presenter to confront the future rather than just reciting the facts of the past. The thesis-driven board presentation doesn&#39;t need to be an audacious proposal or a request for more funding. But it ought to frame an issue that requires board attention. At a minimum, the governing thesis tells directors: This is where I see my part of the company going. That idea can&#39;t be slipped into slide 19. It has to be stated unambiguously and boldly at the outset. At the very least, it provides insurance against off-topic interruptions or mid-presentation dozing.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Understand that the CEO is not the target audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;By the time they are asked to present to the board, a member of a senior leadership team has had plenty of practice leading discussions with the CEO. They may even be very comfortable updating their boss, in an informal way, with little preparation. Unfortunately, bringing the same mindset and habits to the boardroom is a crucial mistake.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I am always struck by how often business unit leaders come to the boardroom and direct their talk to their boss, rather than the directors assembled around the table,” said Scott Miller, who has been serving on public and private company boards for more than two decades. Miller&#39;s point is not merely a criticism of presentation style, but a recognition that senior officers rarely consider the needs of directors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The board of directors is a unique audience with no comparison to the groups most executives regularly engage. They are not customers who need to be sold. And they are not true business colleagues, where strategy alignment and deep familiarity with the operational details of the business can be assumed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A public company board may be compromised of business leaders, academics, former CEOs, current financial officers, and executives who bring expertise from entirely different industries. As a rule, their range of knowledge about the company and any given topic will vary greatly. Some have been serving on the board for well over a decade; others may be attending their third or fourth meeting. There is also an unspoken (and sometimes unknowable) hierarchy on the board, with its own unstated group of alliances and range of authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ron Sugar, the lead director of Uber who also serves on the boards of Apple, Chevron, and Amgen, advises that the job of the presenter “is to fly at the right altitude” in the boardroom: “Dumb it down too much, and you risk insulting the directors. On the other hand, no board wants to be a working group. They want to understand what issues need to be on their radar screen.” He suggests planning to use half the allotted time so that the main point is reached quickly and discussion can follow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugar&#39;s advice is sound. A board presentation has to provide some quick refreshers on the operating environment and — more importantly — identify the biggest problems that need fixing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These problems will be familiar to the CEO (who should never be taken by surprise in the boardroom). The directors, however, need both a reminder of the core issues in an executive&#39;s portfolio (talent, operations, regulation, or a particular geography) along with looming challenges. Too many executives miss the opportunity to frame problems in the right way — and make their presentations far less engaging than they should be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of presenting challenges is not to frighten the board but to enlighten them and engage them in the operational and strategic questions that preoccupy the person presenting the material.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_us/board-matters/how-to-increase-the-boards-impact-and-value&quot;>;2022 study&lt;/a>;, EY&#39;s Center for Board Matters found that public company directors felt confident they added value to discussions of capital allocation and succession. But very few felt the top value they delivered came in areas such as revenue growth, innovation, or disruption. Ironically, these latter topics are most frequently what executives are asked to address when they invited into the boardroom.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Effective leaders can help rebalance the value that directors ought to derive from a board meeting by setting up genuine discussions that invite reaction and input. Alas, too many board presentations come to an abrupt conclusion followed by a quick call for “any questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following a presentation, many business unit leaders complain they find themselves falling down a rabbit hole of technical details triggered by an unexpected and mostly irrelevant question from a persistent director. In most instances, the blame is entirely on the presenter. They are ones who failed to set up the right conversation and missed the opportunity to steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback from the board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Randy Foutch, the former CEO of Laredo Petroleum, who has sat on many small and large company boards, believes that many executives “miss the opportunity to solicit feedback from the directors with relevant experience.” He has seen so many executives wary of raising questions with directors that they leave directors silent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet driving a sophisticated conversation that promotes “good questions” is the unspoken mandate of robust board presentations. Instead of concluding remarks that restate key business results, a confident executive should share two or three important ideas that will drive future success and concerns that could benefit from director input. In other words, the presenter must sincerely seek out the board&#39;s point of view by posing questions that remain unresolved or business risks that will persist. The goal: Gt the board&#39;s validation or critiques of a proposed course of action. The result, invariably, is a mix of candid feedback and intelligent, probing questions that create thoughtful board engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During an interview, Frank Blake, the former CEO of The Home Depot, described the typical tone of a meeting between an on-the-ground store team and chief executive who has stopped by for a visit. “What the CEO will always hear is some version of: &#39;You&#39;re doing great. We&#39;re doing great. Now leave.&#39;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same tone of forced cordiality — and unproductive feedback — has become the all-too-common standard for board presentations delivered by senior executives. They represent missed opportunities to elevate a company&#39;s board discussions and ensure that both the top team and the directors are getting the greatest intellectual value and leadership insight from every conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Managers Can Make Time for Their Own Development]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-managers-can-make-time-for-their-own-development]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_29_sb10065848cx-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Diamond Sky Images/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Managers today must balance their day-to-day work with multiple &amp;#8220;ands,&amp;#8221; such as delivering on quarterly objectives &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;thinking strategically. Given these numerous demands, managers tend to deprioritize their own career development. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be that way. The more managers take control of their development, the better able they&amp;#8217;ll be to avoid the common career mistakes that will get in the way of their growth. And the more their team members see the positive impact of investing in their career development, the more likely they are to do the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-managers-can-make-time-for-their-own-development?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-managers-can-make-time-for-their-own-development?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Being a successful manager today is a tough task that requires grappling with multiple “ands”: Supporting team members &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;influencing senior stakeholders; making progress on the day job &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;troubleshooting unexpected problems; delivering on quarterly objectives &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;thinking strategically. In the midst of the “and overload,” it&#39;s not surprising that managers tend to be the least-likely people in an organization to prioritize their own career development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through our global work on “squiggly” and nonlinear careers, we support thousands of managers every year who share a sense of frustration that their career development is stalling but struggle to find the time to invest in their own learning. We&#39;ve observed three common career development mistakes managers make and uncovered a few tried-and-tested solutions to help them balance the demands of the day-to-day with investing in their own development.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. The Say-Do Development Gap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Our clients often tell us that they find coaching and supporting their team members&#39; career development to be a motivating and enjoyable part of their managerial role — and yet they undervalue the importance of modeling this behavior themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When teams don&#39;t see their manager investing in their own development, it creates a “say-do” development gap, which has a negative ripple effect for both managers and their teams: Team members lose confidence that committing time to their career development is the right thing to do and may even question whether their manager really values continual learning. At the same time, managers miss out on important moments to develop skills and capabilities to improve their performance and support their ambitions for the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do differently: Share learning goals&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One simple and effective way for managers to avoid the say-do development gap is to share their learning goals openly with their teams. Sharing development priorities has multiple benefits. First, it prompts managers to identify what development they want to focus on, and sharing their goals increases accountability. Second, involving team members means that managers are surrounding themselves with more people to support their development and removes the idea that learning from others is linked to levels and hierarchy. Finally, when team members see their managers setting and sticking to development goals, it prompts them to do the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a manager who shares a learning goal to increase their internal profile might benefit from a team member spotting an opportunity for them to speak at an event. A manager looking to develop their ability to use data to drive decisions could be supported with feedback from their team members on what they currently do well and what could be better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When approached in this way, development doesn&#39;t need to be another thing that gets added to a manager&#39;s to-do list; it becomes part of their daily work and is accelerated by the people who work for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. The Bubble Barrier&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With so many demands on their workdays, it&#39;s understandable that managers rarely spend time on development outside of their organization. The challenge of finding the time and opportunity to learn in different places and with new people often feels insurmountable and falls into the category of “should do” rather than “will do.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on internal-only development results in managers developing a narrow view of the world and limits their learning. And operating in the bubble of internal knowledge and networks means that managers are reenforcing who and what they already know rather than cultivating their curiosity. Managers need to learn beyond the internal bubble so that it doesn&#39;t become a barrier to their growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do differently: Knowledge-swap sessions&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An efficient way to bring the outside in is to approach peers in a non-competing organization to co-host a team development session, where both teams share their expertise with each other. For example, a team with agile expertise could knowledge-swap with a team that has strong communication capabilities. Or an established team in a large organization might spend time with a team from a smaller startup, exchanging insights on innovation in different operating contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-sidebar data-sidebar-alternate=&quot;sidebar&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Example agenda items for knowledge-swap sessions&lt;/h4>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“What if?” wall:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares an idea or objective they&#39;re working on, and the other organization creates a “what if?” wall of questions to spark new thoughts. For example: What if you were famous for your customer service? What if your product sold twice as much as it does today?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Day in the life:&lt;/strong>; One person from each team describes the reality of a day in their life. This helps create a sense of connection between people, especially when the speaker includes non-work activities. For example: I started my day by taking my five-year-old to the dentist where he decided to scream the place down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mistake moments:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares a mistake moment they&#39;ve had and what they learned. This can help teams preempt potential problems and recover quickly when they happen. For example: We were communicating across too many technology platforms and people were getting overwhelmed and missing important information. The team created a communications policy that helps people feel more in control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pride postcards:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares one thing they&#39;re proud from the past few months and how they came together to achieve it. This inspires the other team with the art of the possible and gives them practical insights on how to make it happen. For example: We introduced a new well-being policy for our organization that got featured in the media as an example of best practice. The three things that helped us most were… &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Surprise stories:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares an example of something about their organization or function that might surprise others who aren&#39;t on “the inside.” This gives teams ideas for what they can do differently. For example: In our organization, everyone gets an extra day of holiday on their birthday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Superpower swaps:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares one of their superpowers and three top tips on how to develop that skill. For example: One of our superpowers is problem-solving, and our three top tips are to use your strengths to solve problems, hold problem-solving hack sessions, and pair people up on problems.&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/article-sidebar>; &lt;p>;These knowledge-swap sessions allow everyone to spend time in a different working world, create new connections, and learn together (which also supports overcoming the say-do gap). The format of a swap session can range from a virtual hour over lunch to a full day in a room. Holding knowledge-swaps gives managers — and their teams — regular opportunities to learn from people outside the organization in a way that&#39;s part of their existing rhythm of work, rather than something extra to squeeze in.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. The Time Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We often hear managers say: “I don&#39;t have time to invest in my development. I&#39;ll get around to it when everything calms down, or when this project has finished, or when I&#39;ve recruited this person, etc.” This way of thinking means keeps many managers stuck in a time trap, which will hold their career back over the long-term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These time traps aren&#39;t a result of managers making excuses — they reflect the reality of the challenges they&#39;re dealing with. The mistake is the hope that one day we&#39;ll magically have more time and fewer things to do. If managers look for the perfect moment to focus on their development, they&#39;re likely to be left waiting and stagnating in their career.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do differently: Manager micro-learning moments&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Many people still associate development with formal learning methods like taking a course. But what managers need are small, easy ways to make development part of their day-to-day. Practicing micro-learning moments is a memorable and simple way for managers to kickstart the habit of continual improvement. Effective micro-learning moments usually take less than 10 minutes, and they&#39;re small but significant in their impact, as managers benefit from a compound effect of continual learning over time. Here are a few examples:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Fast feedback:&lt;/strong>; Ask your team members to answer the same fast feedback question: &lt;em>;What three words would you use to describe me at my best? &lt;/em>;This simple question gives managers instant insight into whether their intent is matching their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;One-minute weekly review:&lt;/strong>; End your week by spending one minute jotting down the answers to these two self-awareness questions: &lt;em>;What has given me the most energy this week? What could have been better this week?&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Strength accelerator: &lt;/strong>;Pick one skill you want to strengthen and identify an action related to either regularity (how could you use that strength more?), range (where else could you use that strength that you don&#39;t today?), or reach (who could you share that strength with?).&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The more managers take control of their development, the better able they&#39;ll be to avoid the career mistakes that will get in the way of their growth. And the more their team members see the positive impact of investing in their career development, the more likely they are to do the same. Helping managers helps everyone succeed in their squiggly careers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Find the Time to Connect with Colleagues When You&rsquo;re Very, Very Busy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-find-the-time-to-connect-with-colleagues-when-youre-very-very-busy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_28_482824941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HollenderX2/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;A consequence of our often never-ending to-do lists at work is the loss of camaraderie among coworkers. While productivity is important, the balance between task completion and taking the time to connect with your team is essential in avoiding burnout and making work more enjoyable. The common misconception is that there simply isn&amp;#8217;t enough hours (or energy) in the day to get your work done and socialize; the reality is that just a quick slack message, coffee run, or group share in the beginning or ending of a meeting are all simple yet impactful acts that require minimal effort and time and thus make the former argument null and void. Studies show that socializing, despite feeling like a daunting task, can be effective in combating mental fatigue by energizing us. Increased energy improves performance and therefore proves socializing to be even more beneficial than the head down work one might prioritize over fostering those connections with colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-find-the-time-to-connect-with-colleagues-when-youre-very-very-busy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-find-the-time-to-connect-with-colleagues-when-youre-very-very-busy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re feeling behind on tasks and pressed against deadlines, catching up with and connecting with colleagues is about the last thing you feel like doing. You just want to put your head down, check off tasks on your to-do list, and get things done.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are absolutely times when you should put on blinders and focus solely on your tactical objectives. But exclusively interacting in a transactional manner with your coworkers could cause you to lose any sense of personal connection, especially if you work remotely. By taking even a few minutes each day to foster a sense of rapport at work, you could unlock the key to a &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/to-be-happier-at-work-invest-more-in-your-relationships&quot;>;greater sense of purpose and well-being, reduce burnout, and even improve your performance.&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So how do you make time for people without feeling more stressed and overwhelmed? As a time management coach, I&#39;ve seen that with just a little more intention, you can make much more meaningful connections without investing much time.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Chat in One-on-One Meetings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you already have one-on-one meetings scheduled with your team, take a few minutes at the start of the discussion to find out how they&#39;re doing before jumping to the business agenda. You don&#39;t need to spend the whole time on personal updates, but even reserving five minutes to ask about their recent vacation, find out if their mom is out of the hospital, or to see how they&#39;re recovering from surgery can make a difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can use the same strategy for one-on-one meetings with colleagues who you regularly work with on projects. Depending on the length of the meeting and how much you need to cover, you may not have time to catch up each time. But if every few meetings you use a few minutes at the beginning or end to talk about more than the projects at hand, you can strengthen those ties. This could include bonding over your excitement about a particular sports team, talking about your families, or discussing anything else that gives you space to connect beyond a one-dimensional, task-oriented level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If remembering details about people&#39;s lives doesn&#39;t come naturally to you, make a private note in your calendar with memory cues, such as asking them about their new puppy, about their kids&#39; latest extracurriculars, or how their side venture is going.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Encourage Group Sharing During Meetings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In a large team meeting, there won&#39;t be much space for personal catchups. But if you have a smaller team, it may be appropriate to take some time on a weekly or monthly basis for updates. This could be as simple as a quick share at the beginning of a meeting about a recent event, such as attending an industry conference. This can also happen organically if you work in person and have a specific forum designated for it: for example, if you bring in coffee and bagels on Monday mornings and have breakfast together, or if there&#39;s a Friday afternoon happy hour. Even 15 to 20 minutes of unstructured talk can lead to a greater sense of team engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re part of a remote or hybrid team, it may be harder to connect organically. Consider hosting a virtual happy hour or have a few people share during a team meeting. Just keep these updates short so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/irl/highs-lows-weekend-tiktok/&quot;>;the highs and lows don&#39;t turn into a viral meme&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Turn Breaks into Informal Social Time &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Grab a bite to eat with colleagues over your lunch break. Your meeting schedule may not allow a proper lunch break every day, but blocking out at least a couple of days a week where you&#39;re not multi-tasking at your computer can make your lunch more enjoyable and more social. This could be planned out in advance, where you meet up with someone in another department who you don&#39;t get to see often, or it could be more informal with a team member who works right by you. If you&#39;d like to have a relaxed approach, simply ask someone if they want to join you when you&#39;re heading out the door or reheating your leftovers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecloud.adobe.com/discover/article/a-science-backed-guide-to-taking-truly-restful-breaks&quot;>;Social breaks can also effectively combat mental fatigue&lt;/a>; in the mid-afternoon slump and help you feel refreshed for the final work stretch before you&#39;re done for the day. When you notice your eye lids drooping and your head bobbing, stand up and get moving. If you&#39;re in the office, this is an excellent time to walk the halls and connect with a few people or invite someone to grab a cup of coffee. Similar to lunch, you can stop by to chat with members of your own team or drop in on a different department. The movement and conversation will wake you up and serve as a time of connection and potentially internal networking. If you&#39;re working remotely, send a friendly Slack message to a colleague, rather than turning to scroll social media. Even if they&#39;re too busy to respond, they may offer to catch up with you later.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make Calls During Your Commute &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you commute into the office or travel for business, some of your travel times could offer an ideal opportunity to catch up in an informal manner with colleagues. One of my clients who was an executive with a packed meeting schedule used his drive home to reach out and have informal conversations with his leaders. This helped him get a more personal view on their thoughts and concerns, as the company was going through a major transition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re on the road, you can call from airports, Ubers, or hotels or send messages when you&#39;re waiting in lines or on trains. Even a five- to 10-minute conversation can increase your rapport and, most importantly, show that you care.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Take Advantage of Virtual Messaging &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re working exclusively remotely, the options for informal social connection will be limited. In these cases, you can simply send a quick chat message or text asking how someone is doing or share a quick update with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These conversations can end up taking a lot of time if you&#39;re not conscious of how long they go, so you&#39;ll want to limit how frequently you engage in purely social messaging. But reaching out a few times a week can be fun and help you feel connected. Consider pinging people at natural times when you would have said “Hello!” to coworkers in the past, such as when you first get to your desk, around lunch, or when you&#39;re waiting for a meeting to start.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be a challenge to find time to talk with people when you barely feel like you have time for completing tasks and projects. But there are benefits to connecting with your coworkers. Rather than keeping your head down and focusing only on work, find those pockets of time in your schedule where you can thoughtfully connect with colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 28 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Steps to Prepare Your Culture for AI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/3-steps-to-prepare-your-culture-for-ai]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_28_1468369205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;gremlin/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The platform shift to AI is well underway. And while it holds the promise of transforming work and giving organizations a competitive advantage, realizing those benefits isn&amp;#8217;t possible without a culture that embraces curiosity, failure, and learning. Leaders are uniquely positioned to foster this culture within their organizations today in order to set their teams up for success in the future. When paired with the capabilities of AI, this kind of culture will unlock a better future of work for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-steps-to-prepare-your-culture-for-ai?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-steps-to-prepare-your-culture-for-ai?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As business leaders, today we find ourselves in a place that&#39;s all too familiar: the unfamiliar. Just as we steered our teams through the shift to remote and flexible work, we&#39;re now on the verge of another seismic shift: AI. And like the shift to flexible work, priming an organization to embrace AI will hinge first and foremost on culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pace and volume of work has increased exponentially, and we&#39;re all struggling under the weight of it. Leaders and employees are eager for AI to lift the burden. That&#39;s the key takeaway from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work&quot;>;2023 Work Trend Index&lt;/a>;, which surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries and analyzed trillions of aggregated productivity signals in Microsoft 365, along with labor market trends on LinkedIn.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly two-thirds of employees surveyed told us they don&#39;t have enough time or energy to do their job. The cause of this drain is something we identified in the report as digital debt: the influx of data, emails, and chats has outpaced our ability to keep up. Employees today spend nearly 60% of their time communicating, leaving only 40% of their time for creating and innovating. In a world where creativity is the new productivity, digital debt isn&#39;t just an inconvenience — it&#39;s a liability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI promises to address that liability by allowing employees to focus on the most meaningful work. Increasing productivity, streamlining repetitive tasks, and increasing employee well-being are the top three things leaders want from AI, according to our research. Notably, amid fears that AI will replace jobs, reducing headcount was last on the list.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Becoming an AI-powered organization will require us to work in entirely new ways. As leaders, there are three steps we can take today to get our cultures ready for an AI-powered future:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Choose curiosity over fear&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;AI marks a new interaction model between humans and computers. Until now, the way we&#39;ve interacted with computers has been similar to how we interact with a calculator: We ask a question or give directions, and the computer provides an answer. But with AI, the computer will be more like a copilot. We&#39;ll need to develop a new kind of chemistry together, learning when and how to ask questions and about the importance of fact-checking responses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fear is a natural reaction to change, so it&#39;s understandable for employees to feel some uncertainty about what AI will mean for their work. Our research found that while 49% of employees are concerned AI will replace their jobs, the promise of AI outweighs the threat: 70% of employees are more than willing to delegate to AI to lighten their workloads.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re rarely served by operating from a place of fear. By fostering a culture of curiosity, we can empower our people to understand how AI works, including its capabilities and its shortcomings. This understanding starts with firsthand experience. Encourage employees to put curiosity into action by experimenting (safely and securely) with new &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/reinventing-productivity/&quot;>;AI tools&lt;/a>;, such as AI-powered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&amp;amp;OCID=MY0291&amp;amp;q=Bing+AI&amp;amp;showconv=1&quot;>;search&lt;/a>;, intelligent writing assistance, or smart calendaring, to name just a few. Since every role and function will have different ways to use and benefit from AI, challenge them to rethink how AI could improve or transform processes as they get familiar with the tools. From there, employees can begin to unlock new ways of working.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Embrace failure&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;AI will change nearly every job, and nearly every work pattern can benefit from some degree of AI augmentation or automation. As leaders, now is the time to encourage our teams to bring creativity to reimagining work, adopting a test-and-learn strategy to find ways AI can best help meet the needs of the business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI won&#39;t get it right every time, but even when it&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s &lt;em>;usefully&lt;/em>; wrong. It moves you at least one step forward from a blank slate, so you can jump right into the critical thinking work of reviewing, editing, or augmenting. It will take time to learn these new patterns of work and identify which processes need to change and how. But if we create a culture where experimentation and learning are viewed as a prerequisite to progress, we&#39;ll get there much faster.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As leaders, we have a responsibility to create the right environment for failure so that our people are empowered to experiment to uncover how AI can fit into their workflows. In my experience, that includes celebrating wins as well as sharing lessons learned in order to help keep each other from wasting time learning the same lesson twice. Both formally and informally, carve out space for people to share knowledge — for example, by crowdsourcing a prompt guidebook within your department or making AI tips a standing agenda item in your monthly all-staff meetings. Operating with agility will be a foundational tenet of AI-powered organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Become a learn-it-all&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I often hear concerns that AI will be a crutch, offering shortcuts and workarounds that ultimately diminish innovation and engagement. In my mind, the potential for AI is so much bigger than that, and it will become a competitive advantage for those who use it thoughtfully. Those will become your most engaged and innovative employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The value you get from AI is only as good as what you put in. Simple questions will result in simple answers. But sophisticated, thought-provoking questions will result in more complex analysis and bigger ideas. The value will shift from employees who have all the right answers to employees who know how to ask the right questions. Organizations of the future will place a premium on analytical thinkers and problem-solvers who can effectively reason over AI-generated content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At Microsoft, we believe a learn-it-all mentality will get us much farther than a know-it-all one. And while the learning curve of using AI can be daunting, it&#39;s a muscle that has to be built over time — and that we should start strengthening today. When I talk to leaders about how to achieve this across their companies and teams, I tell them three things:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Establish guardrails to help people experiment safely and responsibly. Which tools do you encourage employees to use, and what data is — and isn&#39;t — appropriate to input. What guidelines do they need to follow around fact-checking, reviewing, and editing?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Learning to work with AI will need to be a continuous process, not a one-time training. Infuse learning opportunities into your rhythm of business and keep employees up to date with the latest resources. For example, one team might block off Friday afternoons for learning, while another has monthly “office hours” for AI Q&amp;amp;A and troubleshooting. And think beyond traditional courses or resources. How can peer-to-peer knowledge sharing, such as lunch and learns or a digital hotline, play a role so people can learn from each other?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Embrace the need for change management. Being intentional and programmatic will be crucial for successfully adopting AI. Identify goals and metrics for success, and select AI champions or pilot program leads to help bring the vision to life. Different functions and disciplines will have different needs and challenges when it comes to AI, but one shared need will be for structure and support as we all transition to a new way of working.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The platform shift to AI is well underway. And while it holds the promise of transforming work and giving organizations a competitive advantage, realizing those benefits isn&#39;t possible without a culture that embraces curiosity, failure, and learning. As leaders, we&#39;re uniquely positioned to foster this culture within our organizations today in order to set our teams up for success in the future. When paired with the capabilities of AI, this kind of culture will unlock a better future of work for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 28 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Commit to the LGBTQ+ Community When Hate Is on the Rise]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/commit-to-the-lgbtq-community-when-hate-is-on-the-rise]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_28_512010335_1421562884_1385767484_109438804_1148780239-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/william87/ MoMo Productions/FG Trade/David Arky/Yifei Fang/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;As a dramatic spike in anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment and legislation occurs in the United States and in other countries around the world, there&amp;#8217;sa growing disconnect between well-meaning executives and their constituents. Just as LGBTQ+ employees and communities, civil rights advocates, and socially conscious consumers are looking to employers to take action, many companies are walking back their previous support. However, a majority of consumers continue to expect that corporations maintain their commitment through action, and continue to reward companies that do so with their support and patronage. Amid a hostile social and political environment, companies must root their actions in their organization&amp;#8217;s purpose, value proposition, and values, to embed pro-LGBTQ+ support in their organization&amp;#8217;s identity for the long run. The author recommends three steps to do this: 1) Connect LGBTQ+ inclusion to your customer base, operations, and values; 2) Collaboratively design initiatives that benefit LGBTQ+ communities; and 3) Take a purposeful stand and defend it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/commit-to-the-lgbtq-community-when-hate-is-on-the-rise?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/commit-to-the-lgbtq-community-when-hate-is-on-the-rise?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;“This organization has long been an ally to the LGBTQ+ community,” an executive stated. “But lately, with the political climate the way it is, things that wouldn&#39;t have been controversial to do or say even five years ago are getting a lot more pushback than they used to. How do we show we care?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This organization says it&#39;s an ally to our community,” an employee said. “But lately, in the face of increasing hostility against LGBTQ+ people, we&#39;re at our breaking point, and our leaders are saying nothing. Why won&#39;t they defend us? Is it because they&#39;ve never cared?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a DEI strategist, I hear these kinds of comments often from people at the organizations I work with. They&#39;re not unusual. These sentiments represent the growing disconnect between well-meaning executives and LGBTQ+ employees, consumers, and communities as corporate involvement in LGBTQ+ causes has evolved. Consumers and workers are increasingly holding corporations to &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/06/were-entering-the-age-of-corporate-social-justice&quot;>;higher standards&lt;/a>;, making their patronage conditional on brands&#39; internal and external treatment of LGBTQ+ people aligning with their glossy marketing, and calling them out for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a43713768/rainbow-washing/&quot;>;rainbow-washing&lt;/a>; when they fail. At the same time, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://acleddata.com/2022/11/23/update-fact-sheet-anti-lgbt-mobilization-in-the-united-states/&quot;>;dramatic spike&lt;/a>; in anti-LGBTQ+ social and political movements, the passage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/may-anti-trans-legislative-risk-map&quot;>;regressive laws&lt;/a>;, hate speech, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/07/lgbtq-violence-protest-glendale-unified-school-district&quot;>;acts of physical violence&lt;/a>; in the US — alongside a related increase in right-wing extremism, authoritarianism, and anti-democratic beliefs around the world — has driven a new wave of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/online-right-wing-extremists-amp-up-anti-lgbtq-rhetoric-during-pride-month&quot;>;campaigns&lt;/a>; targeting LGBTQ+ communities and the brands and employers that support them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination of factors means that now, just as LGBTQ+ employees and communities, civil rights advocates, and socially conscious consumers are looking to employers to take action to support their previous pro-LGBTQ+ commitments, some employers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/05/04/anheuser-busch-ceo-disavows-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-ads/&quot;>;disavowing their LGBTQ+ partnerships&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/05/24/1177963864/target-pride-month-lgbtq-products-threats&quot;>;removing Pride-themed merchandise&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/06/23/starbucks-union-workers-are-striking-after-accusing-firm-of-banning-pride-decorations/?sh=371a510a511b&quot;>;forbidding Pride decorations&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders who worry that taking action to support LGBTQ+ communities is now “too risky” can take comfort in knowing that an overwhelming majority of consumers — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/consumers-say-companies-should-support-lgbtq-community-glaad-survey.html&quot;>;70%, according to a recent survey by GLAAD&lt;/a>; — expect them to take a clear stance on the side of civil rights, equity, and inclusion by supporting LGBTQ+ people. There are well-documented business benefits as well: A large majority of consumers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/workers-consumers-prefer-pro-lgbtq-brands-glaad-study.html&quot;>;whether or not they are LGBTQ+ themselves&lt;/a>;, are more likely to purchase from pro-LGBTQ+ companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite these clear benefits, leaders may still feel unsure how to future-proof their commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion in a hostile social and political environment. The answer lies in rooting their actions in their organization&#39;s purpose, value proposition, and values, to embed pro-LGBTQ+ support in their organization&#39;s identity for the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Connect LGBTQ+ inclusion to your customer base, operations, and values. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While most consumers now expect brands to take stances on social and political issues, it&#39;s not as easy as making a throwaway social media post or a blatantly profit-motivated marketing campaign. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/brands-creating-change/&quot;>;study looking into brand communication on social issues&lt;/a>; found that consumers find it most appropriate for brands to take a stance when it relates to the brand&#39;s values, impacts the business, or impacts the brand&#39;s employees or consumers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Future-proofing LGBTQ+ inclusion will require proactive effort to understand the needs of your LGBTQ+ constituents, as well as your non-LGBTQ+ customers and clients&#39; perspective on LGBTQ+ issues. You&#39;ll need to then understand how your operations impact LGBTQ+ communities to find the unique overlaps and opportunities to act. If you have LGBTQ+ customers, you might develop products that meet their needs. If you engage LGBTQ+ content creators or artists, you might tap into their talent for mutual benefit. If you have LGBTQ+ users or clients, you might solicit their feedback to develop a more inclusive product.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To lock these efforts in, you&#39;ll need to reframe them in terms of your organization&#39;s deeply held mission, purpose, and values. If your organization is deeply committed to dignity, you can frame LGBTQ+ inclusion as part and parcel to protecting the dignity of all your customers and employees. If your organization is deeply committed to bravery, you can frame LGBTQ+ inclusion as recognizing bravery against persecution and being brave enough yourselves as an organization to speak.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Put together, this means that organizations able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/people/social-responsibility/lgbt-inclusion.html&quot;>;articulate&lt;/a>; the place of LGBTQ+ inclusion explicitly as it relates to their core purpose, value proposition, and values will build a strong foundation for their efforts that is less likely to waver when the political winds shift.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Collaboratively design initiatives that benefit LGBTQ+ communities. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As ubiquitous as brands&#39; Pride Month campaigns have become, simply putting a product into the hands of an LGBTQ+ influencer and having them read a script doesn&#39;t particularly resonate with LGBTQ+ people. Done poorly, it can come across as a shallow publicity stunt to profit off the LGBTQ+ community without meaningfully benefiting it. In addition, when these initiatives appear to be disconnected from an organization&#39;s purpose or value proposition, your non-LGBTQ+ constituents can feel like your social stances are arbitrary — opening the door for those who might be prejudiced against LGBTQ+ people to criticize your stance as “telling them what to think.”&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem you can realistically solve is &lt;em>;not &lt;/em>;the range of beliefs held by consumers, employees, or other constituents, but rather the alignment of social cause, organizational purpose, and constituent needs. When initiatives or partnerships hit all three — say, a Pride Month initiative that was driven by customer demand and designed with customer input to address an unmet need related to the business&#39;s core service — even if constituents don&#39;t belong to the community directly centered, they are likely to support or at worst, feel neutral toward the initiative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opportunistic marketing ploys spitballed by a consultant during a 30-minute brainstorm are out. Designing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2022/10/11/how-to-promote-inclusion--virgin-atlantic-removes-gendered-uniforms/?sh=74cb1f3355dd&quot;>;successful initiatives&lt;/a>; in this vein requires deep collaboration with constituents both inside and outside the LGBTQ+ community to ensure that the initiative creates value for the target community, to align it with the organization&#39;s purpose and identity, and to test if it will land in the intended way with audiences. The more constituents can drive and inform this process — whether through advisory boards, focus groups, or other participatory methods — the more likely that the initiatives will successfully meet an unmet need, create value, and resonate.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Take a purposeful stand and defend it. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve homed in on the needs of the community and the opportunities available for your organization, take decisive and purposeful action with the full weight of your brand behind it. For every initiative and campaign you run, tell a story that illustrates and reinforces the connections between the social cause you&#39;re championing, your organization&#39;s purpose, and your constituent&#39;s needs. The goal is for any person familiar with your brand to say, “Of &lt;em>;course &lt;/em>;they would champion this cause.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What if your pro-LGBTQ+ initiative is targeted by detractors, whether through a boycott, social media campaign, or even in-person intimidation? Running through the steps of aligning your inclusion initiatives with your organization&#39;s purpose, value proposition, core values, and constituent needs isn&#39;t meant to prevent critique, but instead to prepare for it. Preparing in this way gives leaders everything they need to stand strong in the face of critique, and respond: “We designed this initiative in conversation with our global community of customers and employees and are confident that not only does it celebrate Pride Month, but also embodies our deeply held convictions and furthers our core mission. We&#39;re proud to be creating this impact and invite you to learn more about why this initiative matters to us. And while we invite respectful disagreement if you feel like we&#39;ve missed the mark, we won&#39;t tolerate harassment or violence against our team members or other customers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it&#39;s possible for organizations to still get things wrong and retract their initiatives with an apology. But if they do, it&#39;s because they made a mistake somewhere along the process of aligning with their purpose, value proposition, and values, understanding their constituents, and meeting their needs — not because they were pressured into it by threats of violence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use this approach as a litmus test. As the social landscape changes, the expectations facing brands, organizations, and leaders will change as well. Today&#39;s “best practice” may very well be ineffective or even counterproductive 10, five, or even one year from now. Your DEI, ESG, and other social-issue-related initiatives should adapt with the times, but the strength of your commitment should not. To preserve and strengthen the trust your employees, customers, and other constituents place in your organization, use this purpose- and value-driven approach as a litmus test to create, revisit, and revise your initiatives. In action, all it takes is answering these questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How does this issue impact our purpose for existing, and the constituents we serve?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How might a stance on this issue strengthen our purpose for existing, and benefit our constituents?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How do our constituents want us to act on this issue that centers our purpose and creates value for them?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;One consequence of answering these questions is that your organization &lt;em>;will not &lt;/em>;end up taking stances on every social issue, nor will it engage to the same degree on every cause or current event. It might even receive critique for its inaction in these cases. But when it does take a stance, it will be in strong alignment with its purpose, its value proposition, its values, and its employees, customers, and other constituents. When it acts, it will be with the full weight of its organizational identity and resources, without wavering even in the face of pushback.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This latest wave of anti-LGBTQ+ hostility is alarming, but if your organization holds steady to its purpose, operations, and the people it serves, you&#39;ll hold true to your commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion every month out of the year.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 28 Jun 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Does Your Company Have an India Strategy?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/does-your-company-have-an-india-strategy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_14_1336468982.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/anand purohit/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The price-to-book ratios of Indian subsidiaries of multinationals far exceeds those of their parent companies. That suggests the subsidiaries have better growth prospects, which makes sense given India&amp;#8217;s rapidly growing middle class. At this point, any multinational without an India strategy is missing out on a major opportunity for growth and profitability. But tailoring your strategy for India requires customizing your products and services and tapping into the &amp;#8220;India stack.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/does-your-company-have-an-india-strategy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/does-your-company-have-an-india-strategy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;At the end of financial year 2022, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio for the European consumer products giant Unilever PLC stood at six. The same number for its subsidiary in India, Hindustan Unilever, was twice that, at twelve. This difference is not because the Indian subsidiary is a young or small company — on the contrary, the Indian subsidiary is a 90-year-old company with a market cap of $76 billion. Nor is this an isolated instance.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nestle SA, the world&#39;s largest food and beverage company giant based out of Switzerland, has a P/B ratio of six, while its subsidiary in India has a whopping 82; 3M USA has a P/B of 4.2, its Indian subsidiary has a P/B of 12.7; the German parent of BASF, a global leader in speciality chemicals, has a P/B ratio of just one, its Indian subsidiary has four; the German parent of Siemens, a heavy industry leader, has a P/B ratio of two, its Indian subsidiary has ten. These differences are so vast that in some cases the Indian subsidiary may be valued more than the parent on a standalone basis. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Why is there such a chasm in P/Bs of parent companies and their Indian subsidiaries? Because Indian firms have better growth prospects, higher profitability, and more efficient asset utilization, all the while when the parent languishes in its home market. That&#39;s why every multinational must have an India strategy, or else it will miss out on one of the most promising market opportunities in the world today.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559731&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;P/B ratio represents how a company&#39;s assets are priced by the markets. It is higher for companies with better growth prospects (measured by revenue growth), more profitable operations (measured by profits to sales ratio), more efficient utilization of assets (measured by sales to assets ratio), and lower cost of capital. Lower cost of capital could not be the reason for higher P/B ratios for Indian subsidiaries. A company&#39;s cost of capital is limited by its country&#39;s sovereign rating. India&#39;s credit rating at BBB- is much inferior to the AAA rating of USA, Germany, and Switzerland. So, it is unlikely that all else held equal, an Indian subsidiary has a lower cost of capital than its parent located in a G7 country. Therefore, its higher P/B ratio must be related to better profitability and/or growth prospects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559731&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Over the last five years, the Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in revenues for Unilever India was 9.6%, which is four times faster than that of 2.2% of Unilever parent. Note that parent&#39;s growth rate includes that of the Indian subsidiary, without which, its growth rate would be even lower. Turning to profitability, return on assets for the Indian subsidiary is 11% against 8% of the parent. What is surprising is that the higher profit margin for the Indian subsidiary, of 17%, against 13% of the parent. It is surprising because Unilever&#39;s products are priced cheaper in the India market, because of lower purchasing power of its target segment. Higher profits could be due to higher market concentration and pricing power, but that seems unlikely because of fierce competition from several sources including other multinationals such as Colgate, innovative local competitors like &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Patanjali Ayurved&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, and the availability of numerous cheaper alternatives addressing the same market, including from the informal sector.

Middle class is defined as Indian households earning between $6,700 to $40,000, measured in 2020 US Dollars, which adjusted for purchasing power parity, equates to $22,700 to $136,000 in the US.

Super metros such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, with populations exceeding 10 million each, are contributing to growth in another way.

No other country reaches even half of these numbers. Interesting, in 2030, the total consumption of US middle class is expected to be $4.7 trillion in purchasing power parity terms (in 2011 dollars), about the same as in 2015. The most astounding and consequential global growth in consumption of middle class will come from India, from $2.1 trillion in 2015 (less than half of US) to $10.7 trillion in 2030 (more than twice that of US), both in 2011 dollars. China is expected to become the world&#39;s largest middle class, with a consumption of $14.3 trillion. Another growth center will be Indonesia, which is expected to become the fourth largest middle-class consumption center after China, India, and US.

In mid-2023 we&amp;#8217;re far from a settled state &amp;#8212; projected GDP growth in western markets is depressingly flat, inflation is proving to be rather stubborn, and those disruptions just keep on coming.

New channels, new technologies, and new capabilities demanded new levels of investment. But the good times couldn&#39;t last forever, and the pandemic ushered in a new, more austere era as budgets flatlined. This placed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing&quot;>;chief marketing officers (CMOs)&lt;/a>; under pressure to reduce spending on previously sacrosanct parts of their portfolio, such as marketing technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/495785/1158365?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBCMOSPENDSURVEY&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;Gartner&#39;s annual survey&lt;/a>; of hundreds of CMOs charts the evolution of marketing spending over recent history, offering guidance for how enterprise leaders can deliver results and build the capabilities to fuel growth in a time of less.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Nobody Got Fired for Spending on More Digital and Tech&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When did you first become &lt;em>;digital&lt;/em>;? I got my first job with the word “digital” in the title 20 years ago, which I guess makes me something of a digital marketing veteran. Back then I spent almost as long building business cases as I did activating campaigns. It&#39;s easy to forget, but making the switch from offline to digital in the mid-2000s was far from a no-brainer. Digital marketing leaders were always hungry for &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; — more budget, more technology, more data, more people, more attention from the leadership team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed this was the start of the period of more. Digitization hit marketing hard, and the possibilities to engage, connect, and transact with consumers and customers created a massive opportunity. It also created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/leadership-vision-chief-marketing-officer?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_CMOVISION2022&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;challenge for CMOs,&lt;/a>; who struggled to balance the budget demands of their plucky digital marketing leaders alongside non-digital leaders. And the former presented a compelling argument: We constantly extolled the virtues of digital as &lt;em>;the&lt;/em>; cost effective, measurable, and optimizable choice. By contrast, anything offline seemed stuffy, old-fashioned, and, well, analogue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Nobody Got Fired for Spending (Even More) on Digital and Tech&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The period of more lasted for quite a long time. Digital is a hungry beast after all, with a seemingly unending array of alluring tools, tech, talent, and channels. I became a marketing analyst back in early 2016 — a time when martech and digital channels accounted for a serious chunk of total marketing budgets. At that time, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/495785/1158365?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBCMOSPENDSURVEY&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey&lt;/a>; reported average enterprise marketing budgets at a whopping 12.1% of company revenue. More than a quarter of the total marketing budget was allocated to technology in 2016, and each of the top three channels ranked by spend were digital.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While 2016 may have represented a high watermark in terms of total marketing budget, it certainly wasn&#39;t an outlier — indeed, technology spend as a proportion of total marketing budgets peaked at almost a third (29.2%) of marketing budgets in 2018. And marketing budgets averaged an impressive 11.2% of company revenue between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Less, But Still More&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When we surveyed CMOs in early 2020, before pandemic lockdowns, CMOs couldn&#39;t have anticipated the full scale of the Covid-19&#39;s impact: demolished marketing budgets and disrupted customer journeys. But the pandemic also presented another boost for digital and technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/digital-iq-index-genius-brands?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_GENIUSBRANDSEBOOK&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;Brands&lt;/a>; that previously lagged their peers now had little choice but to switch to digital channels to engage and transact with locked-down audiences. Brands that had already invested heavily in digital had little choice but to further accelerate investments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, even when there was less, there was more. More e-commerce, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/multichannel-marketing-survey?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_MULTICHANNELMKTG&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;more digital channels&lt;/a>;, and more tech. When we surveyed CMOs in 2020, they reported that they were more likely to protect their investments in tech than other elements of the resource mix, such as paid media or agencies, as they believed tech would be an essential tool to help them grow post-pandemic — when we hit the “new normal.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Long Post-Covid Climb-Back&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Like a carrot dangling on the end of a stick, the “new normal” has been frustratingly out of reach over the last few years. The World Health Organization may have declared the end of the Covid-19 global health emergency, but we&#39;re still pretty far from normal. From the recent failures of major banks to the volatility of various social media platforms, these issues weigh on the minds of the entire C-suite, regardless of their level of exposure to their impact. This seemingly unending set of disruptions result in a number of anchors on growth for the enterprise:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Higher interest rates &lt;/strong>;impacting the ROI potential of new investments. In the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/recession-playbook-marketing-leaders?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_GMLRECESSIONPLAYBOOK&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;macroeconomic environment&lt;/a>;, investors are prioritizing profits and cash flow today rather than holding out for future growth. Higher interest rates are also weakening demand in the economy, dulling growth.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;A stubbornly difficult talent market&lt;/strong>; with higher rates of staff turnover, increasing competition for strategically important roles, reduced employee trust in management, and tensions regarding hybrid and remote working.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Lagging digital transformation&lt;/strong>;, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-19-gartner-says-89-percent-of-board-directors-say-digital-is-embedded-in-all-business-growth-strategies&quot;>;2023 Gartner Board of Directors Survey&lt;/a>; reporting that 81% of boards have not made progress toward or achieved their digital business transformation goals. Furthermore, a 2022 Gartner survey found that 67% of CFOs believe the last three years&#39; digital spending has not met enterprise expectations.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;While it&#39;s convenient to frame recent enterprise history in pre- and post-pandemic terms, another inflection point may also have occurred. Enterprises have pivoted from a period of concentrated investment in the tools and capabilities that support digitally led growth to an era when these investments need to start paying back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When technology investments and digital marketing are no longer cool and different, they&#39;re &lt;em>;mainstream&lt;/em>;. In Gartner speak, such investments have shifted from being the &lt;em>;system of innovation&lt;/em>; — transformative, disruptive, and largely unproven — to being the &lt;em>;system of record&lt;/em>; — where the prevailing strategic force is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/455982/1074604?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGOPERATIONS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;operational efficiency&lt;/a>;, and the enterprise expects predictability, reliability, and stability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;We&#39;re (Not) Going to Need a Bigger Boat&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;That brings us to 2023. Data from Gartner&#39;s annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey published in late May suggests that the era of more has come to an end. Firstly (and most obviously), it reveals that the marketing budgets of the 400+ North American and European CMOs we surveyed have not recovered to their pre-Covid peaks. In fact, gains reported in 2022&#39;s survey have slipped, with average budgets down from 9.5% of company revenue in 2022 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-22-gartner-survey-reveals-71-percent-of-cmos-believe-they-lack-sufficient-budget-to-fully-execute-their-strategy-in-2023&quot;>;9.1% in 2023&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps more worrying than the top-level budget trend is an apparent squeeze on marketing&#39;s spending power. Increasing costs (of talent and digital media) and decreasing yield (of marketing technology utilization rates) has created a marketing cost-of-living crisis akin to that experienced by consumers in many markets over the last 18 months. Simply put, each marketing dollar buys less. So, in very real terms, we&#39;ve switched from the era of more to the era of less.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial and psychological impact of the era of less can be heard loud and clear in the responses to this year&#39;s survey. More than 70% of respondents report that their enterprise lacks sufficient budget or resources to successfully deliver its marketing strategy in 2023. Seventy-five percent of respondents state that their enterprise is asking them to do more with less, and 86% report that they&#39;re under pressure to make significant changes to how marketing works to achieve sustainable results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most surprising findings from this year&#39;s survey relate to the enterprise growing impatient with technology investments. Three-quarters of respondents reported that they&#39;re facing pressure from the enterprise to cut investments in martech — unthinkable just a few years ago. What&#39;s more: The seemingly inexorable rise of digital media has stalled. When we look at the proportion of media spend allocated to digital versus offline channels, it&#39;s fallen one percentage point to 55% in 2023. In 2023 it&#39;s entirely possible to get fired for spending more on digital and tech. To misquote the classic 1975 film &lt;em>;Jaws&lt;/em>;: We&#39;re not going to need a bigger boat; we&#39;re going to need a more efficient one.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Adapting to the Era of Less&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;On the subject of classic &#39;70s cinema, Francis Ford Copolla famously said of his 1979 magnum opus &lt;em>;Apocalypse Now&lt;/em>;, “There were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.” This is not to say that CMOs have experienced the sort of excess Copolla is speaking of, but he does refer to one of the major challenges of more: Sometimes more can actually deliver less. Or, to flip this around, sometimes you can get more from less.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But delivering more with less is one of those terrible clichés — easy to say and significantly harder to achieve. It&#39;s challenging because more is the go-to state for most enterprise leaders. In the thousands of conversations I&#39;ve had with CMOs and marketing leaders over the years, a reasonable chunk entails a variation on the theme of “How can I build a business case to grow my marketing budget?” Another reasonable chunk? “How do I define the stuff I can afford to cut and the stuff I can&#39;t afford to lose?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answers to these fundamental questions cannot be found in shiny new technologies; rather, it&#39;s the strategic version of eating your greens. As a leader you need to have a firm plan that defines the scope of marketing and be painfully clear about how the function&#39;s scope ladders up to enterprise goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, your plan must be grounded in both the near-term actions that will deliver the leads and sales that keep the lights on today, alongside the investments that will contribute toward differentiation and growth tomorrow. This requires a nuanced story setting out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/three-techniques-to-prove-the-value-of-marketing?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_PROVEMKTGVALUE2023&quot;>;marketing&#39;s value &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/three-techniques-to-prove-the-value-of-marketing?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_PROVEMKTGVALUE2023&quot;>;proposition&lt;/a>; to the enterprise — how marketing delivers &lt;em>;return on objectives&lt;/em>; alongside &lt;em>;return on investment&lt;/em>;. And it requires an acceptance that the job of building this value story is not about econometric models or attribution analysis; these are a means to an end, not the end itself. It&#39;s about coming to a mutual understanding with stakeholders of how marketing delivers value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also about embracing and exploring the uncertainty that abounds and using the core strategic tools of scenario planning and sensitivity analysis to understand the prevailing issues that are material to success, enabling your team to develop strategic options that respond appropriately.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By returning to the first principles of sound strategic management, marketers will create a plan that rids them of the extraneous stuff, enabling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487268/1142263?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGSYMTAKEAWAYS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;focus on the right &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487268/1142263?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGSYMTAKEAWAYS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;&lt;em>;less&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that&#39;s most likely to support the delivery of goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To frame this in a slightly different way, at Gartner we talk about how CMOs can free themselves from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-22-gartner-says-catalytic-marketing-allows-cmos-to-drive-profitable-growth-amid-macroeconomic-pressures&quot;>;tyranny of more&lt;/a>; by focusing on three key leadership traits:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Clarity.&lt;/strong>; Choicefulness matters. CMOs must make clear-eyed decisions on what will — and will not — be supported over the life of the strategy. Equal thought and consideration should be given to the initiatives that don&#39;t make the cut, and to clarity on why that&#39;s the case.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Courage. &lt;/strong>;Leaders must have the courage to ask difficult questions of their team. It identifies spurious assumptions, strategic sentimentality, and harmful cultural norms. For example, CMOs must dispel the sunk-cost bias of “just because we&#39;ve spent $100,000 on a program, it doesn&#39;t mean we should spend $100,000 more.” Similarly, CMOs must battle historic assumptions of value: Just because an investment made sense three years ago, it doesn&#39;t mean that the business case just rolls over year-on-year. All major investments should be able to justify themselves based on measurable contribution to &lt;em>;future &lt;/em>;goals, not those in the past.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Connection.&lt;/strong>; Success is almost always a collaborative endeavor. The start of successful collaboration is communication and understanding. CMOs must collaborate with CFOs, CSOs, CIOs, et al., with a clearly defined and shared understanding of how marketing&#39;s programs deliver against business objectives. Likewise, they must have an understanding of where marketing intersects with other functions in the value-creation process. Ditch the obscure metrics and three-letter acronyms so beloved of marketing. Translate brand speak into business speak to demystify marketing and increase connection.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Wait, But What About AI?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You may be asking “surely AI changes everything?” Perhaps the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/how-should-cmos-respond-to-chatgpt-today?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_YOY_GML_NPP_PR1_RECHATGPT&quot;>;transformative power of AI&lt;/a>; will usher in a new era of digital investment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reality is complicated for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, AI isn&#39;t particularly new to marketing — it&#39;s been there, hiding in your tech stack (and the tech stacks of your partners and agencies) for years. Second, while the promises of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487667/1143179?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGGENERATIVEAI&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;generative AI&lt;/a>; amp up interest and enthusiasm, this is all happening at a time when utilization rates of technology have plummeted. Gartner&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/marketing-technology-survey-2022?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_MARTECHSURVEY22&amp;amp;utm_term=gi&quot;>;2022 Marketing Technology Survey&lt;/a>; reported that the utilization rate of martech is only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-03-gartner-survey-finds-marketers-utilize-just-42-percent-of-their-martech-stack-capabilities&quot;>;42%&lt;/a>;. So, for every dollar you spend on martech, you&#39;re utilizing less than half of the investment. Given marketing technology has consistently accounted for more than a quarter of the total marketing budget, this level of yield is more than a technology risk — it&#39;s a fiscal risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This level of fiscal risk doesn&#39;t prevent CMOs from looking at new technology solutions. But it should make them think really hard before plunging headfirst into new commitments.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Will There Ever be More &lt;em>;More&lt;/em>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The general rule of enterprise finance is that marketing budgets drop like a stone at the first sign of trouble and rise like a feather once the environment is more settled. In mid-2023 we&#39;re far from a settled state — projected GDP growth in western markets is depressingly flat, inflation is proving to be rather stubborn, and those disruptions just keep on coming. It&#39;s tough to see a significant increase in marketing budgets in the near term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the picture is somewhat mixed. Averages mask variances, and budgets differ significantly across industries and geographies. If you&#39;re a CMO marketing consumer goods, the chances are that your budget in 2023 is much healthier than your counterparts in financial services. And if you&#39;re based in Germany, the chances are that your budget is less healthy than your UK–based colleagues&#39;. However, across all industries and markets we surveyed in 2023, budgets lag pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What of 2024? Predicting the future has always been a fool&#39;s errand. Perhaps we will again see another era of more as new technologies, experiences, and channels open up brave new opportunities for marketing. And perhaps we&#39;ll have learned valuable lessons from the era of less that will make marketing lean and efficient, even with increased funding. Perhaps.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
