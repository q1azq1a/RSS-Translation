&lt;span>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;>;支付透明度使您能够了解有关可能性的信息。但是，当薪资范围特别大时，您应该如何为自己谈判呢？在本文中，作者分享了两位专家对薪酬和谈判的见解。他们建议不要关注“公平”； &lt;/span>;在陈述你的理由时，&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;>;将对话重点放在你和雇主的共同利益上。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;从理论上讲，拥有更多信息来衡量您的价值应该会给您带来更多的薪资优势谈判。但现实情况很复杂。公司可能不太愿意偏离设定的范围，而你可能会因为担心看起来不合理而犹豫是否推动。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;在这个薪酬透明法的新时代，您应该如何处理薪酬对话？当薪酬范围特别大时，为自己辩护的最佳方式是什么？是直接的好还是微妙的好？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;缺点是它可能会导致求职者&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;过度关注薪资&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;，而不是&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/negotiating-your-next-job&quot;>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;就业机会大图&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;，根据&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Victoria Medvec，西北大学凯洛格管理学院教授，​​《&lt;/span>;》一书的作者&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Negotiate-without-Fear -Strategies-Maximize/dp/1119719097&quot;>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;毫无恐惧地谈判&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400；&quot;>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“你的工资是其中的一部分，但工作的其他方面也需要考虑，比如你的角色、责任、福利和灵活性，”她说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这里有一些提示，可以帮助您引导对话并获得应有的报酬。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;span style=&quot;font- Weight: 400;&quot;>;y&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;您现在拥有优势，因为您知道什么是可能的。” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;虽然有些薪资范围可能看起来太宽而无用，但它们强调了谈判的力量，她说。 “&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这个范围的存在是因为&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;谈判是雇员和雇主之间的动态互动，并且&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;有些人做得更有效。” &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;毕竟，她说，这不是&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/how-women-can-get-what-they -want-in-a-negotiation&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;只是愿意要求更多&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; &quot;>;，这还在于拥有足够的信息和自信来阐述自己的观点。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;不要固执己见不要被吓倒或气馁——即使某个数字感觉遥不可及，&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Buckmaster 补充道。例如，如果您的年薪为 70,000 美元，而您获得了一份类似的工作，其薪资范围为 100,000 美元至 150,000 美元，您可能会觉得自己无法要求该范围的最高薪水。但事实是，你现在的薪水与另一家公司愿意付给你的薪水几乎没有关系，他说：“你以前赚的钱&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;并不重要.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;进行研究。&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;您的目标是在谈判中客观、现实地了解雇主如何看待你的市场价值。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这需要做一些功课来弄清楚你可能在公司公布的薪酬中处于什么位置&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;条带：位于顶部、中间或靠近底部。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“在薪酬透明度法律存在之前，人们可能会认为人力资源部门一直在向飞镖靶随机投掷飞镖来确定人们得到什么付了钱，但数字背后有严格的要求，”巴克马斯特说。他说，列出的范围背后隐藏着一个候选人看不到的“批准矩阵”。 “每家公司都有一个触发点，需要额外的批准才能证明将某人置于最高级别是合理的。” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;D&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;不要灰心；相反，使用&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/work-speak-the-right-way-to-negotiate&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;知识来做出为您自己提供令人信服的案例&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;。访问 j&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;求职搜索网站和数据库，例如 Glassdoor、Ladders 和 Salary.com，并与招聘人员和行业同事交谈。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;仔细审视您的经验和资历，并诚实地讲述您的工作经历。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“评估您的实际工作水平和过去的职责范围。不再强调标题。在初创公司担任董事与在大公司担任董事不同。”Buckmaster 说道。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;要了解整个流程。&lt;/b>; &lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;很多，但不是全部&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/15-rules-for-negotiating-a- job-offer&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;薪资谈判在公司发出录用通知后进行&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 。但巴克马斯特表示，如果你认为你的薪资应该处于该范围的高端，那么你可以考虑在此过程中尽早表明你的薪资期望。他建议说这样的话：“我期待看到这份工作机会，并相信我在你们薪酬范围内的起始职位将与我在 XYZ 公司从事这项工作的丰富经验相一致。” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;一旦公司提出报价，谈判获得更多报价的机会通常非常有限，因此巴克马斯特建议明智地提出自己的理由。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“不要多次返回，否则可能会影响你的声誉，”他说。 “你不想给人留下难以共事的印象。”让你的论点简洁、清晰、合理。 “大多数公司不想与每个进来的人进行定制的、复杂的谈判。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;陈述你的情况......&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;谈判更高的薪水需要清楚地阐明为什么你更有价值。 Medvec 建议&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;专注于您的&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;优势：您的背景、技能和特殊能力符合公司的需求。您已&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/5-ways-to-stand-out-in-your-next-job-interview&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;已经概述了您过去在招聘过程中取得的成就&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;课程。现在是时候谈谈您未来将如何增加价值 - 以及这应如何反映在您的薪酬中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Medvec 建议列出如何帮助公司创造新的收入来源、削减成本、吸引人才或进入新领域市场。 “谈谈你的确切角色和职责，包括你具体要做什么，”她说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;明确如何&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/to-land-a-great-job-talk-about-why-you -love-your-work&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;您将应对他们的挑战&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;她说，这会让你处于更有利的地位。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;请记住批准矩阵，巴克马斯特补充道。 “&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;帮助招聘人员在内部讲述你的故事，”他说。 “通过围绕业务的坚实论据，让他们的工作变得更轻松。否则他们将很难获得批准。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;...如果您的目标非常高，请拿出您的最佳表现。&lt;/b>; &lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;虽然可以&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;协商高于规定的薪酬范围，但您的情况必须是防弹的。巴克马斯特表示，许多公司对大约 5% 的员工薪酬超过最高限额感到满意。薪酬等级并不是一门精确的科学，“有时人们会破坏系统并最终获得更高的薪水，”他说。发生这种情况的原因有很多。也许新员工正在加入一家较小的公司，或者他们的经理更像是一个同事，或者新员工可能正在担任专门的角色，或者他们可能知道公司需要的深奥编码语言。 “也可能是因为他们具有独特的天赋而很难得到，”他说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;不过有一点警告：如果你的工资超过了最高限额，你将来可能没有资格加薪，所以一定要询问一下公司的政策。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;对于高级职位，&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Medvec&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-权重：400；&quot;>;建议与公司所在城市的就业律师预约半小时。 “不仅要了解其他人要多少钱，还要了解他们的合同中有哪些内容，例如股票、股权和就业保障，”她说。 “这将是一个昂贵的 30 分钟，但对于高级职位来说是值得的。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;不要关注“公平”，而应该关注共同利益。 &lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;P&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;制定透明度法是为了帮助确保公平的报酬，但围绕公平进行个人谈判并不是一个好主意，&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;根据 Medvec 的说法。 “不要根据什么是正确或什么是公平来创造理由，”她说。相反，“参考其他人的收入信息来确定你的要求，但将谈话重点放在雇主的利益上。” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;例如，Medvec 建议这样说：“我从公开信​​息中得知，该职位的薪酬高达 190,000 美元。我相信我处于该薪酬范围的顶端，因为我在从事 XYZ 工作方面拥有独特的优势，而且我对自己能带来的成果充满信心。但当我实现对您来说重要的目标时，我也很乐意获得 160,000 美元的基本工资和 50,000 美元的年度奖金。” &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这样，您就可以做出对您和组织都有利的战略妥协。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;原则记住&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;执行&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;欣赏您新发现的优势。薪酬透明度使您能够了解可能发生的事情。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;腾出时间做功课，这样你就可以为你想要的薪水提出强有力的论据。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li >; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;确保招聘人员能够通过从业务角度阐述你的论点，向决策者讲述你的故事。&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;b>;不要&lt;/b>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;即使感觉某个数字遥不可及，也要怀疑自己。如果您认为自己值得，请提出有力、理性的理由。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;痛斥公平或正确的事情； &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;相反，应将对话重点放在您和雇主的共同利益上。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;2002年，印度政府推出了无处不在的国际旅游业这场运动被称为“不可思议的印度”。如果今天发起类似的活动，不妨称之为“不可避免的印度”。不仅是印度国内的狂热分子，还有全球分析师齐声宣称印度是下一个经济大国：高盛预测印度将成为&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages /how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy.html&quot;>;到 2075 年成为世界第二大经济体，&lt;/a>; 以及&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft .com/content/c9de715e-2e29-4a7f-880b-1509c04bf11b&quot;>;《金融时报》的 Martin Wolf 表示&lt;/a>;，到 2050 年，其购买力将比美国高 30%&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们有以前也经历过类似的印度乐观主义浪潮。但即使是最热心的印度拥护者，实际的现实仍然让他们感到沮丧。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/28/india-revolutions-economy-growth-future/&quot;>;大胆预测&lt;/a>;它将超越中国（一个经济体）仍比印度大五倍），麦肯锡 2007 年&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/asia-pacific/the-bird-of-gold&quot;>;“金鸟”&lt;/印度消费者的承诺从未完全兑现，到放松管制、随之而来的政策逆转和与印度做生意的信心危机，再到大流行的毁灭性时期，该国承诺的不可避免的崛起仍然难以捉摸。现在有什么不同？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;印度商业生态系统的不同方面汇聚了一些积极的趋势：需求、供应和全系统的促进因素；结合起来，它们可以超越经济周期、宏观冲击和政策逆转。有些是新的，而较旧的已经达到临界质量，它们最终可以相互加强，创建一个&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html&quot;>;增长飞轮&lt;/一个>;。但与所有飞轮一样，重要的是要对嘎嘎声和燃烧气味保持警惕，而在印度，这些声音大量存在。企业和政府领导人都必须在飞轮损坏之前予以关注并采取行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;需求&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;三股力量正在需求侧汇聚，为印度的经济增长提供动力。&lt;/p>; >; &lt;h3>;消费繁荣&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;任何有关印度承诺的讨论的出发点始终是印度消费者的承诺。印度拥有 14 亿人口和无数未满足的需求，其增长速度&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy .html&quot;>;主要由国内消费和投资驱动&lt;/a>;。实际工资预计将增长 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/apac-salary-asia-leads-2023-real-wage-growth-jumps-in-india-china .html&quot;>;4.6%&lt;/a>;，而可支配收入将继续增长超过&lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/india/disposable-personal-venue&quot;>;15%&lt;/a>; 。在西方成熟的行业在印度正在快速增长：例如，私人健康保险几乎统计数据/&quot;>;2015 年至 2021 年期间增长了两倍&lt;/a>;，而耐用消费品预计将在 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crisil.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2022/09 之间增长/volume-vault-to-lift-consumer-durables-revenue-15-18-percent.html&quot;>;今年分别为 15% 和 18%&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;适合具体情况的创新&lt;/h3 >; &lt;p>;国际公司一直在努力了解印度“中产阶级”的构成并制定适当的价值主张。而&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/middle-class-nearly-1/3rd-of-indias-population-to-be-2/3rds-by-2047- report/articleshow/95239621.cms&quot;>;一些分析师&lt;/a>;认为，三分之一的印度人是“中产阶级”，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021 /03/18/in-the-pandemic-indias-middle-class-shrink-and-poverty-spreads-while-china-sees-smaller-changes/&quot;>;6600万&lt;/a>;是真正的“中等收入”全球标准，而巨大的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/18/in-the-pandemic-indias-middle-class-shrinks-and-poverty-spreads -而-china-sees-smaller-changes/&quot;>;11.6亿&lt;/a>;属于低收入。然而，第二类人中的许多人构成了一个巨大的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/be53790c-ea16-4e5c-9410-bac189fb2636&quot;>;有抱负的消费阶层&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这有很多含义。一方面，在印度竞争意味着以低得多的价格销售，这反过来又需要以竞争对手难以模仿的方式重新配置活动、生产和供应链。印度最畅销的汽车是 Wagon R，售价 7,000 美元，由日本铃木公司制造，该公司&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/31/business/corporate- business/suzuki-india-market-share/&quot;>;印度 41% 的市场份额&lt;/a>;在全球汽车行业中是一个异常值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.firstpost.com/entertainment/explained-why-netflix-is-failing-big-time-in-india-10580421.html&quot;>;Netflix 通过在该国的挫折而发现&lt;/a>;，它需要的不仅仅是低价格在印度取胜。本地化内容、使用多种印度语言以及利用印度消费者想要的产品之间的协同效应（就像亚马逊或迪士尼所做的那样）至关重要。在一个截然不同的领域，麦当劳整合了素食选择、印度小吃和多代家庭菜单，构建了切合实际的价值主张。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那些能够破解印度消费者密码的人将获得丰厚的回报：许多麦当劳在印度的特许经营商都是亿万富翁。家用电器制造商 Havells 推出了一系列“适合印度”的产品，例如净水器和无压缩机空气冷却器，这些产品既满足印度消费者的需求，又满足印度消费者的承受能力。自上市30年来，&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/havells-india-ltd/stocks/companyid-10507.cms&quot;>;Havells&lt;/a>;利润增长了826倍，市值暴涨5800倍。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“亚洲奇迹”就是在利用这一趋势的基础上建立起来的：日本于 1964 年进入这一最佳点，韩国于 1967 年，中国于 1994 年进入这一最佳点。印度还拥有世界上最多的说英语的 STEM 毕业生。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;获得金融服务&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;印度的金融市场状况比以往任何时候都好。随着中国机遇的降温，投资者需要替代方案，而印度是最接近的。相比之下，MSCI 印度指数今年上涨了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/india-investing-china-stocks-growth-exports-demgraphics-31252a80&quot;>;12%&lt;/a>;

&lt;p>;这种变化甚至在传统上资金不足的非正规部门也能看到，该部门占非正规部门的 86% 以上。印度的劳动力。印度领先的投资银行 Avendus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avendus.com/crypted_pdf_path/msme-lending-report-formattedvf-img-642a719b97ccc-.pdf&quot;>;计算&lt;/a>;，印度小中型企业部门的债务总需求为1.5万亿美元。其中，有 7,250 亿美元因缺乏抵押品而无法解决，而正规信贷只能提供约 2,890 亿美元。这激励贷方深化其产品。小企业贷款机构的新信贷客户比例从 2017 年的 9% 上升了 34%。小企业贷款机构的贷款在过去两年中每年猛增 43%。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;基础设施升级，无论是物理和数字&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;任何访问过印度的人都会印象深刻的一个关键障碍是其落后的基础设施。从历史上看，&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9483756.stm&quot;>;投资施舍&lt;/a>;在政治上可能更为有利，但现任政府的受欢迎程度赋予它&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/modi-should-focus-on-people-not-just-big-projects/2023/02/06/ceb85dc4-a66b-11ed- b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html&quot;>;基础设施投资有更大的余地&lt;/a>;。资本支出占政府总支出的百分比已从 2010 年的 11% 增加到今年预计的 22%。今年的基础设施支出将增长 33%，达到 1,220 亿美元。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;作为由此产生的变化的指标，印度有 &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/ india-tops-world-ranking-in-digital- payments-beats-china-by-huge-margin-report/articleshow/100944643.cms&quot;>;在数字支付方面以巨大优势击败中国，位居榜首&lt;/a>;。有趣的是，印度的支付量超过了紧随其后的四个主要国家的数字支付总和。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;许多其他改革，例如建筑许可和电力连接，是州政府的职责范围，这些层面上也有变革的动力。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/11/how-indias-states-compete-for-investment&quot;>;各州政府正在通过帮助加快进程来参与竞争&lt;/a>;设立企业，提供投资激励，甚至吸引竞争企业集群，从而在全国更多地区创造更加有利于营商的环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;地缘政治最佳点&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;另一次转型is a more distinctive geopolitical positioning for India, triggered, most significantly, by the growing rift between China and Western economies, particularly the US This is translating into new business opportunities for India, most visibly — the &lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65784719&quot;>;manufacturing of Apple&#39;s smartphones&lt;/a>;. With a goal of producing 20 million iPhones a year, 50,000 new jobs will be created by one such project alone. In addition, when it comes to military-grade technology used for space launches, there is greater confidence in India as a host than China and there is already a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/business/india-space-startups.html&quot;>;thriving ecosystem&lt;/a>; in place. India has hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_satellites_launched_by_India&quot;>;111 international space launches&lt;/a>; since 2020, and successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/science/india-moon-landing-photos.html&quot;>;landed a rover on the moon&lt;/a>; in late August.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To consider another prominent example, chipmaker, Micron Technology, &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-new-semiconductor-assembly-and-test-facility&quot;>;announced&lt;/a>; plans to build a new assembly and test facility, as part of moves to diversify beyond China. In fact, the new president of the World Bank has suggested that there is a narrow window for India to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-should-cash-china-plus-one-strategy-world-bank-chief-2023-07-19/#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20many%20companies,World%20Bank%20chief%20last%20month.&quot;>;“cash in”&lt;/a>; on the growing trend behind companies seeking to diversify their supply chain and manufacturing beyond a massive dependence on China.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Diaspora dividend&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It is interesting to note that both the CEO of Micron Technology and the World Bank chief are Indian-born, which brings us to the third key facilitator: the Indian diaspora, now the world&#39;s largest and influential in ways that it had never been before. In the business world alone it is telling that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2023/06/12/indias-diaspora-is-bigger-and-more-influential-than-any-in-history&quot;>;25 of S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a>; company CEOs are Indian-born. Beyond this, senior management ranks of numerous companies are populated by Indians. It&#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.economictimes.com/tech/startups/indians-are-driving-the-us-startup-story-nfap-study/india-is-the-leading-country-of-origin-for-immigrant-founders-of-us-unicorns/slideshow/93165270.cms&quot;>;leading country of origin&lt;/a>; for immigrant founders of US unicorns. These connections help build global connectivity to Indian business and facilitate India&#39;s integration into global value chains.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Barriers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While these factors reinforce each other, many barriers remain – and they could cause the multiplier effect to stall. Consider three major bumps in the road and the actions needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unbalanced growth&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Despite impressive growth numbers at the national level, the economic benefits have been highly unequal. The top 10% of Indians hold &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfam.org/en/india-extreme-inequality-numbers&quot;>;77%&lt;/a>; of the national wealth. Almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfam.org/en/india-extreme-inequality-numbers&quot;>;2 people every second&lt;/a>; are pushed into poverty because of health care costs alone. India&#39;s population density — amongst the highest in the world — exacerbates the zero-sum nature of resource allocation and environmental stresses. Regional imbalances — southern and western India growing 12% faster than northern and eastern India — will magnify over time. Superimpose on this linguistic fault-lines, new inter-regional tensions could surface. Handling these will require deft management of the political economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other imbalances are growing because of divisive politics. An increasingly assertive form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-this-side-ganesh-devy-putting-the-useless-to-use-the-divisive-politics-of-the-word-hindutva/article67045226.ece&quot;>;Hindutva ideology&lt;/a>; is overshadowing core issues such as job-creation, enhancing productivity and shared economic benefits. The root cause of this problem was a belief in large sections of society that what started as affirmative action projects in a newly independent India should have had sunset clauses leading to discontent over minority appeasement by political leaders. The pendulum has now swung in the other direction creating new challenges of exclusion and identity politics. For many India-watchers it hasn&#39;t helped that India has declined in its position on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rsf.org/en/index&quot;>;World Press Freedom Index&lt;/a>;. Consequently, potentially, bottled-up sentiments in large sections of the disaffected and minority segments of the population can explode, triggering a downward spiral. Such developments can undermine objectives of shared prosperity. For international investors and trade partners, this can add a risk premium of majoritarianism in a country with as much religious, linguistic and socio-cultural diversity as India. More significantly, these developments exhaust political capital, which can otherwise be leveraged for social and economic transformation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are at least two solutions to these challenges. One is of political parties moving away from identity politics to inclusive growth and job-creation as the most reliable means of winning over the widest swath of the country&#39;s vast population. Two, India sees a constant flow of state-level elections, which distorts public dialogue by skewing it away from longer-term economic growth-oriented perspectives. Streamlining and bunching elections will give breathing space to public discourse and push political leadership and voters toward longer-term horizons.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unrealized demographic potential&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/india/despite-world-beating-growth-indias-lack-jobs-threatens-its-young-2023-05-30/&quot;>;Less than half&lt;/a>; of urban workers have full-time jobs, while far too much of India&#39;s employment is in under-productive informal sectors. Education, skill-building, and health care are grossly inadequate. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://do3n1uzkew47z.cloudfront.net/siteassets/pdf/ISR_Report_2023.pdf&quot;>;India Skills Report 2023&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;found only half of young Indians are employable. Even the “crown jewels” technology services sector is vulnerable; demand for outsourcing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/ai-why-india-risks-falling-behind-in-the-tech-race/d8236bc2-16bb-11ee-9de3-ba1fa29e9bec_story.html&quot;>;falling&lt;/a>; and the labor-cost arbitrage model will be disrupted by secular shifts towards cloud computing and AI for coding and routine functions. Alarmingly, India&#39;s female labor participation rate has been in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?locations=IN&quot;>;steady decline&lt;/a>;, having dropped from 32% in 2005 to 19% in 2021.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emulating, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rmresults.com/a-spotlight-on-vietnams-transformation-in-education&quot;>;Vietnam&lt;/a>;, public and private investment in upskilling must be prioritized, which could add &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/india-youth-lack-skills/a-56879385&quot;>;$570 billion&lt;/a>; to the Indian economy. A major handicap has been manufacturing — a key jobs creator in comparable economies — which has plateaued at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/india-must-abandon-protectionism&quot;>;13.3% of GDP&lt;/a>;. The current infrastructure thrust, policy reforms, geopolitical drivers and capital influx could help unlock Indian manufacturing, but the barriers discussed here must be removed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In emerging sectors, the surge of potential in AI could be an opportunity for India to take leadership in a cutting-edge area, given the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/50-global-hubs-for-top-ai-talent&quot;>;emergent AI talent hubs&lt;/a>; in the country that can be massively expanded, paired with the &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/which-countries-are-leading-the-data-economy&quot;>;vast pools of data&lt;/a>; that accumulate in India. Cultural and organizational changes are needed to create on-ramps for women in the workforce and retain them. Such projects have long gestation periods, so a focused and disciplined long-term plan is required.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unrealized ease-of-business and innovation potential&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Doing business in India has improved, but many challenges remain. Land acquisition can stall construction projects and the courts are slow-moving institutions. Land records may be non-existing or outdated and environmental clearances have created additional barriers. On top of this, contract enforcement remains challenging. According to an index created by The Economist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/02/the-2023-crony-capitalism-index&quot;>;India ranks 10th&lt;/a>; in the prevalence of crony capitalism, in spite of the large-scale liberalization of the past three decades. A legacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/india-must-abandon-protectionism&quot;>;protectionism&lt;/a>; still persists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India&#39;s state capacity needs change. Contrary to popular perception, the Indian state is not big and bungling, but weak and waning. Institutions — from regulators to civic bodies to the judiciary — often juggle conflicting demands and are playing catch-up to market and social realities. Many important decisions are made with a crisis as a frame of reference and India&#39;s story of victories is often of individual heroism amidst institutional failure. Making India&#39;s state machinery cutting-edge may well be India&#39;s pivotal project.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In sum, while barriers remain, the positive forces can, indeed, create a domino effect: “Inevitable India” is within reach. India&#39;s greatest challenge will be to make its inevitability tangible and believable to the many constituencies that wish to see India succeed. To get from “Incredible India” — aimed at tourists — to now bring the global economy to its door, India next campaign ought to be “Credible India.”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[AI and the New Digital Cold War]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_02_792DVvbiBBo-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Globalization is not dead, but it is changing. The United States and China are creating two separate spheres for technology, and artificial intelligence is on the front lines of this new &amp;#8220;Digital Cold War.&amp;#8221; If democracies want to succeed in this new era of &amp;#8220;re-globalization&amp;#8221; they will need to coordinate across governments and between the private and public sectors. AI is coming, whether we like it or not. We are at a fork in the road and all segments of society will need to pitch in to build AI systems that contribute to a just and democratic future where humans can thrive.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;We are entering a new world order, one marked by increased nationalism and greater geopolitical competition. While countries are not going to undo all of the global economic systems that took shape under American unipolarity for the past three decades, certain critical sectors will become decoupled in a process we have previously referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/geopolitics-are-changing-venture-capital-must-too&quot;>;“re-globalization.”&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most significantly, the technology ecosystem will be split largely into two spheres dictated by the world&#39;s two economic powerhouses, the United States and China. Other states will need to decide which sphere they want to be part of, putting pressure on the United States and China to outpace the other and establish their technological dominance. Unfolding before us is a heightened form of economic competition we understand as the “Digital Cold War.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Digital Cold War will be an economic war, with technological innovations increasingly determining geopolitical prowess. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its capacity to rapidly and radically transform society, will be the most decisive technology in this arena. AI feeds on information, and its most powerful use cases will emerge through its applications across public and private sectors. For the democratic world to pull ahead, companies and countries need to adopt a new approach that prioritizes collaboration and transformation over competition and disruption.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A New Era of Democratic Coordination&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Everywhere we are seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/dealbook/globalization-fink-marks.html&quot;>;claims&lt;/a>; that “globalization is dead.” Such declarations are fundamentally misguided. The system we are moving toward is more complicated than a reversion of global interconnection. In many cases, trade is simply being rerouted rather than shut down. Most commercial industries will remain open and global, but certain critical sectors will turn inward, toward localized supply chains.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend began not with the United States and its policies but rather with Xi Jinping and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latest_releases/2015/05/19/content_281475110703534.htm&quot;>;2015 Made in China plan&lt;/a>;, which made clear that the Chinese government had begun prioritizing national resilience over market efficiency. Xi laid out a plan to outcompete the United States and other global powers in the commanding areas of the economy, most of all high technology. Indeed, China continues to march towards its goal of 70% self-sufficiency in critical technology by 2025. Since then, the United States has responded with its own series of ambitious measures to retain technological supremacy. This reality leads us into a bipolar high technology future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to AI — arguably the most decisive technology in this global contestation — we are heading toward two hermetically sealed ecosystems: one that supports open systems but is also associated with democracy, privacy, and individual rights, versus one that supports state control, information-flow restriction, and politically imposed limits on openness. As much as we might hope that China&#39;s political model will evolve and that its technology will be subject to democratic feedback, we should not be naïve: That is not the trajectory that it is on. For a future to prevail that prizes openness and individual rights, democratic nations need to be market leaders in AI. The only way to ensure this is by promoting international collaboration, especially between democracies and other defenders of the rules-based order.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the previous era, the United States could innovate on a technology and other countries would simply adopt it. When American technology leaders made groundbreaking advancements with personal computers and the internet, they operated under the assumption that American companies could work in isolation and spread their technologies across the world in a top-down fashion. The cloud revolution amplified this further, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google owning 65% of the global market for cloud computing. This strategy may have worked when technologies were intended for pure disruption. AI, however, is geared for societal transformation. This requires a new kind of collaboration across stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along with computing capabilities, the power of AI is based on the amount of aggregated data that is fed to it. This means that the United States, or any country, working in isolation with restricted data flows will fail to maximize the potential of its technology — and yet data localization policies &lt;a href=&quot;https://itif.org/publications/2021/07/19/how-barriers-cross-border-data-flows-are-spreading-globally-what-they-cost/&quot;>;doubled worldwide&lt;/a>; from 2017 to 2021, further obstructing cross-border collaboration. The summation of human knowledge and capabilities is not siloed in any one country or culture. Even Wikipedia&#39;s knowledge base is only 11% in the English language. For AI to thrive in its ability to help us solve our hardest problems, we have to unlock the world&#39;s capacity — from French nuclear scientists to Korean philosophers, from Indian researchers to Kenyan artists, and indeed to Chinese researchers who choose to leave China and work and live in the West.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus, the capital requirements for investments in the sector are so large at present that very few national markets are big enough to succeed with AI on their own. For example, consider investment in semiconductors — a key input into AI progress. The UK&#39;s recently announced 100 million GBP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/initial-100-million-for-expert-taskforce-to-help-uk-build-and-adopt-next-generation-of-safe-ai&quot;>;AI plan&lt;/a>; and 1 billion GBP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-1-billion-strategy-for-uks-semiconductor-sector&quot;>;semiconductor investment&lt;/a>; pale in comparison to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-approves-280-billion-bill-to-boost-us-science-chip-production-11658942295&quot;>;US&#39;s&lt;/a>; $280 billion and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/eu-enacts-43-billion-chips-act-in-bid-to-boost-production&quot;>;EU&#39;s&lt;/a>; 43 billion EUR chips packages — and even these packages are constrained compared to the scale of the investment required to fully develop these technologies. Certainly, few investors globally can support fundraising rounds for startups like the one-year-old Inflection AI&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/inflection-ai-raises-13-bln-funding-microsoft-others-2023-06-29/&quot;>;$1.3 billion round&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the center of this all, a disjointed approach with various patchworks of regulatory frameworks across the West will harm any ability to compete and win against Chinese AI systems. It is not just a function of population, but a function of data points. Chinese society,&amp;nbsp;with a population more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-population-of-china-compared-with-the-rest-of-the-world/&quot;>;four times larger&lt;/a>; than the US&#39;s, &amp;nbsp;has become so digitized with data freely shared between its government and domestic technology champions. Soon their models, based largely on American and foreign research, can leapfrog the capabilities of those in the West.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With its size, centralized government, and inroads in other countries, China has the potential to develop one comprehensive AI model that outcompetes the multiplicity of models coming out of democratic nations if there is no international coordination. While the United States is still the AI leader — with the companies that are doing the most cutting-edge research — and while AI seems to have a bias toward open systems with unfettered access to information, the United States risks losing its edge if it fails to coalesce around a uniform strategy with other democratic nations. If this were to happen, Chinese companies could bring their technology to Western markets, influencing democratic politics and signaling to the world China&#39;s economic dominance — and its broader colonization of digital infrastructure around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI is becoming an increasingly critical part of this global infrastructure, and the West must act swiftly and in a unified fashion to ensure the technology remains open and democratically controlled. To develop the most powerful AI models across sectors, the United States will need to collaborate with other allied countries — to name a few, India, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and European nations — by adopting data-sharing policies and encouraging the co-creation of technological innovations. Much can be gleaned from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.european-data-governance-act.com/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20European%20Data,of%20EU%20citizens%20and%20businesses.&quot;>;European Data Governance Act&lt;/a>; approved by the EU in 2022, which facilitates data-sharing across member countries to maximize benefits for its citizens and businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Failure to course correct will severely limit the impact of AI. For models tackling climate change, siloed data is an immediate death sentence. Medical and healthcare data and innovations are not limited to any one country, nor any one research institution. Industrial AI powering global supply chains cannot be effective without the constant flow of interconnected data. In consumer applications, varying copyright frameworks would stymie cultural relevance and influence, favoring those with free access to data over others. Moreover, piecemeal data regulation and sovereignty requirements raise compliance costs and complexity, harming the innovation economy&#39;s ability to succeed.&amp;nbsp;This is not to suggest that governments should abstain from regulating AI, but rather that they should work together to establish uniform standards and practices across countries. Coordination among democratic nations will empower each country to individually feel resilient when it comes to AI, but also elevate the West as a bloc to be the leader in AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Responsible Innovation for AI Transformation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In addition to collaborating across states, if Western companies want to become true market leaders, they will also need to collaborate within states, namely with governmental institutions and civil society. While most of the current discourse surrounding AI focuses on large language models and other generative capabilities, AI&#39;s most significant long-term impacts will come from the ways in which it transforms industries and society as a whole. And genuine transformation cannot come about if private actors are disconnected from the wider society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Already we are seeing AI&#39;s transformative potential beginning to take shape. AI has the capacity to massively level the playing field for who has access to information and insights. In the classroom, AI can give&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/30/tech/ai-industry-statement-extinction-risk-warning/index.html&quot;>;recent attention&lt;/a>; has fixated on the existential threat AI could pose to humanity in the somewhat distant future. But AI is also destabilizing democratic systems in the here and now, providing new avenues for mis- and dis-information through sophisticated bots and realistic deep-fakes. AI will also throw into question the value of democracy itself. What happens when authoritarian systems, augmented by AI, can outperform their democratic counterparts, for instance by massively reducing crime with expanded surveillance? Or by providing vastly better healthcare because of access to centralized information with no restrictions for privacy? Undemocratic alternatives will only become more tempting as AI develops, and these possibilities are not too far off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are at a fork in the road when it comes to AI. We can go down the path that leads to automation and destruction, replacing human work and meaning, or we can go down the path that leads to copiloting and enablement, making us more productive, helping us live more balanced lives, and becoming greater masters of our craft. Unlike the social media revolution, which, if regulators really wanted to, they could have slowed or redirected, the AI revolution can only charge forward. Unlike previous &lt;em>;platform&lt;/em>; revolutions, this is a &lt;em>;technological&lt;/em>; revolution, and its mantle has already been picked up by stakeholders across society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most successful companies will be those that embrace this forward-looking vision and build to endure, by centering a core set of values that align with society and abide by self-regulatory mechanisms. Taking the further step of partnering with the public sector and incumbent ecosystems is also crucial. We cannot risk AI going awry and putting democracies off track in this competitive race. Since the impacts of AI will be felt across every sector of society, accounting for broad stakeholder interests is both a moral responsibility and the only way to bring about sustainable transformation. In the age of AI, companies will need to pursue an agenda of responsible innovation, working outside of the usual technological silos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To win the Digital Cold War, the United States and its allies must be the market leaders in AI. And to build the best AI companies, they need to prioritize international collaboration and engender a new mindset — one that aims to innovate responsibly and unleash human potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;网络对于正在进行工作和职业转型的高级管理人员至关重要，但很难找到如何最好地进行工作和职业转型的建议。管理流程。在这篇文章中，作者“他们拥有数十年在过渡时期与高管合作的经验——找出高管经常遇到的六个网络障碍，并提供如何克服这些障碍的指导。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot; /2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-challenges-of- networking-as-an-executive?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在线查看数千篇有关工作网络挑战的文章，您就会发现发现他们中的 100% 都针对相对初级的专业人士如何“向上”建立人际网络提出了建议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但令人惊讶的是，对于高级管理人员来说，提供的建议却很少，他们经历着不同但同样具有挑战性的人脉障碍。这是一个问题，因为了解如何获得网络的全部好处对于金字塔顶端的人来说至关重要，尤其是在首席执行官更替率很高的时候&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/04/27 /ceo-turnover-high-pandemic/&quot;>;创历史新高&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们拥有数十年与正在做出职业转变的高级管理人员合作和研究的经验。在本文中，我们将找出他们在职业网络方面经常遇到的六个常见障碍，并且我们将提供一些如何克服这些障碍的指导。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1)不愿意寻求帮助&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为下一个角色建立人际网络意味着寻求帮助。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597897927461&quot;>;社会心理学研究&lt;/a>;表明，地位高的人更容易感受到维护形象的压力力量和能力以及重视自力更生，所有这些都会使他们不愿意寻求帮助。他们害怕遭到拒绝，并担心寻求帮助可能会暴露自己的弱点，从而可能损害他们的地位、地位或声誉。这是自我驱动的不情愿，我们经常看到这种情况。正如赫米尼亚的一位学生所说，“我提供帮助 - 我不会要求帮助。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决这种趋势的一种自然方法是通过伸出援手来开始你的人际网络过程。低风险（和低收益）的联系人——理想情况下，是你熟悉的高管，他们自己建立了人际网络，不仅可以分享他们如何向他人寻求帮助，还可以分享他们从寻求帮助中得到的结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你可能可以与比你想象的更多的人一起做这件事：正如斯坦福大学社会心理学家赵宣所发现的那样，人们经常&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/ 10.1177/09567976221097615?journalCode=pssa&quot;>;低估&lt;/a>;其他人提供帮助的意愿，因为他们没有意识到其他人这样做会多么高兴。低风险的热身和排练——斯皮什称之为“听到可怕的话语从你嘴里说出来”——将帮助你调整你的信息，化解你的情绪，并体验成功。拥有一些积极的经历将使您以后处理更具挑战性的电话和电子邮件变得更加容易。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2) &amp;nbsp;优先考虑保密&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;高管的级别越高，他们就越有可能想要保密，尤其是在他们被解雇的情况下。例如，斯皮什的一位客户问道：“我如何进入市场而不让市场知道我在寻找？我想接触人们，但我不想让他们知道我有兴趣寻找。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种担忧限制了你与他人的接触，这本身就是一个问题正确的。但它们也会迫使你在从事人际网络和职业转变时保持秘密——根据赫米尼亚的研究，这个过程往往比人们预期的要长得多。长期背负的保密负担可能会造成重大的心理损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;限制与他人的接触可能会特别有害，因为它会阻止您退后一步并广泛探索您真正想要的东西接下来做。不管你怎样努力，你都不会通过混淆视听来愚弄人们。在高层，这是一个很小的世界：与你交谈的人可以通过致电他们自己网络中的消息来源，或者可能只是通过在线搜索来了解你在做什么。如果你确实成功地隐瞒了你的故事，那么你可能会感到紧张并花费大量精力才能得到与诚实、直接地说出相同的结果。除了极少数例外，诚实是最好的策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3) &amp;nbsp;不切实际的期望&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;因为他们不愿意寻求帮助并且不寻求帮助为了让消息传出他们正在市场上寻找新职位，高级管理人员通常希望快速完成他们的网络工作。或者他们只是认为因为自己资历较深，所以这个过程不会花费很长时间。不幸的是，你的职位越高，你可能需要更多的时间来寻找和调整合适的人选。根据 Spish 的经验，最短的搜索大约需要 3 个月，最长的可能需要 18 个月。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有效的网络不仅需要很长时间，而且涉及大量的工作。 、耐力、效率和耐心。造成这种情况的主要原因有三个。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，正如我们两人都发现的那样，只有一小部分正在寻找下一个职位的人确切地知道他们想为哪几家公司工作。因为他们对市场或他们真正想要的东西了解不够，无法进行有针对性的搜索，所以他们必须从研究和非常普遍的探索性网络开始。这一切都需要时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，你想要的和最适合的东西可能实际上并不适合你。我们都见过高素质和经验丰富的人花了非常长的时间才能找到他们的下一个角色。赫米尼亚最近观察到的一位高管认为，鉴于他过去的经验，他将是一家大公司董事会审计委员会的理想候选人，但随着选择标准转变为包括更大的多样性第三，当今大多数公司都有复杂、耗时且不可预测的审查流程，这通常会在招聘流程的最后阶段增加几个月的时间.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在高级管理人员就业市场上，认识到在混乱的供求关系中你几乎没有控制权是有帮助的。一个很好的主动策略可以帮助你在建立人际网络时弥补这一点，那就是在你的日历中安排一些刺激的、并行的活动（社区工作、无偿咨询、短期建议、兼职教学），在这些活动中你可以有更多的时间。立竿见影的效果，并得到更令人满意的回应。这弥补了寻求和等待帮助的乏味（如果不是负担的话）。它还为饱受打击的自我提供积极的（如果是临时的）身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4) 不想投入工作&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;习惯于拥有事物的高管为他们做的事情常常不愿花时间去做他们无法委托的繁琐工作。但要成功建立人际网络，您需要将这项任务视为完全值得您投入时间和精力的任务，而且您需要有条不紊、井井有条。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了帮助实现这一点，Spish 开发了一个人际网络流程，其中包括识别并联系三种联系人：信息提供者、开门者和决策者。信息提供者是指能够告诉您有关市场、公司和招聘趋势的人；他们可以帮助你变得聪明并克服对社交的恐惧。开门人通常是你过去共事过的人。他们反应敏捷，并且因为他们了解您和您的工作风格，所以他们愿意为您提供担保，并可以将您介绍给决策者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您想使用此流程，最好的开始方法是首先列出所有雇主、客户和顾客的清单，然后写下您在这些职位上遇到的人的名字。您可能会发现自己很容易就能想出 100 个名字。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论您使用什么方法来组织、定位和细分搜索，您始终需要先生成一长串您想要的人员名单。我与他们合作，然后有条不紊地遵循一个系统来联系他们。因为这是一个学习过程，所以你无法提前计划好一切；您最好采取“滚雪球”的方法，即询问每个联系人您还应该会见谁。如果您正在寻找您不熟悉的市场，则尤其如此。在这种情况下，您需要在斯皮什所说的“云下山谷”中建立人际网络。这些山谷里有很多机会，但它们不熟悉，需要探索。如果你不去探索它们，你的选择就会受到限制，并且可能会损害你的职业发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个高成本、高收益的游戏，但它会带来回报。 Spish 发现，一旦您联系了列表中的 50 个或更多联系人，网络就会开始联系您，此时您可以让该流程引导您继续前进。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong >;5) 过度关注“叙述”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一旦建立了联系，重要的问题就是要说什么。很多时候，高管们在社交对话中大部分时间都在闲聊共同的联系人或经历，直到对话结束才切入主题（他们需要一份新工作）。当他们觉得需要隐瞒正在发生的事情的现实时（例如，他们与老板相处不好，或者他们被解雇了），这种情况尤其常见。当这种情况发生时，他们通常已经处于守势，他们说话闪烁其词，他们把精力投入到保护自己的公众形象上，而不是尽其所能地学习。最终结果是他们浪费了自己以及他们的联系人的大量时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个没有成效的策略是花费 80% 的时间试图解释为什么你不高兴，或者离开，或者被解雇——这是一种消极的方式，让你的谈话停留在过去，而实际上谈话应该是积极的并着眼于未来。如果您花 20% 的分配时间来解释您的情况，然后将剩余的 80% 的时间集中在您正在寻找的内容上，效果会更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;网络对话的最佳做法是直接、简洁，并且积极。人们想知道你为什么打电话给他们以及你想从他们那里得到什么，他们的级别越高，他们就越有可能期待这样的简短执行摘要：“这就是为什么我打电话给他们你。这就是我想要你做的。我希望这两点足以让我们进行 10 分钟的对话。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6) &amp;nbsp;未能定制你的故事&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;寻求转型的高管经常花费大量时间来完善一个脚本——即传说中的关于他们的“核心技能和能力”的“电梯推销”。他们这样做是假设这个脚本将使他们具有普遍的相关性，但几乎总是他们最终得到的结果并不能令人满意地满足接收者的需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们已经看到很多高管尝试这样做他们以与猎头合作的方式建立人际网络：他们写一封通用电子邮件，只需更改名称和一两句话，附上简历，然后发送给一群人。同样，许多人走进会议并机械地陈述他们的一分钟演讲，即使这不符合听众的独特情况和要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是行不通的。是的，弄清楚你的核心故事情节（我是谁，我为什么在这里？）很重要。但你不能假设你会对遇到的每个人说同样的话。您也不能假设每个听众都能够将您的推介转化为他们自己的业务环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，您需要记住以下几点：这与您无关。如果你希望获得一个真正适合你的职位，你需要弄清楚如何从谈论自己转变为深入地谈论公司及其问题，然后阐明你有多么充分的能力去胜任这个职位。解决这些问题。正如斯皮什所发现的，这就是你为自己创造机会的方式：他指导过的最高级管理人员中有很大一部分最终都担任了在他们谈话之前甚至不存在的角色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: center;&quot;>;* * *&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当您是一名高级管理人员时，建立人际网络是一项微妙、复杂且耗时的任务。如果不加以控制，自负和急躁会破坏你的成功。 The best approach is to think of networking as an opportunity not just to scout out your next role but also to strengthen or deepen relationships you already have — and, even better, to add new relationships that will help you be a better professional in your new job and the others that come after it.&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;但是，&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/02/when-a-vacation-reduces-stress-and-when-it-doesnt&quot;>;并非所有假期都如此正如我们所希望的那样，具有恢复力或活力。长期的工作压力会干扰我们的计划。一旦开始放松就生病的现象甚至有一个名字：&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.thriveglobal.com/the- Five-key-steps-to-take-to-avoid-leisure-疾病/&quot;>;休闲病&lt;/a>;&lt;u>;。&lt;/u>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;那么，当你回来工作时比离开时更疲惫时，你能做什么——尤其是当每个人都认为你很好的时候休息好了，迫不及待地想走了，但您感觉比以前更疲惫（或更疲惫）？您可以采取以下五个步骤在退货时刷新。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.盘点您的健康和精力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;除非您参加过恢复活力的健康静养，否则您可能已经偏离了健康的生活习惯，可能会跳过体育活动或发现自己的日程安排很满，而且有点沉迷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;返回后，评估并确认您的精力水平，盘点您的感受以确定您需要什么。研究发现，在以下领域优化您的能量有助于提高健康和绩效：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/insights/focus/behavioral-economics/sleep-benefits-impact -employee-performance.html&quot;>;睡眠&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/to-improve-your-work-performance-get-some-exercise&quot;>;运动&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201208/connect-thrive&quot;>;连接&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/why-you-should-tell -your-team-to-take-a-break-and-go-outside&quot;>;户外活动&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/to-cope-with-stress-try-learning-something -new&quot;>;放松&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbetechcouncil/2023/04/05/how-relational-energy-impacts-employee-engagement/?sh= 7a3861a047c2&quot;>;有意义&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/05/how-relational-energy-impacts-employee-engagement/?sh=7a3861a047c2&quot; >;敬业度&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先根据您当前在上述各个领域的精力水平，按照 1-10 的等级对自己进行评分。然后确定您希望在每个领域处于什么位置，以及您可以采取的一项行动来加强或改善您的健康的每个要素。一周内每天重新评估，跟踪当您重新养成更健康的习惯时您的能量如何变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.轻松恢复工作。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/what-to-do-on-your-first-day-back-from-vacation&quot;>;从当您在本应放松和享受休息时间的时候却因处理堆积如山的电子邮件和对话而感到不知所措或压力时，假期可能是一种具有挑战性的经历。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抵制在恢复正常之前，通过一天的过渡和恢复来一头投入工作的诱惑。您甚至可以考虑起草自动回复或 &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/ease-the-pain-of-returning-to-work-after-time-off#:~:text=Block%20off%20significant %20chunks%20of,something%20to%20look%20forward%20to.&amp;text=Stay%20in%20stealth%20mode。&quot;>;将 OOO 延长一两天&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在开始一整天的工作之前，为您的时间设置一些护栏，以便您有一个良好的开始。从重要且时间敏感的任务开始，给自己一个缓冲时间，以便赶上稍后可能出现的电子邮件和更新。在日历上留出时间来进行那些能让你充满活力的活动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.反思积极的一面；重新构建，并从消极中学习。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;事情可能不如你所希望的那样，你很容易感到不知所措或失望，但可能会有一些积极的记忆可以保留。花一些时间反思和品味这些经历，以及&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/the-mental-benefits-of-vacationing-somewhere-new&quot;>;获得的经验教训和见解&lt;/a>;。将它们记录在纸上，以便您可以与团队成员分享，并强化您休假期间的好处。如果这次旅行让您感觉一成不变，也许您可​​以在回家后恢复正常的事实中找到安慰。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4.使用全新开始效果来设定新的习惯和惯例&lt;/strong>;。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;全新开始效果是&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/research-explores-how-fresh-starts-affect- our-motivation-at-work&quot;>;与新的开始（例如生日、新年和其他里程碑）相关的行为改变越来越成功的现象&lt;/a>;。您可以通过利用重返工作岗位作为重置的机会来利用这种效应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;度假回来是建立新做法的好时机，以进一步增强您的精力和生产力，例如 &lt;a href= “/2023/05/to-improve-your-work-performance-get-some-exercise&quot;>;锻炼&lt;/a>;、关闭通知、阻止干扰或每晚写日记。寻找让你的日常生活充满活力的习惯和惯例。您可以利用&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive&quot;>;时间盒&lt;/a>;等做法来优化您的精力对你来说重要的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尝试过度补偿可能很诱人，但不要让悔恨驱动你的行为。而是考虑在您的日常生活中有效的惯例，以便您的习惯可以持续下去。确定您今天需要做什么才能&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/09/is-your-motivation-still-on-vacation&quot;>;回到正轨&lt;/a>;，排除悔恨，做您想做的事需要创造前进的动力。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5.明确您未来休假的需要。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;利用这次经历作为学习机会，为&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-take-a-vacation 奠定基础-改善您的健康&quot;>;未来的假期更加充实&lt;/a>;。确定有多少结构为您提供能量，而不是消耗您的能量。您想和谁共度时光以及您想旅行多远？您需要多少&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/set-these-5-boundaries-before-you-go-on-vacation&quot;>;与您的团队沟通&lt;/a>;才能满足您自己的福祉和联系需求？ &lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;衡量企业绩效与其业务战略密切相关。或者应该如此。但令人惊讶的是，正如我在很长一段时间内亲眼目睹的那样，所有部门的组织都在努力将其战略设计与其绩效衡量相匹配。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这非常重要，因为几乎不可能跟踪一个项目的成功。如果没有可靠的关键绩效指标 (KPI)，则制定业务策略。相反，糟糕的绩效衡量可能会导致战略目标的误导。两者都可能导致重复执行相同的失败决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这里，我探讨了管理者在衡量策略绩效时陷入的三个常见陷阱，并解释了如何避免它们。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1.不匹配的框架&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;罗杰是州政府主要道路部门的首席执行官。当他被任命时，他根据“地区”建立了他喜欢的战略框架。这些都有自己的缩写——KRA，关键结果领域。因此，他在节能、治理和材料采购等项目下组织了主要道路战略计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题在于，它与主要道路现有的绩效衡量框架不符，该框架是围绕诸如道路安全、道路效率和道路维护等项目。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种脱节造成了巨大的功能障碍，需要花费大量的管理时间和精力来让事情顺利进行。正如一位高管讽刺地指出的那样，“这就像试图将福特汽车的部件装进梅赛德斯奔驰汽车一样。他们就是不适合。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;如何解决这个问题：围绕主要利益相关者进行组织。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Marjorie 领导着一个照顾自闭症患者的非营利实体。当她加入该组织担任首席执行官时，她面临着她所说的“我们的战略规划框架与 KPI 的组合方式之间的脱节。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该组织的战略计划是围绕“关​​键问题”构建的。例如预算超支、获得补助金和雇用员工。 KPI 是从人力资源、会计和财务等各种来源以及运营（包括运营费用和举办的员工培训课程数量）中提取的指标的大杂烩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她的解决方案是重新调整战略和运营的重点。围绕&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/ Five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;组织的主要利益相关者&lt;/a>;的关键绩效指标。这些利益相关者包括自闭症患者及其家人、政府、捐助者和支持者，以及&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，就利益相关者工作人员而言，马乔里的组织希望围绕他们为自闭症患者及其家人提供的服务加强创新。这需要通过提高组织在就业条件方面的地位来吸引一流的临床医生。成功的指标之一是合格心理学家的工作申请数量增加。 “最后，”她说，“我们组织的战略计划和记分卡可以相互交流。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2。衡量活动&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;以下是我在研讨会上向经理小组说明这个问题的方式。我对他们说：“我建议通过测量我使用的幻灯片数量来衡量我今天的表现。如果一天结束时我真的很累，我就会知道我做得很好。你对这些作为我表现的衡量标准感到满意吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的观众总是说不。 “为什么？” I ask. “因为它们衡量的是活动，而不是结果，”他们说。 “谁决定这些结果？”我询问。 “我们愿意”，这是普遍的回应。在那一刻，我的观众“明白了”。我可以从他们的脸上看到这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;如何解决这个问题：关注结果。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Angelo 领导着一个知名建筑工具品牌的国家办事处。当谈到衡量他的业务绩效时，他解释说：“我们会聚在一起，专注于我们所做的事情。我们制定的 KPI 始终与流程有关。”他们通过关注他的组织为其主要利益相关者（客户、供应商、员工和母公司）产生的结果来打破这种执着。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;衡量这种绩效涉及一条双向的道路，结果是双向的 -为了企业和利益相关者。安吉洛和他的团队避免对利益相关者的结果做出假设。相反，他们采访了主要利益相关者，以了解对他们重要的结果是否已被确定。采访还揭示了 Angelo 和他的团队从未想到的新 KPI。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3.缺乏重点&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;塞巴斯蒂安是郊区议会的首席执行官。他希望制定一个与理事会战略计划相关的理事会绩效记分卡。于是，他收集了社区发展、环境与规划、企业服务等下属部门的措施，并制作了一份综合清单。这份清单很长，让他不满意。许多措施似乎与委员会的目标根本无关。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;如何解决这个问题：级联而不是合并你的指标。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Helen 是一个新上任的校长。大型、有声望且非常昂贵的私立女子学校。为了为学校制定记分卡，她收集了科学、英语和数学等学术部门的衡量标准。但是，与塞巴斯蒂安一样，这套综合 KPI 并不能衡量学校的绩效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她通过重新开始解决了这个问题。这一次，她没有从下到上合并衡量指标，而是以相反的顺序（从上到下）制定了 KPI。她说，这个过程“让我用一块石头杀死了两只鸟。它揭示了为学校设定的 KPI 中的差距，并提供了学校围绕学生、家长、教师和工作人员、政府和社区的战略计划之间的契合度……[它还]根据这些结果提供了有效的记分卡同一组。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海伦学到了绩效衡量的一个基本概念——分析水平。适用于某一级别（例如公司级别的利润）的衡量标准不适用于另一级别（例如人力资源等内部部门）。同样，适用于部门级别的措施并不适合公司级别。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;如果您没有在战略计划和 KPI 之间一致地应用框架，那么您的战略计划和 KPI 之间很容易出现差距 - 如果您遇到这种情况，那么您肯定不是唯一的人。然而，当您缩小差距时，请记住，衡量绩效从根本上讲是衡量您与&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/ Five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;组织的主要利益相关者的关系。&lt; /a>;&amp;nbsp; Your KPIs, therefore, need to be shaped by what those stakeholders expect from you and not by what you think you should be doing.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Harvard&rsquo;s Arthur C.

He&amp;#8217;s the co-author (with Oprah Winfrey) of the forthcoming book, &lt;em>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/em>;, and he joined HBR editor Adi Ignatius for this episode of New World of Work to share insights in how to be happier at work, and in life.

Brooks has a message for you: change your behavior before it&#39;s too late. Brooks was one of you: a pace-setting boss who expected others to work 80-hour weeks just like him, leaving little time for friends and family. He says he was addicted not to work, but to success. And he missed watching his kids grow up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today he classifies behavior like his as a pathology that can lead to misery. And he has concrete, actionable advice for increasing your life&#39;s happiness. In fact, he writes about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;in a regular column&lt;/a>; for &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Brooks, co-author (with Oprah Winfrey) of the forthcoming book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot;>;&lt;em>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s caused the severe dip in general happiness in the last few years?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The two traits of those who find true happiness in their work&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The difference between “deal friends” and “real friends”. The real kind are “beautifully useless” and you need them more than deal friends&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is contagious, Brooks says, and just being in a happy person&#39;s vicinity can make you happier.&amp;nbsp; “But,” he says, “even more contagious is misery.”&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Arthur, welcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New World of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Previous episodes&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New World of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Previous episodes &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C.

BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And the truth is that the book is based on a lot of the things I&#39;ve been teaching at the Harvard Business School, a class I teach called “Leadership and Happiness”, which is a very oversubscribed class. It has 180 in the seats, 400 on the waiting list, and there&#39;s even a secret Zoom link they think I don&#39;t know about. I&#39;m happy to talk about what I talk about with my students, with our wonderful viewers here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope a few of the students were just horrified to hear that you know about the Zoom link. But let&#39;s set some context. Start with some data. The numbers show that despite a thriving happiness industry, people like you who think about it think we&#39;re becoming less and less happy.&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot; name=&quot;The New World of Work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;follow-subscribe data-name=&quot;hbpnewworldofwork&quot; data-activity=&quot;newsletter&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div style=&quot;color: #000000&quot;>; &lt;svg>; &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;/resources/css/images/hbr-icons.svg#the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;&lt;/use>; &lt;/svg>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Subscribe to our Weekly Newsletter &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; The New World of Work &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; Candid conversations on talent, tech, and the future of business.

BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s true.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the US at least, the number of cases of depression are up, the number of people who self-report themselves to be happy is down. I know it&#39;s impossible to say exactly why, but what&#39;s your hunch? What&#39;s going on here?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We do have a pretty good idea of what&#39;s going on. You find that happiness started to go into a little bit of a malaise, a bit of a decline, in the late &#39;80s, early &#39;90s, but then it took a real big dip when social media came along.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media was catastrophic for happiness. Part of the reason is we distract ourselves when we&#39;re lonely with something that&#39;s the equivalent of burgers and fries for a social life. They give you lots of calories and not very much nutrition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a lot of neuroscience behind this, but everybody knows that when you&#39;re bored or you&#39;re lonely and you start looking at your devices and at your phone, you actually get more bored and you get more lonely. This is a huge problem, especially for young adults.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the coronavirus came along, and this was the most catastrophic event for public happiness that we&#39;ve seen in a long time worldwide. Ordinarily, about 30% of people would say they&#39;re very happy about their lives, and 15% would say they&#39;re not happy. The rest are in the middle. Those are flipped. Now it&#39;s about 30% who are not happy and 15% who are very happy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those trends have not actually turned around. We know that it has everything to do with social life. It has everything to do with our love relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We know the habits that bring the happiest life—your philosophical or your faith life, your family life, your real friendships, and work that serves others in person—these have been in decline. When those things go in decline, there&#39;s no tech that&#39;s going to solve the problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You do have your finger on it. I want to focus on the world of work. I think this is drawing from stats in the book, I think you say just 16% of employees self-report that they&#39;re very satisfied with their work. I want to ask about that because we&#39;re spending half our waking hours in the office, and yet we&#39;re not getting the kind of fulfillment and satisfaction that we deserve. So what&#39;s happening here and how can we think about moving the needle?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been studying what brings work satisfaction for the longest time, and when I first started off, I was a fresh PhD. I thought, well, let&#39;s see if for-profit versus nonprofit versus government work: which brings the most happiness? Turns out, that&#39;s insignificant. So I said, well, high salaries versus low salaries. Above a certain level of subsistence, it&#39;s a wash. College educated, not college educated, white collar, blue collar, none of it matters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two things show up on the happiest workers, the people who have the greatest happiness from work. They feel like they&#39;re earning their success, which is to say that they&#39;re creating value with their lives and with their work lives, that their accomplishments are moving the needle and they&#39;re being recognized for those accomplishments. And number two, they feel like they&#39;re serving people so that they&#39;re needed. These are the two big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of people are watching us right now who are employers, and I&#39;ve been a CEO too. The number one thing that you can do for recruitment, for retention, the ultimate rewards that go far beyond money are making sure that you have a system where people are earning their success through their merit and personal accomplishment. They know it, they see it, and so do their friends. And they actually feel like they&#39;re serving other people and they can see the faces of the people for whom they&#39;re creating value. These are the big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One more thing to keep in mind, those things are easiest to do when we&#39;re in person. That&#39;s just it. You said we spend half of our lives with our coworkers at work. Well, I don&#39;t know, man, not anymore. A lot of people are spending half of their lives in front of a Zoom screen where it&#39;s hard to earn your success, it&#39;s hard to feel like you&#39;re serving other people, and you don&#39;t even get to see your work buddies. That&#39;s tough stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re right, then there must be some self-deception here. If you ask people, they like hybrid. They like working from home. They talk about it giving them a better work-life balance, all of that we think would translate into fulfillment and happiness. But do you think we&#39;re fooling ourselves?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, there&#39;s a set of biases that are at play here. For example, one of the things we find is that when you&#39;re really lonely, it impairs the executive centers of your brain. We know this. This is the reason that when you&#39;re really sad and lonely, you cocoon on the couch with a comfortable blanket streaming Netflix and eating Haagen-Dazs. What you should do is get up and go outside and get some vitamin D and ride your bike and call your friends, but you&#39;re impaired at that particular moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the pandemic people started to become more isolated. They made the best of that isolation by creating lives that were very, very convenient, I have to say.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, some people do have a way better work-life balance because they want to spend all that time with their families. The problem is all of the people that are separated from their family and their friends and actually not seeing people at work, that&#39;s really catastrophic when it comes to happiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book in many ways is about agency: happiness and fulfillment are not based on external variables or things that happen to us, but all very much within our control. The problem is it&#39;s very hard to take dramatic actions to reorder one&#39;s life. How do you get people who understand they should be doing this, but who don&#39;t? How do you make that leap?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the problem is that a lot of people notice that they can manage their money and they can manage their company, but they can&#39;t manage their feelings. Or they can manage their home and they can manage their family life, but they can&#39;t manage their emotions. The reason is that emotional life is a different species of problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stuff around us in our work, these are complicated problems, meaning they&#39;re hard to figure out. But once you do, you can master them and repeat the solutions over and over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life and your emotions, the affairs of the heart and the feelings that you&#39;re getting, positive and negative, they&#39;re not complicated at all. They&#39;re what mathematicians would call a complex problem. That&#39;s a problem that&#39;s very easy to understand and that no amount of computational horsepower can solve it for you. You can only get in it and experience it and work with it in real time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cat is a complex problem. A toaster is a complicated problem. Your job is more like a toaster and your relationships are more like a cat. Your feelings are highly complex. The result is that I can master all these highly complicated things, but I can&#39;t get my mind around my feelings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution starts with understanding the science of human emotion. This is what I&#39;m doing in a lot of my work. This is when my HBS students come to me, these phenomenally talented and successful MBA students, really at the best business school in the world. And they&#39;ll say, “My biggest problem is I can&#39;t manage how I feel, and I feel like I&#39;m really out of control.” So the number one skill that we get is to treat your emotional system, the limbic system of your brain, like anything else that you would be managing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about it as a complex system that you&#39;re participating in, and using the techniques that we talk about in the class, which start with basically this idea of learning how to experience your emotions, not as they&#39;re delivered to you, but in the prefrontal cortex of your brain so that you can decide how to react, substitute emotions, and even disregard the emotions, but on purpose. That&#39;s a specific set of techniques called metacognition that I walk through based on cutting-edge neuroscience. Anybody can do it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is, we don&#39;t teach kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach school kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach business people to do this. If I had my way, every business school and every high school would have this class, and when you came to work for a big company, they would have a class in metacognition and emotional self-management that you have to go through for the first week in orientation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I assume these business students are, as you said, incredibly successful by any measure. There&#39;s probably a split, but do you find they crave what you&#39;re teaching or that they come in skeptical of what you&#39;re teaching?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They really crave it. I mean, the most skeptical ones are probably not taking the class. It&#39;s an elective, after all. The ones who are really skeptical are across the hall in supply chain management or something. But the truth is that they really crave it and it&#39;s because they want it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My approach is basically this: you can be happier, but you have to understand the science. You need to use the science to change your habits and your lifestyle, and then you need to teach it to other people to make it permanent in your life. The class is called “Leadership and Happiness” because I want every leader to become a happiness teacher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m doing 175 talks a year outside of Harvard, talking to business audiences primarily. And I say, “Look, I&#39;m going to show you a bunch of PowerPoints on the science of happiness, and what I want you to do is to take these slides, take my name off, put your name on, and I want you to teach it to somebody so that you permanently understand this technology and you don&#39;t forget it in your own life.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s the way to get it done. That&#39;s the way that we teach it at Harvard, and it really, really works. I&#39;m telling you, Adi, I am my own first patient in this work, quite frankly. Because I wanted to be happier. As a social scientist, I applied my own toolkit to myself. I wanted to be a happier person. And since I&#39;ve been writing about the science of happiness, guinea-pigging it on myself, everything that I suggest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; and to my students, I do myself first to make sure that I actually believe it works. I&#39;m not just reading academic journal articles and then teaching it to other people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My happiness has risen by 60% in the last four years. In just four years. To be sure it started at kind of a low baseline, but 60% is a lot based on the best measurement techniques for happiness. So I know it works, and I see the results of this every day among my students as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s keep you on the couch a bit more. You come across as a positive, presumably happy person. I know first impressions can be off, but even the sentence, “My happiness is up 60%,” I can&#39;t imagine really what you&#39;re measuring to come up with such a specific figure. What are some measurements? Why have your numbers changed and how?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are some general wellbeing surveys people can take. They&#39;re all over the Internet. And if they&#39;re psychometrically robust, they can do a good job. What I like to look at, however, is I pull apart the negative and positive intensity levels in affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affect means mood. What we find is that if you have a little bit of a malaise, if you&#39;re kind of a melancholic person, either your happiness levels are too low or your unhappiness levels are too high.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, it seems like I&#39;m splitting hairs here, but I&#39;m not. A lot of people think happiness and unhappiness are opposites: that if you&#39;re unhappy, it means you have a lack of happiness. That&#39;s completely wrong. Happiness and unhappiness, or positive and negative emotion, they largely exist in different hemispheres of the brain. They&#39;re produced for different reasons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The negative emotions of fear and anger and disgust and sadness, these are evolved to keep you alive. You should be very, very grateful for your negative emotions. But if they&#39;re too intense, they can hurt your quality of life. Your positive emotions of joy and love and interest in things, again, these are evolved and they&#39;re really good things to have.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that some people, their happiness levels are too low. Other people, their unhappiness levels are too high. I have a test that I administer to my students. I didn&#39;t develop it. It was developed by psychometricians about 20 years ago. But it&#39;s called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psytests.org/emo/panasen.html&quot;>;PANAS test&lt;/a>;, the positive affect negative affect series, and it separates out the intensity of your positive and negative emotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happens is effectively that you have four different characteristics. You can be high positive and high negative. You can be low positive and low negative. You can be high positive and low negative, and of course you could be high negative and low positive. These are a quarter of the population each.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High, high, this is a high affect person, it&#39;s called the mad scientist. That&#39;s me. My problem with wellbeing is not that I&#39;m unhappy or that I&#39;m not happy enough. On the contrary, it just means that I need to manage my high levels of negative affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other people have different issues. Everybody wants to be high positive and low negative. That&#39;s called the cheerleader. It turns out cheerleaders have problems, too. If two cheerleaders meet each other and marry, for example, they won&#39;t be able to bear any threat or listen to any bad news or think that anything bad might happen in the future. They&#39;ll spend all the money and go bankrupt. Cheerleaders, they tend to be pretty rocky CEOs because they will not listen to bad news, and they tend to get wiped out by threats.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High negative, low positive, these are poets. They tend to be extremely creative, but they suffer a lot from sadness and these negative emotions. They have to manage that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last, low, low, these people are not horribly unhappy or low quality of life. They have low intensity affect. These are judges. These are people who are sober. They make great surgeons, they make great litigators and judges. They make great parents of teenagers, high stress professions, etc. But they tend to look a little unenthusiastic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I give these tests to my students so they can know who to marry, how to manage themselves, how to build a management team around them that complements them. It&#39;s really, really instructive, and this is one of the ways that I measure my own happiness and the management techniques that I need, using the neuroscience for my life, and that I can apply to the lives of others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To what extent do we need to be happy at work? I mean, one approach to work could be I do it, I am hopefully making decent money to be able to sustain myself, and I&#39;m focusing on my personal development, on my happiness outside of work. Obviously in an ideal world, we&#39;re happy and contented everywhere, but do we need to be happy at work? How critical is that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s an empirical question about whether or not people that have a high quality of life tend to be happy at work or it doesn&#39;t matter. And the truth is, if you&#39;re unhappy at work, you&#39;re probably unhappy in life. It&#39;s simple. I mean, it&#39;s like nobody works an hour a day. Maybe you&#39;re one of these lucky people that can be on the four-hour work week. My friend Tim Ferriss wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357&quot;>;that famous book&lt;/a>;, and the truth is, a lot of people could get their work done in a lot less time than they do. But most of us don&#39;t have that luxury.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been working 80-hour weeks my whole career, and part of it is a pathology. I&#39;m not going to kid you, I talk a lot in my research about self-objectification, workaholism, which is all based on success addiction, and fears of failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And everybody out there watching, you know I&#39;m talking about you too. So take care of these pathologies because these are addictions like anything else, and there&#39;s a lot of brain chemistry in that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is, you&#39;re going to spend a ton of time doing that. And if it&#39;s drudgery, that&#39;s bad. You don&#39;t want drudgery. At very least it should be something that&#39;s pleasant and making it pleasant sometimes it&#39;s completely out of our grasp. If you have a job that you truly hate and a boss who&#39;s just the worst, well, that&#39;s no good. But a lot of it is in our hands, and this is a lot of what I&#39;m working on and what I&#39;m trying to help people understand they can actually manage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You just mentioned workaholism. I think many of us suspect we suffer from it, but maybe aren&#39;t willing to look too closely at whether that&#39;s true. But the workaholism is a high, we get a sense of who we are, a sense of accomplishment, etc. But surely it&#39;s not fully a good thing. What is your advice to workaholics who may not realize that that is what they are?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To begin with, workaholism is actually horrible for your quality of life. The problem is that when you&#39;re a workaholic, people congratulate you. Nobody says, “Man, you are so good at drinking gin.” Nobody ever says, “Dude, you&#39;re unbelievable at how much methamphetamine you can consume.” These are not compliments. People feel sorry for you when you&#39;re addicted to other substances or gambling or pornography or anything else that&#39;s deleterious, dangerous, and addictive, that captures your brain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But workaholism, man, you work all night, you work 100-hour weeks, people are like, “Dude, you&#39;re killing it.” And you&#39;re like, “Yeah, I feel so good about myself, but how come I can&#39;t maintain a proper relationship?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The truth of the matter is that there are really a portfolio of four things that go into having a truly happy life, and they need to be in both in abundance and in balance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Number one is faith and philosophy, whether it&#39;s religious or not religious, it has to be something that zooms you out on the majesty of life and makes you small so that you have yourself in perspective. You&#39;re going to have peace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, you&#39;ve got to be paying serious attention to your family relationship. No joke, family relationships are the most mystical kind of love, and you can&#39;t substitute anything for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your friendships, now, this is a really bad one for workaholics. Workaholics have a lot of deal friends, but not very many real friends. Everybody watching us knows the difference between real and deal. And if you don&#39;t, take the fellow workaholics, take the 10 people that you see most and spend most of your time with and write real or deal after each one, and see for yourself that you need to tune this up. Deal friends are useful, real friends are beautifully useless to you. Do you have enough useless people? That&#39;s the question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least is work. The two parts of work that really matter are not title, not money, not admiration, not power, [but] earned success and serving other people. Workaholism militates against these sources of fulfillment in our lives. It impoverishes. It makes us poorer so that we actually can&#39;t pursue these other pillars. The result is we just don&#39;t have a balanced portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look, if everything you do for your happiness is work, that&#39;s like putting your entire pension into Greek bonds. It might work out, but I&#39;m an economist. I don&#39;t recommend it. That&#39;s not a diversified strategy. You&#39;re most likely not going to retire the way you want to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Saudi Arabia, it&#39;s a simple, intriguing question. Is happiness contagious?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, happiness is absolutely contagious because social contagion is a real thing. There&#39;s a really great study, Adi, more or less in our neighborhood, they&#39;re called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/&quot;>;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a>; from Framingham, Massachusetts. It looks over 50 years. It was set up to look at people&#39;s lives, at how different social aspects of life are contagious for physical stuff, whether obesity is socially contagious, etc. But they started to look at other things like happiness, and they found that just being in the vicinity of a happy person makes you happier. Having your spouse get happier makes you happier. Having your best friend get happier makes you a lot happier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even more contagious is misery. That&#39;s the reason you don&#39;t want your teenage kids to hang out with a kid who wears all black and looks bummed all the time. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s like, “Oh, that sucks. Everything sucks.” You don&#39;t want that because that&#39;s so socially contagious that your kid is going to become unbelievably negative and become sad. And nobody wants this for their children because they have a sense of the social contagion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number one issue that I see in family dynamics is a social contagion of negativity. That&#39;s what each one of us has to turn around, is to try to inject the happiness virus into our family and to basically do it on purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a question from Nepal that picks up on your themes. You&#39;ve talked about people taking agency in their own life and their own fulfillment and sense of happiness. But how should we deal with people in leadership who don&#39;t believe in any of this stuff, who don&#39;t believe in work-life balance? You can work on yourself, but as you said, misery and all this stuff is contagious. How can you move the needle on leadership that doesn&#39;t appreciate any of this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to leadership, leader lead thyself. Your number one employee is you. Don&#39;t be the pace-setting leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember when Daniel Goleman wrote that famous book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Results-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/1633692620&quot;>;&lt;em>;Leadership That Gets Results&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;? It was about the six types of leaders, and the number one leadership characteristic that everybody thinks is great—but is actually horrible—is workaholic pace-setting leaders that are in the office all the time and saying, “Look, if I&#39;m going to ask people to work hard, I have to work even harder.” It&#39;s incredibly dispiriting for other people. It lowers their quality of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a CEO, I&#39;m telling you, somebody on my executive team says, “Arthur, you got to stop sending email at 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM because people are going to stay up wondering if they&#39;re going to have to answer your email.” I said, “I don&#39;t expect anybody to…” That&#39;s not the point. So I put timers on my email to do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even better was when my wife started clamping down and saying, “You need to sleep more. You need to go to the gym more. You need to have more of a life.” So number one, if you&#39;re a leader, you need to get a hold on this problem because you&#39;re going to be hurting yourself, wrecking your relationships, and disheartening all the people around you. This is a big problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, don&#39;t work for a workaholic. Don&#39;t work for them if you can. And again, not everybody&#39;s got all these degrees of freedom, but most of us have a few choices in what we can do for work. And by the way, if it turns out that your boss is abusing you and hopelessly addicted to drugs, you got to change circumstances. That&#39;s an abusive relationship. I recommend steering clear of workaholics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, what&#39;s behind workaholism, fellow workaholics? It&#39;s the success addiction. Workaholism is a secondary addiction to the addiction of success, and a lot of that&#39;s based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/10/howto-arthurbrooks-happiness-identity-drshefali-mindfulness-meaning-2021/620282/&quot;>;objectification of yourself&lt;/a>;, which is a bad thing to do, and a deep, deep set of fear of failure. Those are the things to actually start working on. You can&#39;t just say, “Work less, what&#39;s the problem?” It&#39;s self-objectification and fear of failure, almost always.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you think of new entries to the workforce, and some of them are your HBS students who are working for investment banks, who are working for law firms, and there is this expectation of exploitation where, yes, I&#39;m working around the clock. It is killing me, but it is getting me to where I will be rich, fulfilled, happy. How can people who are ambitious in those fields do otherwise?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that I tell my students is you&#39;ve got to have a balanced happiness portfolio, and killing all of your relationships to spend 110 hours in an investment bank is the worst, most unbalanced happiness portfolio you can possibly get. Plus, you&#39;re losing your best years to establish the relationships that you&#39;re going to want to cultivate for the rest of your life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People say, “Okay, I&#39;m 28. I&#39;m going to go get an investment bank job, they&#39;re going to expect me to work a hundred hours a week. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll look for a spouse when I&#39;m 35.”可能不会。 I got the data, and the data don&#39;t lie. You&#39;re more and more likely to actually not have the thing that&#39;s going to give you the most happiness in your life, which is your marriage. We actually have to think in a balanced-portfolio approach to the happiness that we&#39;re trying to get, and making those sacrifices are really bad sacrifices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, guys like you and me, our age, in our fifties, you notice that we don&#39;t make those sacrifices anymore. And the reason is because our time parameters are shorter. But also we&#39;ve had bitter experience with these types of things. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s like I&#39;m a grandfather now and my grandson was born and suddenly I was a lot less interested in working. But part of it was the bitter experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ll tell you a story actually that will motivate this. When I was interviewing this woman for my last book, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Finding-Success-Happiness-Purpose-ebook/dp/B08WCKY8MB&quot;>;&lt;em>;From Strength to Strength&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, about how to get happier as you get older, a titan of Wall Street. This woman was just famous and rich, a billionaire, and she was horribly unhappy. She was my age, late fifties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What&#39;s wrong?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “Well, my husband and I were roommates. I&#39;m kind of cordial with my adult kids, but it&#39;s not close. I&#39;m getting bad reports from the doctor. I think I drink too much. I need to go to the gym. My employees are starting to doubt the wisdom of my decision-making. And I don&#39;t know, what do I do?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What do you mean? You don&#39;t need a Harvard professor to tell you what to do. You&#39;re prescribing to yourself, stepping back, going away with your husband. You&#39;re already rich. Why don&#39;t you do that?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “It&#39;s true, but I guess I&#39;ve always chosen to be special rather than happy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boom, man. It was like a knife to my heart, Adi. All these years when I was running a company and the 14th hour at the office before the first hour with my kids, well, news flash man, they grew up. They grew up and I missed a lot of it. And I really, really regret that. Now I&#39;m not going to miss it with my grandkids, I get a do-over. I&#39;m not going to screw that up twice. That&#39;s a really important thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I could have had a little bit more perspective, I would not have been less successful. The data don&#39;t lie on this either. The 14th hour is not productive. It&#39;s just compulsive. Just like any other addiction, the 14th drink doesn&#39;t give you more joy. Stop at two, is the bottom line, because you need the balance in this part of your life as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At HBR we try to be super practical, so before you go, can you leave the audience shortcuts to happiness, or just things that viewers can think about or do today that can be a meaningful step in that direction?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in the Atlantic&lt;/a>;, every Thursday morning, I have a big topic and I do talk about the science, but then I always give three ways to live this thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just in general, since we&#39;re on the meta topic of happiness, the way to think about happiness is that it&#39;s not a feeling. If happiness were a feeling, that would be very disappointing. It would depend on how you slept last night and what you ate for breakfast and no good. If your spouse yelled at you this morning, no good. Don&#39;t chase the feeling. Feelings are evidence of happiness, like the smell of the turkey is evidence of your Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is three things that we need to be thinking about and managing in our lives. Enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose. Those are the three big things that we need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enjoyment is not pleasure, pleasure is an animal thing. Enjoyment is the pleasure you get plus the people that you enjoy it with and the memories that you&#39;re making. That&#39;s why beer commercials don&#39;t have a guy alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack. They have people enjoying a few beers together because it&#39;s pleasure plus people plus memory. Don&#39;t do the stuff that makes you feel good alone. That&#39;s the rule of thumb.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second is satisfaction. Satisfaction is the joy you get when you struggle for something and you get that. Now fellow strivers, the striver&#39;s curse is you get on something called the hedonic treadmill where you struggle and struggle and achieve it, but then it doesn&#39;t give you very much satisfaction for very long and so you keep trying and trying and trying again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution to that is not to have more, it&#39;s to want less. Your satisfaction is your haves divided by your wants. Manage your denominator with a wants-management strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least, it&#39;s meaning, it&#39;s purpose in your life. The way to figure out if you have a purpose crisis is asking yourself two simple questions. There&#39;s no right answers, but you have to have answers. “Why am I alive, and for what am I willing to die today?” And if you don&#39;t have answers, go looking for the answers with introspection. When you see somebody that finds those answers, it&#39;s like an actual miracle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the three things practically to think about. “Do I have enjoyment or just pleasure? Am I managing my wants or my haves, so I can have satisfaction? And do I have enough meaning in my life by answering those two questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s great. I hope people took notes, I hope people try to act on that. Arthur, I want to thank you for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you, Adi. And thanks to everybody watching.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Incorporating DEI into Decision-Making]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_01_aJTiW00qqtI_5989933_B3UFXwcVbc4_3neSwyntbQ8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Most people believe in promoting DEI in the workplace. But implicit and unconscious biases &amp;#8212; not to mention the constant juggling of priorities required at work &amp;#8212; can lead to inequitable decision-making. In this article, drawing on recent research, the authors suggest that this problem can be addressed by making DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, to managers immediately before they need to make consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation. The authors discuss three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Most people don&#39;t think of themselves as biased or prejudiced, and people often explicitly endorse diversity as something companies should strive for. But many organizations struggle with DEI. Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implicit or unconscious biases can lead to inequitable decision-making. More mundanely, people are just busy. They have lots of competing priorities and lots to occupy their brains. Even if they care about DEI, they might not have it top of mind as they go about their work. As a result, they might not see how their decisions are relevant for DEI and so might inadvertently make inequitable decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fix this, managers and organizations should make DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, when it matters most — that is, when consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation are being made. Our academic research and experiences partnering with companies suggest that to make real progress on DEI, managers and organizations need to make DEI salient in those moments of consequential decision-making. We&#39;ve identified three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Ask managers to hire for more than one job at a time. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many hiring decisions are made in isolation, with only one person being hired at a time. When this is the case, diversity simply just isn&#39;t that salient to decision-makers, who are often thinking not about diversity but instead about technical skills, cultural fit, or how quickly a candidate can start. This shouldn&#39;t be surprising, because diversity is a property of groups, not individuals. You can describe a group of people as “diverse” or “homogeneous,” after all, but not an individual person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, when people make collective hiring decisions — when they hire multiple people at a time — our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3533&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that people select more diversity. They start thinking about the candidates they&#39;re selecting as a group, which makes diversity more salient and leads to hiring decisions that improve it. For example, rather than hiring one person every month, a company might benefit from grouping these decisions together and hiring three people very quarter. The total number of people hired will be the same, but making collective decisions every quarter should lead to more diversity. Relatedly, it might also be beneficial to give one person oversight over hiring decisions across teams or departments, enabling that person to make collective hiring decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Ask managers to make diversity more salient in the promotion process. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This recommendation comes from work that we&#39;ve done at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morethannow.co.uk/single-post/2022/8/22/the-inclusion-lab&quot;>;Inclusion Lab at MoreThanNow&lt;/a>;, a collaboration of academics and consultants focused on generating empirical evidence about what actually works at improving DEI in the workplace. Specifically, it grows out of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/why-you-should-start-ab-testing-your-dei-initiatives&quot;>;field experiment&lt;/a>; we conducted with a global management, engineering, and development consultancy that wanted to know if we could help it increase equity in its promotions process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this company, promotions are made by a group of high-level senior managers in a bi-annual promotions process, during which managers can nominate their employees for promotion. Managers justify their nominations in a statement of 50 words or less in an online form. In our experiment, 116 of these senior managers were randomly assigned to receive one of two messages in advance of submitting their nominations. The control group was asked to consider promoting people who had displayed excellent performance and competence beyond their current grade. The treatment group was asked to consider the same criteria — but also to consider the diversity of their nominees as a whole, and whether their choices would help to close representation gaps. In other words, we made DEI more salient for this group of managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened when we did this? Although the sample for this experiment was small (which means some caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings), we found that making diversity salient increased the number of employees promoted from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. The effects seem to be driven by male senior managers, who at baseline may have been less likely to think spontaneously about diversity. We did not find any statistically significant positive or negative treatment effects on the promotion rates of female employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Ask managers to view a short diversity training video right before formal people decisions. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This suggestion uses salience to help organizations dramatically rethink how they implement diversity training. Prior research suggests that training is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/does-diversity-training-work-the-way-its-supposed-to&quot;>;largely ineffective at actually changing behavior&lt;/a>;. However, we think this may be because it doesn&#39;t make DEI salient in the moment of consequential decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In most organizations, people are given diversity training when they get onboarded, or perhaps on an annual basis. That&#39;s often months or years before they actually make consequential hiring, promotion, or performance-evaluation decisions for the company, which means they&#39;re extremely unlikely to have the messages of the training in mind when they make those decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine instead if an organization had managers take a short training immediately prior to making a consequential HR decision. Because the training happens just before the decision, it has a much higher likelihood of ensuring that DEI remains salient and encourage managers to make more equitable choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have evidence of exactly this finding from a field experiment that we at the Inclusion Lab have been conducting with Ericsson, a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Sweden. We delivered an automated 5-minute DEI training to some managers before they screened resumes and found that the managers who got this training were significantly more likely to hire people from underrepresented groups at Ericsson.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experiment suggests that the significant amount of time and cost we invest into DEI training can indeed pay off — but only when organizations choose the right moment for it. One-off “blanket” training may well not be the way forward. Instead, organizations may want to consider how to use repeated smaller training modules in advance of key decision points to make DEI salient and therefore effective. We see this as fertile ground for further experimentation in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most people really do want to do the right thing when it comes to DEI, but they often just need a nudge or prompt to keep DEI top of mind at the right time. Our research strongly suggests that managers and organizations can do this by making DEI more salient at moments of consequential decision-making.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are Collaboration Tools Overwhelming Your Team?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/are-collaboration-tools-overwhelming-your-team]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1494319608-2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;master1305/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Today&amp;#8217;s workers feel numbed by a fragmented, unpredictable, and overwhelming collection of collaboration tools &amp;#8212; the very things advertised to boost their productivity.

They know they&#39;re overloaded and feel exhausted but believe there is little or nothing they can do to slow the onslaught of communication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We explored how collaboration technology bloat impacts employees and tried to help people take control over their work. We called our intervention the “collaboration cleanse.” Here we&#39;ll explore our findings (spoiler: there&#39;s good news and bad) and outline what leaders should do to simplify employees&#39; collaboration tool use.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Collaboration Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This “cleanse” was implemented by Asana&#39;s Work Innovation Lab, in concert with Amazon Web Services. We randomly assigned each of our 58 volunteers, which included both Asana and Amazon employees, into one of two groups. We asked all participants to report the collaboration technologies they use at least once a week for interacting with colleagues (for example, Slack, Figma, and Zoom). We also asked them to evaluate how well each tool helps them achieve their current work goals, as well as how much effort it takes to use each one. Finally, we asked them to choose specific technologies to refrain from using for two weeks. We asked people in the first group to stop using half of their collaboration tools for the two weeks. People in the second group could choose which and how many collaboration tools they eliminated. All participants told us which technologies they planned to set aside and kept daily diaries, recording any occasions when they strayed from their “approved” list.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This cleanse was inspired by research on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/the-friction-project/&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>;, including our prior interventions at the Work Innovation Lab that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/meeting-overload-is-a-fixable-problem&quot;>;helped people eliminate and redesign bad meetings&lt;/a>;. This research shows that people are prone to solving problems by heaping &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; complexity and burdens on themselves and others — even when subtraction is a more effective strategy. But prompting them to slow down and think about what they can and should remove from their work helps them overcome the instinct to add instead of &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/when-subtraction-adds-value&quot;>;subtract&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Good News: Participants Became More Aware of Their Digital Burdens&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As they embarked on this cleanse, participants in both groups became more aware of the digital clutter pervading their lives — clutter that they didn&#39;t think about much or at all and hadn&#39;t ever tried to reduce or remove. Forty-one percent reported (without prompting) that they became more mindful of the impact of using too many collaboration tools on their focus and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research scientist put it to us this way: “[The cleanse] made me much more aware of the different tools I was using and the impact that was having on my productivity and sense of focus. There is a subtle cost with switching tools, and that additional friction hurts my focus and productivity.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to reflecting more deeply on how they used their tools, participants also made small strides toward using fewer collaboration tools overall. More than half (53%) of participants told us they would use at least one tool less frequently as a result of their cleanse. They expected this conscious culling of their tech stack to free up their time and cognitive bandwidth for more focused work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A customer insights analyst told us the cleanse taught her to be more deliberate about when she uses some particularly distracting collaboration technologies (eg, messaging platforms) to cut down on interruptions. One change she made was to plan intervals where she would use collaboration technologies intensely for 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes after lunch, and 10 minutes at the end of the day, and otherwise wouldn&#39;t use them at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Bad News: Participants Felt More Helpless and Exhausted After the Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The intervention also appeared to have some negative consequences that surprised us. After we prompted participants to become more mindful of their tool use, they reported that their feelings of helplessness increased. When they paused to identify digital tools to subtract, many realized doing so would be a time-consuming ordeal, or downright impossible. That&#39;s because so many other people inside and outside their teams expected (or required) them to use particular collaboration tools, so the decision to get rid of these shared tools wasn&#39;t theirs alone (or at all). The awareness triggered by the collaboration cleanse made them want to fight back and overhaul their tools. But many felt stymied by inescapable rules, traditions, and power dynamics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One project risk manager, for example, said she would try to minimize the use of collaboration tools but didn&#39;t think she would succeed. With different teams using different tools because of their own preferences or company requirements, she and her colleagues were often confused about which messaging tool they should use to communicate with people in different business units.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in both groups reported a sense of helplessness and the resulting exhaustion, yet it appeared to be more severe in the first group, where we asked participants to abstain from using half of their tools for two weeks — a task that proved to be not just formidable, but often impossible. Many participants realized they were helpless to cut their tool use like they wanted to, which frustrated and exhausted them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in the second group, who were given the flexibility to trim their list of collaboration tools as much as they deemed necessary, also reported feelings of futility and digital exhaustion, though they seemed less vehement in their distress. The task of subtracting tools, we found, is complex and daunting, and becoming mindful about the struggle to achieve it can inadvertently exacerbate feelings of helplessness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This aligns with the findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMPROC.2023.11120abstract&quot;>;related study&lt;/a>; where we interviewed 63 knowledge workers from a variety of industries. We found that feelings of digital exhaustion depended on whether or not employees felt like they had autonomy to decide which tools they would use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our takeaway? When people realize they can&#39;t do much or anything to reduce the number of collaboration tools they use (or when and how often they use them), they&#39;re left feeling even more helpless and exhausted. As one software engineer put it, “This is something that&#39;s really hard to change on an individual level.” He went on to explain that, if he decided not to use a tool that other colleagues used, it would be harder for him and his collaborators to do their jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Change Needs to Come from the Top&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many studies show that effective and long-lasting change in organizations bubbles up from the bottom and that strong dictums from management &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;can create impediments for employees&lt;/a>;. We&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250284426/thefrictionproject&quot;>;cited&lt;/a>; much of that research &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/the-digital-mindset-what-it-really-takes-to-thrive-in-the-age-of-data-algorithms-and-ai/10413&quot;>;in our own work&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;even produced a fair amount of it&lt;/a>;, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when it comes to technology overload and digital exhaustion, the best and sometimes only way to reduce the problem is with strong, persistent, and even downright inflexible top-down intervention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results of our collaboration cleanse show that the interactive and interdependent nature of collaboration technologies makes it near impossible for individual employees to meaningfully reduce their tool use in the workplace on their own. And as participants in our study made clear, attempting and failing to change how and when they use their digital tools may be worse than never trying at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees at lower levels often have the best information about which tools to keep and which to eliminate. But those at the top of the pecking order are in the best position to use their authority to make change throughout the organization and help employees stay afloat amid the digital deluge. Here&#39;s how leaders can help employees get a better handle on their collaboration tools:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Provide purposeful constraints.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Set clear guidelines for when employees should use specific technologies. This will help prevent them from spending time and energy second-guessing what type of work to do with which technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Establish non-negotiables. For example, leaders in one organization we worked with specified that Slack should be used for communication that&#39;s time sensitive and requires a quick response — and not for less-pressing matters. Leaders in other organizations have banned email completely, or made the decision to use only one project management tool. They key here is to be specific and exacting: Don&#39;t let too many tools clutter people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Tackle the root cause and ripple effects.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As a leader, it&#39;s crucial to confront both the visible symptoms and underlying causes of tech overload. Initiate a top-down pruning of your organization&#39;s tool stack, eliminating redundant and inefficient technologies. One data scientist who participated in the cleanse described how his company&#39;s leaders cancelled employee licenses for a redundant file-sharing platform, which helped him and others stick to a single platform when working on documents, rather than being forced to keep switching between different platforms that each required different steps and commands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also your responsibility to help your team mitigate the ripple effects of tool overload. Encourage employees to use features like “do not disturb” and turn off unnecessary notifications to regain some control over their attention. But if you don&#39;t model this behavior, it&#39;s unlikely your employees will do it either.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Fix friction head-on.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Encourage, enable, and even require employees to regularly evaluate their tech habits. Our cleanse suggests this conscious reflection can make your employees more aware of the toll of tech overload. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250249869/subtract&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>; can be a powerful catalyst for change, prompting employees to pause and critically evaluate the impacts of their technologies on their productivity and well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet our intervention also revealed that this increased awareness can lead to heightened feelings of digital exhaustion if employees feel powerless to make changes. As a leader, your job is not only to promote this conscious reflection but also to provide support and resources so employees can change their tech use. This could involve facilitating discussions about tech habits within teams, providing training on how to use collaboration tools more effectively, or using your authority to revamp the organization&#39;s tech stack based on employee feedback. Be prepared to follow through and hold yourself accountable to ensure that increased awareness of tool overload leads to positive change rather than increased despair.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Beware the credit card approach.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s become common for managers to buy subscriptions to digital platforms for their teams — without alerting the IT department — by simply charging the small monthly fee to their company credit cards. Many tech companies design their pricing strategies so managers can make these purchases without going through a lengthy corporate approval process. Although many managers adopt this approach because they think it helps their teams adopt the best technologies quickly, the lack of friction contributes to bloat in each member&#39;s own tech stack and can lead to more feelings of digital exhaustion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers need to be more conscious about how many tools they introduce to their employees and of how difficult it is for them to stop using tools once they start. In one midsize company we worked with, the CTO instructed the accounting team to flag all purchases made to software vendors on the corporate card. Each subscription that was not authorized by IT was cancelled. If the manager wanted to reinstate it, they had to make a formal request to the CTO in writing. Sure, this was a tough top-down approach. But after a year of asking managers not to overwhelm their teams with tools, the CTO finally forced people to tackle the problem rather than just make hollow promises. Six months after the big cancellation, the company was using nearly 30 fewer tools.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Collaboration technology overload can drown employees in choices, leaving them feeling helpless. The irony is that by constraining those choices, adding frustrating obstacles to adopting yet another collaboration technology, and taking control away from individuals, employees can feel more in control of their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Prepare for a GenAI Future You Can&rsquo;t Predict]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-to-prepare-for-a-genai-future-you-cant-predict]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1500235907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Given the staggering pace of generative AI development, it&amp;#8217;s no wonder that so many executives are tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations.

We initially worked through scenarios to improve fraud detection and customer service, but with the ongoing spate of recent announcements, it was clear he had grander ambitions in mind. Like many industries, banking has a workforce problem: There is a discrepancy between the demand for skilled personnel and the supply of workers who are willing to return to an office and play by pre-Covid rules.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI, he thought, might be a silver bullet of sorts. It could create cost savings and efficiencies through automation, but might these new tools also solve the talent shortage issue? To put it plainly: How soon could AI replace human workers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our conversation echoed many I&#39;ve had since last November with executives across an array of businesses, including insurance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and even executives leading Hollywood studios, whose writers and actors are currently on strike. They all want to know how their companies can create more value using fewer human resources. That&#39;s because last fall, ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by OpenAI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt&quot;>;suddenly went viral&lt;/a>;, demonstrating the power of AI to generate its own emails, essays, recipes, financial reports, articles, and ideas. Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html&quot;>;estimates&lt;/a>; that within the decade, 300 million jobs will either be eliminated or largely diminished by generative AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re already starting to see turbulence. Job postings for “prompt engineers” — humans who ask systems like ChatGPT to generate content — are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3&quot;>;offering annual salaries of $300,000 or more&lt;/a>;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389233&quot;>;OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 passed the Uniform Bar Exam&lt;/a>; and hinted that in the near future, we may not need lawyers for transactional work. Indeed, Walmart is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005148/en/Pactum%E2%80%99s-Autonomous-Negotiation-Technology-on-Display-at-the-National-Retail-Federation%E2%80%99s-2023-Retail-Big-Show&quot;>;prototyping&lt;/a>; a generative AI system (unrelated to OpenAI) to negotiate some of its vendor contracts; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2023/walmart-finds-75-percent-vendors-prefer-negotiating-with-chatbot/&quot;>;75% of contract lawyers and procurement officers&lt;/a>; on the other side say they now prefer negotiating with an AI over their flesh-and-blood counterparts.

This summer, partners will start testing applications that can look at an X-ray and automatically write a mammography report — without a human doctor in the loop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the staggering pace of development, it&#39;s no wonder that so many executives are coming to the same conclusion: Within just a few years, powerful AI systems will perform cognitive work at the same level (or even above) their human workforce. Tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations, business leaders envision a future of work without nearly as many people as today. From my perspective, this is a huge miscalculation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it&#39;s too early to predict the exact future of AI — especially given that generative AI is just one tiny area of a field with many interdependencies, each in various stages of development. Exactly which jobs AI will eliminate, and when, is guesswork. It isn&#39;t enough for an AI system to perform a task; the output has to be proven trustworthy, integrated into existing workstreams, and managed for compliance, risk, and regulatory issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, in a period of rapid disruption brought by technology, leaders are focused too narrowly on immediate gains, rather than how their value network will transform in the future. As AI evolves, it will require entire segments of business to be reimagined — in real time, but before we have a full sense of what the future will look like. Remember the earliest days of the public internet and web browsers, which were viewed as entertainment? No one planned for the fundamental transformation both would ignite. It would have been impossible then to foretell how it would someday influence presidential elections or create the world&#39;s first trillion-dollar companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be sure, executives today must make decisions in the most complex operating environment I&#39;ve seen since those early internet days. Leaders, understandably concerned about missing out on the next wave of technology, are unwittingly making risky bets on their companies&#39; futures. Here are steps every leader should take to prepare for an uncertain world where generative AI and human workforces coexist but will evolve in ways that are unknowable.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Preparing for a Future You Can&#39;t Predict&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the paradox: We need to think of the workforce as evolving with — rather than being supplanted by — generative AI. The workforce will need to evolve, and workers will have to learn new skills, iteratively and over a period of years. Leaders must adopt a new approach to maximize the potential of AI in their organizations, which requires tracking key developments in AI differently, using an iterative process to cultivate a ready workforce, and most importantly, creating evidence-backed future scenarios that challenge conventional thinking within the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What can leaders do now to navigate this period?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;First, temper expectations about what generative AI can and will do for your business.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Historically, AI cycles through phases that involve breakthroughs, surges of funding and fleeting moments of mainstream interest, followed by missed expectations and funding clawbacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1970, Marvin Minsky, an influential computer scientist and one of the founding parents of AI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiws.net/the-history-of-ai/this-week-in-the-history-of-ai-at-aiws-net-marvin-minsky-was-quoted-in-life-magazine-in-from-three-to-eight-years-we-will-have-a-machine-with-the-general-intelligence-of-an-average-human-b/&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; Life magazine that artificial general intelligence — an AI with cognitive abilities indistinguishable from a person — was just three years away. Bear in mind that in the 1970s, the computing power required for such an AI didn&#39;t yet exist. Supercomputers were mostly theoretical. So were personal computers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://r5.ieee.org/houston/ieee-stepping-stone-award-datapoint-2200-the-first-personal-computer/&quot;>;Datapoint 2200&lt;/a>; and its processor eventually became the foundational architecture for what we came to know as PCs. The grand ambitions promised by Minsky and his colleagues never materialized, so funding and interest dried up. This happened again in 1987, when again, computer scientists and businesses made bold promises on a timeline for AI that was just never feasible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While powerful, today&#39;s mainstream generative AI tools — ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL-E 2 — aren&#39;t finished products. Sometime soon, people will sour on their novelty and realize that while AI can create content, it&#39;s not good enough to actually use. Likewise, it&#39;s still very early days when it comes to domain-specific AI tools for medicine, climate, and life sciences. For generative AI to perform the miracles we&#39;ve been promised — at scale, and cost effectively — a lot more work needs to be done. Remember, these tools were mostly theoretical until very recently.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives need to get clear on the practical functions generative AI will perform in their organizations today. They should also be pragmatic about the opportunities — and risks — generative AI will eventually unlock. AI is not a monolith, and we are just at the beginning of a very long trajectory. This may sound intuitive, but in my observation, few leaders are developing a realistic strategy that links today&#39;s operations to tomorrow&#39;s vision, socializing it within their management teams, and revising their performance indicators accordingly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I met with the executive leadership of a multinational consumer packaged goods (CPG) company eager to partner with a generative AI company. I walked them through a high-probability scenario in which customers using a chat tool answered a few questions about their preferences and goals, and had an online shopping cart automatically filled with the items they would need for the week. But none of the CPG&#39;s brands showed up in the cart — or if they did, they weren&#39;t first on the list. Just as search engines like Google and Amazon invented new mechanisms and rules for search engine optimization, in the future, generative AI integrations across platforms like retailers and shopping cart apps would create new challenges for CPG companies, which might find themselves further down the value chain where critical decisions are made.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Second, evaluate what data your company is generating and how it would today, and in the future, be used by generative AI.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Business data is invaluable because once a model has been trained, it can be costly and technically cumbersome to port those data over to another system. At the moment emerging AI platforms are not easily interoperable, and that&#39;s by design. Generative AI platforms are evolving into walled gardens, where the companies creating the technology control all sides of their ecosystems. The biggest AI companies are competing for market share — and for the enormous amounts of data they need to make their models most competitive. By marketing their platforms to companies, they want to lock them (and their data) in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s AI systems are being created using a technique known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf&quot;>;&lt;em>;reinforcement learning with human feedback&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, or RHLF. Essentially, AI systems need constant human feedback, or they run the risk of learning and remembering the wrong information. The more data that&#39;s ingested, the more annotating, labeling, and training that&#39;s required. Today, this work is automated to gig workers in emerging economies like Kenya and Pakistan. As AI matures, specialists with expert-level knowledge will be needed. Many of the business leaders I&#39;ve met with aren&#39;t planning for a future that includes an internal RHLF unit tasked with continuously monitoring, auditing, and tweaking AI systems and tools. (The last thing any leader should want is an unsupervised AI system making decisions about how to improve itself.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even with trained humans in the loop, businesses must continuously craft scenarios that surface risks of working alongside generative AI systems, especially those operated by third parties. That&#39;s because AI systems aren&#39;t static; they are improving incrementally over time. With each new development, new potential risks and opportunities arise. It would be impossible to game out all of the potential negative outcomes in advance without those predictions quickly becoming outdated. (For now, there is no way to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Monte-Carlo-simulation&quot;>;Monte Carlo simulation&lt;/a>; that would be fully accurate in predicting the future.) Instead, a dedicated team should be charged with monitoring generative AI systems as they are learning, as well as related cybersecurity challenges, and they should develop short “what if” scenarios imagining ways in which things could go wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Likewise, as AI evolves, so too will opportunities to unlock new growth. Which means that businesses should also have a dedicated, internal business development team to develop near- and long-term scenarios for the myriad ways in which emerging tools will improve productivity and efficiency, lead to product development, spur innovation, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Third, when it comes to AI, leaders must shift their focus from the bottom line to top line.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This will seem counterintuitive, as many view generative AI as a means to reduce operational costs. Today&#39;s smart chatbots will soon give way to multimodal systems, which are AIs capable of solving different problems and accomplishing different goals at once. Imagine a property and casualty insurance company where every underwriter is teamed up with an AI. Initially, the underwriter might ask the AI to assess the risk associated with insuring a property; after a preliminary analysis of the text, she might ask it to refine results using the images from inspection reports or audio interviews with the prospective policyholder. She might go back and forth a few times, using different data sources, until an optimal quote is received for both the insurance company and the customer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to making productive use of multimodal AIs is understanding how and what to delegate to a machine, so that both the human and the AI can accomplish more through collaboration than by working independently. However delegation is something professionals routinely struggle with: They either assign too much, or not enough, or not the right tasks. Working alongside a multimodal AI will require workers to master the art of delegation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once a workforce understands how to delegate correctly, it will act as a force multiplier within organizations. Individual teams could be more ambitious in growing the company&#39;s top line through ideating and simulating new revenue streams, finding and acquiring new customers, and seeking out various improvements to the company&#39;s overall operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This portends a future that demands a different approach to upskilling. Most workers won&#39;t need to learn how to code, or how to write basic prompts, as we often hear at conferences. Rather, they&#39;ll need to learn how to leverage multimodal AI to do more, and better, work. Just look at Excel, which is &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/10-excel-functions-everyone-should-know&quot;>;used&lt;/a>; by 750 million knowledge workers every day. The software includes more than 500 functions — but the vast majority of people only use a few dozen, because they don&#39;t fully understand how to match the enormous number of features Excel offers to their daily cognitive tasks. Now, imagine a future in which AI — a far more complicated, more convoluted software — is ubiquitous. How much utility will be left on the table simply because business leaders approached upskilling too narrowly?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Framework for Navigating the Evolving AI Workforce&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Workforce change is an inevitable side effect of technological evolution, and leaders need a systemized way of seeing what the future of their organizations will look like in the wake of generative AI&#39;s developments. To that end, this simple framework will help leaders in any organization anticipate how — and when — their workforce will need to change in order to leverage AI. The goal isn&#39;t to make long-range predictions, or even to be ready for everything — it&#39;s to position organizations to be ready for anything as AI continues to improve.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363183&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_WEBB_IDEA_FRAMEWORK_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;The IDEA Framework.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;620&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This framework should be used to develop scenarios for the future of a business. It is designed to help you see risk and opportunity early enough for action. Used regularly, this framework enables leaders to see the landscape more clearly, evaluate gaps within their organizations, and link emerging technology to existing strategy, positioning them to make decisions with confidence. Importantly, it asks leaders to think exponentially about AI, but to act incrementally in response to new developments. While it won&#39;t predict a singular future for your company —&amp;nbsp;no scenario can do that — it will prepare leaders to make decisions well ahead of their competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The single best thing organizations can do right now — during this period of what feels like a soul-crushing amount of change and uncertainty — is to methodically plan for the future. That requires knowing generative AI&#39;s limitations as well as its strengths and adopting a culture of continual evaluation and improvement. It also means getting past clever product demos to much more mundane, pragmatic conversations about the trajectory of development, how data are being used, and the practical ways in which companies can use emerging tools. Resist the temptation to reduce your workforce — and instead use strategic foresight to create a future where AI is leveraged by a highly skilled workforce, and where human–AI teams are more productive, creative, and efficient working together than apart.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Global Companies Can Create a Consistent Customer Experience]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_30_3850269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Yaroslav Danylchenko/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Building a global company is easier, but also more nuanced and complex, than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run. To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving a GLOBE mindset, one that&amp;#8217;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;On the surface, international business expansion seems easier than ever. Today, any company can reach multiple markets in a matter of seconds: Publish a blog post, launch a mobile app, buy digital ads, and target customers in as many countries as you wish. The rise of online global marketplaces has made it even easier for companies to launch into multiple countries simultaneously, often from their earliest days. This has given rise to a wave of “global native” companies that have an international presence from day one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ian Harkin founded Lottie, a toy company based in Donegal, Ireland that manufactures Barbie doll alternatives with a child&#39;s dimensions instead of an adult&#39;s, he began with international markets in mind from the very start. “In the toy industry, with very high up-front development costs, it&#39;s difficult to justify the expense to launch in just one country,” he explains. Harkin, the company&#39;s CEO, integrated their storefront into Amazon, and immediately reached customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Sweden, and Poland. Nearly 100% of the company&#39;s revenue today comes from outside of Ireland. Harkin points out, “For us, going global early helped our product and brand reach more potential customers, much faster, than if we would have expanded one country at a time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This growing phenomenon of going global as early as possible in the life of a business isn&#39;t only happening with physical products that can launch via global platforms like Amazon or Etsy. Partners at Andreessen Horowitz have written about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2022/07/20/the-company-of-the-future-is-default-global/&quot;>;new wave of “default global” companies&lt;/a>;, which radically compress the timeframe it takes to go global. They contrast these with “default local” firms, which often take five years before operating in just a few foreign markets. The default global companies are often in double the number of markets as default local companies are by year three. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/newsroom/stories/global-natives&quot;>;research from Stripe&lt;/a>; shows that 89% of successful tech companies had expanded internationally prior to achieving “unicorn” status, a valuation of $1 billion or higher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But building a global company is also more nuanced and complex than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, even if you&#39;re already having success as a global company, it&#39;s time to raise the bar. To sustain your success for the long term, you&#39;ll need to build not just a company that has customers or revenue streams from many different countries, but one that operates as a globally equitable organization (GEO for shorthand).&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Rise of the Globally Equitable Organization &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When I ran international expansion efforts for HubSpot, a large public tech company, over the space of nearly eight years, I noticed this pronounced shift toward continuous expansion happening before my eyes. But I also observed another important trend at play in the broader market. In the past, companies that sought to expand internationally measured their success strictly using qualitative measures, usually in the form of revenue or customer count from new markets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, with global becoming the new default, the goal is no longer as simple as just increasing revenue share from between different parts of the world. Instead, the new measure is more customer-oriented in nature. Companies have realized that it&#39;s not enough to initially acquire new customers in other geographies — retaining them is critical, as this ensures that revenue can be sustained. The best global companies ask themselves: How successful can our local customers be with our business in each market, without geography getting in the way?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Teamwork, a project management software company headquartered in Cork, Ireland. “You can sell software from anywhere in the world from the get-go. There are no boundaries,” explains Peter Coppinger, Teamwork CEO and co-founder. “One of the biggest lessons we learned with Teamwork&#39;s international expansion is that once you reach a certain scale, you need to get more deliberate about targeting the regions with the most potential.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the company deepened its presence in specific markets, Coppinger and team found that they needed to ramp up sales and customer talent in order to support customers in new time zones. “There is no substitute for having staff in the same time zone speaking the same language as your target customer,” he points out. When Teamwork recognized some customers were feeling this pain, they were proactive about creating a more equitable experience for all customers. Today, the company has 20,000 customers in 170 countries, and a global workforce of 350 employees in 15 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make Local Customer Experiences Equitable, Not Identical &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the digital age, it&#39;s easy to go global without adapting the customer experience. But if companies fail to make sufficient adaptations, they miss the chance to build true connections of value with their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Making local experiences equitable doesn&#39;t mean they have to be identical. In fact, where many companies go wrong is that they try to enforce a cookie-cutter approach onto all markets, in the name of “global leverage.” But in doing so, they miss out on the importance of local adaptations that ensure their customers across markets are equally happy with the value they&#39;re receiving, even if they define and derive that value in different ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a shining example, look no further than Starbucks. At the product level, customers can order many of the same standard menu items in every location globally. But to appeal to local tastes, a customer in Peru, where the Lúcuma fruit grows, can order a Lúcuma Crème Frappuccino from their local barista. Starbucks adapts not only their physical products, but their digital outreach to customers too. They achieve global consistency offline as well as online, but the company customizes their digital marketing campaigns in each country tied to the seasons, holidays, and local traditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The table below offers some examples of adaptations a company might make in order to ensure it is providing an equitable experience to customers in a new market:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;!-- table start -- Ensuring a Globally Equitable Experience -- -->;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;h4>;Ensuring a Globally Equitable Experience&lt;/h4>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;The table below offers some examples of adaptations a company might make in order to ensure it&#39;s providing an equitable customer experience as it enters new markets around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;>; &lt;thead>; &lt;tr>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Customer experience area&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Current home market approach&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Initial local market approach&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Why it&#39;s globally equitable&lt;/th>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/thead>; &lt;tbody>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Customer experience area&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MARKETING&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Current home market approach&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;A large website that has built up over the years with large amounts of content&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Initial local market approach&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;A microsite with just the core content that enables customers to understand the parts of your offering that matter most to them&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Why it&#39;s globally equitable&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;You didn&#39;t create such a large website for your home market overnight, so you don&#39;t need to localize all of it.

While this is a natural inclination, it actually can have the opposite effect and require investments that are disproportional for each local market. Instead of doing “all things in all markets,” be selective and show a true willingness to adapt. Encourage your employees to flex their creative muscles when thinking about what strategy will work best for a new local market so that they can derive equal value, even if the approaches vary.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Ensure Your Organization Has a Globally Equitable Mindset&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving what I call a GLOBE mindset, one that&#39;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic. This will ensure that all of your employees — not just those with “international” in their titles — keep the global equity momentum going in perpetuity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re launching a new global initiative at your company, I recommend asking these five questions to ensure your approach is equitable:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Geography-agnostic:&lt;/strong>; Is this project designed around the needs of customers in one market, or is it inclusive of multiple geographies?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Linguistically inclusive:&lt;/strong>; Have we considered the language and literacy needs of customers in the local markets we serve?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Operationalized: &lt;/strong>;Have we accounted for local differences with our plans, so we can prevent friction for local teams when it&#39;s time to execute?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Balanced:&lt;/strong>; Are our resources, especially funding and headcount, aligned to support our priority markets?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Empathetic:&lt;/strong>; Have we talked with customers and/or leaders of our local markets to ensure we are truly taking their needs into consideration?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;If you get into the habit of putting these five simple principles at the center of your leadership team&#39;s mindset, you&#39;ll naturally be driving equitable experiences for your customers around the globe.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, international expansion is more ongoing in nature, with a constant pace of change. The more you focus on driving up value across all markets in an equitable way, the greater the financial success that will follow — but only as a consequence of taking a new approach, one that places value on delivering equitable experiences to your local customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 30 Aug 2023 23:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
