&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/research-why-employees- Accept-lower-pay-at-mission-oriented-companies?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在一个有趣的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso&quot;>;HBO 情景喜剧《硅谷》的一集&lt;/a>;，一位笨拙的初创公司创始人接连推销他们的公司，宣称公司“让世界变得更美好”。这部讽刺喜剧凸显了公司宣传其工作如何造福人类福利的现象已变得多么普遍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种趋势——学者们称之为&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/ abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1172?&quot;>;社会影响框架&lt;/a>; — 似乎正在上升。我们在招聘启事、公司网站和消费者广告中都看到了这一点，营利性和非营利性组织都希望雇用“充满热情”和“以使命为导向”的员工，寻求“产生影响”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;如此强调社会影响并非没有道理。其一，它可以反映组织做出积极改变的热切愿望。它还可以通过灌输更大的自我价值感和意义来&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00266-008&quot;>;激励&lt;/a>;员工。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;也就是说，在我们最近在&lt;em>;组织科学&lt;/em>;上发表的&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.1675&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;中，我们发现组织的使用社会影响框架可能会给工人带来潜在的经济损失，因为它会阻止他们就更高的工资进行谈判。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;感知到的规范违规&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们通过五项实验研究探索了这种效应。处于社会影响框架条件下的求职者一致表示，要求更高的工资可能会被招聘组织视为贪婪且不合适。因此，他们没有进行谈判。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我们的第一项研究中，我们从在线研究平台招募了 392 名参与者，以调查员工对不同类型的组织信息的态度。大约一半的参与者阅读了一家强调社会影响的公司，而其他人则阅读了更通用的公司描述。我们要求参与者就他们是否愿意协商为该公司提供工作机会以及原因进行开放式回答。我们发现，那些收到包含社会影响框架条件的公司描述的人进行谈判的可能性降低了 32%。这种沉默的最常见原因是参与者认为谈判会被视为自私和反规范，并使他们面临被这份工作拒绝的风险。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的第二项研究涉及 438 名本科生响应校园内的工作机会，他们将招募同学为教育行业的初创公司工作。学生们观看了一段介绍性视频，视频中所谓的公司创始人兼首席执行官（由训练有素的演员扮演）描述了他的招聘组织。大约一半的参与者观看了创始人强调社会影响的视频，而另一半观看了创始人描述了一个专注于高质量工作和成功的更通用组织的视频。观看视频后，参与者有机会要求更高的工资，而不是接受最初提供的工资。与我们的第一项研究一致，处于社会影响状态的学生进行谈判的可能性降低了 43%。同样，这种效应是由于人们认为表现出对高薪的兴趣会违反组织的员工激励规范而产生的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在其他三项研究中复制了这些结果。我们发现，这种影响在工作场所模拟以及教育、医疗保健、制造和金融等一系列行业中都存在。我们还发现，社会影响框架在很大程度上影响求职者对金钱工作奖励（例如工资和奖金）的要求。这似乎并没有阻止他们要求假期和医疗保健福利等非金钱奖励。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;关于金钱和做好事的假设&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;什么解释了对金钱工作奖励的影响吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;答案在于人们普遍和长期的信念，即金钱会玷污对工作本身的热爱和行善的企图。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，经理有被证明持有“&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2017.0617&quot;>;动机纯度偏见&lt;/a>;”，他们认为员工对材料感兴趣工作奖励（外在奖励）较少受到工作本身性质（内在奖励）的激励，因此不太值得被雇用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种信念是基于错误的前提。研究表明，外在动机和内在动机&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035661&quot;>;&lt;em>;共同&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;共同预测高工作绩效。此外，一种动机的增加并不意味着另一种动机的减少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管如此，在我们的研究中，求职者似乎表现得好像他们意识到管理层对工人物质利益的偏见奖励。因此，在具有社会影响力的背景下——尤其希望员工受到更高尚的动机（例如更高的目标感）的驱动——求职者会对任何表明他们可能也关心金钱的迹象进行自我审查。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>; &lt;strong>;求职者和招聘经理的要点&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;从马克思主义的角度来看，社会影响框架可能被视为另一种文化趋势，它无意中有利于资本所有者，并在工人的费用。然而，鉴于社会影响框架往往植根于组织为社会做出贡献的真正努力，并且也能让员工受益，因此建议组织停止传达其对更大利益的重视就过于简单化了。因此，我们提出了几项建议，以帮助最大限度地减少接触此类消息的工人的财务损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从工人的角度来看，求职者可以投资&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/how-to -evaluate-accept-reject-or-negotiate-a-job-offer&quot;>;培养他们的谈判技巧&lt;/a>;，这样他们就可以避免在组织使用社会影响框架时轻易被抛弃。他们还可以调查那些声称关心人类福利的组织&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/how-to-tell-if-a-pottial-employer-has-a-burnout-culture&quot;>;如何对待自己的员工&lt;/a>;。如果一家强调社会影响的公司忽视了员工的福祉、财务或其他方面，那将是具有讽刺意味的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;组织还可以考虑对经理进行培训，让他们了解他们对员工外在动机的偏见，如上所述，可能是毫无根据的。事实上，例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2014.0898&quot;>;供养家人&lt;/a>;的愿望被发现是一种强烈的愿望工作绩效的预测因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过浪漫化内在动机并条件反射地解雇那些对外在工作奖励表现出任何兴趣的求职者，组织可能会拒绝那些同样对工作充满热情并且很可能一直很优秀的优秀候选人。高绩效者。尤其重要的是，努力采取道德方法开展业务的组织可以避免以马基雅维利式的方式部署社会影响框架，将其作为故意压低薪酬的工具。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot; /2023/07/why-companies-can-and-should-recommit-to-dei-in-the-wake-of-the-scotus-decision?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/why-companies-can-and-should-recommit-to-dei-in-the-wake-of-the-scotus-decision?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/ a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;美国最高法院最近禁止平权行动的决定，特别是在学院和大学中禁止具有种族意识的招生，可能不会直接影响美国的工作场所，但毫无疑问，美国企业界需要考虑这一影响——以及未来潜在的司法裁决和州立法 - 将对其 DEI 实践产生影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至少，我们在高等教育机构中看到的学生群体构成的任何变化也会影响招聘渠道。例如，当加州大学系统于 1995 年取消平权行动时，加州大学洛杉矶分校的黑人学生比例从 7% 下降（相比之下，美国人口为 13.6%，该州为 6.5%）&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/politics/affirmative-action-ban-states.html&quot;>;短短三年内达到 3.9%&lt;/a>; 和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi .org/blog/the-supreme-courts-ban-on-affirmative-action-means-colleges-will-struggle-to-meet-goals-of-diversity-and-equal-opportununity/&quot;>;低于 2%到 2006 年&lt;/a>;。同样，当密歇根大学禁止平权行动时，黑人本科生入学率从 2006 年的 7% 下降（相比之下，该州人口的入学率为 13.6%）&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10 /31/us/politics/affirmative-action-ban-states.html&quot;>;2021 年达到 4%&lt;/a>;。这些案例研究表明，当大学取消平权行动时，它们会产生一个不太多样化的候选人库供雇主利用，而这种情况现在很可能在全国范围内发生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加剧了这种情况，现在还有&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/anti-dei-legislation-tracker/&quot;>;超过 30 项州或地方法案&lt;/a>;针对学校的 DEI 资助、实践和推广。例如，德克萨斯州从 2024 年 1 月 1 日起禁止所有 DEI 办公室、公共机构进行多元化培训和“意识形态宣誓和声明”，这可能意味着在校园招聘的公司需要审查其信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;然而，还有比多元化招聘更重要的事情。作为管理思想领袖和工作场所种族问题的专家学者，我们预计会产生许多额外的连锁反应。该裁决已被解读为邀请 DEI 批评者质疑此类努力的有效性、合法性和必要性。例如，右翼倡导组织消费者研究的执行董事威尔希尔德&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-business-多样性/&quot;>;已经公开表示&lt;/a>;表示，最高法院关于平权行动的决定“将为像我们这样的团体带来风帆，他们希望摆脱基于种族的雇佣和晋升计划美国企业界。”共和党领导的 13 个州的总检察长也发送了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/attorneygeneral/documents/pr/2023/pr23-27-letter.pdf&quot;>;致财富 100 强公司首席执行官的一封信&lt;/a>;，警告称，根据 SCOTUS，“多元化、公平和包容”的标签现在“非法且错误”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，大学招生受以下法律管辖： 《民权法案》&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/TitleVI&quot;>;第六章&lt;/a>;，禁止任何计划中基于种族、肤色或国籍的歧视或接受联邦财政援助的活动。私人就业属于&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964&quot;>;第七章&lt;/a>;的规定，由美国平等就业机会委员会执行目前由夏洛特·A·伯罗斯 (Charlotte A. Burrows) 领导的平等就业机会委员会 (EEOC)，她强调 SCOTUS 的决定与其工作无关。她在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/statement-eeoc-chair-charlotte-burrows-supreme-court-ruling-college-affirmative-action&quot;>;一份声明&lt;/a>;中说”，“它没有涉及雇主努力培养多元化和包容性的劳动力或吸引所有合格工人的才能，无论他们的背景如何。雇主实施多元化、公平、包容性和无障碍计划，以确保所有背景的工人在工作场所获得平等机会，仍然是合法的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这意味着大多数企业 DEI 努力在形式上是安全的。现在。然而，对于组织来说，关注不断变化的形势非常重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;退后一步&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首先，让我们考虑一下我们是否仍然认为种族应该是在制定组织决策时予以考虑。这部分取决于我们是否认为种族主义仍然影响着我们的社会。如果我们这样做，那么建议考虑种族的干预措施似乎是合理的。如果我们不这样做（或者如果我们接受种族主义），那么建议考虑种族的干预措施似乎是难以置信和不公正的。那么，我们问你，种族主义仍然影响我们的社会吗？我们关心吗？考虑一下对美国黑人的系统性压迫，他们长期以来被错误地视为美国平权行动的代言人（而研究表明&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-who-benefits-white-women/70371219007/&quot;>;白人女性&lt;/a>;反而是此类政策的最大受益者）。即使在1865年废除奴隶制之后，美国仍然继续在法律、政治和社会制度中将压迫黑人的行为编入法典。从战后&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/southern-black-codes.html&quot;>;《黑人法典》&lt;/a>;到 1896 年&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/plessy-v-ferguson&quot;>;普莱西诉弗格森案&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;最高法院判决&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/a-brief-history-of-jim-crow&quot;>;美国南部的吉姆·克劳法&lt;/a>;，白人权力结构剥夺了黑人的完全公民身份并受到法律的平等保护。反措施，包括国会采取的行动，如具有里程碑意义的第十三、十四和十五修正案，最高法院1954年布朗诉教育委员会案的裁决，以及最终禁止公共场所、学校和工作场所种族歧视的1964年民权法案，代表进步。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，在奴隶制后的一个多世纪里，黑人被剥夺了职业发展和创造财富的能力，在专业工作场所和领导角色中的代表性仍然不成比例地不足。正如研究人员托尼·梅奥和劳拉·摩根·罗伯茨&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/toward-a-racially-just-workplace&quot;>;描述的&lt;/a>;，他们比白人同龄人更不可能被雇用、发展，并晋升。根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports 的数据，其他种族人口——拉丁美洲人、美洲原住民、太平洋岛民——面临着不同类型的歧视，并且在高收入角色和职业中的代表性也不足。 /race-and-ethnicity/2020/home.htm&quot;>;数据来自劳工统计局&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://extramural-diversity.nih.gov/diversity-matters/underrepresented-groups ”行业团体&lt;/a>;。这表明种族主义确实仍然影响着我们的社会。美国没有实现其建国理想，即让所有公民平等地追求生命、自由和幸福。我们应该关心并继续努力实现这些目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下一个要问的问题是我们是否认为多元化的团队有利于组织绩效。大量研究表明，他们会做出&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;更明智的决策&lt;/a>;并且&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/the-other-diversity-股息&quot;>;更好的投资&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-investing-in-dei-helps-companies-become-more-adaptable&quot;>;适应性更强&lt;/a>;，以及&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance&quot;>;当他们所处的企业文化具有支持性时，推动创新&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03 /research-to-excel-diverse-teams-need-psychological-safety&quot;>;心理安全&lt;/a>;之一。多元化且训练有素的员工队伍和领导团队也更适合与多元化的员工、客户和供应商互动。因此，支持 DEI 的努力仍然有道德和商业理由。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些企业领导人可能仍然想知道，鉴于最近对平权行动的攻击，他们是否应该重新考虑整个 DEI 战略。最简洁的答案是不。现在还不是推翻他们在 2020 年乔治·弗洛伊德被谋杀后对种族平等做出的承诺的时候。相反，是时候围绕 DEI 澄清组织价值观，清楚地传达这些价值观，并确保人员管理流程与其保持一致。在这里，我们解释了在美国历史的这个关键时刻如何解决这个问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;重新思考标签&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;标签&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;鉴于SCOTUS 裁决、其他悬而未决的州立法，以及这 13 名总检察长和一些法律学者的警告 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-business-diversity /&quot;>;建议&lt;/a>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;公司应先行保护自己，从 DEI 标签转向受法律明确保护的标签。例如，您将拥有第七章合规官，而不是首席多元化官。另一种选择是使用“包容”、“归属”和“参与”等词语来强调目标是改善组织文化，而不一定是种族多样性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们敦促在这方面保持谨慎，因为 DEI 仍然很重要给员工。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.bfldr.com/ZZ11QL2O/at/6bpw94vrt588vtc8gr3fgw5/C001_Benevity_TheStateofWorkplaceDEI_Final.pdf?hsCtaTracking=e0c17c58-a6ca-4e73-978b-87718706789f%7C579 28514-8a0c-4227-bf1f-498f3e23c304&quot; >;2023 年福利调查&lt;/a>;发现，95% 的人在选择薪资和福利相似的工作机会时会权衡未来雇主的 DEI 努力，78% 的人&lt;em>;不会&lt;/em>;考虑为一家公司工作未能为 DEI 计划投入大量资源。如果组织回避 DEI 标签，来自历史上边缘化背景的员工几乎肯定会感到被忽视和贬低。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，任何好的 DEI 策略都需要定期评估，以确保其按照既定目标执行并实现预期目标对员工的影响。当面临重大组织变革或新规则和法规时，领导者应该建立一个系统来&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ellavatesolutions.com/the-ellavate-approach&quot;>;调整现有的 DEI&lt; /a>; 策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;审核流程&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;招聘&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;正如前面强调的，我们可以预期少数种族边缘化个人被白人占主导地位的机构 (PWI) 录取，因此仍在寻求候选人库多样性的公司将需要到其他地方寻找尽可能多的多样性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个解决方案是增加传统黑人学院和大学 (HBCU)、西班牙裔服务机构 (HSI) 和部落学院和大学 (TCU) 等机构的招生。另一种方法是考虑非传统途径，例如社区大学，并与专注于种族多元化渠道的社区组织建立合作伙伴关系，例如 &lt;a href=&quot;https://oneten.org/about/mission/&quot;>;OneTen&lt;/a >;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们还建议转向&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/skills-based-hiring-is-on-the-rise&quot;>;基于技能的招聘&lt;/a>;，完善的 DEI 最佳实践，侧重于求职者和角色之间的技能匹配，而不是只关注教育和经验。考虑与 &lt;a href=&quot;https://opportunityatwork.org/stars/&quot;>;STARS&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://mlt.org/&quot;>;MLT&lt;/a>;、&lt; a href=&quot;https://reachingoutmba.org/&quot;>;ROMBA&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://toigofoundation.org/&quot;>;Toigo 基金会&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;http:// /www.fortefoundation.org/site/PageServer&quot;>;Forte Foundation&lt;/a>;（全面披露：后两者是 Tina 的客户），帮助确定雇主需要的人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;入职&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;入职&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;许多公司现在将 DEI 教育作为其入职计划的一部分。但他们不能再假设员工是否准备好进行这些对话。例如，在佛罗里达州公立机构接受教育的学生现在明确&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2023/05/23/what-the-desantis-agenda-means-for-佛罗里达州高等教育“禁止&lt;/a>;修读“教授身份政治，或基于系统性种族主义、性别歧视、压迫和特权是美国机构固有的理论”的课程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，雇主可能需要进行调查，以了解新员工对 DEI 的了解程度，并更加小心地向新团队成员解释为什么这些原则对组织很重要，而不仅仅是它们的实施方式。&lt; /p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;绩效评估、薪酬、晋升&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;随着 DEI 工作受到更加严格的审查，更有理由确保您的人员流程公平。绩效评估以及薪酬和晋升决策应基于标准和客观的数据，但大量研究表明它们仍然充满偏见，特别是对于历史上被边缘化的种族群体的成员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/how-one-company-worked-to-root-out-bias-from-performance-reviews&quot;>;一项研究&lt;/a>;发现 90% 的有色人种，但只有 72%白人在评论中收到了有关他们个性的注释。现在是&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/how-one-company-worked-to-root-out-bias-from-performance-reviews&quot;>;审核这些流程&lt;/a>;的好时机，这样就没有人可以争辩说你偏爱一个种族的人而不是另一个种族的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;谨慎沟通&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org /politics/2023/06/08/more-americans-disapprove-than-approve-of-colleges-considering-race-ethnicity-in-admissions-decisions/&quot;>;公众投票&lt;/a>;是员工对平权行动的裁决将取决于他们的种族和民族、政治立场以及他们如何看待平权行动的框架。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;熟练的管理者应该能够表达和解决不同的意见，表现出同理心，创造员工反馈和支持系统，并定期就这些问题进行沟通。可以使用的工具包括一对一会议（如果少数员工高度关注）；市政厅（如果很多人担心的话）；电子邮件（如果很多人兴趣不强）；或者只是暂时监控情况（如果大多数人的意识仍然较低）。对话可能会很困难，但对于团队来说&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/dig-bridge-collectively-act&quot;>;很重要深入研究有时两极分化的话题，弥合分歧，并在可能的情况下就集体行动达成一致。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成功沟通的基石是包括来自可信渠道的研究，但在这些两极分化的时代，它可以很难找到&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/01/24/us-media-polarization-and-the-2020-election-a-nation-divided/&quot;>;来源&lt; /a>; 受到所有员工的信任。我们建议识别多个并向员工解释审查过程。组织还可以通过开展调查来了解不同观点、识别并寻求各方非正式领导者的意见而受益。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有了事实和意见，领导者将能够更好地传达关于他们的信息的有效信息。 DEI 计划。例如，他们可能会承认，一些员工不同意有种族意识的招聘，或者认为出于法律或节省成本的原因，应该放弃 DEI 的努力，但会解释说，组织会优先考虑通过拥有更多元化的团队或团队来增加创新。只需拥有一支代表更广泛社会的劳动力队伍即可。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个人都参与到这个问题中来，这一点很重要。虽然有些组织将 DEI 归咎于 HR 和 HR 本身，但这是一个错误。从一线经理到首席执行官的每个人都应该理解和传达关于 DEI 的信息和承诺，尤其是在现在种族紧张局势依然严重且平权行动等政策受到质疑的情况下。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;仆人式领导理念 &amp;#8212;将团队的需求置于自己的需求之上为我们带来了一个更加富有同情心、以人为本的工作环境。但在当今的环境下，这会导致倦怠。相反，作者提出了一种更具影响力的哲学，称为“崇高目标领导力”。它将领导者和团队成员联系起来，共同追求对选民产生积极影响的共同目标。在仆人式领导中，传达的信息是：你的角色是服务他人，这使得你很容易专注于取悦他人，而很难拒绝。在崇高目标的领导力中，传达的信息是：你有责任发挥影响力。这需要更多的战略思考来决定你的努力应该放在哪里。作者提出了三个领域，管理者可以将目光转向崇高目标的领导力。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;当罗伯特·格林利夫 (Robert Greenleaf) 创造了短语“&lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/&quot;>;仆人式领导&lt;/a>;”在 1970 年一篇开创性的文章中指出，这是对传统命令与控制领导模式的急需改进。盛行了几个世纪。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“仆人式领导首先是仆人。它始于人们想要服务的自然感觉。然后有意识的选择就会让人渴望成为领导者，”格林利夫写道。 “这个人与首先成为领导者的人截然不同，也许是因为需要缓解不寻常的权力驱动力或获得物质财富。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有据可查的研究告诉我们，组织和个人&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/how-humble-leadership-really-works&quot;>;当领导者关注团队而不是自己时，表现会更好&lt;/a>;。在个人层面上，仆人式领导&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regent.edu/journal/emerging-leadership-journeys/impact-of-servant-leadership/&quot;>;增加&lt;/a>;追随者的信任和忠诚度，以及对领导者的满意度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，自格林利夫最初的文章发表以来的 50 年里，特别是在过去三年里，发生了很大的变化。仆人式领导背后的叙述越来越平淡，这是有充分理由的：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;严重的倦怠。&lt;/strong>;在当今的环境中，当领导者感到疲倦、过度劳累和压力时，服务可以感觉就像从空杯子里倒水一样。我们告诉经理，“你来这里是为了为你的团队服务。”我们告诉面向客户的团队，“你是来为客户服务的。”总而言之，这让人筋疲力尽。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;人们更加忙碌&lt;/strong>;。当格林利夫最初引入仆人式领导时，典型的经理可能会监督一个小型职能团队。他们没有自己的可交付成果，没有参与多个跨职能计划，也没有在一天开始时回复大量隔夜电子邮件。 &amp;nbsp;Today, as middle management continues to thin out, leaders typically have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/how-to-identify-the-right-spans-of-control-for-your-organization&quot;>;between 11 to 15 direct reports&lt;/a>; and their own high stakes deliverables. These exhausted managers often feel they don&#39;t have the time to devote to servitude.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Workplaces have become less hierarchical&lt;/strong>;. Today&#39;s org charts often resemble a jungle gym more than they do a &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/08/stop-offering-career-ladders-start-offering-career-portfolios&quot;>;ladder&lt;/a>;. Leading without formal authority is on the rise and begs the question: Who is the servant and who is served?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Servant leadership was a crucial stepping-stone into a more humane world of work.但下一个演变即将到来。 &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/to-retain-employees-give-them-a-sense-of-purpose-and-community&quot;>;The workplace data&lt;/a>; (and our own experiences) tells us that we&#39;re at an inflection point. We&#39;re standing in a moment in time where leaders, both formal and informal, must move forward towards a more purposeful leadership style that focuses on the impact that the organization&#39;s work has on real live human beings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We refer to this impact-driven philosophy as “noble-purpose leadership.” It&#39;s when leaders and teammates alike are in shared pursuit of a cause bigger than themselves (their team, their customers, their community) and their goal is to positively impact their constituents (versus serving them).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a nuanced, yet distinct shift. In servant-driven leadership, the crux of the message is: &lt;em>;You&#39;re in your role to serve others&lt;/em>;. This makes it very hard to say no, and there&#39;s a temptation for leaders (and their teams) to be reactive, trying to please everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In noble-purpose leadership, the core message is: &lt;em>;You&#39;re in your role to make an impact&lt;/em>;. This requires more strategic thinking in terms of where to place your efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When your North Star is a shared purpose, leaders have more choice in the matter;你不觉得需要取悦所有人。 In our consulting practice, we&#39;ve seen first-hand evidence that noble-purpose leadership can be an effective evolution toward driving better performance while staying true to a culture of service.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are three areas where managers can shift their lens towards noble-purpose leadership:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Employee Interactions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Managers are often taught to ask their people questions like: What can I do to help you be successful?您需要我提供什么样的支持？虽然这些都是很好的问题（而且肯定会比咆哮命令得到更好的结果），但善意的领导者发现自己在这些互动中留下了一份令人筋疲力尽的行动项目清单。 After a few experiences like that, overworked managers often find it easier not to even ask their team what kind of help they need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rather than giving up on the idea of being supportive, managers can create a subtle, yet powerful shift by calibrating to a higher purpose, and asking questions like: What do &lt;em>;you &lt;/em>;need to be successful in accomplishing our goal? What help will &lt;em>;you&lt;/em>; need to get?这种微小的语言变化重塑了情感动态。领导者不必独自负责支持员工，而是询问员工他们需要什么才能成功，从而创造一种共同的责任感。 The leader is purposefully positioning themselves to have a positive impact on the employee&#39;s results, yet they&#39;re not taking on sole responsibility for supporting them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a before and after of how this worked for a client of ours, a vice president who was stretched thin with 12 direct reports and an endless list of their own deliverables. Being a servant leader felt exhausting and impossible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The VP started asking their project managers, “Given our purpose to positively impact our customers, what kind of support will you need to get this done well, and on time?” The project managers quickly determined they needed resources and support from another department to meet the deadline.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Had the VP stuck with the traditional, “What do you need from me?”双方都会遭受损失。副总裁的工作量超出了他们的能力范围，而项目经理也不会与其他部门合作。 With a sightline to the shared purpose (successfully completing a project that improves life for customers), both the leader and their team members become more empowered and effective.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Decision Making &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When your primary focus is to serve, the temptation is to focus on pleasing people&lt;em>; — &lt;/em>;an endless and often fruitless, endeavor. &amp;nbsp;Many elements of work, like tight deadlines and challenging feedback, are inherently displeasing, no matter what the leader does.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a leader frames their decisions solely through a lens of trying to be as helpful and supportive to their constituents as possible, it&#39;s a recipe for burnout.最坏的情况是，它滋生了权利，员工认为领导者的工作就是让他们快乐，什么也不做。 The sum of this emotional turmoil can keep leaders from making tough (but correct) decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, leaders can frame their decisions around purpose.例如，在会议中，不要问：你对此有何看法？这对你有用吗？领导们可以问：这会产生什么影响？ How will this affect our people or our customers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Katherine, the head of customer success for a medical device company, used this model to shift her team from complaining to action.该团队的部分职能是让客户及时了解交货时间。这包括当客户的订单延迟时给他们打电话。在经历了特别令人沮丧的一天之后，她的团队向凯瑟琳提出了一个请求：他们不想再拨打这些电话。 Her team lamented &lt;em>;“Some customers don&#39;t even notice if their order was delayed!”&lt;/em>; Others piled on, &lt;em>;“We can&#39;t speed up the delivery truck! What&#39;s the point of calling? If they&#39;re worried, they call us.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A leader simply trying to please the team would have been tempted to let the team stop making the calls or they might have taken on the calls themselves. &amp;nbsp;Instead, Katherine used questions to recalibrate the team to a higher purpose.她问道：“如果我们的顾客措手不及，不知道订单会延迟，会对他们产生什么影响？ How would it impact our reputation if we stop being proactive and are only reactive?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seemingly simple shift of the lens prompted the team to think about how their work impacts the overarching purpose of the organization. It changed their thought process: Rather than focusing on their own reaction, they began &amp;nbsp;considering the impact on the team and seeing themselves as part of the larger whole.团队决定继续拨打电话，但轮换职责，这样每个人就不必每天都拨打电话。 Recalibrating the team towards a higher purpose, reduces the pressure on the leader and increases buy-in from the team.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Coaching&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A primary function of any leader is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;coaching their team&lt;/a>;. However, when coaching is added on top of deliverables, leaders may struggle to invest time in the development of their people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, during a coaching program we ran for a group of sales managers in the hospitality industry, participants opened up about feeling overwhelmed.该组织拥有卓越的文化，管理者通常希望领导他们的团队做好工作。 Yet, as travel began to boom, and they added more salespeople, managers found themselves stretched thin.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We asked the managers, “Who do you coach?”他们的答案几乎是一致的：表现最差的人。 Yet, the sales managers lamented that despite their sizeable coaching investments, the poor performers were showing marginal improvement at best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We then shifted the lens from servant leadership to noble-purpose leadership. Instead of asking who needs coaching the most, we suggested managers ask themselves: Where will my coaching time have the biggest impact?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The managers started to look at their team through a different lens: Who is the most coachable?谁学得快？ Who has the most at stake with their customers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the program ended, these managers began to invest more of their time in their high and mid-performers.他们亲自指导高绩效员工如何获得最高价值的机会。他们通过团体辅导圈和同伴角色扮演给予中层表现更多的关注。 They didn&#39;t abandon coaching the bottom tier, but instead of spending hours of their coaching time, they directed lower performers to own more of their learning, via on-demand courses, self-study, etc.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results followed quickly: High performers got even better, and mid-performers improved too. What&#39;s also interesting is that low performers did one of three things:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Worked their way to become middle performers&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Stayed the course, making the same marginal improvements as they did when they were taking nearly all of their manager&#39;s coaching time&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Or, when faced with the challenge of taking some ownership in their development, they self-selected out — a process that happened faster and with less frustration than a manager spending hours of time trying to coach a player who doesn&#39;t want to improve.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Overall, the team drove record revenue, and they were more fulfilled doing it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Servant leadership brought us to a more compassionate, human-centered work environment.现在是我们进行下一次飞跃的时候了。 In today&#39;s environment, burned-out leaders endlessly trying to serve will struggle to drive the innovation, resilience, and sense of meaning required for future growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Elevating the lens to noble-purpose leadership has the power to unite employees and managers in the pursuit of making a difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Overcoming Your Fear of Giving Tough Feedback]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_26_1379555.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Juan Moyano/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;A lack of constructive feedback is detrimental to your team, depriving them of mentorship and growth opportunities. And workplaces marked by poor communication and unclear expectations are breeding grounds for low trust and disengagement. Giving feedback is essential to being an effective leader. In this article, the author offers five ways to overcome your fear of giving feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“I felt like I was going to throw up,” Filip confessed to me during our coaching session. “Giving feedback is something a leader should be able to do every day without breaking a sweat,” he said. “But for me, it feels like the end of the world.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Filip was the director of project management at a company that offered translation services for streaming content providers across the globe. Hard working (sometimes to a fault), Filip was an expert at juggling multiple priorities, coordinating translators, quality control experts, and client liaisons across time zones, languages, and cultures. He had a knack for thriving in ambiguity, keeping his eye on strategic goals without getting lost in minutiae.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Filip also prided himself on always having his team&#39;s back, even if it involved taking the heat from an irate executive. But when it came to delivering feedback to his direct reports, Filip&#39;s resilient exterior crumbled. He would be overcome with worries of damaging the relationships he had worked so hard to build. He&#39;d overthink what to say for hours &lt;/span>;— &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;sometimes days. The mere thought of uttering the words, “I have some feedback for you,” made him nauseous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;When a high-stakes project spearheaded by Angelique, one of Filip&#39;s brightest team members, failed, it brought his fear of giving feedback into sharp focus. For two weeks Filip had sensed something was amiss. The team&#39;s low spirits and sluggish performance concerned him, but he told himself Angelique would pull everything together in the end. He never voiced his concerns, and the cost was devastating. Their biggest account would now be going to a different provider who could provide better service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“I could have prevented this. I should have spoken up.” Filip told me. His story echoes a struggle I hear from many of my executive coaching clients: How do I overcome the fear of giving feedback?&lt;/span>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Whether you worry about causing tension, demotivating your people, or handling others&#39; emotional reactions, conflict aversion is a common trait, and managers aren&#39;t immune to it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;You&#39;re not doing anyone a favor by avoiding conflict. When problems go unaddressed or are swept under the rug, everyone suffers, including you. A lack of constructive feedback is also detrimental to your team, depriving them of mentorship and growth opportunities. Workplaces marked by poor communication and unclear expectations are breeding grounds for low trust and disengagement.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Here&#39;s how to navigate the sense of discomfort and apprehension that comes with difficult conversations, so you can say what needs to be said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Challenge binary thinking.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Many leaders who avoid confrontation carry assumptions like, “no one likes a micromanager,” or “bringing up this issue will ruin our working relationship.” While these beliefs may stem from past experiences with rejection and failure, they reflect inaccurate, binary thinking. In actuality, it&#39;s possible to be both assertive and direct without damaging relationships or earning a reputation as the “difficult manager.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Instead, focus on what you could gain by speaking up and the potential rewards of clear communication. Not only will voicing your thoughts help you feel more confident, but:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Your input may be exactly what&#39;s needed to drive a challenging assignment to completion&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;That candid comment you make to a coworker about their disruptive behavior could result in a more peaceful, productive work environment.&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Your constructive criticism could help a team member develop and grow in their role, opening up new career opportunities&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;When you look more closely, you&#39;ll see that expressing your thoughts, feelings, and opinions is far more beneficial than stuffing them down and suffering the consequences.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;See feedback as a tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Despite what you may believe, your team craves meaningful, candid feedback. While 72% of employees &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-people-crave-feedback-and-why-were-afraid-to-give-it&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;rated&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; “managers providing critical feedback” as important for them in career development, only 5% believe managers provide such feedback. Likewise, when team members don&#39;t think their boss is great at giving honest feedback, their engagement scores &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/overcoming-feedback-phobia-take-the-first-step&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;typically&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; take a nosedive. But on the flip side, leaders who rank in the top 10% at giving honest feedback create teams that rank in the top 23% of engagement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;It&#39;s not fair to deprive your team of information they need to grow. When you reframe conflict as a healthy, normative part of leadership, it loosens the anticipatory anxiety you may feel broaching difficult topics with others. Next time you have to give feedback, take a deep breath and remember, you&#39;re not causing a conflict, you&#39;re guiding your people toward growth. You&#39;re not criticizing; you&#39;re nurturing. And you&#39;re certainly not being a villain; you&#39;re being the leader they need.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Anticipate eventualities.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Fear of the unknown or wondering how the recipient will react can hold many leaders back from ever speaking up. What if your direct report becomes defensive and lashes out at you? What if they start crying?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;You can calm your anxiety and handle uncertainty using the worst case/best case/most likely tool. Consider the worst that could happen. If your employee cries, for example, how would you handle it? Perhaps you&#39;d take a time out. Then consider the best that could possibly happen to foster more optimism. Finally, consider what is most likely, which is usually somewhere between the two extremes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Start strong.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;You can also ease your whirlwind of thoughts by planning your opening. Being in control from the get-go can provide a confidence boost and allows you to set a respectful tone for the conversation. Once Filip realized he needed to tackle the situation with Angelique head on, he approached her and said: “I appreciate your dedication and creativity. Something I wanted to talk about is a pattern of low morale, and I want to understand if there are any obstacles that we can address together.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Using “I” statements whenever possible helps ensure you communicate directly without vacillating or minimizing your concerns simply because you&#39;re scared. Being specific is also important. Rather than saying, “You dropped the ball again,” try saying, “I&#39;m concerned that I didn&#39;t get the documents in time for the client meeting today.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Make feedback part of the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Feedback should be a regular ritual, not an occasional blast. Making feedback a habit ensures the tiny annoyances and frustrations you harbor don&#39;t blow up into major conflicts. Plus, gradually exposing yourself to fearful situations is the best way to overcome them. The more you practice giving feedback in lower-stakes, everyday scenarios as part of your role, the better at it you&#39;ll become.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;A great way to systematize feedback is through regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/28-questions-to-ask-your-boss-in-your-one-on-ones&quot;>;one-on-ones&lt;/a>; with your team. You can also schedule project debriefs where team members can reflect, or pre-mortems where people can discuss in advance any risks, potential problems, and flesh out how they&#39;ll work with one another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Creating a positive feedback culture will give you opportunities to flex your newfound assertiveness skills while also strengthening rapport and trust with your team.

That&#39;s a concern because anticipating things like industry trends, future skills requirements, and customer needs is central to a leader&#39;s success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to management consultant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strategy-business.com/article/10938&quot;>;Elliott Jaques&lt;/a>;, the higher you go in an organization, the further out you need to think.虽然直线经理可能必须维持一个季度的计划，但首席执行官需要考虑 10 年后业务的发展状况。 Jacques called this concept “time span.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The challenge, of course, is that thinking about the future is difficult in the best of times.人们思考的越多，就越难注意到可以提供有关可能的未来的见解的安静信号。 Our brains also have to battle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00345&quot;>;distance bias&lt;/a>;, which causes us to prioritize ideas and decisions closer in time over things further in the future. What&#39;s more, only 16% of the executive leadership programs we studied have outcomes dedicated to thinking about the future, and the numbers are even lower for mid-level and first-time leader programs, at 4% and 6%, respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, research suggests the habit of thinking about and predicting the future is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xap-0000040.pdf&quot;>;learnable &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xap-0000040.pdf&quot;>;skill&lt;/a>;, and it&#39;s one of many cognitive skills leaders can and should learn as part of leadership training.一种开始方法是每月划出时间，并为您希望团队在三到六个月内达到的“未来状态”制定计划。 Using that vision, then work backwards to determine what you&#39;d need to do to get your team to that destination in the next six months.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Your People Are Everything&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Leaders are jugglers — and the things they juggle are often at odds.以领导者的总体责任为例：制定能够创造成功成果的业务战略。 And yet, they must also be good at connecting with and motivating their people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two tasks are often at odds because people often get promoted to leadership positions &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/transform-your-technical-expertise-into-leadership&quot;>;because of technical competence&lt;/a>;, not personability. Social neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/should-leaders-focus-on-results-or-on-people&quot;>;points out&lt;/a>; that a leader who is both technically competent and highly personable is somewhat of a unicorn.他引用了一项研究，其中一位被视为注重结果的领导者（结合了强大的分析能力和前进和解决问题的强烈动力）只有 14% 的机会被视为伟大的领导者。 If a leader was strong only with social skills — attributes like communication and empathy — they were seen as a great leader even less, only 12%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for leaders who were strong in both results &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; social skills, the likelihood of being seen as a great leader skyrocketed to 72%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So how many of these unicorns are out there? One of us (David), along with Tricia Naddaff, CEO of Management Research Group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-at-work/201310/find-out-how-many-leaders-are-both-goal-and-people-focused&quot;>;analyzed&lt;/a>; data from thousands of employees in which people rated their bosses on goal focus and people focus. Less than 1% of leaders were rated high on both.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out there&#39;s a neurological reason for this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://membership.neuroleadership.com/material/how-power-affects-behavior-and-decision-making/&quot;>;Neuroimaging studies&lt;/a>; have shown a seesaw effect exists for the separate brain centers responsible for goal focus and people focus: When one dials up, the other dials down. What&#39;s more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167207301011&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that as an individual&#39;s power increases, the brain&#39;s goal-focus network becomes dominant. This process is adaptive because to make effective decisions as a leader, one must often detach from the needs of every individual and view them more as chess pieces than human beings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting the right balance between goal and people focus is the key.但根据我们的研究，只有 58% 的高管领导力项目关注人员成果，其中中层领导者和初次领导者分别占 64% 和 51%。 Knowing this, leaders can cultivate the right balance by being more intentional about sending the signals to employees that they&#39;re cared for.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Drive Realistic Results &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;One of the biggest conundrums of leadership is the way our brains perceive power. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.324&quot;>;individuals perceive themselves&lt;/a>; to be more powerful, they tend to become more optimistic. This often leads to unrealistic targets and inflated expectations, which can cause a disconnect between leaders and their direct reports who are doing the heavy lifting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is that leaders become more “&lt;a href=&quot;https://membership.neuroleadership.com/material/how-power-affects-behavior-and-decision-making/&quot;>;vision-focused&lt;/a>;” and less concerned with detail.拥有权力感会积极地触发我们的大脑，让我们感觉良好，就像赢得金钱或获得奖励一样。 As soon as the brain is triggered this way, it seeks to activate more of those rewards by directing our behavior to power-rewarding activities, like thinking big picture or pursuing goals rather than focusing on details.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good news is that by understanding the brain&#39;s tendency to become less detail-oriented and more visionary, you can counteract the urges by seeking other perspectives to stay realistic about the present and set more &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroleadership.com/your-brain-at-work/putting-people-first&quot;>;people-focused goals&lt;/a>; that are tied to the welfare of others. For example, if you&#39;re embarking on a new project and think it should take three weeks to complete, ask for the perspectives of others who will execute the day-to-day tasks to ensure alignment on how much time it takes to deliver a quality product – and then be open to shifting your timeline, if possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luckily for Robin, her company invested in a well-designed leadership program that balances all three challenging capabilities.在接下来的六个月里，她获得了深刻的见解，使她能够更好地了解是什么让她的团队运转，同时学习如何提前思考并平衡领导力的各个方面与日常的战术需求。 Although the brain might not be naturally built for leadership, with the right science-based training and habit formation, leaders at all levels can power through that tough Monday — and beyond.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Digital Skills Provide a Development Path for Sub-Saharan Africa]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/digital-skills-provide-a-development-path-for-sub-saharan-africa]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_25_996888296.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;wilpunt/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing with massive rural-urban migration.

But unlike the urbanization of the Western world decades and centuries ago, Sub-Saharan Africa is missing a critical component: industrialized urban cities. In other words, unlike in the Western world where industrialization preceded urbanization, Sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/africas-urbanisation-dynamics-2022-economic-power-africas-cities&quot;>;urban cities&lt;/a>; are growing with marginal manufacturing output and industrial capacities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The implication is huge, as these urban areas have become overcrowded with substandard housing and severely inadequate infrastructure to cope with unplanned population growth. With limited taxes, urbanizing Sub-Saharan African cities are underfunded and could face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org/wca/press-releases/unicef-who%E2%80%AFcall-end-historic-underfunding-mental-health-services-africa&quot;>;severe challenges on healthcare delivery&lt;/a>; and overall social welfare. And with climate change affecting major cities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c97je2gzdlwo&quot;>;Lagos&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.africanews.com/2023/05/07/kenya-residents-on-a-mission-to-reduce-flooding-damage/&quot;>;Nairobi&lt;/a>;, the continent needs urgent solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Statista, on average, the Sub-Saharan African urbanization rate stood at approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/805657/urbanization-in-sub-saharan-africa/&quot;>;41.83%&lt;/a>; in 2021, even when the continent accounts for just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2016/11/23/figures-of-the-week-africa-industrialization-day/#:~:text=The%20average%20share%20of%20manufacturing,at%20just%20under%202%20percent.&quot;>;2% of the global manufacturing output&lt;/a>;. The implication is that those moving to the urban areas in search of economic opportunity aren&#39;t finding it, and that has resulted in high unemployment rates, especially among young people. The Brookings Institution estimates the youth unemployment rate in Africa to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/12/08/the-case-for-job-creation-hubs-to-reduce-youth-unemployment-in-africa/&quot;>;about 60%&lt;/a>;, while the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) puts the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unctad.org/press-material/facts-and-figures-7&quot;>;poverty rate at above 50%&lt;/a>; in most of the countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The challenges posed by this rapid “urbanization before industrialization” have been exacerbated by many factors, including an industrialization policy which has looked more backward than forward. For years, Sub-Saharan African leaders have been architecting a strategy to mimic what worked for China, which relies on an expectation that the Western world would outsource low-level factory jobs to Sub-Saharan Africa to stimulate a dynamic manufacturing sector once wages become relatively more expensive in China.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/why-africas-industrialization-wont-look-like-chinas&quot;>;as I&#39;ve noted before&lt;/a>;, it would be a huge mistake if Africa tries to pursue China&#39;s strategy. What worked for China is already expiring with advances in AI and robotics, making it nearly impossible for Western Europe and the United States to ship some of these low-level jobs outside their shores; robots will do the jobs at home. Instead, Sub-Saharan African policymakers must develop a new developmental playbook that takes into account the realities of the present state of the area.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, that new development playbook is already evolving, and it is anchored on the teeming young people in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last few years, in the process of running Tekedia Capital, an early-stage venture fund, and Tekedia Institute, a business school with thousands of students, I have collected enormous data on sectors, core economic indicators, freelancing, offshore jobs, and other factors. Based on the datasets, the path I see for the development of the continent goes through young people equipped with advanced digital skills. The young people in sub-Saharan Africa are digitally savvy, creative, and can lead a massive transformation if they&#39;re equipped and supported to unlock their potential, not just regionally but globally. These young people can export digital skills to Western Europe, United States, and Asia through the unbounded and unconstrained opportunities the internet has provided. In other words, while the West outsourced factory jobs to China, soon, they will outsource “&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/the-most-and-least-digital-jobs-and-how-well-they-pay&quot;>;digital jobs&lt;/a>;” in multifaceted ways to Sub-Saharan Africa. These digital jobs are diverse, from music to software development to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/the-hottest-job-in-tech-right-now-is-in-prompt-engineering/&quot;>;prompt engineering&lt;/a>;. For nations like Japan and South Korea where birth rates have remained low, Sub-Saharan Africa provides a readily available talent base, to remotely support their economies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some enabling infrastructures are in existence as the Sub-Saharan African region is experiencing deeper broadband penetration. Alongside a growing terrestrial broadband expansion, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/elon-musks-spacex-starlink-arrives-nigeria-meets-ncc-for-permit/&quot;>;arrival&lt;/a>; of SpaceX Starlink satellite broadband brings many promises on connectivity in both urban and rural areas. And with renewal energy startups, which use solar to provide energy services, young techies are overcoming infrastructure challenges, making it easier for them to participate in the global digital economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These shifts allow young Sub-Saharan workers to earn income where they are, and once that income is imported, they have the capacities to contribute and transform their local economies at scale. Indeed, some digital experts, after they have made money working for international organizations, decide to start their own companies and, in the process, nurture other young talent. The continent has at &lt;a href=&quot;https://guardian.ng/technology/nigeria-produces-five-of-seven-unicorns-in-africa/&quot;>;least seven unicorns&lt;/a>; — startups valued at least $1 billion — and as they become listed in the public stock exchanges, acquired by large multinational firms, or grow to have abilities to pay good dividends, the wealth created would be used to accelerate development. More so, because of the digital nature of their jobs, there is no requirement to remain in even the urban areas; Andela, a digital skill outsourcing startup, for example, hires workers from anywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, provided they have good internet service.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to scale this and make it a success, the following must be taken into consideration at both the policy level and in implementation:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Quality digital education: &lt;/strong>;The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that many Sub-Saharan African countries are still very low on digital readiness. While many universities in China, the US, and Europe were able to transition to remote learning, many Sub-Saharan African universities could not. Building infrastructures to support the future knowledge economy will be essential for Sub-Saharan Africa to unlock the huge potential of the youth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Tax treaties and harmonization:&lt;/strong>; In leading Sub-Saharan African economies like Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya, most young people work for some of the leading companies in Europe, US, and Canada. Sub-Saharan African policy makers must ensure these workers are compensated fairly, and that they pay local taxes as required by law. A clear policy that makes it easier for global companies to hire and develop these talents should be part of the region&#39;s development priorities. Also important is making sure that burdensome taxation does not dim the young workers&#39; motivations. That calls for effective implementation and harmonization of tax treaties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Outsourcing-focused startups&lt;/strong>;: Regional and national policies should be developed to deepen the capacities of outsourcing-focused digital companies. These companies, like Andela, valued at excess of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/andela-becomes-a-unicorn-raises-200-million-at-1-5-billion-valuation/&quot;>;$1.5 billion&lt;/a>;, train young people and then export their digital skills to the world, while they remain in the continent. African embassies and missions in Europe, Asia, and North America could support them to connect with major clients, providing pipelines to hire the services of African youth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sub-Saharan Africa has young people to fuel the knowledge economy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/ohrlls/news/young-people%E2%80%99s-potential-key-africa%E2%80%99s-sustainable-development&quot;>;According&lt;/a>; to the United Nations, “Africa has the youngest population in the world, with 70% of sub-Saharan Africa under the age of 30.” If the continent educates and trains them in the higher-level digital skills, Sub-Saharan Africa will develop within decades, and will experience its unique version of industrialization.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Journey to Cloud Smart: Executives Share Their Perspectives - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM VMWARE]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/07/the-journey-to-cloud-smart-executives-share-their-perspectives]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-0&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/hero-1024x682.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;In recent years, a growing number of organizations have turned to multiple public cloud providers to run their businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some cases, the situation arises unintentionally, as separate teams prefer different platforms. Other times, it&#39;s the result of a strategic decision from organizations eager to gain the competitive and economic advantages of multiple clouds. These can include higher flexibility, lower costs, a greater capacity to monetize data, and regulatory compliance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet the journey to multi-cloud adoption can be long and painful. Along the way, many enterprises can face spikes in complexity and cost, not to mention and security concerns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlocking the true potential of a multi-cloud approach—becoming “cloud smart”—requires being intentional and strategic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The Struggle with Multi-Cloud Complexity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Multi-cloud challenges can take business leaders by surprise. Public cloud “looked really, really good on paper,” said William Brown, Cloud and Infrastructure Architect at ice Norway.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the initial burst of excitement, there&#39;s this phase of disillusionment—that things aren&#39;t going as well as had been expected,” said Tom Eck, SVP and Distinguished Engineer at Fiserv.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For Christoph Rode, senior vice president of Cloud Platforms at T-Systems (part of Deutsche Telekom AG), multi-cloud adoption led to challenges on several fronts. “You realize costs are spiraling even if you do cost control,” he said. “I need to control my costs. I need to control security, compliance, and I need help.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These experiences are not unique. According to a recent survey of nearly 6,000 IT leaders by Vanson Bourne commissioned by VMware, 70% say they struggle with multi-cloud challenges. Few enterprises have reached the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vmware.com/reaching-multicloud-tipping-point&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;tipping point&lt;/a>; at which the strategic advantages of multi-cloud outweigh its complexities: 70% of companies have not yet achieved an advanced stage on their journey to multi-cloud adoption.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations experiencing these challenges are missing out on key opportunities around multi-cloud revenue, profitability, and data monetization that can deliver competitive advantages. They are also unable to enjoy multi-cloud data sovereignty and data security advantages that keep customers and employees loyal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The Advantages of Being “Cloud Smart”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a better approach to multi-cloud adoption. One in five organizations surveyed in the report could be considered “cloud smart,” or mature in their approach to multi-cloud.

Brent hung his head trying to absorb the loss.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brent, an account executive at a fintech company, had been so sure that this deal was going to go through that he&#39;d put it on his forecast to close the quarter. He had even mentally spent his commission. As he sat with the reality that he&#39;d lost the deal, he recognized there had been a few signs that the client wasn&#39;t fully engaged. Now, they were going to use someone else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brent knew he was going to have to tell his boss. But the last thing he wanted to do was spend a meeting unpacking his own failure. Maybe he could get another deal cooking before they talked and avoid what he was sure would be a painful conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When salespeople lose a deal, most prefer to move on rather than linger over the specifics of the loss. Similarly, when they win a deal, most are quick to celebrate. But very few take the time to assess &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; they won the business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our experience leading and coaching sales teams, we see evidence that a brief, well-pointed sales retrospective, where you unpack the reasons behind a win or a loss, can significantly improve a team&#39;s future win rate. Beyond the obvious benefits for the sales team — for whom the process can help identify the best messaging and behaviors to use going forward — unpacking wins and losses also provides valuable insights for product, marketing, and finance teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The challenge is for leaders and sellers to dig beneath the traditional competitive analysis of pricing and features, to uncover the nuanced factors that played into the customer&#39;s buying decision. While salespeople may groan at the thought of taking a magnifying glass to the rearview mirror, particularly on a loss that may still be stinging, we find that spending even as little as 10 minutes on a retrospective yields big dividends.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Below are three questions organizations and individuals can use in a sales retrospective. The questions work whether the team won or lost the deal. They are designed to help the team understand the real issues driving customers&#39; buying decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How would the customer articulate the value of their choice?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Leaders can pose the questions to the team after a deal closes or falls through. The process starts by challenging the team to go beyond the solution itself. Instead, focus on how the customers would articulate the effects of implementing their chosen solution, be it yours or your competitor&#39;s. For example, the solution may impact other departments at the client beyond the initial user group that sales traditionally talks to, or it may help the customer accomplish additional internal priorities. Looking beyond the obvious product users helps the team understand their larger impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you lost the deal, digging deeper through this lens will help you frame your positioning to create more urgency next time. If you won the deal, this information will help you take actions to ensure a high-value implementation from the client&#39;s perspective.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fintech firm described above, the sales retrospective revealed that the customer had placed a high value on a few product features, which they deemed must-haves for their internal team. The customer believed the competitor&#39;s offering was more robust in these areas. Getting specific during the retrospective prompted the product team at Brent&#39;s company to make some minor tweaks that put them at parity. Marketing also gleaned information about how to adjust their materials to highlight the changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unpacking a loss typically helps identify opportunities. But there are also benefits to unpacking a win. Asking the salespeople involved how the customer would articulate the value of your solution creates a shared win for the entire team. In a tight economy, playing up the wins, versus exclusively unpacking losses, reminds your sales team that customers find your solution valuable and that many are still buying.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Who was the most influential voice in and out of the room?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Oftentimes, key decision makers, influencers, and subject matter experts aren&#39;t revealed until after the deal has been decided. Knowing who these people are in a deal that you won prepares you for implementation. Knowing whose voices carried strong weight when you lost a deal helps the sales team address these influencers earlier in the sales process during future pursuits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unpacking a loss more holistically by looking at the players and the value story can help a sales team move beyond the sting of rejection. It&#39;s worth noting that an environment of shame and blame rarely produces great insight. Instead focus on what they can do differently next time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the fintech firm looked more closely at the decision makers, it became clear that the CIO had made the final call. While most of the sales calls had been with the user group, it was the CIO who identified the must-have features that cost the team the deal. Knowing this prompted sales enablement to create additional training to help the sales team become more skilled at calling on CIOs. The marketing team developed a new deck showcasing how their offering addressed typical CIO challenges, and finance developed models to showcase their net-positive impact over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Beyond price, what were the key deciding factors in the client&#39;s decision?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When a team loses a deal, it&#39;s easy to blame it on pricing. Asking the team to think about why a client makes decisions for reasons other than price will allow them to reflect on the full value of the solution. It will also allow them to take a broader look at how their own offering stacks up in a competitive landscape. When you lose a deal, this question will help your team uplevel their skills by being more attuned to the nuances in the future. Conversely, when you win, unpacking why you won beyond pricing strengthens the team&#39;s confidence, which helps you hold margin going forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can also be helpful to ask the buyers themselves what other factors played into the decision. They may not even be aware of the subtle things that drove their thinking until they&#39;re asked to unpack it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the loss, the fintech team went back to their client to ask why they choose the competitor, allowing the team to get more detailed information about the perceived product differences. Keeping the conversation neutral without trying to re-pitch the sale created an environment where the client was willing to share. The loss still hurt, but the deep insights they gained directly from a client helped the team adjust their offering going forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While the benefits of a sales retrospective are clear, the challenge is often in assessing when to use one. Organizations can have hundreds or thousands of deals in a quarter, and not all warrant introspection. The temptation is to limit retrospectives to large deals that didn&#39;t close at the end of the quarter. However, in our experience, emotions are so high at that time that the utility of retrospectives is usually low.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, we find it helpful for sales leaders to have at least one retrospective per account executive per quarter. That enables the team to gather information that is valuable for multiple functions in the company. Perhaps most importantly, this approach will train the sales team to think about why they actually won or lost independent of a retrospective.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of which deals a leader selects to discuss, going from no retrospectives to a few will be a considerable achievement and deliver insights that may change the go-to-market strategy. Through running deeper sales retrospectives, the fintech firm was able to tweak their offering, upskill their sales team, and create a stronger presence with a key set of buyers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For most leaders, it will take time to drive an impact similar to what was achieved in the case study, but along the way, account executives will feel heard, sales will be more effective, and the go-to-market teams will be able to better support sales. Ultimately, this enables leaders to turn small losses into a big win.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When Your Employee Isn&rsquo;t Reaching Their Full Potential]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/when-your-employee-isnt-reaching-their-full-potential]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_24_56660878.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Jeanette Martin/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;It can be frustrating to feel that your employees aren&amp;#8217;t taking the initiative to do more with their talents. As their manager, you may even wonder if it&amp;#8217;sa question of knowledge or willpower: Do they not understand what&amp;#8217;s necessary to perform at their best? Or are they just unmotivated? In this article, the authors examine three main reasons why your employee may not be reaching their full potential: personal challenges, interpersonal issues, and leadership problems. It&amp;#8217;s unpleasant to consider, but remember that at least 30% of employees&amp;#8217; performance is the product of how they&amp;#8217;re managed, meaning that your leadership could play a big role in determining whether people are reaching their potential or not. It&amp;#8217;s possible that, despite intending to support and nurture your employee, you may be squelching their talents through micromanagement, overly loose supervision, or poorly communicated objectives, among other managerial sins. The good news about this potentially alarming revelation is that it&amp;#8217;s one area that&amp;#8217;s firmly within your control.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/when-your-employee-isnt-reaching-their-full-potential?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/when-your-employee-isnt-reaching-their-full-potential?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve seen flashes of real competence — maybe even occasional brilliance — in your employee. So why are they failing to live up to that potential?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a leader who cares about cultivating your employees&#39; skills, abilities, and professional growth trajectory, it can be enormously frustrating to feel that they&#39;re not taking the initiative to do more with their talents. At times, you may even wonder if it&#39;s a question of knowledge or willpower: Do they not understand what&#39;s necessary to perform at their best? Or &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/4-reasons-good-employees-lose-their-motivation&quot;>;are they just unmotivated&lt;/a>;?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, there&#39;s a reason you believe that your employees&#39; “typical performance” (what they usually do) is not as high as their “maximal performance” or capabilities (the best they can do) — so as a first step, it&#39;s important to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08959280701333289&quot;>;clarify and quantify&lt;/a>; that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps you&#39;re thinking of a specific example of their peak performance, such as delivering a compelling presentation under high-stakes circumstances, or particular moments when they&#39;ve demonstrated valuable skills, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8721.ep10768746?journalCode=cdpa&quot;>;intelligence&lt;/a>; (recognizing an important hidden pattern, turning chaos and complexity into order, learning new things), &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691611421204?journalCode=ppsa&quot;>;curiosity&lt;/a>; (asking a truly insightful question), or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2015.1030293&quot;>;creativity&lt;/a>; (delivering an unexpected insight, generating original and useful new ideas). They&#39;re obviously capable of performing at that level if they&#39;ve done it once, let alone multiple times.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s essential then, to narrow down the reasons your employee may not be reaching their full potential. We&#39;ve found three main categories to examine: personal challenges, interpersonal issues, or your own leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Personal Challenges&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;One reason people fail to reach their full potential is that few people are aware of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Delusion-Intuition-Unlocking-Potential/dp/0349412480&quot;>;actual potential&lt;/a>; in the first place. Consider that in any area of expertise, talent, or performance, there is typically less than &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-29559-001&quot;>;10% overlap&lt;/a>; between how good people are and how good they think they are. As a leader, you can give a powerful gift to the team members you lead and manage: seeing what they&#39;re capable of, sometimes even before they do, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fair-Talk-Three-Powerful-Feedback/dp/1912555093&quot;>;holding up a mirror&lt;/a>;. Indeed, feedback is a critical catalyst of employee performance, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1996-02773-003&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that two-thirds of the time, it either fails to make others better, or even makes them &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy&quot;>;worse&lt;/a>;!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Make sure that you&#39;ve specifically praised the times your employee performed at their best, so they&#39;re aware of what “excellent” looks like, and engage them in conversations about what they did to succeed in those moments. Did they nail the speech because they took time to practice and prepare? Did they interview audience members beforehand so they could cite relevant examples? Helping them dig deeper into the reasons behind their success helps show them how to replicate it. In other words, think of yourself &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;as a coach&lt;/a>; rather than a boss.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another major driver of people failing to reach their potential is, simply, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-06019-003&quot;>;motivation&lt;/a>;. If you&#39;ve seen your employees perform at a high level in the past, then clearly ability isn&#39;t the problem here — so their current level of motivation is worth investigating. You might check in with your team member to see what&#39;s going on, especially if there&#39;s been a sudden change. Perhaps they&#39;re going through something &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/how-to-manage-an-employee-whos-having-a-personal-crisis&quot;>;challenging in their personal life&lt;/a>;, or are on the pathway to &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/do-you-know-burnout-when-you-see-it&quot;>;burnout&lt;/a>; and need to take time off. Or perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/how-to-lose-your-best-employees&quot;>;they feel stagnant&lt;/a>; in their role and need new challenges, including stretch goals, which you can &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/give-your-employees-specific-goals-and-the-freedom-to-figure-out-how-to-reach-them&quot;>;help them craft&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Interpersonal Issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sometimes your employees&#39; underperformance comes from the circumstances surrounding them — ie, other people. As Boris Groysberg and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;/2004/05/the-risky-business-of-hiring-stars&quot;>;have shown&lt;/a>;, star employees who migrate to new firms often fail to replicate their success, because the supportive ingredients that helped propel their rise (such as company-specific knowledge or networks) are no longer in place. Indeed, although organizations typically pay more for external hires than internally promoted employees, external hires typically tend to fail to add as &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-external-hires-get-paid-more-and-perform-worse-than-internal-staff/&quot;>;much value&lt;/a>; as internal candidates, not least because many of the conditions that made them successful before may not be there anymore.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, your employee may be hitting a plateau as a result of new team dynamics (perhaps in the aftermath of a colleague departing or joining the team), altered roles or responsibilities, or a perceived lack of recognition or change in status (someone else landing a promotion or bonus). Your employee&#39;s talents may be unchanged — but their ability to execute on them has. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ll want to discuss the dynamics honestly and identify opportunities to reframe or mediate the conflict — or shift them to a new role where they&#39;re more likely to succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Leadership Problems&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s unpleasant to consider, but remember that at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324&quot;>;least 30% of employees&#39; performance&lt;/a>; is the product of how they&#39;re managed, meaning that your leadership could play a big role in determining whether people are reaching their potential or not. It&#39;s possible that, despite intending to support and nurture your employee, you may be squelching their talents through &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/signs-that-youre-a-micromanager&quot;>;micromanagement&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/get-what-you-need-from-your-hands-off-boss&quot;>;overly loose supervision&lt;/a>;, or poorly &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/02/making-sure-your-employees-suc&quot;>;communicated objectives&lt;/a>;, among other managerial sins.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good news about this potentially alarming revelation is that it&#39;s one area that&#39;s firmly within your control. By &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/a-refresher-on-ab-testing&quot;>;A/B testing&lt;/a>; strategies around how you communicate with your employee, give feedback, empower them, and manage them, you can directly examine the results of the guidance you provide and evaluate whether the main reason for their underperformance is actually . 。 .&amp;nbsp; you. It&#39;s useful to test strategies that have worked with them in the past, as well as those that have proven effective with other employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All people are unique and no strategy works for everyone. That being said, it&#39;s generally true that when you spend more time with an employee with whom you have a trusting relationship and give them more feedback (including constructive criticism, worthy praise, recognition, and resources), they&#39;ll be more likely to reach their potential than if you do the exact opposite with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, remember that people are humans, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Human-Automation-Quest-Reclaim-Unique-ebook/dp/B099KQV3ZJ&quot;>;humans are not machines&lt;/a>;. This means you shouldn&#39;t expect everybody to perform to their maximum level or full capabilities all their time. In fact, the most creative and talented people on earth — in any field — can be dramatically inconsistent in their performance, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-02410-016&quot;>;inspiration is a strong driver of results&lt;/a>; and the main fuel for innovative and exceptional work. Cutting people some slack and respecting their natural cycles, while of course &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/hold-your-team-accountable-with-compassion-not-fear&quot;>;holding them accountable&lt;/a>; as appropriate, is what good managers do. Incidentally, the inconsistency or erratic element that underpins work performance may also apply to you — so it&#39;s probably helpful to examine whether &lt;em>;you &lt;/em>;are reaching your own potential, and what could potentially be stopping you from doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Understanding the gaps in your employees&#39; performance — and, perhaps, your own — is an exercise in thoughtfulness and empathy. By examining the possibilities above, you&#39;ll be in a much better position to help guide your team to be at their best more frequently.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Effectively &mdash; and Legally &mdash; Use Racial Data for DEI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-to-effectively-and-legally-use-racial-data-for-dei]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/July23_24_RacialData.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Ngadi Smart&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;After the recent US Supreme Court ruling striking against affirmative action in higher education, leaders might be concerned that their DEI initiatives and programs will face additional scrutiny and legal challenge.

Employers can&#39;t create de facto hiring quotas (eg, “50% of the employees hired in this department must be women”), or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/esg-epicenter/20220524-california-court-strikes-down-law-on-board-diversity&quot;>;reserve seats&lt;/a>;” for employees from certain groups, even in the interest of diversity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the law, even after the recent Supreme Court ruling, gender-conscious or race-conscious hiring practices are permitted&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; but only as part of limited, temporary, and highly structured &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2023/07/considerations-for-employers-following-the-eeocs-response-to-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-race-conscious-college-admissions?utm_source=pardot&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=clientalerts&amp;amp;sc_camp=2D3D522D49CB4CE599B743213715F288&quot;>;voluntary affirmative action programs&lt;/a>;, undertaken only if employers find evidence of company-wide or industry-wide hiring discrimination, only to correct the initial imbalance, and only without “undue harm” on members of non-targeted groups (meaning that employers cannot lay off white workers to hire workers of color).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So long as these guidelines are followed, neither employers nor DEI practitioners need to panic. Removing the word “diversity,” vowing to strip all mentions of race at work, or shutting down race-related affinity groups are harmful overreactions that don&#39;t reflect real legal risks. As it stands, the vast majority of workplace DEI programs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catalyst.org/2023/06/29/legal-experts-supremecourt-affirmative-action/&quot;>;strongly supported by legal precedent&lt;/a>; and are unlikely to be affected by this Supreme Court ruling.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When done right, DEI programs can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2021/sep/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-an-important-loss-prevention-tool/&quot;>;reduce&lt;/a>; the risk of employment discrimination and hostile work environment claims and can mitigate risk across your organization. However, employers can nevertheless reduce their risk by auditing their existing programs to ensure they don&#39;t run afoul of existing laws. Policies that instruct hiring managers to use the race of individuals as a “tiebreaker” or “plus points” for individual candidates are impermissible under the law. Setting aside concrete numbers or percentages of roles or seats for members of specific social groups is similarly risky. Avoid practices like hard rules forbidding employees not of a particular race from joining employee resource groups or instructing recruiters to fill a position with someone meeting specific demographic criteria (eg, “you must fill this role with a woman of color.”) Essentially, if a policy, process, or practice requires knowing the racial characteristics of an individual to make a decision affecting their employment, you may want to review it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Collect Racial Data to Identify Disparities&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Some leaders may read the preceding paragraph and assume that an easy way to reduce risk is to simply not collect any racial data at all. However, making this conclusion would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and could put your company&#39;s DEI progress at risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While using the racial data of individuals to influence a hiring decision would be illegal, aggregating racial data for the overall candidate pool to identify overall race-related disparities is well within reasonable grounds. Collecting demographic data in conjunction with an employee engagement survey might reveal racial gaps in meeting participation deserving a closer look. Collecting demographic data in conjunction with HR data might reveal racial gaps in turnover deserving intervention. In other words, collecting demographic data, including race, can reveal adverse impact caused by existing practices, prior discriminatory practices, or historical limitations on the labor pool, all criteria specifically listed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.constangy.com/affirmative-action-alert/increase-diversity-without-violating-the-law&quot;>;Voluntary Affirmative Action Guidelines&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is this data-driven approach compliant with current guidelines for employers, but it is also highly effective in ensuring DEI initiatives deliver measurable impact. Socially conscious investors, employees, and customers want employers to go beyond public statements of commitment, to take specific actions that remedy real inequities in organizations, industries, and society. Collecting racial data to gain information about inequalities in your organization, your industry, or even society is one of the highest-value DEI-related actions you can take as a leader, and ensures that when you act, you will be working purposefully with a clear goal in mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Remove Universal Barriers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A common misunderstanding of DEI initiatives is the assumption that, if a racial disparity is identified, DEI initiatives rectify the disparity by giving marginalized groups preferential treatment — so-called “reverse discrimination.” For example, some managers might assume that if an analysis reveals racial hiring discrimination, DEI initiatives would seek to “give jobs to marginalized people” at the expense of white employees in return.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only would such a crude and zero-sum approach be blatantly illegal; it&#39;s also far from the reality of DEI work. Most effective DEI programs use racial data to identify discriminatory barriers that are compromising fairness and meritocracy in the workplace, and to develop initiatives that remove those barriers &lt;em>;for everyone&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if an analysis using racial data uncovers disproportionate barriers for Black, Asian, Latine, and Indigenous manager candidates due to the lack of a standard promotions process and high barriers to entry for candidates, a DEI initiative might follow up by working with all leaders to develop a standardized promotions process, train leaders on how to use it and how to interrupt biases, and automatically consider all employees for promotion after three years in a position. These initiatives would have the added benefit of reducing manager favoritism, nepotism, and other unethical practices that might negatively impact workers from any background. Most DEI initiatives follow this pattern: They collect data on marginalized groups to design workplaces that work better for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Correct Discrimination&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When employers seek out &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/how-to-identify-and-fix-pay-inequality-at-your-company&quot;>;pay equity audits&lt;/a>;, they learn whether employees of different backgrounds are being paid fairly for equal work. If the answer is no, then responsible employers may proactively offer back pay to the affected employees to rectify the inequality. The extra pay isn&#39;t “taken” from the non-affected employees like in a zero-sum game; it&#39;s given from the employer to make things right: expanding the pie, rather than fighting over it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if an employer uses racial data to identify that white managers are receiving disproportionately more opportunities to take on challenging projects, network, and receive mentorship from senior leaders, in addition to removing universal barriers to opportunity, they might proactively create more opportunities to offer challenging projects, networking, and mentorship to members of marginalized groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the surprising benefits of using data in this way is that it can help your workforce understand the rationale behind your DEI initiatives. Because most people assume that workplaces are inherently fair or are meritocracies until proven otherwise, DEI initiatives (eg, starting an employee resource group with event programming mostly directed at Latine employees) might be met with apathy or &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/fighting-backlash-to-racial-equity-efforts/&quot;>;backlash&lt;/a>; from those anxious about preferential treatment. By grounding DEI work in data (eg, with an analysis showing a relative lack of community, support, and belonging for Latine employees compared to White employees) you can help your workforce understand the importance of DEI programs and take pride in your commitment to supporting your workforce.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Design Fair Processes&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You cannot use individuals&#39; racial information to give them a 30% score bump compared to other candidates. You cannot allocate 30% of positions to members of marginalized racial groups, outside of a highly-bounded voluntary affirmative action program following the guidelines discussed above.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; you may stipulate that each stage of your hiring process be composed of at least 30% qualified candidates of color before proceeding (a practice known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diversitylab.com/pilot-projects/mansfield-overview/&quot;>;Mansfield Rule&lt;/a>;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclusocal.org/en/inclusion-targets-whats-legal&quot;>;Inclusion Rider&lt;/a>;). While these practices typically aim to correct for industry-wide discrimination or limited labor pools, no one candidate has higher or lower odds of being hired than the next candidate. The employer simply takes additional time to intentionally expand the candidate pool before proceeding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Processes like these can be combined with other bias-disrupting practices to further ensure fairness. For example, you can make it clear that any voluntarily shared racial data will not be associated with an individual&#39;s candidacy. You may even require that individuals handling racial data for candidate pool diversity work separately from those who will make employment decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Racial Data to Demonstrate DEI Progress&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Some leaders may invest in DEI initiatives and programs out of the applaudable initial justification that they are “obviously” needed to support the workforce. However, when these initiatives run their course, those leaders can feel unsure what to do next. When times are good, these DEI initiatives are seen as a marker of a successful, people-centered workplace. But when organizations are under financial pressure, face business challenges, and must juggle competing priorities, the lack of a solid justification for DEI can consign it to &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/protecting-dei-progress-when-budgets-are-tight&quot;>;the top of the list for budget cuts&lt;/a>;. Organizations that are neither able to demonstrate an evidence-based reason for DEI programs&#39; existence, nor an evidence-based assessment for DEI programs&#39; effectiveness will never be able to decouple their DEI efforts from short-lived trends and fads.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for organizations that &lt;em>;can&lt;/em>; initiate DEI programs using data showing racial disparities or unmet needs, racial data can be the single most powerful tool in justifying their continued existence. If your &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/to-understand-whether-your-company-is-inclusive-map-how-your-employees-interact&quot;>;network analysis&lt;/a>; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/employee-belonging&quot;>;belonging survey&lt;/a>; quantifies a racial gap in access to decision-making processes, you might use these findings as rationale to design new decision-making processes, create advisory boards to inform leaders, and lean on employee resource groups to share information to employees of color about their input is being sought out.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By once again running those same analyses and comparing the data you receive, you&#39;ll be able to make powerful inferences regarding the success — or failure — of your initiatives and draw on these findings to further improve your DEI programs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Principles to Remember&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;Don&#39;t:&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Panic, abandon your DEI efforts, or compromise effective initiatives out of unfounded fear.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Make employment decisions about or resources for individuals dependent on knowing their race or ethnicity, without a prior analysis showing disparity, and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Allocate or reserve a percentage of desirable resources (eg, promotions, positions, assignments) to members of racial group, without a prior analysis showing disparity and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Use people&#39;s racial data to give them a boost or a demerit in any decision, without a prior analysis showing disparity, and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Express racial preferences, criteria, or restriction for any role or position, without a prior analysis showing disparity, and without first talking to legal counsel.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;Do:&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Use racial data to inform recruitment efforts and diversify candidate pools (eg, by using the Mansfield Rule).&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Aggregate racial data to preserve anonymity without losing group-level insight.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Draw upon racial data to identify racial inequalities and disparities in your organization.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Cite racial data to design DEI efforts and initiatives that remove barriers and correct for discrimination.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Reference longitudinal racial data to show DEI progress, communicate about the efficacy of DEI programs, and celebrate your wins.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/to-drive-diversity-efforts-dont-tiptoe-around-your-legal-risk&quot;>;Partner&lt;/a>; with attorneys and legal experts early on to design and communicate about legal — and effective — DEI programs.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;DEI work isn&#39;t going anywhere, and leaders know it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2023/bain--company-study-shows-85-of-business-leaders-view-social-issues-as-urgent-concerns-for-their-companies/&quot;>;85%, according to a recent survey&lt;/a>;, view social issues as “urgent” concerns. Employees and consumers continue to expect organizations to not just make commitments to do better, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/to-make-lasting-progress-on-dei-measure-outcomes&quot;>;achieve measurable outcomes&lt;/a>; that can prove that their talk isn&#39;t empty. Doing so will require that evidence-based DEI work — that requires collecting and using racial data legally and effectively, alongside other demographic data — becomes the new standard of this work. Done right, you&#39;ll be able to simultaneously shore up your legal risks and accelerate your organization&#39;s transition to the higher standard of transparency, accountability, and effectiveness your constituents expect from their DEI programs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is simply the next evolution of DEI in a longer fight for greater diversity, equity, and inclusion at work grounded in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with decades of widespread support. How your organization meets the needs of this moment will decide how well you adapt to the next stage in your DEI journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: A Little Nature in the Office Boosts Morale and Productivity]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/research-a-little-nature-in-the-office-boosts-morale-and-productivity]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_19_MaryHaasdykVooys.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Mary Haasdyk Vooys&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Research on &amp;#8220;micro-nature&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; the incorporation of small, affordable natural elements into workplaces &amp;#8212; demonstrates its positive impact on employee performance and well-being. Studies show exposure to nature at work boosted productivity, helpfulness, and creativity, with no evidence of negative effects. Recommendations include both real and artificial nature, extending beyond the office environment, utilizing underused spaces, and encouraging nature exposure outside work hours. The integration of nature in workplaces enhances overall business performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/research-a-little-nature-in-the-office-boosts-morale-and-productivity?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/research-a-little-nature-in-the-office-boosts-morale-and-productivity?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In Canary Wharf, the bustling district that serves as the London base for many global enterprises, developers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/glenn-howells-and-eden-project-to-give-canary-wharf-a-green-revamp&quot;>;building a “green spine”&lt;/a>; that will soon wind through the skyscrapers, giving workers ready access to green spaces during their workdays. Across town at Google&#39;s under-construction UK headquarters, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15723642/google-london-office-pictures-headquarters-kings-cross&quot;>;300-meter-long rooftop park&lt;/a>; with over 250 trees crowns the building, providing employees with a natural escape from the offices and urban environment below. On the other side of the Atlantic, retailer LL Bean cut out the middle of one of their warehouses and turned the space into a courtyard, so that everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90908239/ll-bean-new-headquarters&quot;>;at their new home office&lt;/a>; would have views of nature while working. These real-world examples of incorporating nature into commercial spaces are part of a growing trend to design places where employees can be immersed in nature during their workdays.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Increasing nature in the work environment certainly aligns with many companies&#39; sustainability initiatives. However, the motive also stems from nature&#39;s effect on humans — it is well established that nature makes us feel better. Our emotions, our thinking, our connection to others, and our physical well-being &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2017.0177&quot;>;are all enhanced by being in and around nature&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the connection between contact with nature and our well-being, large investments in bringing nature into the workplace raise some thorny issues. First, in a time of economic headwinds and cost-cutting, is there a business case for incorporating nature into employees&#39; surroundings? Second, what about those workplaces where it is not feasible or sensible to incorporate a green spine or a rooftop garden?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answering these questions requires first understanding whether nature has effects on metrics that matter to organizations&#39; bottom lines (eg, employee satisfaction and performance) and if so whether less-extreme doses of nature are meaningful enough to elicit these gains. Thus, we set out to test the effects (if any) of what we call &lt;em>;micro-nature &lt;/em>;— small, affordable, seemingly innocuous ways of incorporating nature into the workplace — on how employees feel at work, and how they perform.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Research&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We measured or manipulated contact with nature at work in different ways across multiple studies, with workers in the US, Canada, China, New Zealand, and Indonesia. In experiments, working adults were simply shown images of workplaces suffused with natural elements or matching images without nature. We then asked them to imagine they worked in these spaces and report how it would make them feel and perform. We also conducted more complex studies in real-world work settings. For instance, we assessed employees&#39; actual contact with nature during a week at work (eg, working near plants, natural views, or the sound of running water), and then measured their feelings and objective job performance. Finally, in a field experiment in an accounting firm, we went into the offices at night and placed potted plants at some employees&#39; desks and similar pots, only filled with office supplies, at other desks. We then measured the attitudes and job performance of the two groups and compared them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results were largely consistent across these studies: Experiencing even small doses of nature at work improved the way employees felt in ways that fueled &lt;a href=&quot;https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10166977/1/Tang%20et%20al%20final%20prepublished.pdf&quot;>;higher task performance, increased helping&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01492063231172182&quot;>;enhanced creativity&lt;/a>;. These findings indicate that incorporating micro-nature into work settings can contribute to worker well-being and performance in a meaningful way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also looked into whether there were differences between employees that shaped how nature affected them at work — factors such as how much individuals appreciate nature in general, and the extent to which they are drawn to novel experiences. Our findings showed that some people are especially prone to experiencing the benefits of nature. However, we found no evidence that any employees were negatively impacted by nature exposure at work; thus, micro-nature seems to hold considerable promise for employees with little downsides.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bearing these findings in mind, we believe that nature should be accessible to as many employees as possible, not just those lucky enough to work below a green roof or alongside a park. Companies should provide employees with micro-nature experiences. Below, we offer suggestions for incorporating micro-nature into the workplace, while also encouraging managers to take liberties and get creative in their specific organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Capitalizing on Micro-Nature&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;Real is best, but artificial works too.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Giving employees opportunities to access “the real thing” is ideal when it comes to nature: indoor water features, windows with views of nature or that open to let in natural sounds like birdsong. But just because it&#39;s not the real thing does not mean that employees will not benefit from nature. Research shows that even depictions of nature, such as murals and artificial flowers, can give employees a natural boost.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Think beyond the office…&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It goes without saying that it is not just office workers who benefit from nature. Employees in settings where the work environment feels especially removed from nature — think warehousing or manufacturing — are especially likely to notice a dash of the outdoors brought inside and be positively impacted by it because of how different it is from their status quo.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;…and beyond the workplace.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The benefits of nature extend beyond employees&#39; work lives. Some of our research looked at the work-related benefits of spending time outdoors in the evening, after the workday. We found that employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/01492063221106430&quot;>;were more productive the next day&lt;/a>; when they spent time outdoors the prior evening. Especially for hybrid and remote workers, the implications are clear: The benefits of being around nature at home carry over into work. So even incentivizing employees to take an evening walk can help them be more productive the next day.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Utilize unused or underused spaces.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;By definition, micro-nature is small, and can be as simple as painting a wall with natural tones, adding flowers to the break room, or landscaping the area outside employees&#39; windows. We encourage managers to keep an eye out for the unused or underused spaces around their workplace that can be easily and cheaply turned into natural features. For instance, adding more landscaping to an overly industrial parking lot may boost employees&#39; morale.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Overall, our findings indicate that the benefits of connecting employees to nature at work extend beyond sustainability, and include positive effects on employees&#39; well-being and how they perform their jobs. As such, we view contact with nature as a valuable supplement to well-designed jobs that already include meaningful work, fair compensation, and respectful treatment. For firms that provide these things and are looking for more ways to enhance the environment in which their employees work, micro-nature offers considerable promise.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
