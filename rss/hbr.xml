&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;泰勒是一家中型科技公司的经验丰富的经理，最近完成了培训关于如何进行困难的对话。泰勒发现培训很有价值。她学习了一种新模型，练习了与同伴进行的困难对话，并从其他参与者那里得到了反馈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但泰勒从未进行过对话。这感觉很冒险，她担心这个人会如何反应。虽然泰勒知道这次谈话很重要，但她自己的经理很少如此直接地沟通，她公司的大多数经常得到认可和晋升的领导者也没有这样做。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“泰勒”是我认为许多积极进取的领导者的综合体。多年来一直与我们合作，他们受到鼓励和培养，以他们在公司中看不到的榜样或奖励方式进行领导。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我已经 &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/two -techniques-for-helping-employees-change-ingrained-habits&quot;>;之前写过&lt;/a>;关于使用行为科学来提高员工发展计划有效性的力量。当完成培训后，个人准确定义何时采取行动并计划他们将遇到的不可避免的障碍时，他们更有可能实现目标并做出有意义的行为改变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，这种关注点对个人发展的关注并不能解释任何行为改变努力中的另一个关键变量：个人工作的背景或环境。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/research/constructs/environments&quot;>;在几乎所有领域&lt;/a>;，一个人的环境在塑造其行为方面发挥着重要作用。我们环境的设计会影响我们的选择和随之而来的习惯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们也受到环境中其他人的规范和期望的强烈影响。当我们看到周围的人&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07712-9&quot;>;无私&lt;/a>;或&lt;a href=&quot;https://ijbnpa. biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-7-86&quot;>;锻炼&lt;/a>;，我们更有可能采取同样的行为方式。斯坦福大学行为设计实验室的创始人兼主任 BJ Fogg 甚至表示，“只有一种方法可以从根本上改变你的行为：从根本上改变你的环境。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在组织环境中，高级人员领导者在创造环境方面发挥着重要作用。 Edgar Schein，被认为是组织文化“之父”，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Organizational-Leadership-Jossey-Bass-Business-Management-dp-1119212049/dp/1119212049/ref =dp_ob_title_bk&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;领导者关注的内容、榜样、教导和强化的内容将对组织文化产生重大影响。如果一个领导者把所有时间都花在与上级领导在一起而忽视了自己的团队，那么他就会发出一个信号，表明他们认为什么是重要的。当领导者拒绝承认错误或弱点时，他们就在含蓄地告诉团队，这样做也不安全。在泰勒的案例中，她的经理避免了困难的、直接的对话，并定下了这样的基调：此类对话没有重要到优先考虑的程度，可以避免。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，领导力发展计划常常不会“不能充分考虑领导者工作所在的文化、规范和系统。领导者可能会被要求在注重即时结果的文化中进行长期思考，或者当他们在自己的团队中因工作而获得奖励时，他们可能会被教导要跨组织边界进行协作。当领导者和领导力发展从业者未能认识到 1) 公司文化和组织环境以及 2) 最高层领导者在塑造这种环境中的关键作用时，他们就会过于简单化，并可能会破坏他们的领导力发展工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;在 Intuit，我们过去五年一直致力于建立一种能够加强而不是抑制领导者积极成长的文化。一路走来，我们学到了很多东西，包括需要使我们的学习技术现代化，这需要我们的人力资源和技术团队的大量支持和投资。我们还被提醒，我们的领导人在有限的时间和许多相互竞争的优先事项中始终如一地优先考虑他们的发展是多么困难。虽然我们还有很长的路要走，但我们已经看到了积极的反馈、参与度和行为变化，这表明我们正走在正确的轨道上。希望我们的经历可以为经历类似旅程的其他人提供启发。以下是我们为确保我们的文化支持和加强领导力发展而采取的四项行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;定义领导力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首先，高层领导者需要明确阐明贵公司的优秀领导力是什么样子，并围绕您的领导力期望创建一种共享语言。为此，请考虑以下问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;我们最好的领导者真正擅长什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我们的领导者未来需要擅长什么？&lt;/li>; >; &lt;li>;我们期望领导者塑造和强化的文化有何独特之处？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在 Intuit，我们围绕领导力的共同语言与以下方面相关且适用，这对我们来说非常重要：各级领导者——不仅仅是我们的高管。我们还希望确保它“易于记忆和背诵”，因此我们避免使其过于规范或复杂。最终，我们将定义集中在三个核心能力上：1）以清晰的愿景领导； 2）建立高绩效文化； 3) 推动取得胜利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下一步是建立领导框架。我们将其称为“领导力手册”，它包括针对每项核心能力的三种支持行为。我们纳入的许多行为，例如“培养人才以提高绩效”，都是最佳实践，可能与许多其他公司和行业的期望行为类似。其他的，例如“专注于客户问题”，反映了我们独特的公司优先事项和价值观。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们不断收到领导者的反馈，认为将这些行为编入法典有助于明确他们的期望和提供一个框架来应对真正的领导力挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;树立领导力典范。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您是高级领导者，您可以做的最有影响力的事情是确保要让你的公司文化与你的领导力期望保持一致，你需要亲自塑造公司的领导行为。正如 Schein 所说，你的行为将对塑造文化产生不成比例的巨大影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了在 Intuit 鼓励这一点，我们从最高层开始，由我们的最高层领导者启动我们的许多领导力发展工作。当我们最初在年度领导力会议上推出《领导力手册》时，我们的首席执行官萨桑·古达齐 (Sasan Goodarzi) 和他的员工，以及我们的前首席执行官、时任执行主席布拉德·史密斯 (Brad Smith) 分享了他们实践手册行为的经验以及行为表现的方式根据他们独特的领导风格而有所不同。我们的最高层领导者为组织的其他成员定下了基调，他们的行动（比他们的言论更重要）表明了他们认为重要的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们还努力帮助领导者建立自我意识，了解他们是否他们正在模仿我们的领导行为。作为我们多个高管发展计划的一部分，领导者会收到来自其团队和/或经理的反馈，了解他们实践我们的领导力手册的程度。然后，领导者根据这些输入制定发展目标，以确保他们不断强化和实践这些行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;教授领导力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在书中 &lt;em >;高产出管理，英特尔前首席执行官安迪·格罗夫讨论了“管理杠杆”的概念——领导者可以采取的行动来增加组织的产出。他将培训视为“经理可以采取的最有效的行动之一。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为我们建立领导力发展文化的努力的一部分，我们正在培训我们的领导者抓住可传授的领导力时刻。这些可以是正式的机会——例如，我们设计的几乎所有培训项目至少部分是由领导老师主导的。我们尝试构建这些机会，以便领导者能够教授他们感兴趣的主题，并分享他们自己的经验和观察中的教训。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教学也可以在领导者日常对话中出现的非正式时刻进行。 、1:1 和团队会议。我们鼓励我们的领导者发展一种领导哲学——教授兼领导力专家诺埃尔·蒂奇（Noel Tichy）称之为“可传授的观点”。我们建议他们问自己以下问题，以形成自己的可传授观点：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;哪些经历或观察影响了我对领导力的看法？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我学到了哪些重要的教训？从我的经验中学到了什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我如何将我的经验教训整理或简化为原则或切实的建议？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在我们上一财年，我们 100% 的执行副总裁和 88我们 % 的高级副总裁促进了学习体验。也许并不奇怪，参与者的出席率、参与度和对领导力发展项目的承诺相对较强。在推出《领导力手册》后的第一年，95% 的副总裁自愿参加我们的第一个高管计划，即副总裁领导力实验室。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;认识并加强领导力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;为了让你的领导行为持续下去，必须通过你的人才和绩效系统和流程来系统地强化它们。当您的绩效系统与您所提倡的行为不一致时，&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Kerr_Folly_of_rewarding_A_while_hoping_for_B.pdf&quot;>;领导者持续实践这些行为的可能性要小得多。考虑您雇用、奖励和认可领导者的所有正式和非正式方式。每个流程都提供了一个机会来强化您的组织对卓越领导力的定义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们将领导力手册嵌入到我们的招聘、入职和绩效管理流程中。我们将行为面试问题映射到我们的剧本中，以便在招聘领导者时使用。例如，为了了解我们的“定义成功并激励团队围绕它”的领导行为，我们纳入了面试问题：描述一次你必须影响他人朝着他们最初抵制的方向前进的经历。您做到了吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在员工入职培训期间，每位员工都会了解该手册，并且所有新高管都会参加为期一年的深入学习，作为我们高管入职培训的一部分。领导力手册是我们用于绩效和晋升决策的准则，也是我们公司领导力奖项和年度领导力会议的基础。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多组织都有像“泰勒”一样的领导者 - 好奇、积极、渴望为他们的公司和团队做正确的事情，但要克服组织的阻力。采取措施创造一种环境和文化，支持和增强而不是削弱他们作为领导者的成长和发展，将会产生巨大的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Make a Pivot in the Latter Half of Your Career]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-to-make-a-pivot-in-the-latter-half-of-your-career]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;作为一名老年工人，改变职业可能会令人畏惧，尤其是在当今无情的不确定性的情况下。但你已经具备了让自己成为候选人所需的条件——你只需要做一些额外的准备，以确保招聘经理和面试官能够看到你独特的技能、经验和观点将如何推动他们的团队和组织向前发展。如果您考虑在职业生涯后期转向不同类型的角色或行业，作者提出了五个面试技巧，供您尝试。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-to-make-a-pivot-in-the-latter-half-of-your-career?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt; /a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-to-make-a-pivot-in-the-latter-half-of-your-career?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/ a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;改变职业可能具有挑战性，尤其是当您从事单一职业或行业时。当你处于职业生涯的最后一两年时，这样做可能会更加困难，因为你需要保持一定的薪酬、水平或头衔，而你的竞争对手更年轻并且“经验丰富”来完成工作。&lt;/我记得 33 岁时，当我想从电视新闻记者转行到娱乐律师时，我担心招聘经理不会重视我十年的工作经验。当我在 48 岁时决定再次将职业生涯从娱乐律师转向科技这一新行业的人力资源业务合作伙伴时，这种恐惧成倍增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您正在考虑跳槽到不同类型的角色或行业在您职业生涯的后期，这里有一些方法可以让您在面试过程中从初级竞争对手中脱颖而出。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;突出显示需要多年工作才能掌握的经验。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在工作场所更加成熟意味着您不仅了解工作的“内容”，而且还了解“如何”表现出色。强调对您的职业成就和进步做出贡献的个人技能、人际交往技能和软技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可靠、准时和承诺等个人技能显示了您完成工作的整体职业道德和精力。软技能也很重要，例如独立执行工作、能够在组织的各个级别工作以及了解您的工作如何为公司的更大目标做出贡献的能力。例如，如果您有机会向首席执行官或其他高管展示或与他们一起工作，请突出显示这一经历，以表明您具有高管风范、有效沟通的能力，并且您不会被更高级的领导者吓倒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，人际交往能力在企业工作场所中至关重要。知道如何与跨职能团队成员合作，与他人解决问题，通过变革协调和管理利益相关者，以及如何在没有权力的情况下施加影响，是每项工作都重视的技能。但你的目标是展示这些技能以及更高水平的商业头脑——也许可以通过举一个例子来展示你理解决策的广泛影响的能力，或者在回答问题时表现出盈利能力的方向。提供复杂工作环境的示例来展示您对人际交往能力的掌握，将使您与那些没有太多接触或时间来获得这种经验的初级员工区分开来。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;展示您将如何带来价值.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;即使您从未在您所追求的特定职业领域工作过，作为一名经验丰富的工人，您可能已经掌握了大量适用于该领域的技能和经验。在此期间，当许多公司通过合并角色来削减成本并期望员工事半功倍时，展示您的技能组合将有助于招聘经理将您视为最佳候选人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，说您的整个职业生涯都在金融领域工作，现在想进入商业运营领域。您对金融、平衡损益、摊销等细微差别的深刻理解，可能会让您成为比没有直接金融经验的资历较浅的人更有吸引力的候选人。当被问到一个以“告诉我一次……”开头的行为问题时，不要只从运营角度谈论你做了什么——还要解释你的金融背景如何成为你成功解决问题的主要原因。问题、影响某人的观点或获得利益相关者的一致。将这些点联系起来，以便面试官了解您广泛的技能如何使您比仅具有职位描述中列出的所需技能或工作经验更有限的人更有价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;展示您如何不断提高技能。 &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;不断地&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/5-ways-to-acquire-new-skills-without-going-back-to-school&quot;>;培养你的技能&lt;/a>;向你展示有精力继续学习，您就不会轻松退休。为了将自己与初级候选人区分开来，请解释一下您如何以与新职业相关的特定方式发展自己的技能和知识。通过查看最低和最高级别角色的职位描述，熟悉行业中常用的数字工具和应用程序。在那里，您会找到诸如“必须精通 X”或“必须具有利用 Y 等多种技术的经验......”之类的语言，然后研究这些应用程序在特定领域的使用方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，花时间了解人工智能和机器学习可能如何影响新的职业——即使你计划相对较快退休。通过简单搜索“人工智能对营销的影响”或“人工智能对金融的影响”，研究人工智能在您想要的领域中如何被使用或将来可能被使用。 Being able to discuss emerging technologies and how they&#39;ll change the way work is performed will elevate your candidacy above more junior candidates who don&#39;t have the analytical skills to apply this knowledge in future-focused, strategic conversations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Prepare to answer: “But you haven&#39;t actually done this before?”&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Never admit that! In all interviews, it&#39;s your job to connect the dots between your skills and the job you&#39;re interviewing for using keywords from the job description.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I transitioned from entertainment lawyer to HR business partner and executive coach, I was asked this exact question in every interview. Here&#39;s what I said to persuade hiring managers that I had the skills and capabilities to succeed in the new career (keywords from the job description are in bold):&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;HR business partners &lt;strong>;align employees&#39; skills and capabilities to achieve company goals&lt;/strong>;. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing on reality shows: &lt;strong>;strategically helping&lt;/strong>; creative executives and producers build strong casts of people with &lt;strong>;the right skills&lt;/strong>; to ensure successful shows &lt;strong>;that drive the business.&lt;/strong>; I&#39;m also in charge of &lt;strong>;coaching&lt;/strong>; producers &lt;strong>;on people-related issues that don&#39;t have a playbook&lt;/strong>; and &lt;strong>;require exceptional judgment&lt;/strong>;. This is exactly what &lt;strong>;HR business partners&lt;/strong>; do in an office — I&#39;m just on set.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;I work with my clients to prepare for this question when they&#39;re transitioning careers as well. For example, English teacher Janet was asked, “So are you a teacher or a program manager?” Janet replied:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Both. I am an English teacher but to perform that job, I need to be an &lt;strong>;exceptional program manager&lt;/strong>; in &lt;strong>;preparing programs to achieve our business objectives&lt;/strong>;, which in my world is to improve both student and faculty &lt;strong>;performance &lt;/strong>;across the district. Since I&#39;m more of a program manager than educator, I became &lt;strong>;program-management certified&lt;/strong>; so I could gain more tools and best practices in areas such as &lt;strong>;long-term planning&lt;/strong>;,&lt;strong>; reconciling interdependencies between multiple projects&lt;/strong>;,&lt;strong>; and facilitating communication on programs&lt;/strong>; across multiple schools and leaders within the district. I believe I can bring the most &lt;strong>;value&lt;/strong>; to a company as a &lt;strong>;program manager&lt;/strong>;, and that is why I am parlaying these &lt;strong>;skills and capabilities&lt;/strong>; into a more corporate setting.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h2>;Lean on and highlight your vast network.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;ve been in the workforce for 20 to 30 years, you&#39;ve likely worked with people who are now executives, board members, or managers and are therefore in a position to vouch for you. Leverage those relationships to learn about jobs (some of which may not be posted publicly yet), and see if those connections can introduce you to recruiters or hiring managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, for certain jobs, a vast network, which less-experienced candidates are less likely to have, could make you a particularly attractive candidate. For example, clients or contacts from your work in sales or business development could expand your reach, influence, or access to benefit the next company — and help you be perceived as more valuable than the less-established candidate who doesn&#39;t have a book of business or deep industry relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Changing careers as an older worker can be daunting, especially amid today&#39;s relentless uncertainty. But you already have what you need to set yourself apart as a candidate — you just need to do a little extra preparation to ensure that hiring managers and interviewers can see how your unique set of skills, experiences, and perspectives will move their team and organization forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Managers Are Burned Out.

It&amp;#8217;s your job to not only support your burned-out leaders, but also to keep burnout at bay going forward. In this article, the author offers six strategies to help recharge the burned-out managers on your team: 1) Recognize and acknowledge their burnout; 2) Create opportunities for personal connection both in person and virtually; 3) Re-assess, re-prioritize, and re-distribute their work; 4) Revise team agreements about how you all work together; 5) Touch base one-on-one with your leaders on a regular basis; and 6) Set the expectation with team members that they use all of their vacation time &amp;#8212; it can be easy to put off or skip vacation when there&amp;#8217;s so much to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/managers-are-burned-out-heres-how-to-help-them-recharge?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/managers-are-burned-out-heres-how-to-help-them-recharge?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Chances are managers in your organization are &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/more-than-50-of-managers-feel-burned-out&quot;>;feeling burned out&lt;/a>;. Middle managers have felt the squeeze of having to execute strategy from above while coaching and developing their teams below them — often without receiving the same type of development or empowerment from more senior managers. Often under-resourced, they frequently roll up their sleeves to do the work alongside their teams, particularly given higher rates of turnover in the last few years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/2023/07/in-defense-of-middle-management&quot;>;Research&lt;/a>; from McKinsey revealed that some middle managers spend up to two days a week on individual contributor work and a day a week on administrative tasks, in addition to their management responsibilities. Too much work, combined with too little time and resources adds up to scores of exhausted managers, who are almost &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/more-than-50-of-managers-feel-burned-out&quot;>;twice as likely to leave&lt;/a>; their employer, according to research from Microsoft.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Burnout goes well beyond simply being tired or stressed — thus, recovering from it is not a quick fix. It takes time, intention, and organizational support to not only regain a sense of equilibrium, but to also feel energized, engaged, and motivated again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be sure, each person&#39;s experience of burnout will be &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/your-burnout-is-unique-your-recovery-will-be-too&quot;>;different&lt;/a>;, so various approaches to address it will impact them differently. Likewise, there is no silver-bullet antidote. Employing a multi-pronged approach that includes the strategies below will help your managers in their burnout recovery journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Recognize &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;There are two aspects to this strategy. First, recognizing and showing concern that an individual is experiencing burnout can help them feel seen, understood, and even cared for. Acknowledging the burnout also puts it on the table so that it can be addressed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second aspect is to recognize the manager&#39;s sustained efforts and positive contribution or impact on the business. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workhuman.com/resources/reports-guides/from-thank-you-to-thriving-workhuman-gallup-report?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2023q2_wh_sem_nb_awareness_secondary_na_phr_pros&amp;amp;utm_content=workers_burnout&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwv8qkBhAnEiwAkY-ahmQoboWxnUHCOMtoK16gZ4GmZrzXKVd2RIKjn2OYTEAWhGeyBUPOBBoC3ZgQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; of more than 12,000 employees, Workhuman and Gallup showed a strong positive correlation between employee recognition and well-being, which also led to better business outcomes. Moreover, this recognition can show the individual they are making a difference, especially when their impact might not be as visible to them. This can help them to counter feelings of diminished efficacy, reduce their cynicism or mental distance from the job, and derive more meaning from their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When we take time to recognize people, it not only has a positive impact on them but on ourselves as well,” shares employee appreciation and workplace culture expert Christopher Littlefield. “The act of noticing what is going well, celebrating progress, and sharing the impact of their work helps us generate meaning, hope, and a sense of belonging — all things known to promote well-being. This can be as simple as taking five minutes to write a &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/how-to-write-a-meaningful-thank-you-note&quot;>;meaningful thank you note&lt;/a>;, give a quick&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/10/how-to-give-and-receive-compliments-at-work&quot;>;compliment&lt;/a>;, or even use&amp;nbsp;reflective recognition.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Reconnect&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Creating opportunities for personal connection (both in person and virtually) amongst managers as a group can counter feelings of isolation that are common with burnout, particularly for those working remotely. Creating a sense of community, where managers can share their challenges (and successes) with their peers not only facilitates support, but also reduces feelings of isolation that can come with burnout and creates a sense of being “in it together.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Likewise, connecting one-on-one beyond the work at hand can also be powerful, and may be more meaningful to some. “Picking up the phone to check-in on a colleague can help remind someone that you are there for them,” shared Adam Smiley Poswolsky, a workplace belonging keynote speaker. “Reconnecting with a coworker you haven&#39;t spoken to in a while can provide them with energy and inspiration – especially when they are struggling with stress or burnout.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poswolsky added: “A simple act of kindness — like remembering a coworker&#39;s birthday, or buying a colleague their favorite coffee order, makes people feel like they belong. When we &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/the-little-things-that-make-employees-feel-appreciated&quot;>;provide more time and space for human connection&lt;/a>; at work, we normalize talking about the full spectrum of human emotions, of which burnout is one of the most common. When we normalize talking about burnout or stress or loneliness, we help people feel less alone, which in turn can help them feel much better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Re-assess, Re-prioritize, and Re-distribute Work&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When managers are burned out, it&#39;s likely due in large part to an excessive, unrelenting volume of work, and as new priorities emerge, existing projects do not get de-prioritized. Everything has become important and stays on their plate, making the workload unsustainable.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conduct an audit of what your managers are each working on and what&#39;s consuming most of their time. Identify the top three areas that will make the biggest difference in achieving the organization&#39;s goals. Focus your managers&#39; effort on these and de-prioritize the rest. In doing so, determine what can be put on the back burner, what deadlines can be extended, or what can be cancelled altogether. Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/managers-adjust-your-expectations-without-lowering-the-bar&quot;>;re-assess&lt;/a>; the level of detail or quality needed for certain work products or metrics for success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of this re-evaluation, take time to understand each person&#39;s workload and capacity and &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant&quot;>;re-distribute work&lt;/a>;, as needed. Moreover, make this a regular practice to help your managers re-assess and manage priorities on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While you can&#39;t create more hours in the day, you can make the case to adjust the scope of the work to be commensurate with the resources available (ie, people, time, and budget) or advocate for more resources, such as budget to hire more people or engage outside contractors to share the workload, even if only temporary to manage a peak period.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Revise Team Agreements&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Empower the managers on your team to help solve the problem of burnout by revising agreements about how you all work together. What boundaries can you and the managers on your team agree to respecting? This may include things like not sending evening or weekend emails or avoiding other &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/dont-let-micro-stresses-burn-you-out?autocomplete=true&quot;>;micro-stresses&lt;/a>;. Looking for a better way forward together by creating new norms can help create a sense of agency that is often missing in cases of burnout.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a team, you can decide things like how you will hold each other accountable to your respective commitments, give each other permission to push back or say no, and establish specific non-meeting days to do focused work. Making these types of agreements can reduce wasted time, energy, and frustration, as well as create a sense of empowerment and ownership for their experience going forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Regularly Check In&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Touch base one-on-one with your managers on a regular basis, particularly those who have exhibited signs of burnout. Check in to see how they are doing and how you can best support them. &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/ask-your-team-what-are-you-stuck-on&quot;>;Ask them where they are stuck&lt;/a>;. Make it safe for them to speak up and tell you when they&#39;re feeling &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/10/how-to-deal-with-constantly-feeling-overwhelmed&quot;>;overwhelmed&lt;/a>; so you can discuss how you can make their work less taxing by clearing obstacles or taking things off their plate, as appropriate.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Relax and Reset&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While not sufficient alone to recover from burnout, taking a meaningful break from work to decompress is a necessary step to restore your managers&#39; energy level and help them reset, both mentally and physically. Set the expectation that they &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-taking-a-vacation-improves-your-well-being&quot;>;use all of their vacation time &lt;/a>;— it can be easy to put off or &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/thinking-of-skipping-vacation-dont&quot;>;skip vacation&lt;/a>; when there&#39;s so much to do. The reality is, there will &lt;em>;always &lt;/em>;be more to do, so trying to wait until you feel &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/youre-never-going-to-be-caught-up-at-work-stop-feeling-guilty-about-it&quot;>;caught up at work&lt;/a>; is like running a marathon with no finish line.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, by making vacation &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/what-one-company-learned-from-forcing-employees-to-use-their-vacation-time&quot;>;mandatory&lt;/a>;, you can help counter any warrior mentality in your organization&#39;s culture that might be a contributing factor to burnout. This can be done in a staggered way amongst team members to avoid business interruption, or some organizations choose to shut down completely during selected weeks of the year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whichever approach you take, give your people permission to completely unplug while they&#39;re away and role model this for your team. &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/dont-work-on-vacation-seriously&quot;>;Research&lt;/a>; shows that working during time off (which, sadly, two-thirds of Americans do), reduces intrinsic motivation, which will already be at a low point if the individual is burned out to begin with.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The remedy for burnout is not an instantaneous single solution, nor is it one-size fits all. Using the above strategies in combination over time will allow you to not only support and recharge your burned-out leaders, but also to keep burnout at bay going forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A More Ethical Approach to Employing Contractors]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/a-more-ethical-approach-to-employing-contractors]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_02_645973167.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;For companies, the practice of outsourcing labor to third parties has become attractive: they get a pre-screened, flexible workforce and the ability to offload the responsibilities of legal employment to someone else.

Those who were directly hired at Twitter woke up to an email with either a new assignment or a severance package. But contract workers like Melissa Ingle got nothing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ingle was contracted to work on political misinformation at Twitter, working to ensure that the midterm elections wouldn&#39;t be influenced by bots and hoaxes. She and her fellow contract workers rushed to check their inboxes for their decision emails — but they never got one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Melissa then tried to focus on her work in the week to come, tackling misinformation in the days leading up to the 2022 midterm elections, all the while wondering if that day would be her last at the company. On Saturday, November 12th, while Ingle was at the mall with her daughter and a friend, she received a notification that said “One or more of your access tokens have been revoked.” She tried opening her work email and Slack, only to get a notice that said “No such user exists.” That was the way Melissa was fired. No meeting to discuss it, not even an email — she was just deleted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/05/tech-layoffs-contract-temp-workers/&quot;>;Melissa&#39;s experience isn&#39;t unique&lt;/a>;. In California alone, estimates suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanstaffing.net/research/fact-sheets-analysis-staffing-industry-trends/staffing-statistics-by-state/&quot;>;nearly 2 million p&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://americanstaffing.net/research/fact-sheets-analysis-staffing-industry-trends/staffing-statistics-by-state/&quot;>;eople &lt;/a>;are working as contract workers — often doing the same work as their directly hired counterparts with less pay, worse benefits, and fewer protections.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For companies, the practice of outsourcing labor to third parties has become attractive: they get a pre-screened, flexible workforce and the ability to offload the responsibilities of legal employment to someone else. That compelling opportunity has spread far beyond tech to industries from healthcare and logistics. Gusto, a human resources services company, has found that the number of employers on its platform using contract workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://gusto.com/company-news/us-contract-work-2022-survey&quot;>;has increased by 28% since the start of the pandemic&lt;/a>;, with a ratio of contract workers to employees at the average company being nearly 1-to-5.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, this workforce model comes at a cost, to both workers and companies. Our research shows that contract workers — who &lt;a href=&quot;https://contractwork.techequitycollaborative.org/&quot;>;are more likely to be Black, Indigenous, Latinx, women, and nonbinary&lt;/a>; — are often doing the same work as their directly employed peers while making less money, receiving fewer benefits, and experiencing significant job precarity. This dynamic not only opens up contract workers to harm — it also opens up companies to some big risks. What was originally considered a system to reduce a company&#39;s ongoing financial responsibilities, contracting out has become a legal, financial, and reputational liability. Increasingly, courts and regulatory bodies are finding that when worker harm exists, employers are liable for that harm — whether they are the direct employer or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a way for employers to contract out responsibility without exposing workers to harm — and themselves to increased liability. By implementing responsible contracting standards that ensure workers have basic protections and pathways to opportunity, employers can mitigate their risk. Implementing these standards can also work towards diversity, equity, and inclusion commitments, by unlocking this pool of qualified, diverse talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of our research at &lt;a href=&quot;https://techequitycollaborative.org/&quot;>;TechEquity Collaborative&lt;/a>;, we created the Responsible Contracting Standard to act as a blueprint for companies to implement clear, high-road contracting practices that benefit workers and companies alike.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Harms and Risks of Contract Work&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In 1996, long-serving “temporary” contract workers sued Microsoft for the benefits they would have received if classified as direct employees. The workers argued that performing the same job functions and working for the same managers as direct employees entitled them to the same compensation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2000/12/13/microsoft-to-settle-with-temp-workers/6f59576a-0725-4bea-93cc-3e2d759bda45/&quot;>;Microsoft settled the lawsuit in 2000&lt;/a>;, and the case has informed how tech companies navigate the separation between contract and direct employment ever since.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies have set up (often flimsy) firewalls and processes to avoid classifying contract workers as employees — requiring them to use a different colored badge to enter the building, barring them from using internal systems, excluding them from all-staff events like annual holiday parties, and more. Meanwhile, many contract workers&#39; performance management and daily responsibilities are directly controlled by the tech company. At the same time, after the Microsoft lawsuit, many companies structured their contracts as ever-revolving doors: workers start on an initial contract, frequently for a six-month term, and their managers extend their jobs in repeated, shorter increments. These contracts can be canceled or not renewed at any time, leaving the workers in a constant state of precarity. Many of these workers stay in this pattern of short-term non-guaranteed contract extensions for up to two years, when they are made to take a break lest the companies run up against the standards laid out in the Microsoft settlement for qualifying as direct employees. Once they&#39;ve been away from the company for up to six months, many of them are hired back to start the process over, exposing the farce that they are “temporary” employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only are the contracts themselves disjointed, but so are the jobs they&#39;re performing. Contract workers are often stuck in the middle of a dual management structure: their day-to-day work is overseen by a manager at the parent company while the operational aspects of their employment — processing pay, managing benefits, and handling workplace complaints — are the purview of the staffing agency that hired them. Keeping contract workers at arm&#39;s length — whether it be the lack of access to company human resources, internal tools, and information, or career development — creates leaky communication pipelines, power imbalances, and the potential for worker harm.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the precarity of contract work (and the risk it creates for companies) is compounded by racial and gender inequities. In the tech industry, we found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://contractwork.techequitycollaborative.org/&quot;>;contract and temp workers are more likely to be Black, Indigenous, Latinx, women, and nonbinary&lt;/a>; than those in the directly employed workforce. Research examining temp work in blue-collar jobs in Illinois found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-temporary-staffing-agencies-racial-discrimination-20210223-34sof3i56rhjxhzu42xtcshx44-story.html&quot;>;Black and Latinx workers comprise 85% of blue-collar temp assignments in Chicago&lt;/a>; but only account for 40% of the population.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of these potential harms, compounded by race and gender inequities, create a potential legal liability. If a worker experiences harm — whether that&#39;s wage and hour violations, harassment, discrimination, or a hostile work environment — and decides to pursue remedies for that harm, companies aren&#39;t necessarily off the hook, even when they argue that they aren&#39;t the worker&#39;s legal employer. Courts and regulatory agencies have increasingly found the companies to be joint employers alongside the staffing agencies and thus liable for any violation or harm inflicted on the contract worker. There have been several high-profile instances of this dynamic in the tech sector in the last five years.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;In 2021, Meta agreed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/facebook-content-moderators-safe-workplace-litigation/#:~:text=viewing%20objectionable%20conduct.-,The%20award%20also%20establishes%20a%20%2452%20million%20fund%20for%20ongoing,financial%20compensation%20for%20content%20moderators.&quot;>;pay $52 million to content moderators&lt;/a>; who were hired through a third-party staffing agency to review disturbing content ranging from child pornography to suicide and bestiality — without adequate health and safety measures in place.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;In a class-action lawsuit against Riot Games, a judge ruled that contract workers should be included in a 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/27/riot-discrimination-100-million-settlement/&quot;>;$100M settlement&lt;/a>; for experiencing workplace gender discrimination and harassment.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Activision Blizzard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/29/1089577389/judge-activision-blizzard-settlement-sexual-harassment&quot;>;paid an $18 million settlement&lt;/a>; for subjecting female workers, including direct employees and contract workers, to sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Companies that do not adopt high-road contracting practices create a race to the bottom, degrading job quality and career mobility. Enacting high-road practices, and requiring them of any vendor your company works with, helps mitigate the potential for worker harm in the first place which helps reduce future liability and risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Way Forward: Responsible Contracting Standards&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Simply put, the best way to avoid liability for worker harm is to reduce the potential for harm in the first place. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://techequitycollaborative.org/download-responsible-contracting-standard/&quot;>;Responsible Contracting Standard&lt;/a>; offers six clear avenues companies can pursue to reduce worker harm, mitigate corporate risk, and close the equity gap for contract workers at your workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Family-Sustaining Pay&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This one is pretty straightforward — all workers should be paid family-sustaining wages and benefits. By being explicit about how much you expect contract workers to be paid by contracting agencies, you can make sure contract workers receive family-sustaining pay — often without needing to raise your contract budget at all. Other best practices include requiring staffing agencies to provide family-sustaining benefits, predictable schedules, clear communication on contract renewals, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Equal Pay for Equal Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All available research shows that contract workers are often paid less for doing the same job as full-time employees. You can ensure equal pay for equal work by providing transparent and responsive systems for raises and promotions, requiring staffing agencies to report on pay data, comparing pay rates with your full-time workforce, and implementing equitable hiring practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Workplace Safety Protocols and Worker Voice&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Contract workers routinely face the choice between speaking up about problems in the workplace and having their contracts canceled. Creating clear channels for reporting problems and including contract workers in company-wide communication streams can contribute positively to workplace morale for your direct employees and contract workers alike.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Equitable Procurement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One reason contract workers may experience pay disparities compared to the full-time workforce is that staffing agencies are taking a larger cut of the contract than you bargained for. Often, companies think they are hiring contract workers at the same rate as other employees on their team, not realizing that staffing agencies take a significant cut of the wages. Requiring staffing agencies to disclose their “markup” fee or pay rates for workers can help bring transparency to the process and help your company avoid inequitable pay structures — without having to increase your overall costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Pathways to Direct Employment&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Contract workers of color, especially Black workers, are more likely to have experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/article/eliminating-black-white-wealth-gap-generational-challenge/&quot;>;structural barriers to building wealth&lt;/a>;. One way to address occupational segregation is to provide meaningful pathways from contract positions into full-time roles at your company. Some best practices include allowing workers to share their experience working for your company on their resume, granting access to internal job boards, ending non-compete agreements for contract workers, and providing professional development training. Through forging real opportunities for career mobility, your company can tap into a pre-qualified, diverse pool of talent that not only advances equity but also lowers recruitment costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Transparency&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Demonstrate your company&#39;s values and commitments to shareholders, workers, and the public by being transparent with your responsible contracting. Measuring the adoption of these practices amongst vendors, auditing the standard&#39;s implementation, and checking in with workers directly to learn more about their experience — all help ensure that your written policies are correctly applied by the staffing agencies you employ.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Responsible contracting isn&#39;t solely about risk mitigation. Beyond “doing the right thing” as an inherent business value, responsible contracting is an investment that attracts and cultivates talent, lifts employee morale, generates returns, and bolsters your brand. An upfront investment will help your company actualize commitments to inclusion — and reap the benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Pandemic Changed Marketing Channels]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-the-pandemic-changed-marketing-channels]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_01_AdriaVolta.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Adrià Voltà&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The pandemic undoubtedly changed how marketers approach channel strategy, and there is no single route to success. With more channels than ever, marketers need to map which channels add clear value and forget the rest. It can be tempting to enter a channel because your competitors are there. But with limited customer time and attention, marketers must strategically determine in which channels they can have the greatest impact. The authors look at five post-pandemic channel strategies gleaned from The CMO Survey and offer analysis on how marketers can operationalize these trends.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-the-pandemic-changed-marketing-channels?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-the-pandemic-changed-marketing-channels?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The Covid-19 pandemic pushed companies to quickly adapt and respond to new customer requirements. One of the ways this dynamic was most apparent was in the marketing channels companies adopted to engage with and sell to customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what changed? The latest version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmosurvey.org/results/&quot;>;The CMO Survey&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;identifies five key trends gleaned from 314 US marketing leaders. We also offer our analysis and recommendations to help marketers operationalize these trends.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Channels are expanding. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Nearly two-thirds (61%) of companies reported increasing the number of channels they use. While true across both B2B and B2C firms, B2C services led with 77% reporting an increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One upside of channel expansion is that consumers can now choose their preferred method of interacting with companies. However, expanding channels takes significant effort and investment. Before jumping in, marketing teams should ask:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Will the new channel attract new customers to the category, steal existing customers from competitors, or increase share of wallet from current customers?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is the larger number of channels aligned from a brand and customer experience perspective?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do the touchpoints point to the same benefits and brand image?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Are the channels seamlessly connected?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do customers understand the value they acquire by using different channels and how to move easily between them?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Face-to-face (F2F) channels are alive and well. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Only 6.7% of companies report that their F2F channels have become completely digital — meaning most have stayed F2F. Further, 28% of companies are opening new F2F channels.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given the digital transformation of companies and marketplaces, we expected to see a larger reduction in F2F channels. We think there are three reasons channels have persisted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, consumers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://siteefy.com/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/&quot;>;exposed&lt;/a>; to 5,000 to 10,000 advertisements a day. This digital clutter is hard to penetrate, so staying F2F may provide marketers with different ways to reach consumers and achieve breakthrough.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, consumers report experiencing digital fatigue from the number of apps used and screen interactions they use in an average day — a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lxahub.com/stories/what-is-digital-event-fatigue-and-how-can-marketers-avoid-it&quot;>;level&lt;/a>; that has increased by more than 100% during the pandemic. As a result, we suspect that many people are craving human interactions from their all-consuming digital lives. Consumers also &lt;a href=&quot;https://escp.eu/news/why-consumers-seek-refuge-products-branded-authentic-pandemic-and-post-pandemic-era&quot;>;want more authenticity&lt;/a>;, a natural response to the risk and uncertainty of the last three years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, many companies view F2F channels, such as brick-and-mortar stores, as labs for learning about consumer behaviors. They&#39;re leveraging advanced technology, such as IoT-connected merchandise and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/customer-footfall-analysis-why-important-geoiq-io/&quot;>;footfall analyses&lt;/a>;, to learn more about what customers want and how they behave during the journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We did, however, observe several differences in our sample that may be useful in diagnosing the need for F2F channels in your industry. Product companies are less likely to go fully digital and are more likely to report opening new F2F channels (31%) compared to services companies (22%). Only pure-play internet companies are not opening F2F channels. New F2F channels are most prevalent in the real estate, retail, and communications/media sectors and least likely in health care, pharma/biotech, and technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Brand social media use is expanding. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Nearly half (45%) of companies are now using social channels to sell products and services, and (61.5%) of B2C services companies are. In this sector, real estate firms (100%), communications/media companies (82%), and retailers/wholesalers (70%) lead the pack.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media companies such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram achieved record-high e-commerce sales during the first year of the pandemic. Instagram&#39;s rollout of in-app checkout in 2020 may have accelerated this process, opening the door to reach more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/183585/instagram-number-of-global-users/&quot;>;1.2 billion&lt;/a>; users scrolling their social feeds. Furthermore, the ease of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-social-commerce-is-reshaping-customer-experience/#Social_channels_are_the_new_storefronts&quot;>;social messaging&lt;/a>; allows marketers to engage in real time with customers to answer questions. In 2022, more than half of US adults &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-commerce-brand-trends-marketing-strategies/&quot;>;purchased&lt;/a>; something through a social media channel, and a Sprout Social &lt;a href=&quot;https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-shopping-2022/&quot;>;survey&lt;/a>; found 98% expected to use this channel to make a purchase in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the example of Scrub Daddy, which has established a cheeky TikTok personality and collaborated with up-and-coming social media influencers, resulting in billions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foodandwine.com/scrub-daddy-review-trend-7483598#:~:text=Designed%20to%20make%20the%20often,3%20billion%20views%20on%20TikTok.&quot;>;views&lt;/a>; and millions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90756764/how-to-find-tiktok-influencers-scrub-daddy&quot;>;followers&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2022/02/21/how-viral-tiktok-fame-propelling-scrub-daddy-100m.html&quot;>;online sales&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we think about brands on social media, we tend to envision B2C brands. Indeed, those companies are more likely to sell their products and services on social channels (58%) compared to B2B brands (37%). However, there is a place for B2B companies in this world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/cmr.2014.56.3.142?casa_token=cu8dtuoZwScAAAAA:dv3SkiOmyT4Vr0cgFpqQlEI8v_hFu0w9ij_uacVoe61fl5egMUdQnKhWj3py-wCL1w2d1ioAWetWakc&quot;>;Maersk&lt;/a>;, the Danish shipping company, which launched a social media campaign more than a decade ago to build its brand reputation. Managers were surprised to find that 22% of its 850,000 Facebook followers were actual customers (even though Maersk was not yet selling shipping services online). Leveraging this channel for feedback and follow-up sales was a natural next step for the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, it has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-statistics/&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that 89% of B2B marketers turn to LinkedIn to generate leads. These numbers are encouraging and we expect they will only increase as younger, social media-savvy consumers move into management positions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The D2C revolution has begun. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Almost a quarter (24%) of companies added a direct-to-customer (D2C) channel in 2023. B2C product companies led the charge with 41% of brands adopting this channel.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are brands moving into D2C channels? First and most importantly, D2C allows companies to gather valuable firsthand insights into customer online behavior and needs — an opportunity companies in certain sectors, such as consumer packaged goods (CPG), have historically lacked. This first-party data is more important than ever given growing privacy restrictions on access to third-party data around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, D2C lets companies test new strategies and collect valuable feedback. If used wisely, this type of experimentation should yield more effective and efficient strategies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, D2C means companies can control the customer experience with the brand. This is especially important for premium and unique brands that deliver their benefits, in part, through the channels experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given these reasons, we weren&#39;t surprised to find that 55% of CPG companies report adding D2C. B2C services made the biggest leap — up from 15% in 2022 to 45% in 2023.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tesla has fully embraced the D2C revolution. The company sells its vehicles directly to customers through its online platform and national network of retail stores in major urban centers in US By bypassing traditional car dealerships, Tesla is able to control the sales experience (and markups), which most consumers find unpleasant.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies should consider two important factors before entering this space. First, does the company have a robust &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adroll.com/blog/what-is-d2c-and-why-does-it-matter#:~:text=A%20Better%20Connection%20With%20Customers&amp;amp;text=By%20offering%20a%20more%20streamlined,loyalty%20and%20encourage%20repeat%20business.&quot;>;digital&lt;/a>; footprint in place to analyze and execute D2C strategies? This is important considering D2C models&#39; reliance on digital marketing, social media, and data analytics skills to deliver positive returns. Also, does the brand have customer-service structures ready to handle the likely increase in customer interactions from this direct channel?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent partners from moving direct to consumers, we recommend distributors and other intermediaries provide value-added services in marketing, inventory, or logistics. Sharing customer data and analytics can also foster long-lasting and mutually beneficial partnerships between organizations. Another powerful partnership strategy is to leverage cross-category perspectives to share recommendations with key partners for new products, in-store advertising and promotion strategies, and even potential acquisition targets. The point is: provide value!&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Gamification is underutilized. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Gamifying shopping and other customer interactions via rewards, points, competitions, or other similar fun interactions is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/gamification.asp&quot;>;expected&lt;/a>; to grow from $9.1B in 2020 to $30.7B in 2025 — a 237% increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, only 4.8% of marketers integrated gamification into digital channels to sell. B2C product companies (13%) and companies with sales of $10 billion or higher (23%) are outpacing other sectors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large-scale research of the effect of gamification on brand outcomes has not been performed. However, practitioner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/coping-with-the-big-switch-how-paid-loyalty-programs-can-help-bring-consumers-back-to-your-brand&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; has shown that loyalty programs do increase the likelihood that customers will choose the brand over competitors, pay higher prices, and increase their spending levels. Gamification, we suspect, is only likely to heighten these effects. Given this, we think this low percentage is a missed opportunity for many companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to making gamification work is brand fit – the game has to make sense given the brand&#39;s position and associations. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpronews.com/business-leveraging-gamification/&quot;>;Fitbit&lt;/a>;&#39;s exercise milestones and friendly competitions help consumers gain more benefits from their devices and increase the likelihood they&#39;ll buy more products and recommend them to their friends. The game also needs to be engaging, but low-cost or free. If either of these elements are missing, current and potential customers will not play. Therefore, marketers must understand what motivates and delights their customers and use small-scale experiments to test different approaches to assess these costs and benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gamification is more daunting for B2B companies. Our findings show only 1% of B2B companies are using this strategy, compared to 13% of B2C companies. Using gamification with employees who serve B2B customers, including your salesforce, is perhaps the easiest way to begin the process. Another option is to introduce gamification during webinars that are generally somewhat boring. This may provide a way to keep attending prospects paying closer attention to sales pitches.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Evaluate and Deploy New Channels Strategically &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The pandemic undoubtedly changed how marketers approach channel strategy, and there is no single route to success. With more channels than ever, marketers need to map which channels add clear value and forget the rest. It can be tempting to enter a channel because your competitors are there. But with limited customer time and attention, marketers must strategically determine in which channels they can have the greatest impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Using AI to Build Stronger Connections with Customers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/using-ai-to-build-stronger-connections-with-customers]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_01_1500238081.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;As companies learn to use generative AI to create value, there&amp;#8217;sa risk that they take the wrong approach when applying the technology to the customer experience. In fact, research shows AI can help boost customer satisfaction when it&amp;#8217;s used to offer customers more personalized solutions or to help human employees provide better service than they would without the technological assist. Some examples of companies experiencing early success with this are in the financial services industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/using-ai-to-build-stronger-connections-with-customers?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/using-ai-to-build-stronger-connections-with-customers?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The surge of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications is spurring exciting innovations and consumer experiments, but it also worries many people who are concerned about data privacy or only being able to communicate with a company through a bot. These concerns are especially acute in industries where customer interactions and data privacy are critical, such as banking or healthcare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some level of anxiety typically accompanies breakthrough technologies, and it&#39;s natural to worry about a technology that mimics human intelligence. As this new class of large language models has emerged, however, most companies have put model risk, accuracy of the model&#39;s output, and ethical use of data at the heart of their risk frameworks. They aim to ensure responsible uses of new AI technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less appreciated is the risk that companies will cede the customer experience to models and bots designed to extract value in the short term, not to foster long-term customer loyalty. Companies might increasingly pair traditional AI and machine learning models with generative AI to deliver messages and offers to customers in more human-like ways. If we are not careful, profit-seeking bots, algorithms, and predictive models could indeed lead to dystopian experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the world of AI, customer love should lead the way. Traditional metrics of customer sentiment, such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), may start to look different, but one premise will endure: Every interaction enhances or diminishes a customer&#39;s perception the company involved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Informing each decision with the goal of enriching customers&#39; lives will lay down a reliable route to an AI-enabled future that creates more value for customers, employees, and shareholders. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31161/w31161.pdf&quot;>;early published results&lt;/a>; from researchers at Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology show favorable effects from the rollout of an AI-based conversational assistant tool to 5,200 customer support agents in several countries. Not only did the tool raise agent productivity by 14% on average, but the AI-assisted interactions had higher average NPS, and monthly agent attrition dropped by 9%.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Make It Personal&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Orienting AI around customer love requires a fundamental rethink of objective functions. Most existing algorithms optimize around ROI for a particular moment rather than around an entire experience. AI-enabled customer engagement holds the promise of a company learning more from each interaction and finding more ways to create value for customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s a good sign because customers increasingly expect more personalized, relevant experiences and are open to sharing their data in return. Bain &amp;amp; Company&#39;s latest survey of almost 30,000 banking customers in 11 countries found that the respondents who agreed that their bank personalizes the experience are more likely to reward it with a higher NPS. There&#39;s a 123-point difference in NPS between respondents who strongly agree that their bank interacts based on knowing who they are and those who strongly disagree.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way AI refines personalization is through digital assistants for customers, as shown by emerging efforts in banking and payments. Royal Bank of Canada uses an AI-enabled assistant called NOMI to personalize digital money management for customers. Features include timely tips pushed to clients, personalized budgets, and savings recommendations based on spending behavior and cash flow. In the year following its launch, the results were promising, with 50% more&amp;nbsp;digital interactions for NOMI customers relative to the entire customer base, 93% more time spent on financial accounts, and 2% attrition of NOMI customers vs. 8% for their peers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI digital assistants are also helping employees to strengthen their customer connections, reinforcing the places where a human touch may be a source of differentiation. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, for instance, is rolling out an AI assistant to help its thousands of financial advisers better support their clients in a personalized way. The assistant combines search and content creation so that financial advisers can quickly find and tailor the right information for each client at any moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large language models will enable a new era of personalization. Machine learning techniques already turn each customer&#39;s pattern of digital interactions into a unique behavioral “fingerprint,” and recent AI advances will now enable these fingerprints to include speech and text interactions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Help employees help their customers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Companies should start with a few no-regrets cases to get the organization comfortable with generative AI technology. These typically use AI to help employees who deliver aspects of the customer experience so that humans can vet the model&#39;s output. Examples include suggestions to relationship managers for the next conversation with a customer based on recent engagement or providing specific actions for handling collections with customers facing financial hardship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next wave of cases would feature AI embedded in standard operating procedures for employees. Promising cases include predictive routing of a customer&#39;s inquiry to the agent best equipped to handle a particular issue or real-time script recommendations for relationship managers. The technology will listen to a customer call in real time and help agents know whether their interactions are creating a promoter or a detractor Other employee-supporting features in the near future could include devising a personalized offer with images and text that evoke a customer&#39;s favorite hobby or reminding a relationship manager to call on a customer during key life stages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a few industries such as retail, a fully AI-enabled front line is starting to support automated engagement directly with customers. Over time, this digital front line could deliver service with the same thoughtful empathy as traditional human front lines. Bots will engage with customers and learn to serve up relevant products and information just as the best employees have always done. The best uses of AI may even completely reimagine the overall experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a time of high inflation and tight economics, some managers may be tempted to use generative AI technology only to cut costs and improve efficiency. That would be misguided. While generative AI has the potential to bend the cost curve in many industries, the greatest value will come to those companies that focus on enriching the lives of their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
