&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/what-is -responsible-computing?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/what-is-responsible-computing?language=pt&quot;>;阅读葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在过去几年中，IBM 与数百位首席技术官 (CTO) 进行了交谈，反映了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/thought- Leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/cto&quot;>;一系列架构决策点报告&lt;/a>;。显然，企业领导者认识到技术将成为交付未来企业的核心部分。然而，他们也清楚地意识到，社会正在寻求企业证明他们可以按照他们所拥护的价值观生活——而计算可以发挥关键作用。这些首席技术官提到，技术的社会影响让他们彻夜难眠。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于企业来说，技术具有各种相互关联的影响，包括意想不到的后果、数据风险和技术使用的适当性。作为更广泛的环境问题。领导者担心会给公司带来漏洞，担心部署带有有害偏见的系统，担心内部和公众如何看待人工智能，以及使用某些技术对环境的影响。这些问题都是相互关联的，尽管它们经常被单独讨论。如果公司想要确保他们是负责任的技术用户，他们需要一种整体方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在 IBM 与我们的 CTO 外展合作中开发了一个系统性的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://responsiblecomputing .net/&quot;>;负责任的计算框架&lt;/a>;将能源消耗和排放等环境挑战与许多其他社会和治理方面相结合。这是一个实用的蓝图，企业可以利用它来使其 IT 更加绿色、道德、值得信赖和可持续。我们的负责任计算框架强调了企业领导者需要解决的六大支柱，以使其企业成为负责任的计算提供商：数据中心、基础设施、代码、数据、系统和影响力。对于每一个，我们都提供了几个可用于进行比较的 KPI。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;负责任的数据中心&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;负责任计算的第一个支柱是开发和提供 IT 服务所需的物理基础设施 —无论您是否自己运营数据中心。全球数据中心电力容量增长了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/23/2390642/0/en/The-Global-Data-Center-Market -Size-to-Reach-288-30-Billion-by-2027-Arizton.html&quot;>;过去三年占 43%&lt;/a>;，效率低下是一个重大问题：&lt;a href=&quot;https:// /www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/data-center-efficiency-assessment-IP.pdf&quot;>;平均服务器&lt;/a>;以其容量的 12% 至 18% 运行，但消耗了 30% 至 60% 的资源最大功率。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks&quot;>;国际能源署 (IEA)&lt;/a>; 预测全球数据中心的能源使用将从占全球电力需求的 1% 跃升至&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06610-y&quot;>;超过 20%&lt;/a>;十年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要衡量数据中心的影响，您需要考虑能源来源、与冷却相关的能源使用&lt;strong>;、&lt;/strong>;和用水量，以及&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/feature/Words-to-go-6-key-data-center-sustainability-metrics&quot;>;跟踪每个指标的 KPI&lt;/a>;。如果您不运行自己的数据中心，则可以选择最成熟的云服务提供商，例如 &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sustainability/&quot;>;AWS&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https ://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Cloud-Carbon-Calculator-Aims-to-Help-Organizations-Address-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-to-Advance-their-Sustainability-Objectives&quot;>;IBM&lt;/a>;，或&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-microsoft-measures-datacenter-water-and-energy-use-to-improve-azure-cloud-sustainability/&quot;>; Microsoft&lt;/a>; 将其作为其服务的一部分进行衡量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，考虑碳足迹，即数据中心使用能源时排放的二氧化碳量。考虑数据中心每天产生多少二氧化碳（碳使用效率）；数据中心消耗的能源有多清洁（技术碳效率）；以及现场产生了多少可再生能源（绿色能源系数）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来是效率足迹，或者说数据中心对其计算基础设施的优化程度。为了衡量这一点，您可以查看数据中心基础设施专门使用了多少能源、数据中心内有多少能源在设施的其他地方重复使用，以及 HVAC 系统的有效性或冷却系统的整体效率。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，还有数据中心在运营过程中使用的水量，或者说水足迹。这需要分解水的使用方式，考虑基础设施、发电以及有多少水被回收用于其他目的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过清楚地了解数据中心的电源、冷却和用水情况，企业领导者可以开始批判性地思考解决这个问题。如何转向可持续能源？如何使用碳补偿？将您的基础设施转移到气候凉爽的地方会节省能源吗？您可以将基础设施产生的热量用于其他目的吗？如何节约用水？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;负责任的基础设施&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;第二个支柱是减少计算对环境的影响。这要求您评估您所在的整个计算生态系统，而不仅仅是您自己的基础设施，包括开发、测试、交付、监控、控制和支持 IT 服务所需的硬件、软件和网络。虽然大多数制造商在询问时都会分享这些信息，但也有多个行业举措，例如来自 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Documents/Toolbox/GEM_2020_def.pdf &quot;>;国际电信联盟&lt;/a>;，标准化数据并制定最佳实践。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，考虑现在使用的计算硬件。这可以通过用电 KPI 来衡量，例如每个硬件单元的平均耗电量、计算硬件的使用频率以及一个月内使用的硬件与已安装硬件的比例。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下一步，您需要了解单位硬件的温室气体排放量，或单位碳足迹。该关键绩​​效指标衡量单个硬件单元在其生命周期的不同阶段产生的温室气体排放总量——从最初的资源开采到前体的制造、单元的制造、运行，以及一次处置的排放量。它已被取代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，测量计算产生的浪费量。这可以包括有多少硬件被送往垃圾填埋场，以及有多少硬件被翻新、再利用、转售或回收（电子废物率）。它还可以评估您的塑料足迹，根据所用塑料的总重量或所用塑料聚合物的类型以及它们的潜在最终目的地或被回收的可能性进行计算。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦您有了考虑到您的基础设施，您可以开始考虑采取措施来解决您的计算影响。您可以使用哪些技术来降低单位功率？如何才能获得更多收益——例如，通过整合、合理化或删除不使用的系统？将闲置容量用于其他目的怎么样？如何更有效地回收或再利用？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;负责任的代码&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;第三个支柱是代码的效率，以及所使用的代码对环境、社会和经济的潜在影响。这涉及将责任落实到各个开发人员的层面，并确保开发负责任的设计原则或架构，以帮助他们做出正确的选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;理解负责任的代码如何工作的关键是“功能点”，即“功能点”。是表达代码提供的业务功能量的一种方式。有多种软件工具（&lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools&quot;>;开源&lt;/a>;和商业工具）可以帮助组织进行分析。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;首先测量功能点的效率，例如页面大小或每个进程的 HTTP 请求。您还应该测量每个功能点的碳影响 - 整个系统、单个功能点甚至功能点内单个流程的电力消耗。衡量功能点的安全性（例如已识别的漏洞数量）也至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，仔细查看您的代码架构。它的可扩展性如何？将代码转移到另一个平台有多容易？将一个系统中的功能点与其他系统中的功能点集成所花费的时间或成本也是一项有价值的 KPI。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，衡量代码的质量 - 例如，每个功能点的缺陷数量 -及其维护和返工属性。您还应该衡量代码的可靠性，例如整个系统、功能点甚至单个流程每季度的平均正常运行时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦您了解了功能点的效率以及整体架构和质量那么你就可以开始考虑如何改进。您应该使用开放代码还是专有代码？您的代码的安全性如何？你的代码有多开放？让代码可重用是否弊大于利？能否通过近似计算来降低计算的分辨率？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;负责任的数据&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;负责任计算的第四个支柱是数据的隐私、透明、共享和获取。该支柱直接解决了您了解在整个生命周期中处理数据的道德、法律和社会责任的责任，并允许领导者就数据的保护和隐私及其使用承担或委托所有权和责任。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;值得庆幸的是，这一领域正在进行大量工作，我们建议一个 KPI：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/responsible-data-maturity-model/&quot;>;负责任的数据成熟度模型&lt; /a>; 深入了解您的企业如何在 15 个领域（意识和能力、政策和治理、问责制、合作伙伴关系、库存、隐私、法律、风险、最小化、传输、安全、共享、组合）管理数据、保留和事件响应）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过此分析，您可以了解如何改进每个领域，以及如何跟踪改进。您是否有足够的数据治理？您是否了解您的企业负责的所有数据？谁对哪些数据负责？您当前的数据和法律风险是什么？您对数据事件的响应速度有多快？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;负责任的系统&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;负责任的系统是公平、负责和透明的系统。第五个支柱要求企业领导者了解他们的“系统”——工作中使用的硬件、数据、代码、模型和服务的集成集——以及使用它们的道德影响。这一支柱的核心是您组织内的系统所具有的公平性（或偏见），以及您的公司对这些系统以您的名义所做的事情负有多大的责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，考虑您的一个系统如何承担责任。系统可能会基于种族、性别、年龄或残疾等特征歧视或伤害人们。通过比较各组之间的结果来衡量这一点。更复杂的比较可以认识到群体在多个维度上存在差异。另一种方法可以衡量收到了多少关于系统公平性的投诉以及如何解决这些投诉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来，确定哪些系统指定了特定个人对结果负责，并衡量对法规的遵守情况、采取什么法律手段是否可以获得补救措施，以及企业对可能发生的任何损害承担的责任。这些观点将帮助您使这些系统更加透明。通过清楚地了解您的系统的公平性、责任性和透明度，您可以开始批判性地思考解决该问题。我们如何减少系统中的偏差？我们如何才能最大限度地减少责任风险？谁负责什么系统？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个重要的 KPI 是对可审计系统结果数量的分析，另一个是系统结果的可解释性。此外，衡量解释系统目标、方法和局限性的知识工件的数量。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;负责任的影响&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;最后一个支柱考虑如何利用技术来做好事——为了例如，解决社会流动性或排斥问题。但仅仅因为您的组织可以做某事，并不意味着它应该做。我们建议产生负责任影响的最佳方法是在联合国 17 个可持续发展目标 (SDG) 的背景下考虑您的计算。有些影响更为普遍，例如实现招聘中的性别平等（可持续发展目标 5）、提供体面工作（可持续发展目标 8）或减少收入不平等（可持续发展目标 10）。这里的KPI可以通过查看之前和之后的统计数据来考虑IT投资如何导致这种影响。同样，实现气候变化目标 (SDG 13) 的行动可以通过 KPI 来衡量，例如每个员工、每个客户和每个 SKU（盘点单位）的碳影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，其他影响措施将具体到行业。例如，IT 使用对农业产生的影响类型与零售业不同。农业公司可以衡量其 IT 投资如何减少农作物灌溉所需的水量（可持续发展目标 6）。同样，零售公司可以衡量其 IT 投资如何实现更可持续的消费和生产 (SDG 12)。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦您深入了解您的计算如何影响您在 SDG 方面的绩效，您就可以开始批判性地思考评估未来如何改进。您的 IT 如何以类似的方式帮助拯救生命或改善生活？如何创造新的就业机会或帮助人们发展新技能？您如何帮助加快对灾难或紧急情况的响应？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;前进之路&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;大流行以来的世界事件和地缘政治已经非常清楚地向企业领导人表明，他们的工人需要保护，并且他们的供应链比他们想象的更不稳定。这将注意力集中在企业责任以及我们如何使用稀缺资源上。特别是在 IT 领域，新常态就是快速、高效、有效和负责。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企业领导者面临的任务是为公司定位以实现规模和成功，同时采取道德和负责任的方法来实现目标。他们如何、在​​哪里以及为何使用 IT。我们采访过的首席技术官一致认为，实现真正持久的变革需要一种整体方法，涵盖计算生态系统的各个方面，从排放和材料到道德采购、数据管理和社会责任工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，企业领导者无法独自完成这一切。他们需要确保整个 IT 职能与其负责任的计算愿景保持一致。 IT 职能部门的每位成员都需要了解支撑负责任计算愿景的道德规范，并对自己的行为负责。这将需要一个专业化的 IT 职能部门，既要有能力实现愿景，又要具有包容性，以确保意见的多样性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了 IT 职能部门之外，整个高管层，员工、供应商、合作伙伴和客户需要更加关注他们如何消耗和节约宝贵的资源，这意味着为他们提供适当的激励措施。每个人都可以发挥作用：基础设施专家和应用程序开发人员，还有销售、营销、运营、财务、采购和设施方面的专业人士。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，这是一项艰巨的任务，但回报将是对组织的更大信任——最终，一个更美好的世界。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 07 Jul 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[6 Science-Backed Ways to Improve Your Well-Being at Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/6-science-backed-ways-to-improve-your-well-being-at-work]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p style=&quot;background: White&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #282828&quot;>;员工福祉是一个组织问题，而不仅仅是个人问题一。许多因素都会影响它，包括您的工作量和灵活性、您的经理以及团队内的文化。但是，虽然您可能没有能力改变您的组织或老板，但您可以每天做一些简单的、有科学依据的事情来改善您的情绪健康和幸福感。本文介绍了六种&lt;span style=&quot;background:white&quot;>;简单但令人惊讶的强大情绪健身练习，可帮助您更好地管理压力并改善您的健康&lt;/span>;。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/6-science-backed-ways-to-improve-your-well-being-at-work?语言=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/6-science-backed-ways-to-improve-your-well-being-at-work?language=pt&quot; >;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在过去的两年半中，我举办了超过 360 场关于情绪健康、幸福感、并避免倦怠。我有幸与来自各行各业的人们一起工作，包括新冠疫情前线的医生、大大小小的公司的员工以及非营利组织的专业人士。我有幸与他们中的许多人保持联系，了解哪些情绪健身实践对他们的健康产生了积极影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是我的重要收获：当谈到良好的改善时-在工作中，如果你坚持不懈地实践，小事就会产生大影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;需要明确的是：员工福祉是一个组织问题，而不仅仅是个人问题。许多因素都会影响它，包括您的工作量和灵活性、您的经理以及团队内的文化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，虽然您可能没有能力改变您的组织或老板，但有一些简单的方法，你每天可以做一些有科学依据的事情来改善你的情绪健康和幸福感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我将情绪健康定义为与自己、你的思想和情感以及其他人建立更具支持性的关系的技能。当您提高身体素质时，您就可以提高应对身体挑战的能力。当您改善情绪健康时，您就可以提高处理情绪挑战的能力，从而减少挣扎、压力和不知所措。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里有六种简单但令人惊讶的强大情绪健康练习，可帮助您更好地管理压力并改善您的情绪健康。幸福感：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;每天检查自己。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;问问自己：&lt;em>;我今天过得怎么样？我感觉如何？&lt;/em>;不要评判你的答案，也不要立即尝试“修复”你的感觉。只要意识到这一点即可。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在最近的一次主题演讲中分享了这种做法，后来一位年轻女士走过来告诉我，她以前听过我谈论过它。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在那一次，我感到非常疲惫，”她告诉我。 “我不确定这会有所不同，但我决定尝试一下每日签到。我很惊讶它让我感觉好多了。我不再被压力或不知所措的感觉所吞噬，而是意识到它们，现在感觉更能控制。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究支持她的经历：练习情绪意识的人&lt;a href=&quot;https ://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-021-00593-8&quot;>;更有可能报告幸福感更高&lt;/a>;。意识到你的困难感受会降低你经历这些感受的强度，并让你有机会做一些事情来支持自己，让自己感觉好一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;在这段时间内进行一些短暂的、高质量的休息。天。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这里的关键词是“质量”。这意味着做一些事情可以帮助你摆脱工作、补充能量和充电。浏览社交媒体或阅读新闻并不是一种质量休息，追赶待办事项列表也不是一种休息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人类大脑需要每 90 到 120 分钟休息一次，才能发挥最佳功能并避免累积压力和不堪重负。 Microsoft 最近进行了一项&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/brain-research&quot;>;大规模研究&lt;/a>;，发现&lt;a href =&quot;/2023/06/to-build-a-top-performing-team-ask-for-85-effort&quot;>;在会议之间休息 5 到 10 分钟&lt;/a>; 显着减少了累积的压力和压倒性的情况，并改善了集中精力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;白天，我最喜欢的脱离工作的方式是到外面散散步。大量研究表明，&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27100368/&quot;>;它可以改善你的情绪&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/dont- underestimate-the-power-of-a-walk&quot;>;提高注意力和动力&lt;/a>;，如果你坚持这样做，对健康有很多好处。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;练习接受，专注于什么你可以控制。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;接受涉及两个步骤：首先，清楚地承认情况，重点关注您知道的事实。其次，确定你可以采取的一个步骤，以减少压力和挣扎，继续前进。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们往往会低估对压力情况的反思会消耗我们多少能量。当您发现自己陷入消极想法的循环中时，练习接受这两个步骤有助于将您的注意力集中在您可以控制的事情上，并采取富有成效的行动，无论多么小。这个&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/05/small-wins-and-feeling-good&quot;>;小胜利&lt;/a>;会给你的大脑带来一种进步的感觉，这种感觉很好，并且经常激励你去寻找其他你可以采取的有用的步骤&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;参加我的领导力课程的一位女性最近告诉我，在工作中不断面临挑战和不确定性时，这是她的主要技能。在该课程中，我们学习了接受技能。 “每当我对工作环境、经济或团队事务的压力感到不知所措时，我都会停下来，深吸一口气，问自己，鉴于事情的现状和我的控制范围，我可以采取什么步骤来前进。作为一个团队提出这个问题也有助于我们的团队专注和压力水平，”她告诉我。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;优先考虑与同事联系的微小时刻。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;当您接到电话或白天第一次见到同事时，一定要以真诚的热情向他们打招呼。在虚拟会议中，人们倾向于深入讨论议程，首先要求每个人分享本周迄今为止的好事情。有意识地与同事联系只是为了了解情况，不要将谈话重点放在工作上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过多年的大流行隔离后，我们都渴望人与人之间的联系，这对我们的福祉产生了负面影响。作为人类，我们生来就有联系，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125010/&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;表明社会支持和感受保持联系可以改善心理健康，减轻压力和焦虑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，采取主动，每天与同事建立联系。这并不需要太多的努力或时间，但你会感到振奋并帮助他人减少孤独感。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;练习感恩来对抗大脑的消极偏见。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果你没有感恩的习惯，可以每天早上或晚上写下三件你欣赏的事情一样简单。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;培养感恩的心态总是有益于您的幸福，在这些不确定的时期更是如此。不确定性会带来极大的压力和精力——这是人类大脑最难处理的事情。当你的大脑遇到不确定性时，它会专注于寻找可能的危险，并进入“战斗或逃跑状态” &lt;/a>; 这样它就能保护你。这可能会导致对负面结果和最坏情况的焦虑和反思增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过练习感恩，你可以要求你的大脑扩大视野，将注意力集中在积极、有意义或令人安慰的事情上。目标不是否认您可能面临的困难，而是提醒自己它们并不是您生活的全部。这会激发您的情绪能量，并有助于提高您的适应能力，这是您在挑战中积极适应的能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;在工作之外进行积极的休息。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;最后，在工作之外花时间做自己喜欢的事情也很重要。把时间花在你最喜欢的爱好上。花时间阅读或园艺。尝试新的创意活动，例如水彩或写作。关键是要做一些积极的事情来补充你的能量并满足你除了工作之外的其他部分。 （相比之下，在 Netflix 前呆上几个小时并不是积极的休息，尽管时不时地观看一集您最喜欢的节目是一个不错的选择。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我自己精疲力尽后，我开始画画，拥有一些能让我完全脱离工作并满足自己的创意/艺术家部分的东西对我的幸福来说是一份巨大的礼物。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43532701_On_the_Role_of_Passion_for_Work_in_Burnout_A_Process_Model&quot;>;最近对护士职业倦怠的研究&lt;/a>;支持了我根据我的经验发现的事实：护士花时间积极休息当他们不工作时，无论是从事业余爱好还是与朋友或家人共度时光，与轮班结束后无意脱离工作的护士相比，他们不太可能感到倦怠。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style =“文本对齐：居中；”>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;俗话说：“你不是你的工作。”甚至，也许尤其是，如果你对工作充满热情，你就需要有意识地做你在工作之外喜欢的事情。如果您注重生产力的大脑反对，请提醒自己，积极的休息是对您长期充分发挥工作能力的投资。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 07 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Managers Can Dismantle &ldquo;Benevolent Marginalization&rdquo;]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-managers-can-dismantle-benevolent-marginalization]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;古谚授人以鱼不如授人以渔一条只能维持一天的鱼，也适用于组织如何增强弱势群体的能力，而不仅仅是帮助弱势群体。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;公司的多元化举措显着激增，相信多元化劳动力的好处和集体打击歧视的信念推动了这一进程。当组织努力建立包容性工作场所时，他们经常试图解决针对弱势群体的公开歧视和负面刻板印象。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;然而，这些善意的努力往往包括一个关键的监督：许多 DEI倡议的基础是错误的假设，即如果没有当权者的帮助，弱势群体将无能为力。这种保护主义信念导致了经常被忽视但却令人深感担忧的仁慈边缘化现象，即善意可能导致伤害。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;当主导群体家长式地控制弱势群体时，仁慈边缘化就会发生。或边缘化群体，同时将他们的行为描绘成支持并声援该群体。在旨在提升边缘化群体的善意行动的表面背后，微妙的权力失衡依然存在。 Managers may even expect gratitude for their affectionate and helpful efforts, while those who are marginalized find themselves pressured into accepting or internalizing the subordinating order as the norm and even expressing gratitude in return. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Our analysis draws upon over a decade of extensive research conducted in diverse contexts. We utilized interviews, archival documents, and observations of individuals navigating subtle forms of marginalization. We also examined the pivotal role of internal activists and managers who actively support and become allies to overcome benevolent marginalization&lt;i>;.&lt;/i>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Subtle Discrimination Perpetuates Gender Inequality&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Benevolent marginalization manifests as subtle discrimination that impacts various groups and makes them unlikely to intervene or dissent, thereby hindering their advancement and perpetuating organizational inequality.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Imagine the scenario of &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/06/dismantling-benevolent-sexism&quot;>;benevolent sexism&lt;/a>;. Despite the decline of overtly sexist attitudes, women still face subtle forms of discrimination that may contribute to their underrepresentation in executive positions. Women are often stereotyped as the “weaker sex” needing chivalrous protection, but this seemingly favorable treatment conceals male dominance and can have negative consequences. When women are shielded from challenging assignments at work, for example, it inadvertently encourages stereotypes and fosters self-doubt, ultimately hampering their professional performance.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMBPP.2021.10710abstract&quot;>;three-year study&lt;/a>; examining benevolent sexism, we took a closer look at women-only networking initiatives. These initiatives, touted as essential components of diversity guidelines within organizations, are often devised by male managers to assist women. However, women frequently perceive them as a superficial attempt or mere tokenism aimed at fulfilling diversity quotas and creating a facade of inclusivity. Many such initiatives place the burden of overcoming gender disparities on women, often treating them as a homogenous group while failing to address the underlying systemic bias that fuels gender inequality. Paradoxically, in our study, these women frequently found themselves obligated to participate in such initiatives, only to experience feelings of patronization and occasional polite dismissal. They also encountered instances of “mansplaining,” where men condescendingly or patronizingly explain the intricacies of networking, assuming women to have lesser or inferior knowledge of the subject. These experiences can result in women feeling disillusioned and disengaged from such initiatives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Yet, a remarkable transformation can occur when women take charge of these initiatives and tailor them to meet their individual needs. This can be achieved through collaborating with women across different levels of seniority to foster an inclusive networking environment that promotes diverse voices, offers mentorship and sponsorship opportunities, and creates spaces where women can openly and genuinely engage.&lt;i>; &lt;/i>;Our research suggests that women need to adopt a strategic, long-term perspective in their networking endeavors, prioritize follow-ups to build strong relationships, delineate tangible goals for professional advancement, and engage in ongoing evaluation and improvement of these initiatives. As a result, women can gain a sense of empowerment and find their voices to collectively combat gender inequality head-on.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;“Ableist Assumptions” Hinder Efforts to Help Workers with Disabilities&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Let us explore another compelling example: benevolent ableism, which refers to well-intentioned but problematic behaviors such as pity, protectiveness, and patronization toward employees with disabilities. Managers, guided by ableist assumptions, often impose their own definitions of disability, attempting to create “inclusive” environments that reinforce ableist norms in organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2020.1689&quot;>;longitudinal study&lt;/a>; of sheltered workshops, published in the Academy of Management Journal, disabled workers report that many inclusion initiatives at work are based on power imbalances rooted in pity. Sheltered workshops provide employment to disabled workers in segregated facilities with limited exposure to the broader public under the guise of care and protection. We show that well-intentioned managers often devise inclusion initiatives based on simplified assumptions that all workers with disabilities share identical needs of help and assistance — a paternalistic or even infantilizing approach that perpetuates inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a transformational moment may occur when these managers confront their own fallibility, let go of their defensive positions, abandon their patronizing behaviors, and provide opportunities to people with disabilities to bring out their untapped potential. This requires a change in communication from telling to listening and a change in behavior to promote inclusive practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One example of a patronizing initiative in this context involved assigning jobs that could be carried out within the confines of the sheltered workshop, limiting public engagement. These jobs encompassed metal processing, industrial assembly, packaging, and shipping. In contrast, a successful inclusive practice involved establishing a farmer&#39;s market in consultation with these workers and their representatives. Engaging directly with people from outside the sheltered workshop environment while selling farm produce gave these workers newfound self-belief, autonomy, and a sense of empowerment. This experience was a moment of epiphany that boosted workers&#39; confidence in their abilities to perform tasks they had never envisioned or been given the responsibility to perform. Managers also realized that they had unwittingly stifled the potential of some of these workers while trying to be protective and creating a secluded environment. This shift marked a profound turning point as managers transitioned from guardians to true allies of workers with disabilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Three Key Strategies to Tackle Benevolent Marginalization at Work&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In creating inclusive workplaces, managers need to invest time and resources in understanding and dismantling benevolent marginalization to ensure that equality in organizations becomes more than just a buzzword.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After studying this phenomenon across diverse settings, we present three key insights that serve as tools for managers aiming to go beyond good intentions:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Shift your perspective from help to empowerment.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In the pursuit of creating inclusive workplaces, the traditional approach of providing help can unintentionally reinforce unequal power dynamics. Managers must view disadvantaged individuals as equal colleagues. However, this is often easier said than done. Our findings reveal that practitioners may resist change, seeking to preserve deeply entrenched structures and the benefits they bring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, managers need to call out and confront such resistance to pave the way to a profound shift from protectionism toward self-determination and empowerment. This requires introspection that can prompt managers to scrutinize and challenge their own paternalistic assumptions and biases. Managers must recognize and address the often-hidden power dynamics at play when interacting with people with whom they have a significant power differential. Building trust, actively listening, and gaining awareness of the emotions behind their behaviors are crucial steps. Seeking candid feedback from colleagues, mentors, or coaches about one&#39;s paternalistic behaviors is vital for self-reflection, sensitization, and remediation. Lastly, it is important to display empathy toward marginalized perspectives, even when they differ from one&#39;s own, and refrain from making decisions on their behalf, regardless of good intentions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Harness allies in non-managerial roles.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Effectively addressing benevolent marginalization across an organization means tailoring initiatives that align with the unique interests of disadvantaged individuals. However, doing so requires the help of others beyond managers or designated diversity officers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is critical to leverage the power of intermediaries, such as support staff, close&amp;nbsp;colleagues, and friends, who are closer to the experiences and challenges faced by their marginalized peers. Identifying and designating these allies involves seeking out individuals who&amp;nbsp;are known to have actively supported marginalized communities. One way to select these allies is by letting marginalized groups participate in anonymous voting. This allows them to choose and elect individuals they trust and believe in as champions of inclusion based on their proven dedication and commitment. For example, at the sheltered workshop, workers with disabilities were given the opportunity to vote for their allies, who subsequently collaborated with management to improve inclusion initiatives. This approach is also seen in academia, where committees are frequently selected through voting to represent the interests of junior or disadvantaged faculty members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Organizations also need to recognize and reward allies who actively contribute to creating an inclusive environment. Managers can implement allyship programs or resource groups that offer tailored training and toolkits for allies, equipping them with the necessary skills to support marginalized peers. This comprehensive guidance should address issues such as identifying invisible bias, uncovering instances of benevolent marginalization, and actively advocating for and amplifying the voices of marginalized peers in their day-to-day interactions and decision-making processes. More generally, organizations can establish confidential feedback channels or suggestion boxes where support staff and colleagues can provide input on potential improvements to policies and practices to avoid paternalistic behaviors. By regularly reviewing and taking action based on this feedback, organizations demonstrate their commitment to “walk the talk” on inclusivity.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Create supportive spaces by handing over responsibilities to disadvantaged individuals.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Overcoming benevolent marginalization requires the creation of both formal and informal supportive or “safe” spaces in the workplace where marginalized groups can freely express themselves and expose behaviors they perceive as paternalistic or patronizing. However, it is not enough to unite marginalized employees in, say, an employee resource group (ERG) and expect them to form an empowering collective without further support. True inclusion demands a recognition of the diverse experiences and unique needs of&amp;nbsp;everyone within these spaces, and these individuals must have the choice to shape these spaces themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations must relinquish control and hand over the reins to disadvantaged individuals to shape their own professional lives. By doing so, organizations can become confidence-building, encouraging, and inspiring environments to challenge the status quo and overcome existing paternalistic norms.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Building effective diversity programs can be a challenging endeavor, especially when hidden barriers hinder progress despite the best intentions. While by no means exhaustive, these three evidence-based strategies offer a solid starting point for advancing true inclusion. Shifting perspectives from help to empowerment, identifying hidden allies, and handing over responsibilities to create supportive spaces are crucial steps toward giving a platform to those who have long felt silenced or not listened to and creating a workplace where everyone feels heard and valued.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 07 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Let the Urgency of Your Customers&rsquo; Needs Guide Your Sales Strategy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/let-the-urgency-of-your-customers-needs-guide-your-sales-strategy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_06_AdriaVolta.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Adrià Voltà&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When companies are creating profiles of possible target customers, there is a dimension they often overlook: the urgency of the need for the offering. This article provides a process for segmenting prospective customers in this fashion and creating a sales strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/let-the-urgency-of-your-customers-needs-guide-your-sales-strategy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/let-the-urgency-of-your-customers-needs-guide-your-sales-strategy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Many business leaders believe that they fully understand their best target customers. They&#39;ve developed clear profiles (aka personas) that are richly detailed with well-researched parameters, such as standard characteristics (eg, age, education level, years at the company, role) or firmographic (eg, annual revenues, number of employees, industry, geography, years in business). While such characteristics are important, they ignore another crucial characteristic: urgency of need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A company that offers a software-as-a-service billing solution for small and mid-sized private dental practices may focus on classic demographics, such as the size of the practice (number of employees or number of dentists), the age of the practice (since older practices may more likely have outdated systems), or the amount of insurance billing the practice does each year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These variables are useful in helping to produce a list of prospects, but they don&#39;t determine which of these dental practices the sales team should call on first. If, however, the company added data that reflects which of these practices&#39; needs is most urgent — say, those that have advertised for billing and claims administration help more than twice in the past year (suggesting that they are struggling to keep up with billing) — salespeople would be able to prioritize their attention on these prospects.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Four Segments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This needs-based approach entails segmenting potential customers into four segments:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Urgent&lt;/strong>;. The customer recognizes that it has an immediate need. &lt;em>;(We just had another billing person quit!)&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Non-urgent.&lt;/strong>; The customer recognizes the need, but it isn&#39;t a high priority at this time. &lt;em>;(We realize that our billing needs are changing and our current system will need to be revamped. We plan to start looking into this in the next year.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Currently met&lt;/strong>;. The customer believes it already has an adequate solution to address the need at this time but recognizes it may not be a long-term solution. &lt;em>;(We have an older billing system in place that still does the trick for now.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;None&lt;/strong>;. The customer simply has no need nor expects such need anytime soon. &lt;em>;(Our small practice has a limited number of patients who pay out of pocket. Since all payments are made at the time of service, we simply don&#39;t need a complex new billing system.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;This focus on the urgency of target customers&#39; needs may sound like common sense, but we have found in our work with B2B companies — from mid-sized firms to Fortune 50 giants in an array of industries such as financial services, enterprise information technology, utilities, industrial solutions, and health care technology — that they often fail to consider this dimension. Here is a process a firm can employ to apply this approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Identify new customers.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To identify prospects outside of your existing customer base, you can use available information. One is a source we mentioned: help-wanted ads that reflect a particular need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there are plenty of others. For instance, if a company sells inventory management solutions, a source of valuable data might be manufacturing industry merger-and-acquisition data, which could reveal companies with an urgent need to change or merge systems such as those for managing inventories. If a company sells quality-management solutions, a source of valuable data could be companies that are getting hammered for poor quality on social media.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Gather the necessary information.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Identifying your customers&#39; true urgency of needs requires looking beyond your typical demographic and firmographic profiling. This starts with an outreach initiative to talk to customers and prospects. The purpose is to ask questions to identify new target customer parameters that may be impacting the customer&#39;s urgency of needs:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Frustrations. &lt;/strong>;How urgent is the need to resolve these frustrations? Which frustration would best accelerate success if resolved?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Goals. &lt;/strong>;Are your goals clear, consistent, reasonable, and measurable? Have your goals shifted recently?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Roadblocks. &lt;/strong>;What keeps you from reaching your goals? (ie, What keeps you up at night?) What is the magnitude of the impact of these roadblocks?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Environmental and situational factors. &lt;/strong>;Are you experiencing any industry consolidation, organizational or executive management changes or instability, competitive changes, regulatory changes, and so on? What is the magnitude of the impact of these factors?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Technology factors. &lt;/strong>;Are there new or changing technologies that will impact your ability to achieve your goals? Are you at risk due to technology end-of-life issues or incompatibility?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Assess your firm&#39;s ability to serve lower-level segments.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Once a company has performed its needs-based segmentation effort, it should seek to answer the following questions about each of the four levels. The findings will dictate the sales and marketing strategy, level of investment and resource allocations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Level 1. Urgent need&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;How quickly can we meet their need? How can we best serve them? Is the market opportunity large enough to focus only on these prospective customers? Given the customer&#39;s urgency, how do we price our products to optimize margins without damaging relationships by appearing exploitive?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Level 2. Non-urgent need&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Can we convince them that their need is more urgent than they currently believe? How do we effectively stay in touch with them so we remain top of mind when they perceive that their need has become urgent?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Level 3. Need currently met&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Should we walk away from these prospects? If so, when and how do we touch base with them to see if their needs have changed? Or is there an opportunity to continue to work to convince them that their need is either more significant than they realize or could be much better addressed? If so, what&#39;s the best approach to get them to reconsider their current situation and recognize their true need and its urgency?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Level 4. No need&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Should we completely remove these contacts as any potential prospect? Is there some other need we may be able to address for them — perhaps with another product? Should we be in contact on a planned basis to see if their situation has changed? How do we best do that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ideal customers are those who clearly understand and recognize they have an urgent need for your offering. However, if that opportunity is not enough to meet the company&#39;s sales volume target, it may be necessary to extend efforts beyond Level 1. Gaining the attention of these additional target customers, challenging their perceptions of their needs, and educating them on how your offering could benefit them will require resources. Consequently, a critical assessment is required to determine whether the opportunity outweighs the investment necessary to address customers in these other levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Test your new targets.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Before committing to a complete revamp of how your salespeople are prioritizing opportunities, select one or two experienced salespeople to help you test your new target customer parameters. Identify a few prospects that align to your revamped target profiles, and see how the selected salespeople are able to penetrate them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Revamp your sales messaging and training.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Include prospective customers&#39; level of need in your sales messaging — the language that the sales team uses in its interactions with customers. Revamp your sales tools (materials such as brochures, technical papers, and customer testimonials used in the selling process) to include the urgency of need. And teach salespeople how to read and react to the prospective customer&#39;s level of need and adapt their language appropriately.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By adding urgency of need to target customers&#39; profiles, companies can do more than differentiate their offerings more effectively. They can also identify new growth opportunities and successfully pivot away from slowing or tightening markets. They can accelerate the sales of new products. Last but not least, they can turn underachieving sales teams into strong performers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 06 Jul 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[To Help Your Team Grow, Give Them Space to Struggle]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/to-help-your-team-grow-give-them-space-to-struggle]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_06_1198521996.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;>;When you see an employee struggling with a task you could do easily, it&amp;#8217;s only natural to want to step in and help.

One potential reframe is: “I was allowed to struggle and that&#39;s where I gained confidence in my skills. So I&#39;m going to give my employee the same gift of time to solve the problem on their own.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Distinguish between high- and low-stakes tasks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Leaders often tell me they remain stuck as doers because employees make too many high-impact mistakes that require intervention. But this usually happens when the bosses themselves hold on to all the work for far too long and are then forced to delegate at the wrong moment. The key is to instead hand off tasks when the stakes are low and missteps tolerated, or even expected..&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;What makes an environment low-stakes? Failure will support learning more than it would hurt reputation. Mistakes will not impact team or company success. The environment is safe for stops and do-overs. The people involved have support and compassion for less experienced colleagues on learning curves.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;To know which tasks are ripe for delegation, consider ones that now feel easy or rote to you but would be good development opportunities for those on your team? Also think about work that drains your energy and doesn&#39;t align with your skills, talents, and strengths but might excite and feel like a perfect fit for others.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For example, if your employee&#39;s goal is to develop better presentation skills, try a low-stakes activity like asking them to lead the next staff meeting before a high-stakes one like conducting a client meeting. Or, if they want to get better at influencing others, challenge them to get buy-in from a small team on using a new tool or work process before asking them to persuade your whole division to implement it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Be curious and facilitative&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Early in my corporate career as a trainer, people told me that I was visibly nervous during sessions I was leading. I explained to my boss that I was worried about not having answers to participants&#39; questions. Her response: “What if your role isn&#39;t to have all the answers but to facilitate the expertise in the room?” This changed my perspective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Like trainers, leaders can&#39;t be expected to have all the answers. But they do need to have patience and curiosity and ask insightful questions to facilitate learning. For example: What has your current approach been? Can you apply past experience to this problem? What is this situation teaching you?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Finally, practice compassion and grace. This doesn&#39;t mean tolerating poor effort or careless mistakes. Instead, it means offering understanding and accommodation in the face of someone not doing something exactly how you would do it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Valerie&#39;s approach that day with our CEO didn&#39;t feel good at the time. But had she intervened, I wouldn&#39;t have learned how to respond to unexpected questions or later reflected on how to better prepare for executive presentations. If she&#39;d followed up with advice, I wouldn&#39;t have discovered my own authentic ways of improving. To this day, I credit her with helping me to develop the ability to present calmly in high-stakes situations. She&#39;s also the reason I have&amp;nbsp;the courage to delegate to colleagues and team members even if it means watching them struggle. That&#39;s the only way that all of us — leaders and employees — grow. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 06 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Train Generative AI Using Your Company&rsquo;s Data]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-to-train-generative-ai-using-your-companys-data]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_06_1488880093.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Anton Vierietin/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Leveraging a company&amp;#8217;s propriety knowledge is critical to its ability to compete and innovate, especially in today&amp;#8217;s volatile environment. Organizational innovation is fueled through effective and agile creation, management, application, recombination, and deployment of knowledge assets and know-how. However, knowledge within organizations is typically generated and captured across various sources and forms, including individual minds, processes, policies, reports, operational transactions, discussion boards, and online chats and meetings. As such, a company&amp;#8217;s comprehensive knowledge is often unaccounted for and difficult to organize and deploy where needed in an effective or efficient way.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-train-generative-ai-using-your-companys-data?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-train-generative-ai-using-your-companys-data?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Many companies are experimenting with ChatGPT and other large language or image models. They have generally found them to be astounding in terms of their ability to express complex ideas in articulate language. However, most users realize that these systems are primarily trained on internet-based information and can&#39;t respond to prompts or questions regarding proprietary content or knowledge.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leveraging a company&#39;s propriety knowledge is critical to its ability to compete and innovate, especially in today&#39;s volatile environment. Organizational Innovation is fueled through effective and agile creation, management, application, recombination, and deployment of knowledge assets and know-how. However, knowledge within organizations is typically generated and captured across various sources and forms, including individual minds, processes, policies, reports, operational transactions, discussion boards, and online chats and meetings. As such, a company&#39;s comprehensive knowledge is often unaccounted for and difficult to organize and deploy where needed in an effective or efficient way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emerging technologies in the form of large language and image generative AI models offer new opportunities for knowledge management, thereby enhancing company performance, learning, and innovation capabilities. For example, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; conducted in a Fortune 500 provider of business process software, a generative AI-based system for customer support led to increased productivity of customer support agents and improved retention, while leading to higher positive feedback on the part of customers. The system also expedited the learning and skill development of novice agents.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like that company, a growing number of organizations are attempting to leverage the language processing skills and general reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to capture and provide broad internal (or customer) access to their own intellectual capital. They are using it for such purposes as informing their customer-facing employees on company policy and product/service recommendations, solving customer service problems, or capturing employees&#39; knowledge before they depart the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These objectives were also present during the heyday of the “knowledge management” movement in the 1990s and early 2000s, but most companies found the technology of the time inadequate for the task. Today, however, generative AI is rekindling the possibility of capturing and disseminating important knowledge throughout an organization and beyond its walls. As one manager using generative AI for this purpose put it, “I feel like a jetpack just came into my life.” Despite current advances, some of the same factors that made knowledge management difficult in the past are still present.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Technology for Generative AI-Based Knowledge Management&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The technology to incorporate an organization&#39;s specific domain knowledge into an LLM is evolving rapidly. At the moment there are three primary approaches to incorporating proprietary content into a generative model.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Training an LLM from Scratch&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One approach is to create and train one&#39;s own domain-specific model from scratch. That&#39;s not a common approach, since it requires a massive amount of high-quality data to train a large language model, and most companies simply don&#39;t have it. It also requires access to considerable computing power and well-trained data science talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One company that has employed this approach is Bloomberg, which recently announced that it had created BloombergGPT for finance-specific content and a natural-language interface with its data terminal. Bloomberg has over 40 years&#39; worth of financial data, news, and documents, which it combined with a large volume of text from financial filings and internet data. In total, Bloomberg&#39;s data scientists employed 700 tokens, or about 350 billion words, 50 billion parameters, and 1.3 million hours of graphics processing unit time. Few companies have those resources available.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Fine-Tuning an Existing LLM&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A second approach is to “fine-tune” train an existing LLM to add specific domain content to a system that is already trained on general knowledge and language-based interaction. This approach involves adjusting some parameters of a base model, and typically requires substantially less data — usually only hundreds or thousands of documents, rather than millions or billions — and less computing time than creating a new model from scratch.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Google, for example, used fine-tune training on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/sharing-google-med-palm-2-medical-large-language-model&quot;>;Med-PaLM2&lt;/a>; (second version) model for medical knowledge. The research project started with Google&#39;s general PaLM2 LLM and retrained it on carefully curated medical knowledge from a variety of public medical datasets. The model was able to answer 85% of US medical licensing exam questions — almost 20% better than the first version of the system. Despite this rapid progress, when tested on such criteria as scientific factuality, precision, medical consensus, reasoning, bias and harm, and evaluated by human experts from multiple countries, the development team felt that the system still needed substantial improvement before being adopted for clinical practice.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fine-tuning approach has some constraints, however. Although requiring much less computing power and time than training an LLM, it can still be expensive to train, which was not a problem for Google but would be for many other companies. It requires considerable data science expertise; the &lt;a href=&quot;chrome-extension://bdfcnmeidppjeaggnmidamkiddifkdib/viewer.html?file=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09617.pdf&quot;>;scientific paper&lt;/a>; for the Google project, for example, had 31 co-authors. Some data scientists argue that it is best suited not to adding new content, but rather to adding new content formats and styles (such as chat or writing like William Shakespeare). Additionally, some LLM vendors (for example, OpenAI) do not allow fine-tuning on their latest LLMs, such as GPT-4.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Prompt-tuning an Existing LLM&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most common approach to customizing the content of an LLM for non-cloud vendor companies is to tune it through prompts. With this approach, the original model is kept frozen, and is modified through prompts in the context window that contain domain-specific knowledge. After prompt tuning, the model can answer questions related to that knowledge. This approach is the most computationally efficient of the three, and it does not require a vast amount of data to be trained on a new content domain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Morgan Stanley, for example, used prompt tuning to train OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 model using a carefully curated set of 100,000 documents with important investing, general business, and investment process knowledge. The goal was to provide the company&#39;s financial advisors with accurate and easily accessible knowledge on key issues they encounter in their roles advising clients. The prompt-trained system is operated in a private cloud that is only accessible to Morgan Stanley employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While this is perhaps the easiest of the three approaches for an organization to adopt, it is not without technical challenges. When using unstructured data like text as input to an LLM, the data is likely to be too large with too many important attributes to enter it directly in the context window for the LLM. The alternative is to create vector embeddings — arrays of numeric values produced from the text by another pre-trained machine learning model (Morgan Stanley uses one from OpenAI called Ada). The vector embeddings are a more compact representation of this data which preserves contextual relationships in the text. When a user enters a prompt into the system, a similarity algorithm determines which vectors should be submitted to the GPT-4 model. Although several vendors are offering tools to make this process of prompt tuning easier, it is still complex enough that most companies adopting the approach would need to have substantial data science talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this approach does not need to be very time-consuming or expensive if the needed content is already present. The investment research company Morningstar, for example, used prompt tuning and vector embeddings for its Mo research tool built on generative AI. It incorporates more than 10,000 pieces of Morningstar research. After only a month or so of work on its system, Morningstar opened Mo usage to their financial advisors and independent investor customers. It even attached Mo to a digital avatar that could speak out its answers. This technical approach is not expensive; in its first month in use, Mo answered 25,000 questions at an average cost of $.002 per question for a total cost of $3,000.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Content Curation and Governance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As with traditional knowledge management in which documents were loaded into discussion databases like Microsoft Sharepoint, with generative AI, content needs to be high-quality before customizing LLMs in any fashion. In some cases, as with the Google Med-PaLM2 system, there are widely available databases of medical knowledge that have already been curated. Otherwise, a company needs to rely on human curation to ensure that knowledge content is accurate, timely, and not duplicated. Morgan Stanley, for example, has a group of 20 or so knowledge managers in the Philippines who are constantly scoring documents along multiple criteria; these determine the suitability for incorporation into the GPT-4 system. Most companies that do not have well-curated content will find it challenging to do so for just this purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Morgan Stanley has also found that it is much easier to maintain high quality knowledge if content authors are aware of how to create effective documents. They are required to take two courses, one on the document management tool, and a second on how to write and tag these documents. This is a component of the company&#39;s approach to content governance approach — a systematic method for capturing and managing important digital content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At Morningstar, content creators are being taught what type of content works well with the Mo system and what does not. They submit their content into a content management system and it goes directly into the vector database that supplies the OpenAI model.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Quality Assurance and Evaluation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;An important aspect of managing generative AI content is ensuring quality. Generative AI is widely known to “hallucinate” on occasion, confidently stating facts that are incorrect or nonexistent. Errors of this type can be problematic for businesses but could be deadly in healthcare applications. The good news is that companies who have tuned their LLMs on domain-specific information have found that hallucinations are less of a problem than out-of-the-box LLMs, at least if there are no extended dialogues or non-business prompts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies adopting these approaches to generative AI knowledge management should develop an evaluation strategy. For example, for BloombergGPT, which is intended for answering financial and investing questions, the system was evaluated on public dataset financial tasks, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis ability, and a set of reasoning and general natural language processing tasks. The Google Med-PaLM2 system, eventually oriented to answering patient and physician medical questions, had a much more extensive evaluation strategy, reflecting the criticality of accuracy and safety in the medical domain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life or death isn&#39;t an issue at Morgan Stanley, but producing highly accurate responses to financial and investing questions is important to the firm, its clients, and its regulators. The answers provided by the system were carefully evaluated by human reviewers before it was released to any users. Then it was piloted for several months by 300 financial advisors. As its primary approach to ongoing evaluation, Morgan Stanley has a set of 400 “golden questions” to which the correct answers are known. Every time any change is made to the system, employees test it with the golden questions to see if there has been any “regression,” or less accurate answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Legal and Governance Issues &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Legal and governance issues associated with LLM deployments are complex and evolving, leading to risk factors involving intellectual property, data privacy and security, bias and ethics, and false/inaccurate output. Currently, the legal status of LLM outputs is still unclear. Since LLMs don&#39;t produce exact replicas of any of the text used to train the model, many legal observers feel that “fair use” provisions of copyright law will apply to them, although this hasn&#39;t been tested in the courts (and not all countries have such provisions in their copyright laws). In any case, it is a good idea for any company making extensive use of generative AI for managing knowledge (or most other purposes for that matter) to have legal representatives involved in the creation and governance process for tuned LLMs. At Morningstar, for example, the company&#39;s attorneys helped create a series of “pre-prompts” that tell the generative AI system what types of questions it should answer and those it should politely avoid.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;User prompts into publicly-available LLMs are used to train future versions of the system, so some companies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-ai-like-chatgpt-for-staff-after-misuse-of-chatbot.html&quot;>;Samsung&lt;/a>;, for example) have feared propagation of confidential and private information and banned LLM use by employees. However, most companies&#39; efforts to tune LLMs with domain-specific content are performed on private instances of the models that are not accessible to public users, so this should not be a problem. In addition, some generative AI systems such as ChatGPT allow users to turn off the collection of chat histories, which can address confidentiality issues even on public systems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to address confidentiality and privacy concerns, some vendors are providing advanced and improved safety and security features for LLMs including erasing user prompts, restricting certain topics, and preventing source code and propriety data inputs into publicly accessible LLMs. Furthermore, vendors of enterprise software systems are incorporating a “Trust Layer” in their products and services. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-aims-to-plug-ai-trust-gap-with-new-tech-tools-19e11750?mod=djemCIO&quot;>;Salesforce&lt;/a>;, for example, incorporated its Einstein GPT feature into its AI Cloud suite to address the “AI Trust Gap” between companies who desire to quickly deploy LLM capabilities and the aforementioned risks that these systems pose in business environments.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Shaping User Behavior &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Ease of use, broad public availability, and useful answers that span various knowledge domains have led to rapid and somewhat unguided and organic adoption of generative AI-based knowledge management by employees. For example, a recent survey indicated that more than a third of surveyed employees used generative AI in their jobs, but 68% of respondents didn&#39;t inform their supervisors that they were using the tool. To realize opportunities and manage potential risks of generative AI applications to knowledge management, companies need to develop a culture of transparency and accountability that would make generative AI-based knowledge management systems successful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to implementation of policies and guidelines, users need to understand how to safely and effectively incorporate generative AI capabilities into their tasks to enhance performance and productivity. Generative AI capabilities, including awareness of context and history, generating new content by aggregating or combining knowledge from various sources, and data-driven predictions, can provide powerful support for knowledge work. Generative AI-based knowledge management systems can automate information-intensive search processes (legal case research, for example) as well as high-volume and low-complexity cognitive tasks such as answering routine customer emails. This approach increases efficiency of employees, freeing them to put more effort into the complex decision-making and problem-solving aspects of their jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some specific behaviors that might be desirable to inculcate — either though training or policies — include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Knowledge of what types of content are available through the system;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How to create effective prompts;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What types of prompts and dialogues are allowed, and which ones are not;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How to request additional knowledge content to be added to the system;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How to use the system&#39;s responses in dealing with customers and partners;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How to create new content in a useful and effective manner.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Both Morgan Stanley and Morningstar trained content creators in particular on how best to create and tag content, and what types of content are well-suited to generative AI usage.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;“Everything Is Moving Very Fast”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;One of the executives we interviewed said, “I can tell you what things are like today. But everything is moving very fast in this area.” New LLMs and new approaches to tuning their content are announced daily, as are new products from vendors with specific content or task foci. Any company that commits to embedding its own knowledge into a generative AI system should be prepared to revise its approach to the issue frequently over the next several years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While there are many challenging issues involved in building and using generative AI systems trained on a company&#39;s own knowledge content, we&#39;re confident that the overall benefit to the company is worth the effort to address these challenges. The long-term vision of enabling any employee — and customers as well — to easily access important knowledge within and outside of a company to enhance productivity and innovation is a powerful draw. Generative AI appears to be the technology that is finally making it possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.安装便携式空气净化器（净化器）。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722029813&quot;>;便携式低噪音空气净化器&lt;/a>; 例如 HEPA 净化器和自制 (DIY) 空气净化器&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patentknowhow.com/safe.html&quot;>;组装&lt;/a>;由箱式风扇、过滤器、和其他现成的材料是通过回收每个房间的空气来实现 CDC 目标的一种经济有效的方法。基于我们的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/san-francisco-unified-seeks-nearly-3-million-to-buy-air-purifiers-for- every-classroom/2639904/&quot;>;在旧金山学校的经验&lt;/a>;，三个DIY净化器可以&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.05.22281734v1&quot;>;超过&lt;/a>; a>; 对于典型的 900 平方英尺&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtmnUc8cBE&quot;，CDC 的目标是低至 250 至 400 美元（约每平方英尺 0.25 至 0.50 美元） >;教室&lt;/a>;天花板高 10 英尺，每月电费不到 10 美元。由于 HEPA 可以在商店购买并&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN3kYm7bXJs&quot;>;快速&lt;/a>;自行构建，因此它们可以在短时间内作为有效的清洁空气解决方案实施天 — 结果已由 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132322011507&quot;>;CDC&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.13163&quot;>;美国环境保护署&lt;/a>;。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectn95.org/free-air-purifiers/&quot;>;免费&lt;/a>;向为弱势群体服务的组织提供 DIY 空气净化器。最近，市场上出现了使用&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cleanairkits.com/&quot;>;个人电脑冷却风扇&lt;/a>;的更加节能的DIY型号。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总的来说，所需净化器的数量及其总成本与房间体积和空气交换目标成比例增加。许多净化器都具有可变速度。它们需要设置为以达到 CDC 目标 5 个 ACH 所需的速度运行；否则，其效果将会降低，并且可能达不到预期目标。安装并运行后，可以使用手持式&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278555v10&quot;>;粒子计数器&lt;/a>;检查空气交换率，以测量空气交换率的变化房间内存在空气颗粒。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.在拥挤的情况下超过 12 ACH 的新 CDC 目标。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为了限制细菌生长，鱼缸通常使用过滤系统每小时至少清洁水四次（每 15 分钟），类似到四个空气 ACH 来获取房间内的空气。直到最近，对于有效减少建筑物内病毒传播所需的空气净化程度还缺乏明确的认识。所以2022年我们在《美国医学会杂志》上&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2799161&quot;>;写信给CDC&lt;/a>;，要求它说清楚需要多少 ACH 才能阻止 Covid。 CDC 研究人员&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2799159&quot;>;回复&lt;/a>;表示，虽然他们不知道有 5 到 6 个 ACH 的空间中爆发了 Covid-19，但 12 个 ACH在某些情况下，可能需要或更多（例如飞行中的飞机或医院的空中隔离室）。随着空间内人数的增加，传播的可能性也会增加，这可能需要更多的 ACH 和距离来降低风险。例如，加州公共卫生部&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/EHLB/IAQ/CDPH%20Document%20Library/School_ventilation_and_filtration_ADA.pdf&quot;>;建议&lt;/ a>; 学校中至少有 6 个 ACH，最好是 12 个 ACH。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.在工作时间内运行空气净化器，以降低成本并定期更换过滤器。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;过滤器和风扇可以按照制造商建议的定期时间表进行更换，或者，如果组织想要保守的话，经过&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722029813&quot;>;测试&lt;/a>;后显示他们的表现已降至可接受的水平以下。测试可以揭示过滤器或风扇的使用寿命何时比预期更长，或者其性能下降是否比预期更快（例如，过滤器被颗粒堵塞或在强烈的野火烟雾事件后失去了过滤颗粒的能力）。在某些地方，例如医院，它们可能需要 24×7 运行，但对于许多企业来说，如果仅在有人在场的典型营业时间（例如上午 9 点至下午 5 点）开启，它们可以持续长达时间延长四倍，功耗减少四倍。它们可以由房间里的人手动打开和关闭，也可以通过低成本的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009KSECO8&quot;>;运动传感器&lt;/a>;（可以设置） 20 分钟不活动后自动关闭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企业可以实施这三个步骤，以经济有效地支持新的 CDC 标准和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/ Wellness/air-purifier-smoke-covid-best/2021/08/29/28ea4176-0740-11ec-a266-7c7fe02fa374_story.html&quot;>;保护&lt;/a>;人们免受新冠病毒感染，&lt;a href=&quot;https://aaqr .org/articles/aaqr-21-03-tn-0046&quot;>;野火烟雾&lt;/a>;、过敏原和任何其他可能出现的空气传播危险。这些清洁空气的简单步骤最终将使每个人受益，并为高危人群创造一个更具包容性的环境，包括免疫功能低下的人、孕妇、老年人、儿童以及患有慢性心肺疾病的人。&lt;/ p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;无声的报复形式非常常见，并且在工作场所可能会传染。接受这种形式的报复作为标准做法的组织很难雇用和留住优秀人才。报复&amp;#8212;各种形式的不仅会伤害当前的团队成员，而且容忍报复的文化也会损害使命和组织向客户和利益相关者提供服务的能力。为了创造一种心理安全成为常态、创新蓬勃发展、团队效率高的文化，解决暗中发生的报复问题至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/does-your-company-have-a-culture-of-quiet-retaliation?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/does-your-company-have-a-culture-of-quiet-retaliation?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;我们大多数人都熟悉教科书或人力资源政策中对报复的定义。公开、大声的报复时刻确实会发生，比如有人在大声疾呼或正式表达担忧后被解雇。然而，在我们与团队的合作中，我们经常目睹更微妙的报复形式，这些报复经常发生，但通常被忽视或忽视。微妙的、通常是无声的报复会毁掉职业生涯，侵蚀目标个人的价值感，并损害团队的效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们尚未遇到任何自称具有报复性的领导者，但我们经常看到报复的发生在团队上。当领导者只通过公开和大胆的行动来看待报复时，他们就会忽视其更微妙的表现，而其后果同样严重。如果领导者无法识别自己和他人的这些行为，他们就有可能对个人、团队和他们所服务的组织造成短期和长期伤害。为了创造一种心理安全为常态、创新蓬勃发展、团队效率高的文化，我们必须了解暗中发生的报复行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;报复的现实&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在在美国，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-releases-fiscal-year-2020-enforcement-and-litigation-data&quot;>;55.8% 的索赔中提到了员工报复&lt; /a>; 于 20 财年向美国平等就业机会委员会 (EEOC) 提交了申请 - 这正是所报道的内容。举报报复行为可能会给个人的财务稳定性、未来职业发展和声誉带来重大风险。举报所需的时间和精力对许多人来说是一种威慑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些最常见的报复行为涉及经理&lt;em>;不&lt;/em>;采取的行动。这种悄悄的——有时是隐蔽的——报复行为极其有害，因为它可能会持续多年而不被发现、不被提及或不被报道。它不仅会影响目标个人，还会降低目睹这一事件的团队成员的信任水平、创造力和生产力，并使虐待文化永久化。维拉诺瓦教授 Manuela Priesemuth 在她的文章“&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/06/times-up-for-有毒-workplaces&quot;>;有毒工作场所的时代到了&lt;/a>;”中分享了虐待和报复文化如何“蔓延到整个组织，形成了整个虐待氛围。因为员工向经理寻求并向经理学习，他们逐渐明白这种人际虐待在公司是可以接受的行为。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下是我们在工作辅导中观察到的五个隐蔽报复的具体例子领导者及其服务的团队：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;拒绝提供指导、反馈或专业发展机会&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;拒绝为项目或部门提供资源&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;故意给予在几乎没有支持的情况下完成具有挑战性的任务，或者给出注定会失败的具有挑战性的任务&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;阻止其他人倾听或重视团队成员的声音、专业知识或贡献&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;将团队成员排除在必要的之外马克*以报复性着称，在退休前曾担任一家大型零售公司的首席执行官十多年。当我们与新任首席执行官领导下的剩余领导团队合作时，我们很快发现，仅靠马克的离职不足以平息员工的恐惧。尽管马克已经不在了，但公司里仍然存在着明显的恐惧感。我们从几位领导那里听说，与马克的任何分歧都意味着你在公司内成长的终结。 “当他对某个敢于发声的人感到失望时，他会露出一种表情，”我们从几位领导人那里听到了这样的说法。 “他会在你的名字上画一条线，而不是在名字下面。每个人都知道，比赛基本上就结束了。你被困住了。”对于马克来说，报复采取了社会破坏和排斥的隐蔽形式。这对组织的影响是巨大的：创新停滞、文化受损、业务停滞。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Julia 是一家中型科技公司的首席财务官。当她收到部门内部有关敌对工作环境投诉的通知时，她表示自己已经意识到这些问题，因为这些问题已经发生多年，但一直避免解决。朱莉娅一直直言不希望她的团队成员与人力资源部讨论任何问题。 “为什么人们不能低下头完成工作呢？为什么我的工作就是处理他们幼稚的行为？”她问她的同龄人。朱莉娅随后剥夺了投诉团队成员获取执行工作所必需的信息和文件的权限。朱莉娅还不再及时回复她的电子邮件，并希望缺乏通信会导致项目按时完成的延误，进一步让团队成员在同事面前丢脸。当被问及这些行为时，朱莉娅回答说：“这不可能是报复，因为我没有解雇他们。”我们经常看到领导者进行悄悄的报复行为，从而产生巨大的影响，但他们并不认为这是报复，因为他们将报复狭隘地定义为解雇员工。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗恩曾在一家医院担任护士长。医院急诊科连续15年获青睐，年内大幅晋升。虽然医院内的正式领导赞赏罗恩严格、传统的管理风格，但其他急诊室工作人员的经历却截然不同。 “如果你做了一些让他烦恼的事情——也许表达了担忧或指出某些供应不足——你可以预期你将来所说或所做的一切都会受到审查。他无法接受任何反馈，即使是关于口罩或手套库存等简单的事情，”我们从一位值班领导那里听到。在这种特殊情况下，持续的负面审查对文化和僵局造成的负面影响不仅影响了部门，还危及公共安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;领导者应如何自我评估其影响&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;领导者经常将自己视为部门或组织中正确行为的看门人。在我们刚才描述的每种情况下，领导者都相信这就是他们正在做的事情。危险并不在于看不到你的意图和影响之间的脱节。领导人报复的连锁反应是巨大的。当领导者缺乏加深对其行为及其影响的自我认识所需的工具时，对所有利益相关者来说后果可能是可怕的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们倾向于根据我们的良好意图来判断自己，并根据他们的影响来判断他人。我们的领导指导原则之一是：你无法决定你的影响力；你可以决定你的影响力。其他人也这么做。那么，您如何才能更好地评估您的行为的影响并了解您行为的根本原因呢？从这三个实践开始：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;进行勇敢的审核。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;检查自己的行为并深入挖掘行为背后的动机。我们强烈建议基于&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/hgse100/story/changing-better&quot;>;免疫变化&lt;/a>;的工作进行“勇敢的审计”实践罗伯特·基根和丽莎·莱希。变革免疫模型在这种情况下特别有效，因为它挑战我们思考我们的行为（或缺乏行为）如何妨碍创建心理安全的工作环境。想想团队成员中最让你沮丧的情况，并寻找你的行为方式是否没有效率或可能具有报复性。挑战自己，好奇地提问并勇敢地回答：我在做什么或不做什么会妨碍安全文化？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;意识到适得其反的行为是改变它们的第一步。我们经常听到领导者说，以这种方式反思自己在同事面前显得太脆弱，因此与经验丰富的教练合作是增强您在工作场所中的思想和行为的自我意识的有效方法。&lt;/p>; &lt; h3>;识别你的影子意图。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;影子意图是指我们（有意识或无意识）出于自我和自我保护的立场而行动。拒绝你自己声称的“提供帮助”或“保护你的部门”的愿望。您的想法或行为以何种方式意图通过隐蔽或被动的方式伤害团队成员？你什么时候被自我保护驱使而不受控制？您什么时候可能会允许您的第一次压力驱动反应对您对他人产生的影响产生负面影响？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;伊丽莎白是一家不断发展的 IT 公司的一员，而且从各方面来看，她都是领导团队的重要成员。当发生合并时，“必须为即将上任的领导者腾出空间”，她也多次被忽略晋升。虽然她希望继续证明自己的价值并领导好团队，但她需要支持来积极摆脱自己希望新领导者失败的阴影意图，这样她就可以因其卓越和持续的承诺而得到奖励。通过努力放松她的影子意图对她的控制，她能够将更多的注意力带回自己的部门并更好地支持创新。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;探索你的内群体/外群体。&lt; /h3>; &lt;p>;评估您对周围人的想法和假设。谁能对你诚实，甚至不同意你的观点？你看重谁的意见？为什么？你和谁一起奋斗？你的团队内成员与团队外成员之间存在哪些共同点？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确定自己​​的模式是打造一个每个人都参与并充分贡献的团队的关键第一步。丹是一家中型公司的首席执行官，他希望以不同的方式思考因退休而发生的几次领导层变动。他希望引进新的高管，并与其余成员建立一支有凝聚力的团队。在对自己的内部和外部团队进行审计时，他发现执行团队的两名领导者在他的外部团队中。两者都是在大流行期间开始的，丹没有与他们进行一对一的交流，他通常会投资于团队中的新高管。 Dan 决定开始更有意识地与他们建立联系，每月安排一次单独的午餐，每周与他们每人进行一次 15 分钟的一对一谈话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有很多策略可以帮助领导者与他们的外群体建立联系，但要记住的最重要的一点是，最有权力的人必须发起联系。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;无声的报复形式非常常见，并且在工作场所可能会传染。我们所服务的那些接受这种形式的报复作为标准做法的组织很难雇用和留住优秀人才。各种形式的报复不仅会伤害当前的团队成员，而且容忍报复的文化也会损害使命和组织向客户和利益相关者提供服务的能力。组织是由他们庆祝什么和他们容忍什么来定义的。参与或容忍报复行为的领导者可能会给个人和组织造成持久的伤痕。 The humans we serve deserve better.&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;Many first-generation Americans face a cultural seesaw effect when trying to be successful in Western workplaces. For example, members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community can find it challenging to self-promote, as it goes against their values. They&amp;#8217;re taught from a very young age to be humble, to stay under the radar, and to never correct authority figures, as a sign of respect. They hope their hard work will simply speak for itself. But self-promotion and voicing opinions have become key elements needed to thrive in Western workplaces, which clearly advantages some and disadvantages others. Further, first-generation Americans and other marginalized communities endure numerous generational, societal, and workplace traumas that create mental health disparities, which can result in an apprehension to advocate for themselves in work environments. While leaders cannot control how their employees will cope with societal and generational trauma, it is their responsibility to foster environments where all employees can feel secure in raising their hands for support. In order for this to successfully occur, organizations should closely look at whether current employee behaviors are in fact promoting inclusivity, or if processes and norms need to be modified to provide an equitable landscape for all workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/removing-the-roadblocks-that-first-generation-americans-face-at-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/removing-the-roadblocks-that-first-generation-americans-face-at-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When my family immigrated from India to the US nearly four decades ago, they had no indication of what a new world would bring. They were filled with hope that this relocation would provide a surplus of opportunities unavailable before. With that hope came a justified reservation about acceptance in a new community, so they applied a strategy many immigrant families deploy: assimilate and prosper.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The goal was not to suppress our identities. In contrast, it was to engage in a new environment with foreigners in a non-burdensome way. Rather than demanding a promotion at their jobs, my parents patiently waited until their hard work was finally rewarded — years after their American peers. Instead of asking for support in their daily duties, they silently took on additional responsibilities to prove their worth. Both of my parents wore their sense of altruism, undying commitment, and unwavering devotion as a badge of honor — blissfully passing these values onto me in hopes that I would replicate their work ethic in my career.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I entered the workforce with my parents&#39; worth ethic, fearless spirit, and integrity to carry me through my future endeavors. Unfortunately, history repeated itself in an unexpected way. I was exploited for my hard work. My boundaries were constantly being violated by senior leadership. I was petrified when it came to seeking support from my team because I was convinced that this would be a sign of weakness and would tarnish my professional image, ultimately hindering growth opportunities. It created a version of me that I despised: insecure, hesitant, and incredibly docile.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Working as a First-Generation American &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;My formative years were spent thinking my family environment was unique, but this was far from the truth. Many first-generation Americans face similar challenges as they navigate the societal expectations of two cultures at a very young age, resulting in a unique phenomenon called the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdep.12071&quot;>;immigrant paradox&lt;/a>;“.&amp;nbsp;First-generation Americans experience diminishing developmental outcomes, educational achievements, and even mental health challenges because of the racial and ethnic disparities in the US — challenges our parents or even recent immigrants do not face since they immigrate normally post-adolescence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To exacerbate this experience, first-generation Americans also face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/mental-health-children-of-immigrants-wellness/index.html&quot;>;immigrant guilt&lt;/a>; as they try to desperately hold onto the traditions they inherited while harmonizing within a culture their families could not provide any guidance about. Adapting to the Western culture while feeling “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-othering-5084425&quot;>;othered&lt;/a>;” can lead to the inability to forge an identity that neatly falls within both cultures, traditions, and experiences. While our families may have had the best intentions in providing us with their wisdom and perceived values of success, it did not translate well into a workplace construct that was built for people who never shared our identities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the cultural seesaw effect that many first-generation Americans face when trying to be successful in the workplace. The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community (and many cultures alike) find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-we-need-to-talk-about-asian-american-mental-health?cid=other-eml-dre-mip-mck&amp;amp;hlkid=a774e1a8976d4a078406df70a8406fd5&amp;amp;hctky=12012649&amp;amp;hdpid=9ae1a3af-4f90-48c7-84bd-0389613c0228&quot;>;challenging to self-promote&lt;/a>;, as it goes against our values. We&#39;re taught to be humble and stay under the radar. We have been taught from a very young age to never correct authority figures, as a sign of respect. Similar to how my parents navigated their careers, many AAPI community members hope their hard work will simply speak for itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So why is this important for workplaces and leaders to consider as they seek to create equitable and inclusive work environments? &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/savvy-self-promotion&quot;>;Self-promotion&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2012/03/19/6-reasons-employees-must-speak-up-to-thrive-at-work/&quot;>;voicing your opinion&lt;/a>; have become key elements needed to thrive in Western workplaces, but this clearly advantages some and disadvantages others. Further, first-generation Americans and other marginalized communities endure numerous generational, societal, and workplace traumas that create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/cultural-competency/education/mental-health-facts#:~:text=Racial%2Fethnic%2C%20gender%2C%20and,of%20awareness%20about%20mental%20health&quot;>;mental health disparities&lt;/a>;, which can result in an apprehension to advocate for themselves in work environments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if employers take an approach that commits to prioritizing inclusivity across all identities and backgrounds, then we can make progress in our distorted definition of success.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How Leaders Can Change the Narrative and Help Fix a Flawed System&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Leaders cannot control how their employees will cope with societal and generational trauma. Yet, it is their responsibility to foster environments where all employees can feel secure in raising their hands for support. In order for this to successfully occur, organizations should closely look at whether current employee behaviors are in fact promoting inclusivity, or if processes and norms need to be modified to provide an equitable landscape for all workers. In my experience in working with global organizations, taking this critical pause before churning out solutions has proven to be a pivotal factor in revamping inclusion.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Assess Your Inclusion Efforts &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In order to understand what practices are supportive of inclusion and which are not, a thorough assessment is required. In previous leadership roles, I have successfully conducted this assessment that ultimately evaluates inclusion across organizational and management practices through three specific dimensions: Co-creating success as a team, fostering communities with purpose, and evaluating the effectiveness of feedback mechanisms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These three dimensions serve as a comprehensive approach to further understanding the organization&#39;s context, culture, and intent in creating substantive inclusion. It also serves as a foundation for leaders to deep dive into prevailing processes to determine if the current company climate integrates the differences first-generation employees bring to the table, and allows them to be part of the decision-making process to achieve strategic objectives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once each dimension is thoroughly examined, taking action and prioritizing specific areas that need immediate attention is key. It will foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement from an organizational level, while simultaneously creating new practices where first-generation employees have the security to thrive.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Co-Create Success as a Team&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;We start with this dimension because our traditional workplace practices define success by emphasizing specific individual behaviors, instead of creating practices that benefit the entire employee population. This &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/how-to-infuse-liberatory-practices-into-work-practices&quot;>;divide and conquer&lt;/a>; approach specifically prevents first-generation employees from determining what success looks like for them, furthering the narrative that their unique insights are less important than the dominant group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As leaders, you can rectify these practices by first evaluating the level of collaboration and inclusion you provide for your own team. Commence reparative practices and invite all team members to define what success looks like for them. By doing so, you are providing first-generation employees the permission to relinquish their previous notions of the perfect employee, and create a culture of solidarity where they will be more likely to voice their opinions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, forging rules of engagement, understanding preferred communication styles with others, and finalizing what support leadership should provide at the start of a project maintains boundaries for each first-generation employee. Eventually, if you keep inviting opinions to the table — and revisit conversations about success definitions on an agreed-upon timeline — the stigma associated with raising concerns will slowly diminish. Further, maintaining these work relationships and reciprocally committing to meet each other&#39;s needs will allow for an equitable decision-making process and boost morale among all team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Foster Communities With Purpose&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Arguably, this may be the most important component of the inclusion assessment, because it offers up a safe haven for first-generation employees to discuss how they navigate unique workplace stressors that only apply to them. Employee resource groups (ERGs), for example, have been incredibly popular for organizations trying to increase their inclusion efforts. However, they often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/effective-employee-resource-groups-are-key-to-inclusion-at-work-heres-how-to-get-them-right&quot;>;fall short&lt;/a>; because they lack accountability or a specific mission. In my experience, I have seen ERGs solely being leveraged as an after-work social gathering — which is important, but does not cultivate corrective practices in the workplace that first-generation employees deserve. In order to make these communities more effective, I recommend finding a business sponsor who is already practicing &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/why-inclusive-leaders-are-good-for-organizations-and-how-to-become-one&quot;>;inclusive leadership&lt;/a>; to lead the ERG with empathy and strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a previous role, I acted as the business sponsor and supported the launch of a similar ERG with a six-month action plan. The first two months were to simply connect as a community — to decompress and speak about how our community is marginalized in particular ways. The third and fourth months were used to transition into strategy. We examined questions such as: &lt;em>;How can we empower ourselves to ask for support? What specific actions do we need leadership to take for us to continuously feel empowered in order to bring value back to the organization? &lt;/em>;These conversations were often difficult, and sometimes quite emotionally draining because it required many of us to revisit how our immigrant guilt manifests itself in the workplace. This is why the business sponsor of any ERG should be well-equipped and skilled to facilitate these conversations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lastly, the fifth and sixth months were dedicated to building a case to senior leadership in the specific work practices that needed to be amended in order for us to feel valued, included, and guarded in the workplace. A specific proposal was then developed with a coherent communication plan derived from the roundtable discussions we had in previous months. As we co-created this plan, each member of the ERG was invited to provide feedback and voted for the top concerns we wanted to address.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this collective support of the ERG community, we were able to establish new norms across client projects to address capacity constraints, enhance cross-collaboration with teams, and determine accountability measures across all levels. For many of the ERG members, this success came with a unique sense of ownership of their careers that had seemed foreign before. People in the community had been accustomed to remaining silent, trailing back to the generational trauma many of us carried as we navigated through various challenges into the workforce. However, this success was a glimmer of hope that self-promotion could actually lead to tangible results, fundamentally changing the way the business operates.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Evaluate the Effectiveness of Feedback Mechanisms &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While employee feedback through engagement surveys has become popular over the years as a definitive measure for enhancing inclusion, many first-generation employees will hesitate to offer their insights. Due to our complex identities, feeling othered, and lack of role models that share our identity, we feel compelled to assess the work environment first to determine if speaking up will be celebrated or punished — regardless of whether the feedback is imperative to change working conditions. To counteract this, leaders should actively analyze what type of culture they are promoting in order to retrieve an accurate glimpse of the work environment. Without this core component in psychological safety, employee engagement surveys will remain a false illusion of the organization&#39;s actual reality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if your goal is to decrease employee burnout by seeking suggestions through engagement surveys, evaluate the type of behavior you are celebrating prior to seeking feedback. If you are amplifying an employee working at all hours, allowing others to accept every client demand, or creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90662451/its-very-time-sensitive-why-a-fast-paced-work-environment-hurts-all-employees&quot;>;a false sense of urgency&lt;/a>;, you are not fostering an inclusive environment for others to raise their hand for support. In fact, you are telling your employees that this is the golden rule for everyone to follow. First-generation employees will not feel safe to provide feedback in addressing these negative workplace stressors because the organization inadvertently supports this type of burnout behavior. Regardless of how well-intentioned your surveys are, harmful work environments will negate any efforts to make substantial change and eradicate any creditability amongst your first-generation employees. However, if the end goal is to create sustainable and inclusive work environments, call out toxic behaviors as regularly as you can, making it known these are not expectations for employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once there has been a careful examination of workplace practices, seeking individual feedback via engagement surveys, team forums, or even via 1:1 meetings can further prove to empower first-generation employees. This continued course of action achieves a positive cycle of consistency where self-advocacy is encouraged, rather than expecting first-generation employees to overcome their reservations without the proper groundwork.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, as you seek feedback, carefully analyze the perspectives of your first-generation employees. You may not always agree with their feedback or even fully understand their point of view. However, it is still your responsibility to do your best to implement changes if your end goal is inclusivity. Once this process is underway, an important consideration is not to have the feedback stay idle. Ultimately, if feedback goes unheard, it can create an environment of mistrust between you and first-generation employees. Keep in mind that this specific group would have done a great deal to overcome their own internalized stigma in providing the feedback, in hopes that the culture of work would be transformed. Communicate how you will address the feedback and remain agile. It may be possible that you will need to spend some time deciphering feedback from your first-generation employees or have another follow-up questionnaire to clarify points when it comes to their working conditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As organizations continue to correct a flawed system by building inclusion for all communities, it is imperative to support those who may not be able to advocate for themselves. First-generation employees sit at a unique juncture in applying determination and diligence in a new era of work, continuously shifting between cultures. Organizations need to create an environment where we can shed our layers and authentically thrive in the hopes of creating a more equitable world.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 05 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Benefits of Being Bored at Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/the-benefits-of-being-bored-at-work]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_29_XLRivrl9mNI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;While boredom can be an unpleasant feeling, it can also be an opportunity to reflect on your interests, values, and goals. By recognizing the type of boredom you&amp;#8217;re experiencing and identifying the underlying causes, you can take steps to address them and find new ways to engage with the world around you. Working with your boredom can also help you develop creativity, resilience, and the ability to adapt to new situations. So rather than trying to avoid or ignore your boredom, consider working with it as a valuable tool for personal growth and a way to lead a more fulfilling life. Based on the body of research exploring this emotion, the authors highlight some of boredom&amp;#8217;s benefits and detriments and offer insights into how you might harness the best of boredom.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/the-benefits-of-being-bored-at-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/the-benefits-of-being-bored-at-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Bored at work?我们都去过那里。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691612456044&quot;>;Boredom&lt;/a>; is that experience of wanting to be occupied in a satisfying activity, yet somehow being unable to do so. And being busy is no antidote: You may be both very busy — and very bored — simultaneously.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early in life we learn that boredom is no fun, and as we age we might begin to see it as a waste of time, or a missed opportunity to do something more productive (or at least more interesting). At best, boredom has been considered an unpleasant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691612456044?journalCode=ppsa&quot;>;aversive &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/152c9TgGipX6UOMCIbfTdrGy_vN6kopCv/view?usp=share_link&quot;>;experience&lt;/a>;, and at worst, a state that evokes a deep sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/journal/13164&quot;>;meaninglessness&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXpz4j8kTTtUdXJdlak3e3_kuIJLNskz/view?usp=share_link&quot;>;.&lt;/a>; In addition, when feeling the discomfort of boredom, time &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNy8bUlah9IHjM1CZZjkS6EnRV7AxXzX/view?usp=share_link&quot;>;tends to pass slowly&lt;/a>;, which can make work days seem endless.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering this, it&#39;s no surprise that boredom often triggers an intense desire to escape the situation (or job!) that evokes it. In today&#39;s ultra-connected world, this escape is just one tap away. At your fingertips, you find a world of data, breaking news, shows and stories, messages from friends and family, or gifs, memes, and video clips that help you avoid feeling bored — at least at the surface level. Research shows that use of smartphones not only distracts the mind, it offers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJPHM-08-2016-0044/full/html&quot;>;addictive hit&lt;/a>; of dopamine, which &lt;em>;temporarily&lt;/em>; replaces the discomfort of boredom with pleasure. However, this&amp;nbsp;feeling is short lived, as this mindless scrolling results in long-term decreases in overall mental health and quality of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next time you&#39;re feeling that creeping sense of boredom at work, pause before you pick up your phone. Boredom can have important benefits, and you&#39;ll miss them if you&#39;re not tuned in to what you&#39;re feeling and why.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Pros and Cons of Workplace Boredom&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Boredom has a negative reputation for a reason. At work, it&#39;s often viewed as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053482222000766&quot;>;counterproductive state&lt;/a>; that ignites discomfort, desperation for a new role, or perhaps simply a desire for the day to end. Boredom at work has been linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bdm.2160&quot;>;risky decision-making&lt;/a>;, costly mistakes, and accidents triggered by inattention or lack of focus — and that&#39;s not to mention the fatigue that being bored can generate. Boredom can also incite other types of problematic behavior, such as “cyberloafing” (that is, non-work-related browsing) and childish emotional responses. Prolonged exposure to monotonous activities can even cause &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-pathology-of-boredom/&quot;>;hallucinations&lt;/a>;. In addition, when it comes to well-being, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187912200118X&quot;>;one recent study found&lt;/a>; a linkage between boredom at work and burnout, as well as decreases in job satisfaction and increased desire to quit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the flip side, recent research shows that boredom — when handled constructively — has big “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053482222000766&quot;>;bright sides&lt;/a>;.” Moments of boredom can offer a pause, or a short respite for your brain and body in a world designed to distract, overwhelm, and overstimulate. A sense of boredom can create the space to daydream, which can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073&quot;>;hatch creativity&lt;/a>;, new ideas, and innovation. Prolonged boredom can prompt you to reflect and ask yourself, “Am I on the right path? Am I doing the right thing?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Use Your Boredom for the Better&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re not advocating that you seek out jobs where you&#39;ll spend large parts of the day feeling bored. However, getting better at working &lt;em>;with&lt;/em>; your boredom — and harnessing it for the good — can help you capture its bright sides. Here&#39;s how:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Notice.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When you feel that discomfort of boredom setting in, avoid acting on it immediately. The fact that you&#39;ve noticed you&#39;re bored means that you&#39;ve managed to (briefly) resist the urge to instantly engage in mindless scrolling. Noticing and naming your boredom in order to intentionally direct it opens up the opportunity to develop your resilience and the potential to use boredom for positive ends. Most importantly, in a bout of boredom, don&#39;t make snap decisions (like to quit your job) as a way to escape the discomfort.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Decipher.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Not all experiences of boredom are the same — &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-013-9385-y&quot;>;research shows&lt;/a>; that various “types” of boredom manifest differently in the body and mind, giving rise to different behaviors. Decoding which types you&#39;re feeling early on can help you make a game plan to deal with boredom, or prevent it from escalating or clouding your decision making.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ask yourself what your boredom is telling you. Could it be that you simply need a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-to-take-better-breaks-at-work-according-to-research&quot;>;micro-break&lt;/a>; because you&#39;ve worked too long without pausing and you&#39;re tiring? Or maybe your tasks are becoming monotonous and you&#39;re losing motivation and energy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider what you&#39;re bored with specifically: Is it your role, the content or form of the work, or your prospects for the future in your job that bore you? Can you decipher a pattern with a typical type of work that ignites this uncomfortable feeling? This can be an opportunity to consider your goals and values and whether you feel you&#39;re moving forward or feel “stuck.” Here are five research-based types of boredom to consider as you work to decipher yours:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Indifferent boredom.&lt;/strong>; This is one of the more positive types of boredom. It can feel like relaxation or a sense of cheerful fatigue and reflects a general indifference to (and withdrawal from) the external world. This type of boredom can help boost rest and recovery, particularly during busy days.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Calibrating boredom.&lt;/strong>; This one&#39;s slightly more unpleasant and is one of the most common types. It occurs when you&#39;re not fully engaged in a task or activity and your mind starts to drift. It can show up as wandering thoughts or not knowing what to do to change the situation, yet wanting to get out of it somehow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Searching boredom.&lt;/strong>; This type reflects a restlessness and active search for alternative actions and distractions to ease the negative experience (eg, through other activities, leisure pursuits, interests, and hobbies). While unpleasant, this type of boredom ignites activity and the pursuit of change and often has positive outcomes, such as creativity, innovation, and personal growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Reactive boredom.&lt;/strong>; Reactive boredom arises in situations where a person is required to do a repetitive or tedious task (such as being stuck in a long and ineffective meeting with no chance of escape). It&#39;s an action-oriented and deeply unpleasant type of boredom, which causes restlessness and frustration that might be expressed in a more angry or aggressive fashion toward others or toward the boring experience. Those experiencing it may persistently fantasize about other options and feel anxious to make a change or escape quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Apathetic boredom.&lt;/strong>; This can relate to feelings of disinterest, lack of motivation, and emotional detachment toward activities or events one would normally find stimulating or enjoyable. Apathetic boredom isn&#39;t necessarily accompanied by feelings of frustration or restlessness but rather a sense of disengagement and indifference. It can occur as a result of chronic stress, depression, or other mental health issues and can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. People experiencing apathetic boredom may feel like they&#39;re going through the motions of life without any real purpose or enjoyment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Decide what to do.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Based on the type of boredom and what it&#39;s telling you about yourself or your situation, decide what to do about it. Maybe your boredom is simply allowing you to relax and unwind after a period of intensity at work. Or perhaps it&#39;s telling you something about your role itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All roles have certain elements that are monotonous, frustrating, or simply boring, and sometimes these tasks must be done to get to the “good stuff.” If you find yourself persistently bored, try to harness the boredom to catalyze change, perhaps by engaging in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2001.4378011&quot;>;job crafting&lt;/a>; to bring out the elements of your role that you really enjoy. This could involve, for example, making changes to the type, variety, complexity, or significance of your tasks. You might intentionally evade boredom by seeking out, envisioning, and championing new ideas at work, which can also boost your leadership abilities and potential. Reflecting and engaging in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23163710/&quot;>;nostalgia&lt;/a>; can also counteract the sense of meaninglessness you might feel when bored.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Cultivate mindful boredom.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Moments of boredom can be opportunities to help you unwind from a fast-paced and hyper-connected world and allow you the opportunity to simply be in the present moment. Use moments of boredom for positive intentions rather than mindless distraction, for example, by taking a moment to breathe, doing another activity you find simulating, or simply mindfully allowing the discomfort to pass. As boredom can spark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200522-how-boredom-can-spark-creativity&quot;>;creativity&lt;/a>;, you could even include space for it as unstructured time in your work routine, for example, before you&#39;re required to innovate, come up with new ideas, and be at your best.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While boredom can be an unpleasant feeling, it can also be an opportunity to reflect on your interests, values, and goals. By recognizing the type of boredom you&#39;re experiencing and identifying the underlying causes, you can take steps to address them and find new ways to engage with the world around you. Working with your boredom can also help you develop creativity, resilience, and the ability to adapt to new situations. So rather than trying to avoid or ignore your boredom, consider working with it as a valuable tool for personal growth and a way to lead a more fulfilling life.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 04 Jul 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[4 Ways to Earn the Respect of a More Powerful Colleague]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/4-ways-to-earn-the-respect-of-a-more-powerful-colleague]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_03_144694173.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;retales botijero/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When you are stuck in an unequal power dynamic, it helps to remember that not only is the placement of power temporary, but you can equalize it. In this article, the author outlines four strategies you can use to creatively pivot in the moment and frame the connection differently, so that you are building the respect you deserve and positively shifting the perception of your power.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/4-ways-to-earn-the-respect-of-a-more-powerful-colleague?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/4-ways-to-earn-the-respect-of-a-more-powerful-colleague?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether we want to acknowledge it or not, in many colleague relationships there is a power differential, often based on each party&#39;s status in the organization and who has more control over what the other needs at a given time. For instance, the engineering leader whose team ultimately determines a product line&#39;s time-to-market may hold more power over the sales leader trying to deliver for impatient customers, and the leader of a mature and “unexciting” business unit may find their needs consistently deprioritized by the IT department, which is rushing to support a fast-growing division, instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a deeply frustrating dynamic for those in the “inferior” position — but to develop a mutually respectful relationship with colleagues (and perhaps even claim more relative power), it&#39;s vital to take steps toward rebalancing the equation. With a willingness to assert yourself in creative ways, you develop more agency for yourself, particularly at times when feeling dismissed or dependent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_pushing_up_to_a_point.pdf&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; there is a “Goldilocks” effect when it comes to assertiveness in interpersonal relationships, where you&#39;re able to hit a sweet spot between being too assertive and not enough. When done properly, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/why-we-should-be-disagreeing-more-at-work&quot;>;healthy dissent&lt;/a>; can lead to deeper trust and mutual respect. Based on my work as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.partnerexec.com/&quot;>;executive coach&lt;/a>; for senior leaders at global companies, here are four strategies you can deploy in your relationships to distribute power more evenly.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Choose to decline certain requests. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It may feel incredibly challenging to decline a more powerful colleague&#39;s request. But in any interaction, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)&quot;>;framing effect&lt;/a>; takes place where each party is sizing up who has more power and influence. Since power is comprised of many factors and is situational, even if you find yourself typically powerless relative to a colleague, there do emerge situations where they need something from you just as much as you need them. Even if you&#39;ve always acceded in the past, in occasional moments, it&#39;s important to capitalize on the opportunity to politely refuse the more powerful person&#39;s demands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201602/4-truths-about-power-in-relationships-including-yours&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; on relationships defined power as not only having a greater ability to influence the other, but also having the stronger &lt;em>;resistance to the other&#39;s influence&lt;/em>;. So, the next time you sense your colleague is overly exerting their power over you (for instance, making another last-minute request even though they have been inaccessible for yours), it may be a good idea to not immediately drop what you&#39;re doing and jump to the rescue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once coached a leader whose peer often dumped work on her but managed to stay above the fray when others needed her help. This colleague would frequently cite her interactions with their shared boss as a way of justifying her power and drop their name while making requests that purely served her.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are in a similar position as my client, respond to your colleague by saying something like, “I wanted to let you know I got your request. I&#39;m happy to help but have other commitments I must address at the moment. In the meantime, feel free to send me more information in case I can suggest another solution.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ideally, you want to send a message that you expect them to invest their limited time as well into the relationship. If you are true to the minimum promises you&#39;ve made, then you can confidently hold your ground as an equal partner. This not only encourages them to respect you but forces them to make sacrifices as needed for the relationship as much as you do.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Connect them to other people in power who value you.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Another way to shift the power in the relationship is by subtly reminding them of your social value by connecting them to other people they respect, with whom you&#39;ve cultivated a relationship. This does three valuable things: first, it shows them (through the principle of social proof) that you must have something to offer if people they admire see value in you; second, it may tip the scales in your relationship dynamic because you possess access they&#39;d like to enjoy; and third, it sends a signal that you already have high-profile access, so are not desperate to chase their approval.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I worked with a leader who struggled to be seen as a “strategic” executive and was continuously downplayed for higher level roles by HR when succession planning discussions took place. But in truth, he was quite innovative and eager to contribute to more forward-looking aspects of the business; it was because he was so good at operational execution that HR and his boss didn&#39;t want to rock the boat through a promotion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To disrupt this power dynamic, which was limiting his advancement, my client started to develop relationships with other senior leaders and socialized ideas that could help their business needs. And then he started making introductions between his new contacts and some of the colleagues in HR and his business who held influence over his career. By showing his access to other powerful leaders and sharing it as well through connecting others, his brand began to rise toward the perception of an enterprise-level leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Help them surface their blind spots as a way of supporting them.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Even the most powerful people can&#39;t see themselves exactly the way other people perceive them. In other words, they have blind spots just like the rest of us. And when you can help them gently recognize an aspect of their thinking or behavior that is getting in the way of their goals, they can begin to view you as a highly trusted partner, rather than someone below their level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of my clients was an SVP at a technology company who was privy to the chatter across the organization about the CEO&#39;s lack of decisiveness and how it was creating confusion for employees and teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While she agreed with the general sentiment, she was happy with how the CEO treated her. While he had more power than her, she generally accepted the idea of working under his leadership and meeting his expectations as best as she could. After all, she thought, why risk her relationship with the CEO and give him tough feedback that could backfire on her for being the messenger?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she also recognized that to become a trusted partner to him, she would need to truly be in his corner, through good and bad, and that required being honest with him for his benefit. So, she decided in her next one-on-one to share her observations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The SVP said, “I know how important it is to you to do the right thing for the business and our people. And sometimes our strengths can be over-leveraged to the point of becoming a weakness. I think because you care so much about listening to all sides of an issue, it&#39;s starting to delay making decisions. And I wanted to offer this possibility because you may be too close to this style to see how it&#39;s impacting others.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In taking the risk of putting a mirror up to the CEO, the SVP earned a high measure of respect and gratitude from him. Their relationship became one of trusted advisor and not just direct report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you meet with people in power and simply tell them everything they&#39;ve heard before or the same things as others in your position, you will be forgotten and relegated to the status quo. But by stepping out of your comfort zone to — kindly, but assertively — point out something that the powerful person had not noticed, you not only become memorable but start to gain influence and respect with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make them work to earn your attention.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Gaining the respect of colleagues more powerful than you is an interesting paradox: by putting them in a position to work for your approval, you earn more of their respect. So, a fourth strategy is to create conditions where they must “sell” their value to you. Basically, work less at earning their respect and put the burden on them to explain why they should be worth your attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the years, I&#39;ve coached leaders at companies that had undergone a merger or reorganization that required many employees and leaders to “reapply” for a job, either within their division or in a new part of the company. This experience can be unsettling, not just because they are back to being a candidate competing against others for a job, but because unlike applying to a new company from the outside, their reputations precede them and provide more subjective input that will influence interviewers when evaluating them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The natural mistake many people make in these situations is to overprepare for the questions they think they will be asked and try their best to hedge their answers to please the hiring colleague. This seems like the path of least resistance but in fact positions them as forgettable and unremarkable in the eyes of the other party.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, find ways to be generous with your answers but unafraid to also ask questions that put them a bit on their heels. When your colleague asks you that oft-repeated question, “Why should we hire you for this job?” your first instinct may be to prove your value to their satisfaction, even though you and they know that most everyone is applying for jobs because of the reorganization, not because they wanted to try something new.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, take a beat and say something like, “Actually, I&#39;m not sure you should hire me just yet. I&#39;d like to explore if there&#39;s a mutual fit between my experience and your vision of where this team is going. Anything you could share about your management style would be helpful as I&#39;m exploring my next steps.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Expecting people in power to “earn” your interest rather than take it for granted can bring positive results. Not only can it set you apart from the competition, but it can ensure you are working with colleagues who respect you rather than keep you under their power and whims.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you are stuck in an unequal power dynamic, it helps to remember that not only is the placement of power temporary, but you can equalize it. By adopting these strategies, you can creatively pivot in the moment and frame the connection differently, so that you are building the respect you deserve.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 03 Jul 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
