&lt;span>;&lt;p>;研究表明，对工作充满热情的员工效率更高、更具创新性和协作性。新的研究表明，这些员工也将对工作的热情视为一种道德要求，他们更有可能评判那些出于其他原因（例如财务稳定、社会地位或家庭义务）而受到激励的同事。研究还发现，这些员工更有可能为更热情的同事提供帮助。领导者必须认识到驱动员工的多样化动机，并创造一个支持和重视所有形式动机的包容性环境，而不是惩罚那些不符合以激情为中心模式的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/research-your-love-for-work-may-alienate-your-colleagues?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt; /a>; &lt;br>;

— 更有激情的员工更有生产力、创新性和协作性，并且他们对组织表现出更高水平的承诺。对于渴望实现持续增长、创新和成功的组织而言，培养热情是制胜法宝。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，在追求培养热情的过程中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org /doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2020.1761?af=R&quot;>;我们最近的研究&lt;/a>;表明，雇主可能忽视并忽视了员工的需求，这些需求是由其他动力来源驱动的，例如财务稳定性、社会地位、或家庭义务。这些员工&lt;a href=&quot;/2003/06/lets-hear-it-for-b-players&quot;>;在他们公司的成功中发挥着关键作用&lt;/a>;，但可能会因为以下原因而受到无形的惩罚他们认为自己对工作缺乏热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;做自己喜欢的事会让你“道德化”热爱自己的工作&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们的研究涉及 1,245 名全职员工对规模和行业各不相同的几个组织的调查揭示了当代工作场所的一个新现象：人们越热爱自己的工作，就越将其视为一种道德责任。对工作更有热情的员工更强烈地同意“为个人享受而工作在道德上是美德”和“内在动机是道德的”这样的句子。对于这些人来说，热爱自己的工作除了个人成就感之外还有道德意义，他们更有可能根据自己的道德标准来判断同事的工作动机，或者问，“我的同事来这里是为了&lt;em>;正确的&lt;/em>;理由吗？ ?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;将热爱工作作为一种道德义务的强调具有深远的影响。我们的研究表明，那些更热爱工作的人也更有可能不喜欢为外部奖励而工作。赞同“内在动机是道德的”这样的句子的人也认同“只为金钱而工作的人不是有道德的员工”和“受外部奖励激励的员工往往是不道德的”这样的句子。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;至关重要的是，我们发现了这些性格判断的后果。更热爱工作的员工也会优先帮助更有热情的同事，他们认为这些同事在道德上更优越。相比之下，因其他原因工作的员工从更有热情的同事那里得到的帮助较少，这使他们更难在组织中晋升，并更有可能被排除在重要项目之外。这种待遇会对员工士气、保留和整体组织绩效产生严重后果。相比之下，为获得外部奖励而工作的员工平等对待他们的同事，无论他们为什么工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;创造重视员工多样化动机的环境&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;管理者需要意识到，重视激情的组织会给一些员工带来疏远感。承认和庆祝所有员工的独特贡献，无论他们的潜在动机如何，将有助于在您的员工中建立归属感和目标感，从而提高敬业度和生产力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经理还应该努力培养开放和包容的工作场所文化，员工可以自在地讨论他们的动机和目标，即使他们与激情驱动的精神不一致。这既可以鼓励不同工作动机的员工之间进行对话，也可以为员工提供在工作场所内外探索和发展激情的机会。例如，指导、网络关系或工作重塑（即花更多时间在对他们更有意义的任务上）可以让员工接触到他们可能更感兴趣的角色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您是一名员工谁热爱他们的工作，请记住，这可能会让你对你的同事更有判断力，并影响你帮助他们的程度。不是每个人都需要做这项工作，因为他们对此充满热情。一些员工可能需要照顾家人，需要福利作为安全网，或者尚未发现他们对工作的真正热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，组织应该检查他们的福利和津贴是否对具有不同背景的员工具有吸引力动机。虽然一些员工可能会因为对工作充满热情而被工作吸引，但其他员工可能会因为灵活的工作安排或获得职业发展机会而受到激励。通过提供一系列福利和津贴，领导者可以创造一个吸引具有不同动机的员工并帮助留住顶尖人才的工作场所。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管人们普遍认为激情是成功的关键，但所有员工都应该受到赞赏他们是谁以及他们如何做出贡献——无论他们的工作动机如何。领导者应该认识到驱动员工的多样化动机，并创造一个支持和重视所有形式动机的包容性环境，而不是惩罚那些不符合以激情为中心模式的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Apple&rsquo;s Vision Pro Really For?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/what-is-apples-vision-pro-really-for]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;要了解 Apple 新护目镜的价值，思考它的虚拟性有多大帮助现实 (VR) 和增强现实 (AR) 对应于决策制定中的两项基本任务。 VR呈现新信息； AR 从现有环境中提取信息。但是以前的头戴式耳机和支持互联网的眼镜都没有在决策环境中挖掘这两者的潜力。 Apple 押注它可以建立一个应用程序开发者生态系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/ what-is-apples-vision-pro-really-for?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-is-apples-vision-pro-really -for?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Apple 上周大张旗鼓地发布了一款新电脑。 Vision Pro 是一台戴在脸上的电脑，但新颖之处在于您如何使用它。不是通过物理屏幕查看计算机的输出，而是将输出直接投射到您的眼睛中，两个非常小但高分辨率的显示器位于您面前非常近的距离。主要的用户界面不是通过键盘、鼠标或触摸屏来控制计算机，而是通过眼动追踪和手势。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;正如他们在推出 iPhone 时移除了屏幕手写笔一样，Apple 不需要物理控制器来使用计算机。计算机通过观察你的眼球运动来感知你有兴趣与之互动，然后观察你的手来确定你想做什么。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;这些事情都有前因——无数的可穿戴设备用于观看，例如 Google Glass 或 Meta 的 Quest Pro，以及诸如此类的技术作为 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/reviews/leap-motion-controller-review/&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;Leap Motion&lt;/span>;&lt;/ a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; 和 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVDPrFvBvWw&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>; Myo Armband&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; 用于手势控制。但这些前辈都没有将其整合为一个连贯的愿景。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6 ,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot; ;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Apple 将这款新设备命名为&lt;/span>;空间计算机&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto “>;。这个名字很贴切，因为该设备可以使用您周围的任何物理空间作为画布来显示数字输出。不需要桌子（或膝盖）来放置设备，并且对可感知的查看区域的大小没有限制。这意味着从技术上讲，你可以坐在一个狭小的空间里，比如飞机座位上，看电影大小的电影。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;你应该用空间计算机做什么？目前，Apple 已经概述了看似平淡无奇的用例。您可以像普通计算机或 iPad 一样使用它，但当前的 2D 信息会显示在更加灵活和不受约束的显示器上。有这样的需求。如果您没有太多空间，这将很有价值。对于那些目前使用大量大型显示器的空间的人来说，这将是有价值的。从这个意义上说，最接近的类似物是超大屏幕电视。人们会为此支付 3,500 美元吗？他们现在就这样做。甚至 Apple 也销售售价高达 6,000 美元的显示器（Pro Display XDR）。从这个角度来看，它很容易在当前用例的成本范围内。这种策略还有一个好处，即为这个新平台播种 iPad 和 iPhone 已经存在的大量应用程序。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot; 335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;更好更方便的显示然而，对于 2D 内容，似乎并不能证明 Vision Pro 的技术和研发重量是合理的。真正的问题是这个设备是否可以导致增强和虚拟现实应用程序，这些应用程序可以证明将计算机绑在你的头上是合理的。它当然有这样做的技术能力。 Vision Pro 可以显示您当前空间中的 3D 对象，甚至可以将您带到新的空间。然而，Apple 在发布时几乎没有提到 AR 和 VR 这两个术语。在这样做的过程中，他们画了一条人们以前没有画过的线。这不是 AR 或 VR 设备或技术。该技术是一台空间计算机，如果 AR 和 VR 有作用，那就是在空间计算机上运行的应用程序中。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0, &quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;让我们回顾一下这些概念.增强现实（或 AR）涉及获取您周围的环境并改变您对它的看法。谷歌眼镜通过智能眼镜向您显示通知来做到这一点。 Vision Pro 通过将 2D 显示器放置在该环境中并固定它们来实现这一点，这样当您的头部移动时，显示器就不会移动。它似乎存在于您当前的环境中。这是通过将真实世界的非常准确的视频通过设备传递给您来实现的。你没有直接看到你的环境，但你认为你正在这样做。因此，从技术上讲，Apple 正在增强您所处环境的视频捕获，而不是在您直接观看时叠加内容。对于用户来说，没有真正的区别。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;; :276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;虚拟现实（或 VR）涉及让用户沉浸在虚拟环境中。 Vision Pro 会吸引您的全部注意力，因此您会沉浸在虚拟环境中。在一种模式下，这看起来就像你实际所处的环境。转动表盘，它会改变，你可以被传送到其他地方。来自您当前环境的视频直通被数字创建的 3D 环境所取代。从这个角度来看，这显然是一个 VR 设备。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;需要注意的重要一点是，尽管能够支持 AR 和 VR，但 Apple 并未强调这些用例。因此，他们生产了一种能够同时具备这两种功能的设备，但在任何一个领域都没有找到令人信服的用例。这是他们在年度开发者大会上宣布它的原因之一。 Apple 需要应用程序，他们需要其他人想象它们。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot; 335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;在 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs /2305.16872&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;最近的论文&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;，我们概述了我们认为 AR 和 VR 应用可以添加的方式独特的价值。除了游戏和娱乐，我们的重点是经济用途——特别是那些可以提高用户生产力的用途。对此，我们不禁要问：哪些 AR 和 VR 应用能够通过帮助用户做出更好的决策来创造真正的价值？对于希望为 Apple 创建的平台构建应用程序的人来说，了解可能性至关重要。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;大多数决策都涉及某种程度的不确定性。信息是解决这个问题的良方，它能让你了解更多，从而减少错误。但是在决策中使用信息有两个方面。首先，您需要获得正确的信息。其次，您需要有认知空间来提炼和解析有用的信息。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;; :6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;事实证明，AR 和 VR 映射到这些东西中的每一个。 VR 能够为用户提供更多相关信息，尤其是当这些信息不在他们身边或获取成本很高时。通过让用户沉浸在新的环境中，它所做的就是将这些信息带给他们。在某些情况下，它可能是建筑物内部正在发生的事情的真实视图，例如，在火灾期间。在其他情况下，它提供了一个安全的模拟环境，例如飞行模拟器，可以在没有高风险的情况下促进训练。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;; :6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;相比之下，AR 将信息呈现在一个给定的上下文并解析它以产生相关的信息。例如，当您在会议上遇到某人时，它可以识别该人是谁，而无需您搜索自己的记忆。或者，如果您正在处理火灾，它可以提供有用的逃生路线覆盖图。在每种情况下，目标都是从用户环境中提取大量信息并呈现所需信息。需要注意的一件事是，Vision Pro 并不是一款可以在家庭或工作场所之外使用的便携式计算机，这限制了它在导航外部环境（例如驾车时）中的适用性。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;这个观点强调了为什么许多以前的 AR 和 VR 声称的用例价值很低。在漂亮的房间里与化身举行的 VR 会议并不能提供对会议中可能因 Zoom 通话而产生的那些人更有用的信息。当你四处走动时提供文本通知的 AR 眼镜正在增加而不是减少你的认知负荷。我们的框架表明，最佳用例将出现在获取信息通常很昂贵或很危险的情况下，突出了 VR 的价值，或者环境非常复杂，以至于通过 AR 来澄清它的数字覆盖价值很高 &lt; /span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;— &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;或两者。想想应用程序，例如新飞机或建筑物的原型设计，或协助远程医疗程序。 Vision Pro 展示了能够完成所有这些事情的能力，但为这些用例进行试验和设计的工作留给了其他人。希望从 Apple 创建的平台中获利的开发人员最好专注于以恰到好处的详细程度为用户提供难以访问的上下文信息的应用程序。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{ &quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot; auto&quot;>;这是 Apple 首次推出设备时的标准。 iPod 是一种数字随身听。 iPhone 是一个连接的 iPod。 iPad 是更大的 iPhone。 Apple Watch 是一款更好的智能手表。而 Vision Pro 是一个不受约束的 3D 屏幕。在以前的案例中，设备已经过时，并且通过支持开发人员创新而变得不仅仅是最初的使用。 Vision Pro 是一个受欢迎的新产品&lt;/span>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-proactively-defuse-tension-on- your-team?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-proactively-defuse-tension-on-your-team?language=pt&quot;>; Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;作为首席人事官，我亲眼目睹了未解决和未解决的人际关系紧张和不良行为如何导致组织失败。微妙的种族歧视、对项目可交付成果的争论，或者对被认为不公平的优势的八卦，都会对团队绩效、协作和生产力产生负面影响，在团队之间造成运营摩擦，并导致员工感到不敬业、不信任和没有动力。这些问题可能由多种因素引起，包括个性和观点的差异、种族、阶级&lt;strong>;、&lt;/strong>;和性别特权、工作和沟通方式、权力失衡和/或缺乏透明度和清晰度&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/how-to-navigate-conflict-with-a-coworker&quot;>;工作中的人际冲突是不可避免的&lt;/a>; ，我们常常忘记我们自己的机构来根除问题，并以同理心、责任感、自我意识和勇气阻止问题迅速升级。这样做会让人感到害怕和危险，尤其是当你是一名初级团队成员或属于一个或多个代表性不足的群体时。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近，一位年轻的有色人种女性表达了保留意见，她是我所在组织的一颗冉冉升起的新星关于加入一个可以显着提升她的职业生涯的新团队。在与团队经理的谈话中，当他对社交活动中员工的种族隔离问题发表了麻木不仁的评论时，她感到很困扰。由于担心她的职业生涯以及可能存在种族敌对或不舒服的工作环境，这位经理可能不尊重她的身份和经历，她向人力资源业务合作伙伴寻求指导，后者将她介绍给了我。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们讨论了她期望的结果是加入团队，同时让经理对他的言论的影响负责，并鼓励他改进他的行为。我让她选择直接解决这个问题，或者在谈话中得到我的支持，优先考虑她的安全和尊严。深思熟虑后，她选择了直接参与。我指导她如何自信而深思熟虑地表达自己。随后，她分享了一个积极的结果——经理表现出同理心，真诚地道歉，并承诺与整个团队公开承认不屑一顾的评论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据这名员工和其他许多人的经历，我在我的职业生涯中一直担任教练，如果您在工作场所目睹或经历伤害，您可以&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;采取以下五项措施来减少或停止人际关系紧张和有害行为：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;强>;1。确定紧张的根本原因。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在处理工作场所的人际摩擦时，第一步是确定根本原因——紧张的真正来源。艾米·埃德蒙森 (Amy Edmondson) 在她的&lt;em>;无所畏惧的组织&lt;/em>;一书中探讨了组织中缺乏心理安全感的代价，包括有毒的工作环境、倦怠和人力资本损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;消除不健康的因素降低个人和团队的安全、舒适度和绩效的行为要求我们面对需要改变的东西。在如何运行项目、与哪些合作伙伴合作以及绩效衡量方面的权力不平衡和意见分歧往往是误解、分歧和合作崩溃的根本原因。在这些情况下，初级员工、有色人种女性和代表性不足的员工往往害怕说出冲突，因为害怕遭到报复或受到负面评价。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上面的例子中，紧张的根本原因是经理对种族不敏感的评论，导致人们担心工作环境可能充满敌意或不舒服，缺乏尊重，并无视这位有色人种女性和其他人的生活经历。通过以支持、同理心和勇气来处理此类情况，我们可以发现并解决紧张局势的根本原因，并防止它们对个人的福祉和职业发展产生负面影响。重要的是要认识到这种方法可能并不总是可行或安全的。在这种情况下，该员工相信如果谈话偏离正轨，我会进行干预。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.寻求理解，而不仅仅是被理解。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;职业关系是充满误解的人际关系。在压力大的时刻，一个错误的、无意的词，尤其是那些受性别和种族偏见影响的词，可能会在同事之间造成深深的隔阂。要建立共识，重要的是要为他人的意见留出空间，对复杂和微妙的情况产生同理心，并承担起在同事之间培养安全感和信任感的责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这种情况下，经理拥抱连接、学习和成长的机会，寻求理解他们的言行的影响，而不是采取防御姿态。这种反应表明愿意承认错误并努力改变，而不用担心显得无能或被取消。经理没有转移或抱怨领导挑战，而是将团队的福祉放在首位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过帮助经理看到并理解她的担忧，该员工表现出了非凡的同理心。尽管她不理会这位经理是公平的，但她认识到了成长的机会并参与了建设性的对话。这种方法使她能够在解决经理对不敏感评论缺乏认识的问题上主张她的代理权。她选择了一种协作方式，让其他人可以学习和改进。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们的互动生动地展示了开放、安全和信任的沟通的变革力量，突出了当双方处理棘手问题时积极改变的巨大潜力，带着真实的理解和被理解意图进行不舒服的对话。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.评估干预的正确时间。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;说点什么和不说点什么都是会产生深远影响的选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有时，干预可以在当下或短期内发生在那之后。如果你单独与某人分享冒犯性、诽谤性或贬损性评论，并且觉得有可能说出可能被误解或针对你的武器，请等到周围有其他人可以提供支持或向人力资源部报告或匿名热线。或者，如果你觉得舒服，你可以试着说，“当你说 ___ 时，我感觉 ____”或“我确定你不是那个意思，但我不太喜欢那个评论。”接收反馈的人可能需要了解他们的言行的影响。等待时间过长可能会导致负面情绪在您和他人的内心挥之不去并不断滋长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果该员工没有分享她的担忧，或者如果该经理以防御和报复的方式做出回应，就会错失培养健康员工的机会和繁荣的工作环境。此外，这可能会延续一种恐惧文化，给她和其他有类似恐惧的员工带来负担，最终阻碍他们在整个职业生涯中的成长和幸福。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4.寻求帮助。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;随着我在职业生涯中的进步，我渴望能够利用自己的权威地位来挑战有害行为的领导者。当我自己担任领导角色时，我意识到责任落在我身上，以身作则来体现我想要的行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您在处理棘手情况或组织的冲突解决、申诉和纪律程序，求助于您的人力资源团队。我理解接触时的犹豫，尤其是当你与 HR 的关系不牢固时。尽管如此，人力资源部还是要提倡员工的发言权、代理权和安全性。他们可以帮助您收集信息、了解根本原因并确定适当的行动。人力资源合作伙伴可以促进建设性对话，指导您和其他相关人员，并找到解决行为问题的主动解决方案。谨慎处理此选项很重要，因为它可能会加剧团队成员之间的紧张或不适。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured %20insights/diversity%20and%20inclusion/women%20in%20the%20workplace%202022/women-in-the-workplace-2022.pdf&quot;>;Women in the Workplace 2022&lt;/a>;，LeanIn 和麦肯锡关于该州的年度报告美国企业中的女性，整体女性，尤其是黑人女性和残疾女性，经常在工作中遭受微侵犯，例如她们的判断力受到质疑或因举止受到批评。从工作场所的可用资源中寻求支持可以在促进繁荣和健康的职业生涯方面产生重大影响。让同事、经理和领导承担责任对于解决和减轻这些有害经历至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这个例子中，员工向 HR 寻求指导以应对这种复杂情况。通过利用可用资源，她使自己能够有效地解决问题，从而使她和团队中其他人的体验发生重大变化。她主动寻求帮助、乐于接受反馈并进行自我反省，这对取得积极成果发挥了关键作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5.修复伤害；修复信任。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;重复的伤害行为，例如微妙的&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/research-the-real-time-impact-of-microaggressions&quot;>;微攻击&lt;/ a>;, 会严重影响幸福感、工作场所满意度和生产力。要从误解、不一致的观点或期望、伤人的语言、滥用权力或背信而引起的人际关系紧张中痊愈，受伤害的人必须感到被倾听、被尊重和被重视。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据 Kay Pranis 的说法, a national leader in restorative justice, assuming accountability and implementing measures to rectify the damage caused and prevent its recurrence requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://irp.cdn-website.com/76b5fa75/files/uploaded/Kay%20Pranis% 20Article%20for%20March%20Blog.pdf&quot;>;five elements&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Acknowledge that your actions caused harm.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Acknowledge that you had agency in those actions .&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Understand the full impact of your actions on anyone who was impacted.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Take steps to repair the harm and make amends.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Identify patterns or habits that led to causing harm and take steps to change those habits.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;Repairing harm can manifest in various ways: acknowledging the harm, expressing remorse, admitting guilt, and committing to behavioral change through new policies, commitments, or agreements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a woman of color, I&#39;ve heard my fair share of comments that offend, upset, or hurt me, and I have regrettably done the same to others. Whenever I&#39;ve been the target of microaggressions, I try to collect my thoughts and emotions before addressing a coworker, respond assertively with “I” statements, and often reply with kindness and humor to defuse the tension. For example: “When you restated my recommendation in the recap meeting without giving me credit, I felt erased from our conversation. I&#39;d like us to have a healthy working relationship. Can you help me understand why you omitted my contribution?” Or: “When you confused me for the other Latina on the floor, I felt we were both invisible to you. And I think I&#39;m pretty memorable!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I unintentionally make an insensitive comment, such as misgendering someone, I immediately approach the impacted individual with humility.我真诚地倾听以了解我的话的影响并表示衷心的道歉，同时对我的言行承担全部责任。 I also encourage them to call me in if I repeat such behavior because I am committed to learning from my mistakes and growing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be clear, it is not the responsibility of women, BIPOC, or members of marginalized communities to educate their colleagues on how to foster healthy interactions. To proactively create more meaningful relationships, ask yourself these questions: How can I focus on what the person is saying, and not solely on how they say it or how they look? What else do I need to know to understand what my colleague is trying to communicate instead of dismissing or avoiding what they say? And before addressing someone&#39;s uncomfortable comment, ask yourself: Am I responding to being shut down, ignored, or offended, or am I trying to be right? If both parties are willing, there are ways of responding that can lead to constructive conversations and shared understanding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Repeated acts of harm in particular must be addressed. MIT&#39;s Sloan School of Management conducted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/&quot;>;a study in 2022&lt;/a>; that found that employee turnover is 10 times more influenced by a toxic corporate culture than compensation.承担责任意味着了解团队之间广泛的观点和经验，并主动识别紧张的根源。 A good starting point is asking yourself, “What do I need to hear, what do I need to say, and what would I like to see as an outcome?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this example, the manager took essential steps to repair the trust his insensitive comments had initially broken.他通过承认自己的言论造成的伤害并进行公开对话来表现出责任感。 By actively working to understand the impact of his words and offering to take tangible steps to change his behavior, he successfully began repairing the trust with his new employee and, quite possibly, his relationship with the broader team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of us want to change workplace conditions so everyone can thrive, yet sometimes, we are terrified of messing up, saying the wrong thing, or not being able to do enough.解决人际关系紧张和毒性需要持续、积极的努力，以培养同理心、意向性和勇气。 By identifying the true source of the tension, seeking understanding, assessing when to intervene, involving neutral third parties if necessary, and repairing harm and trust quickly and often, you can prevent conflict from escalating and build a stronger, more connected, and more effective team.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Game Plan for Funding Carbon Offsets]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_13_-537715290_-1363813940.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration: Edmon de Haro; Baloncici/Getty Images (chimney); Vitalina/Getty Images (butterflies)&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The most common types of carbon offsets are nature-based offsets such as forests. Unfortunately, while emissions remain in the atmosphere around 1,000 years, possibly longer, a tree can only remove carbon for its lifespan of 10o or so years, which means a forest planted as a carbon offset must be maintained with trees replanted at least ten times to &amp;#160;match the emission it is offsetting. Most businesses will be reluctant to tie up capital in this way, but such projects can be (and have been) financed by perpetual bonds, which represent attractive investments for investors such as university endowments that have very long liability streams extending far into the future. The use of financial instruments such as perpetual bonds can make considerable quantities of capital available to offset producers, spurring the production and the creation of spot markets in offsets that can definitively and reliably be offset against emissions.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;In September 2015, a curator from Yale&#39;s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library traveled to Amsterdam to collect the previous 12 years&#39; worth of interest on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.yale.edu/2015/09/22/living-artifact-dutch-golden-age-yale-s-367-year-old-water-bond-still-pays-interest&quot;>;a bond issued on May 15, 1648&lt;/a>;. At the bond&#39;s issuance, the borrower, an autonomous Dutch water authority, had promised to pay the holder interest &lt;em>;in perpetuity&lt;/em>;. Cash from sale of the bond had been used to pay for an infrastructure project that protected against rising sea levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Such perpetual bonds may prove useful in today&#39;s fight against climate change by enabling the funding of projects that will remove and store carbon indefinitely. Carbon removals can be used to offset carbon-emissions liabilities (or &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/accounting-for-climate-change&quot;>;E-liabilities&lt;/a>;), thereby helping businesses and other organizations achieve net-zero goals. Perpetual bonds can also support the development of efficient &lt;em>;spot markets&lt;/em>; in removal offsets, spurring both their production and their use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Perpetual bonds help resolve a key mismatch between the duration of many carbon offsets and the duration of the E-liabilities they are to be netted against. As we note in our July-August HBR print article, “&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/accounting-for-carbon-offsets&quot;>;Accounting for Carbon Offsets&lt;/a>;,”&amp;nbsp;E-liabilities from greenhouse gas emissions pose a particular challenge to financial markets since emissions produced today are expected to linger in the atmosphere for more than 1,000 years, a duration far longer than typical financial liabilities. Given that, we establish the need for offsetable carbon-emission assets (E-assets) to also have &lt;em>;indefinite &lt;/em>;duration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Certain E-assets such as carbon capture and storage via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/making-minerals-how-growing-rocks-can-help-reduce-carbon-emissions&quot;>;subterranean mineralization&lt;/a>; explicitly meet this criterion, but such E-assets are currently uncommon. Far more widespread today are nature-based offsets (NBOs) such as virgin forestation programs, which typically have shorter durations stemming from the &lt;em>;finite&lt;/em>; (unreplenished) lifetime of forests (potentially less than 100 years). At issue, then, is whether NBOs can be used to net E-liabilities: if they cannot, then most removal offsets being supplied today are only down-payments against long-term emissions liabilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For NBOs to have indefinite duration, the issuer must commit to managing the underlying (forest) asset in perpetuity — that is, replanting the forest as its constituent trees naturally decay or are destroyed by disease, fire, etc. To finance this operation, the offset provider needs capital not only to buy the land and plant trees but also to provide for predictable outlays in perpetuity. In other words, they must invest part of any capital raised in an endowment fund, the returns on which can go towards financing the management of the forest so that the carbon remains sequestered indefinitely (defined as, say, 1,000 years, a reasonable scientific estimate of how long carbon emitted today will stay in the atmosphere).&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Moreover, given the indefinite commitment, an issuer wanting to qualify some fraction of its presently delivered (or “earned”) removal offsets as being immediately and fully nettable against the purchaser&#39;s E-liabilities will have to set aside a separate (significantly larger) fraction of its available earned offsets against future commitments to sequester carbon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;All this implies that providers of capital to producers of NBO offsets can expect relatively low returns on their investments, albeit distributed in perpetuity. Individual offset buyers (usually for-profit businesses) will not find it attractive to tie up their own capital in this way. But such an investment might well be attractive to institutions that require endowments to cover predictable liabilities far into the future, such as universities and churches. The investment would take the form of a perpetual bond — such as that issued by the Dutch water authority — or of preferred equity with a fixed dividend. Ordinary equity is likely not suitable to finance indefinite-duration removal offsets since investors usually want a guaranteed return for tying up capital in perpetuity with limited upside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Consider, as a hypothetical example of how a perpetual bond approach can work, an indigenous tribe in Canada that wants to sell nettable E-assets from a virgin forest that it will plant on its land and manage indefinitely. To do so, it must raise capital to develop and maintain the forest. The tribe can issue a perpetual bond and place some of the capital in an everlasting financial endowment. The tribe uses the interest from the endowment to pay for the costs of managing the forest. As offsets from the forest become “earned” — that is, trees mature and sequester carbon — the tribe can sell some portion of these E-assets to pay for expenses, including the interest on the perpetual bond.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Let&#39;s assume that 20 megatons of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; equivalent (MtCO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;e) of offsets from the forest&#39;s current trees is “captured” this year and will be so for the next 100 years, but the trees will then have to be replanted at least 10 more times to be nettable against a 1,000-year E-liability. To distribute the risks of this commitment, the tribe can sell 2 MtCO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;e of this year&#39;s offset as “earned” in perpetuity (ie, 20 Mt divided by 10).&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;If there are enough producers of NBO offsets and enough demand for them, the nettable offsets can be sold into a liquid market, which distributes the future risks of the forest across a range of offset purchasers and helps the tribe to meet its interest obligations. Next year&#39;s spot buyers may be different from this year&#39;s, and, indeed, spot buyers hundreds of years thence likely will be very different, but collectively, through contributing to the perpetual bond&#39;s interest costs, they share in the long time-series risks of NBOs. The scheme is profitable for the tribe as long as the proceeds from spot sales of nettable offsets and from endowment returns exceed the bond&#39;s interest expenses and the ongoing forest-management costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Very likely, no one 375 years ago expected the Dutch seawall-management bonds would make interest payments in the present day to a New England university library 3,500 miles away. Likewise, we cannot predict how financial markets will develop to meet the needs of emissions liability management. But the pathway set out here suggests a feasible market solution to mitigate the long-term consequences from today&#39;s carbon emissions.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Your Company Prepared for the Effects of Wildfires?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_13_1258513476.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Angela Weiss/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Today&amp;#8217;s wildfires and smoke can travel hundreds of miles, blurring the lines between what happens within and outside the workplace when it comes to workforce health.

The author recommends taking six actions: 1) Connect global wildfires to local health; 2) Collect and assess air quality data, developing thresholds for workforce advisories; 3) Identify the key stakeholders in your corporate response team and activate your command center; 4) Identify when to take action for outdoor workers; 5) Identify how to support indoor office employees; and 6) Develop communication and education plans for your employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Wildfires. The word has struck fear into the hearts of small and midsize rural communities for generations. Now, thanks to smoke blanketing parts of North America, urban America and the corporations headquartered there are beginning to understand themselves as vulnerable, too.

This means the conversation in Corporate America has moved beyond indoor air circulation or filtration, to encompass outdoor air quality as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poor air quality impacts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ishn.com/articles/113569-how-poor-iaq-impacts-employee-safety-and-productivity&quot;>;employee health and productivity&lt;/a>;, from diminished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/office-air-quality-may-affect-employees-cognition-productivity/&quot;>;cognitive function&lt;/a>; and poor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w20648&quot;>;concentration&lt;/a>; to lowered &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/air-pollution-is-making-office-workers-less-productive&quot;>;productivity&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8b8c&quot;>;sentiment&lt;/a>;.

Unfortunately, there&#39;s likely more to come in the future — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires&quot;>;climate change&lt;/a>; means increases in wildfire season length, frequency, and burned area.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a physician working for an international organization advising corporate leaders, we are seeing a rapid rise in employer inquiries related to employee health and the best practices around air quality concerns. HR teams are fielding complex questions from employees and leaders — and many don&#39;t feel prepared with the right information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is reminiscent of the height of Covid in March 2020, when leaders asked: Is this an issue we need to respond to? What do I need to know? What action do I need to take now? Here are six actions for employers to consider as they navigate this ongoing issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Connect global wildfires to local health.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Air pollution can harm anyone. But it is more dangerous for specific employee segments and their family members. This includes infants and young children, seniors over 65, pregnant women, anyone who exercises or works outdoors, and people with existing illness or chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, lung, or heart conditions. During heavy smoke conditions, all employees may be at risk regardless of their age or health. Impacts can be both physical and psychological, especially for employees experiencing the trauma of wildfire evacuation from their homes and workplaces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Smoke can travel thousands of miles from an initial fire zone, which means that wildfires in other parts of the world will impact your people in the local communities where your company operates. Smoke from wildfires includes a complex mixture of pollutants, like fine particulate matter. Invisible to the human eye, these particles get deep into our lungs and bloodstream, sometimes leading to serious health effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no evidence of a safe level of exposure for some pollutants, meaning that smoke can impact employees&#39; health even at very low levels. And as local smoke levels increase, the health risks to your workforce will generally increase as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Collect and assess air quality data.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Data can typically be found through an Air Quality Index (AQI), which is a system used to warn the public when air pollution reaches dangerous levels. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues year-round AQI forecasts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airnow.gov/&quot;>;maps&lt;/a>; showing how pollution levels change and move throughout the day, and other countries have similar resources. This “real-time” information can help employers to quantify current outdoor air quality that impacts both their employees and customers far before it hits front-page news.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recommend working with health care experts such as physicians or medical consultants to develop specific thresholds for workforce advisories that go along with these levels. Doing so will help you take steps to protect your employees from unhealthy levels of air pollution and enable them to proactively seek appropriate supports for their health and safety. Specific thresholds paired with health care guidance will also prepare managers to communicate with and guide their teams in line with corporate policy. Once your organization understands how to use air quality data and sets monitoring thresholds, it will help trigger your corporate response at the right time and place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Activate your command center.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Identify who needs to be brought together to respond when AQI thresholds are met, especially if there is an immediate physical health and safety threat to employees. Wildfire-related local evacuations &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/how-kaiser-permanente-prepares-for-disasters&quot;>;are particularly high stakes&lt;/a>;, especially when hundreds of thousands evacuate all at once as seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/southern-california-wildfires-blaze&quot;>;Southern California&lt;/a>;. Your corporate response team may include local business leaders in impacted areas, communications specialists, medical advisors, HR leaders and even risk practitioners given broader enterprise issues involved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your multi-disciplinary approach may look similar to governance models &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/leader/early/2020/04/07/leader-2020-000244.full.pdf&quot;>;developed during the Covid pandemic&lt;/a>; and will ensure timely information is continuously flowing to and from the right stakeholders, including executives and the board. It will also enable rapid, holistic decision-making and related corporate response. This may range from meeting occupational health and safety standards to regulatory compliance for different employee segments like indoor versus outdoor workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Focus on outdoor workers, and comply with regulation.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Depending on your industry, outdoor work exposure to wildfire smoke is regulated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/wffsmoke.html&quot;>;occupational health and safety&lt;/a>; standards and regulatory bodies like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;>;Occupational Safety and Health Administration&lt;/a>; (OSHA). Long work schedules and physical work demands may impact a worker&#39;s exposure risk and health response. Geography matters, as local regulations differ. For example, California&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dir.ca.gov/title8/5141_1.html&quot;>;emergency regulation&lt;/a>; applies to workplaces where AQI is greater than 151 or if employees are expected to be exposed to wildfire smoke.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers should know their local air quality regulations and take action to limit outdoor workers&#39; exposure, particularly when wildfire smoke is in or around the work environment. This may include relocating or rescheduling work tasks to smoke-free or less smoky areas or times of the day, reducing levels of physical activity when possible, providing workers with frequent breaks in places that are free from smoke, and offering special accommodations where required.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some situations, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as well-fitted N95 respirators, should be considered to limit workers&#39; exposure. When US employers require use of respiratory protection to limit exposure to smoke, this should occur as part of a comprehensive respiratory protection program as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;>;OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard&lt;/a>;. (When use is voluntary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppD&quot;>;other OSHA standards&lt;/a>; apply.)&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Support indoor office employees.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Air quality can be unexpectedly complex for indoor office workers. Corporate safety standards related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/staying-compliant-in-an-era-of-hybrid-and-remote-work-c0e0938e&quot;>;home office&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalguardian.com/global-digest/at-home-duty-of-care&quot;>;worker travel&lt;/a>; have been elevated in recent years. And while it is arguable whether an employer&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1741438/does-employers-duty-care-extend-commuting&quot;>;duty of care&lt;/a>; extends to the employee journey to and from work, the commute matters, especially if an employee needs to navigate significant outdoor air pollution to get to and from the office. Taking a holistic “employee experience journey” approach can help calibrate potential risks for employee segments in hard-hit local areas or where there are specific individual health risk factors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As many office buildings have advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and optimized Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) ratings, the air quality at the office may be superior to that of the average home during wildfire season. Employers may need to take additional actions to reduce exposure to and protect occupants from wildfire smoke. This may include installing air cleaners equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, ensuring that windows and other building openings are kept closed to reduce overall smoke exposure inside, operating HVAC systems in the re-circulate setting, or temporarily reducing the amount of outdoor air supplied to the building. If you currently lease office space, engage your landlord to ensure that they optimize protection of your indoor workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More broadly, consider security, medical, and mental-health coverage to keep your people safe in times of crisis. This includes extending fulsome protection to the entire workforce, whether they commute or work indoors or outside. Employees working from home in your local corporate backyard might need that same 24/7 evacuation coverage you previously only considered for international travelers. This coverage applies equally to wildfires as it does to other natural disasters, like flooding or hurricanes, when companies often provide assistance such as food and water, shelter, or emergency evacuation. At many companies, this extra layer of coverage requires a mentality shift, but it is one worth making today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. Communicate and educate broadly.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Depending on the scope and scale of a wildfire and its impact on your organization, consider what should be communicated proactively (eg, that your organization is aware of and actively responding to worsening local air quality) and reactively (eg, messaging from HR in relation to very specific individual circumstances requiring accommodations).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Education is an important part of any communication plan related to wildfires and air quality, so alert your employees to symptoms of wildfire smoke exposure. Milder and more common symptoms include headaches, mild cough, sore and watery eyes, and nose, throat, and sinus irritation. More serious but less common symptoms include dizziness, chest pains, severe cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and even irregular heartbeat. Encourage employees to seek care from a health care provider and consider urgent medical attention if warranted for severe cases such as risks for asthma attacks, stroke, or heart attack.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of severe wildfire events, communication may include addressing immediate physical health and safety threats and extend to longer-term practices around air quality and respiratory health. Providing individual employee guidance on what to do to safeguard their health when air quality level is at different thresholds can help. For example, at higher levels, employees can be guided to avoid prolonged vigorous activity outdoors and stay away from high-traffic areas. It may also mean postponing or cancelling certain corporate and team-building events, or moving outdoor gatherings indoors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/how-prepare-wildfire-smoke.html#:~:text=Checklist%20for%20wildfire%20smoke%20season%20preparedness,-Are%20you%20or&amp;amp;text=Do%20you%20have%20an%20adequate%20supply%20of%20food%20and%20water,a%20break%20from%20the%20smoke%3F&quot;>;Preparedness checklists&lt;/a>; can help and may cover home, office, and personal medical preparedness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s wildfires and smoke can travel hundreds of miles, blurring the lines between what happens within and outside the workplace when it comes to workforce health. Now is the time to get ahead of this and other climate change-driven health issues. Source new resources, pilot novel approaches, and translate them into productive corporate action to support employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When Your Boss Gives You Bad Feedback, Badly]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/when-your-boss-gives-you-bad-feedback-badly]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_12_1434150794.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Anton Vierietin/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;It&amp;#8217;s difficult to manage your feelings when getting feedback that feels too harsh, overly nice, or somehow dishonest. We all struggle with feedback, so extend a little grace to yourself for having strong emotions, and to the other person for initiating a difficult conversation. The authors present the three most common ways people deliver feedback in a way that causes harm and elicits strong emotions, as well as five key steps to take when you get poorly delivered feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-your-boss-gives-you-bad-feedback-badly?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-your-boss-gives-you-bad-feedback-badly?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Hearing about what you&#39;re not doing well at work can feel bad. That doesn&#39;t make you “defensive” or “shut down to feedback.” It just means you&#39;re human and that you care about your performance — both good things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when you receive kind, clear feedback from a manager, peer, or employee, it can still be difficult to learn what you could be doing better. Say to yourself: “This is uncomfortable, and that&#39;s okay. My reaction will pass.” And then do something that allows you to sit with the discomfort for a while. Meditate, take a walk, or journal. Remind yourself that the person is giving you feedback because they care about helping you&lt;em>;. &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what happens when the person doesn&#39;t care about you, or when the feedback is poorly delivered? What if the person was rude, insensitive, or unclear? Now is not the time to criticize the criticism. But how can you navigate your own emotional responses to different types of feedback? The only way out of feeling bad about critical feedback is through.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mollie and Liz are experts in emotions at work and Kim is an expert in feedback at work. Kim&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://review.firstround.com/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss&quot;>;radical candor&lt;/a>; framework explains the three most common ways people deliver feedback in a way that causes harm and elicits strong emotions: obnoxious aggression, manipulative insincerity, and ruinous empathy. Together, we&#39;ve identified five key steps to take when you get poorly delivered feedback:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Name your emotion.&lt;/strong>; Figure out how you&#39;re feeling and don&#39;t judge yourself.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/strong>; Look for something helpful in the feedback even if it wasn&#39;t delivered well.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Reward the candor&lt;/strong>; — even if you disagree. Note that this doesn&#39;t mean pretending to agree. Sometimes the best reward for feedback you disagree with is a respectful explanation of why.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/strong>; Talk to the person about the impact of their delivery.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Fish or cut bait.&lt;/strong>; Figure out if you can continue to improve the relationship or if this is someone you need to avoid.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;As with most advice, this is much easier said than done. Here&#39;s how to apply these steps in the face of three common types of poorly delivered feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Obnoxiously Aggressive Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;What should you do when someone is yelling or using disparaging language? For example, a person once gave Kim some feedback by jabbing his finger in her face as he yelled, “You are the most aggressive woman I ever met!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of feedback usually makes us feel a mix of anger, fear, defensiveness, and anxiety. In addition to the steps below, if you feel that you&#39;re being bullied or verbally abused at work, it&#39;s important to escalate that to a trusted leader or HR rep if you feel safe doing so. If there&#39;s nobody you feel safe going to at work, it&#39;s a sign to start looking for a new job.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Give yourself a minute. If you find your emotions are overwhelming, try to create space for yourself or remove yourself from the situation entirely. You might say something like, “I&#39;d like to come back to this later” or “I&#39;m having a strong reaction to your feedback, and I need a moment.” Liz has learned to evaluate her emotions on a scale from 1 (okay) to 10 (enraged or panicking). She aims to wait until she&#39;s settled down to a 3 or 4 before taking action or even responding.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;re calm, think about what was said, not how it was said. Is there some information, no matter how terribly imparted, that can be useful to you or help you succeed? Some people will never tell you what they&#39;re thinking until they&#39;re so angry that they aren&#39;t able to communicate it well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It may be the case that you disagree with the content of the feedback as well as the way it was delivered. That&#39;s okay. But challenge yourself to find one thing the person said, or even one aspect of what they said, that you can agree with. There may be a whole bushel of chaff and only one grain of wheat. Find that grain, and use it to your advantage!&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you agree with any of the feedback, make changes and update the person on what you&#39;re doing differently. If you disagree with it, offer a respectful explanation of why.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Is there a way to relay how their words and actions impacted you? In some situations, it may be effective to share how an overly harsh delivery affects your ability to perform well on the job. In a workshop Liz and Mollie led, for example, a participant shared that her boss used to yell at her frequently. One day she finally said to him, “I know that you&#39;re upset right now, but when you yell at me, I&#39;m not able to focus on my work.” Her boss apologized and realized that he was inadvertently hurting her performance. His outbursts became much less frequent.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Of course, sometimes when you talk to the person about how what they said impacted you, you&#39;ll learn the person is trying to upset you. In those cases, telling them how they made you feel won&#39;t work. Why tell them they succeeded in upsetting you?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, limit how much you interact with the person. Once Kim told her boss he was being disrespectful; he replied he was offended that she didn&#39;t genuflect enough, or appreciate how superior he was to her. She quit. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/i-hate-my-boss/id1148704291?mt=2&quot;>;TV writer Elizabeth Craft advises&lt;/a>;, “If someone handed you a literal glass of poison, you would not drink it — so don&#39;t drink the verbal poison. If someone&#39;s coming at you negatively at work, just don&#39;t ingest.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Manipulatively Insincere Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When people are worried about their own reputation more than helping you improve, they may say things they don&#39;t really mean. Sometimes people say things to you that feel passive aggressive, or they praise you to your face but criticize you behind your back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all do this sometimes. Kim confesses that she had a direct report to whom she gave manipulatively insincere feedback. His work was riddled with careless mistakes. And he was popular and very sensitive. What if he started to cry when she pointed out the mistakes? Worried about her reputation as a leader rather than her direct report&#39;s performance, she&#39;d say something to him along the lines of, “Oh, Alex, this is a great start. You are so incredible. Maybe you can make this a little better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What can you do if someone is giving you praise that feels more like an ego salve than something real? How can you encourage them to say what they really think?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When confronted with this behavior, it&#39;s easy to feel confused. If you find out the person is saying nice things to your face and bad things behind your back, you may feel angry, betrayed, or mistrustful. Take a deep breath. Figure out how you&#39;re feeling.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Remember, you&#39;re trying to get feedback that will help you grow. Try asking the person making the comment to clarify what they meant. You might say, “Can you share a bit more about what you mean by that?” or “What would you recommend I do differently?” By asking for more detail, you help prevent miscommunication and give yourself an opportunity to address any underlying issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It might be that the person is simply conflict avoidant. You might make them feel more comfortable sharing if you say something like: “I feel like you have valuable feedback for me, but I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to communicate. Can you tell me what you&#39;re thinking more directly?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another tactic is to tell the person that you&#39;re working on improving something, and ask them to help you: “I&#39;ve been told I interrupt a lot. Can you help me by passing me this pen if you notice me interrupting someone during the meeting?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When a well-intentioned person has a hard time giving feedback, it&#39;s especially important to prove to them that not only is it safe to give you feedback, but that they&#39;ll be rewarded richly if they do. When their feedback results in your action, the risk they took has paid off. Saying thanks is never enough —&amp;nbsp;you need to fix the problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when a person praises you to your face and criticizes you behind your back, it&#39;s really hard to reward that kind of passive aggression because you&#39;re not supposed to know what they think. You could ask: “Is there something I could do differently so next time you can tell me what you really think? You told me you thought the presentation went well, but I heard you told others it was terrible. I promise not to bite your head off if you tell me when I&#39;m not hitting the mark. In fact, I&#39;ll be grateful because your feedback is exactly what I need in order to do better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Now that you&#39;re talking, you can ask the person if they can commit to talking to you directly rather than behind your back in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If the person apologizes and seems sincere, you can begin to rebuild trust. But if they respond in a way that erodes trust further, aim to regulate your emotions so that their behavior affects you less. Try an imaginary time-travel technique called temporal distancing. “Imagine it is a day, a week, or a year later,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://msande.stanford.edu/research-impact/stories-voices/faculty/faculty-spotlight-bob-sutton&quot;>;says Bob Sutton&lt;/a>;, author of books including &lt;em>;The No Asshole Rule&lt;/em>;. “And you are looking back on it, and it really didn&#39;t last that long or wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as it seemed at the time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Ruinously Empathetic Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sometimes you get the sense the person is so worried about hurting your feelings or offending you that they won&#39;t tell you what they really think. They care, but they&#39;re not challenging you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The part of Kim that was reluctant to tell her popular and sensitive employee Alex when his work wasn&#39;t good enough because of her concern for her reputation as a leader was manipulative insincerity; the “too nice” part of her that was reluctant to tell Alex what he needed to know because she was afraid of hurting his feelings was ruinous empathy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When someone is overly nice about their feedback, you may feel unsure about their intentions, or frustrated that they&#39;re not telling you what you need to know to improve. You may wonder if they think you can&#39;t handle the feedback. Maybe that makes you angry. Maybe their ruinous empathy makes them seem weak to you, and maybe that makes you feel disgusted. Emotional responses to ruinous empathy vary widely.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You might say, “While I appreciate that you think I&#39;m doing a great job, I know that there is always room for improvement. When I repeatedly don&#39;t get any constructive feedback from you, it makes me feel like you&#39;re holding back. The only way I can improve is if you give me candid feedback.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You may then need to sit through the other person&#39;s discomfort. Many people who give overly nice feedback will try to wriggle out of saying anything critical. They might repeat, “No really, you&#39;re doing great.” Their discomfort might make you feel that you should let them off the hook.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Push back against this instinct and stick with the conversation until you get a genuine response. One technique Kim recommends is to count to six before saying anything else. This forces the other person to endure the silence. After six seconds, if they still can&#39;t come up with anything else in the moment, suggest finding a time to meet again.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This is really important if you ever want to get more feedback from the person. Be effusive in your thanks. If you agree with the feedback, fix the issue, and then ask if you over or under-corrected. If you disagree, first look for something they said that you can agree with. Then, respectfully explain why you disagree with the rest. If possible, agree to do it their way — even if you disagree. Maybe they&#39;re right and you&#39;re wrong. Even so, explaining your reasoning and still deferring to them is a sign of respect.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Having demonstrated how helpful their feedback was, tell them you&#39;ll be asking for more. Let them know that while you appreciate their concern for your feelings, when they fail to tell you things that would help you do better work, it hurts your ability to succeed, and it doesn&#39;t improve your relationship. Reassure them that you really do want them to be candid with you, and that you not only can take it, but will appreciate it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Encouraging others to give you feedback often demands patience and takes work. But not everyone will offer it to you. If you&#39;ve taken all the steps suggested above, and the person still will not share any direct feedback, look to others for candor. If your boss seems constitutionally unable to give real performance feedback and their boss is not holding them accountable, start looking for a new boss.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s difficult to manage your feelings when getting feedback that feels too harsh, overly nice, or somehow dishonest. We all struggle with feedback, so extend a little grace to yourself for having strong emotions, and to the other person for initiating a difficult conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Large Language Models Reflect Human Judgment]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_10_1448510799.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Olena Koliesnik/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Artificial intelligence is based around prediction. But decision making requires both prediction and judgment. That leaves a role for humans, in providing the judgment about which types of outcomes are better and worse. But large language models represent a key advance: OpenAI has found a way to teach its AI human judgment by using a simple form of human feedback, through chat. That opens the door to a new way for humans to work with AI, essentially talking to them about which outcomes are better or worse for any given type of decision.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Artificial intelligences are prediction machines. They can tell you the probability it will rain today, but they cannot tell you whether or not you should pack an umbrella. That&#39;s because the umbrella decision requires more than just prediction — if the probability of rain is 10%, some people will choose to carry an umbrella, but others won&#39;t. Why will different people behave differently even though they are faced with the same information? Because they have different preferences. In this case, some people care much more than others about getting wet. Only you or someone who knows you well can judge the costs and benefits of carrying an umbrella. Making that decision for you requires both a prediction and a judgment based on your preferences.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;AIs excel at prediction but they do not possess judgment. To be sure, there are many decisions where we know the rewards or can work them out easily. Fundamentally, we know what a driver should do in most situations — accelerate, brake, turn — because we know the consequences of not doing the right thing. But ask Google to give you advice on a new dishwasher, and the best it can do is predict which pages are likely to provide the information you are looking for. It isn&#39;t feeling lucky enough to tell you what to do. Likewise, while you might be worried that your employer will use an AI to determine if you should be fired, the machine isn&#39;t ultimately responsible. AI might provide a prediction about your performance, but it is your employer who applies judgment and decides whom to fire.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;It was for this reason that, in our 2018 book &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Prediction-Machines-Economics-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1633695670&quot;>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Prediction Machines&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, we saw a role for reward function engineers whose job it would be to “determine the rewards to various actions, given the predictions that AI makes.” AI prediction could improve so many decisions that the reward function engineers who understood those predictions and the decision at stake would provide a skilled complement as AI adoption continued apace. But innovation in reward function engineering has been slow. There has been little progress in developing tools to codify appropriate human judgment into machines before they are deployed at scale. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Until recently. Large language models (LLMs) are, for all their seeming intelligence, still just prediction machines. But they are transforming the way AI assists in decision-making because they are changing the way humans provide judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Ask ChatGPT to rewrite a paragraph more clearly for a certain audience, and it does not give you options or a lecture on grammar and rhetoric. It gives you a paragraph. It is impressive, but the real miracle here is that ChatGPT could write the paragraph &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;you wanted&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;. There are a ton of reward and risk issues that go into writing a paragraph. Will the writing be honest (consistent with the facts), harmless (not including words that might offend), and helpful (accomplishing the goal of the paragraph)? Just think about that last one. These models are trained on existing writing by people. The paragraph produced is, at its core, written using a type of “autocomplete” over and over again. When we have our phones autocomplete, they do a good but not perfect job. So how is it that ChatGPT is able to produce written outcomes that are so much better than what the average person can do? How was ChatGPT able to judge quality from all of the content, good and bad, it was trained on? More generally, why didn&#39;t it develop into the toxic cesspool that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;>;Microsoft&#39;s Tay chatbot turned into after a day on Twitter&lt;/a>;?&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Some people, such as &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;Stephen Wolfram&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, believe that LLMs are uncovering some fundamental rules of grammar. Yes, that can make the writing readable, but it surely can&#39;t make it clear and compelling.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;A &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;2022 paper from OpenAI researchers&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; provides an important clue. That paper describes how raw, unmodified LLMs were taken and used to offer up outputs to real people. For the most part, the people were asked to &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;use their judgment to rank several alternative outcomes&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; to the same prompt. The ranking criteria were carefully specified (ie, prioritize helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness). It turns out that with clear instructions and some person-to-person training, different people could quite readily agree on those things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Those rankings were then used to tweak or “fine tune” the algorithm. The model learned human judgment and adjusted based on positive and negative reinforcement. Writings that ranked highly received a positive bump. Those that did not got a negative hit. Interestingly, even for a model trained on billions of pages, with just a few thousand examples of human judgment in the form of ranked responses, the AI began producing outcomes for all queries that were highly ranked. This occurred even for queries that seemed far from the ones the evaluators had ranked. Somehow, human judgment on writing quality spread quite far throughout the model.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;The evaluators were effectively reward function engineers. But unlike with a statistical model, the output of which can be offputting for many people, LLMs interact in plain language — anyone can help teach the model judgment. In other words, anyone who can speak or type can be a reward function engineer. The amazing discovery behind ChatGPT was that with comparatively little effort, reward function engineers were able to train LLMs to be useful and safe. This is how OpenAI was able to launch a consumer-facing model that did not suffer from the flaws of its predecessors when released into the wild. This simple method of codifying human judgment into machines supercharged AI performance. The machine was now imbued with the ability to not only predict word sequences that were likely, but also to apply the reward function engineers&#39; judgment to those sequences to increase their appeal to readers. The discovery of an easy method for machines to apply human judgment — the complement to any AI prediction machine in specifying the risks and rewards in a wide variety of circumstances — made all the difference.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;For many decisions, specialized reward function engineers will be needed to deploy AI prediction machines at scale. The discovery of this intuitive approach for codifying human judgment into machine — fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback — may unlock many valuable applications of AI where human judgment is difficult to codify in advance but easy to implement when you see it.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI Will Accelerate the Circular Economy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_12_1295939564.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Almost Green Studio/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Despite living on a planet with finite resources, our economy remains largely linear and full of single-use products. The shift toward a circular economy, where companies recover or recycle resources, has hit roadblocks, including low value of used products and high recycling costs. Harvard&amp;#8217;s D^3 Institute recently highlighted how digital tools and AI can help overcome these hurdles. They discussed three key strategies: extending the life of products, using fewer materials in production, and using more recycled materials. These tech-enabled strategies promise significant financial returns, but unlocking their full potential will need serious investment. Simply put, it&amp;#8217;s high time businesses recognized the potential of turning waste into wealth.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The global economy still functions in a linear manner and is characterized by the extraction, production, consumption, and disposal of materials.这是一个问题，因为我们生活在一个资源有限的星球上。 Yet the shift to a circular economy, in which businesses recover or recycle resources used in their value chain, has remained elusive, despite offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.summaequity.com/assets/Reports/PDF/230417-Investing-in-a-circular-and-waste-free-Europe.pdf&quot;>;trillions of dollars in value creation&lt;/a>;. Barriers include the low residual value of used products, an inability to collect materials, prohibitive costs of separating and processing materials, and lack of traceability of products and materials that are being recycled.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To accelerate the pace of innovation and learning, the Digital, Data, and Design (D^3) Institute at Harvard Business School recently hosted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://environment.harvard.edu/event/d3-catalyst-circular-economy-conference&quot;>;event focused on the circular economy&lt;/a>;, where entrepreneurs and business leaders shared how they&#39;re using digital tools and artificial intelligence to remove those barriers and create entirely new markets and business models. Specifically, the conference helped identify three main ways to achieve a more circular economy: increasing product utilization, material efficiency, and use of recycled materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Product Utilization&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Product utilization seeks to extend the useful life of a product, such as through sharing economy platforms, product refurbishment programs, or enhancing product duration. One new way companies are extending the life of the product is through over-the-air software updates that increase the residual value of a product.以 iPhone 为例。 Today, the iPhone constitutes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-used-smartphone-market-is-booming-surprisingly-thats-good-news-for-apple/&quot;>;80% of the market&lt;/a>; among 300 million or so phones in the secondhand market. A primary reason for this success, Marcelo Claure, former CEO of Sprint and Softbank International, explained at the event, is the forward compatibility of the iOS operating system, which ensures a user can access the app ecosystem and all the new features that Apple releases, maintaining iPhones&#39; appeal as a high-quality product in the secondhand market. Over-the-air updates of software is becoming the norm for more products — even cars. As a result, we expect an increase in the residual value of used products and an increase in product utilization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contrary to the belief that prolonging product lifespan might hinder sales growth and therefore firms should implement a planned obsolescence strategy, leading firms perceive enhanced product utilization as a mechanism for reaching new consumers, enhancing customer satisfaction, and building business models that monetize their efforts to create more durable products through services. Apple now has &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/apple-says-it-now-has-935-million-paid-subscriptions/&quot;>;935 million subscribers&lt;/a>; in its services segment, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16157374&quot;>;has grown&lt;/a>; to almost $80 billion in revenues and runs at close to double the gross margin compared to the hardware business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another opportunity to extend the useful life of products is through the product-as-a-service model, where companies retain ownership of a product while consumers pay for its use. Advancements in data and tracing technology has enabled better information flow to facilitate this business model. For example, SuperCircle developed a digital infrastructure that enabled circularity in the fashion industry by integrating customer purchase data with warehouse and distribution systems to trace the lifecycle of clothing. Entrepreneur Chloe Songer, cofounder of SuperCircle, explained how they partner with apparel brands like Reformation to create a customer experience that allows for goods to be returned for a credit or discount, while also facilitating the logistics infrastructure for aggregating and selling these clothes to the recycling sector. Identifying the consumer as a temporary owner of a long-lived asset opens up a world of opportunities to continue engaging customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Material Efficiency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Material efficiency, which refers to making products with fewer materials, is not a novel concept for many firms that have long pursued a lean operating model, characterized by minimizing waste in production processes. However, with recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and innovative technology, material efficiency is witnessing the emergence of even more opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, our conference heard how entrepreneur Shelly Xu&#39;s SXD Zero Waste applies artificial intelligence to redesign garment mockups that generate less pre-consumer waste from offcuts during apparel production. The result is the creation of sweaters, dresses, or pants with close to zero waste in fabric and about 55% lower cost, as opposed to 10–30% waste in traditional designs. Successful entrepreneurial solutions will be those that invest time in educating B2B customers about the potential for cost savings and the need to revise legacy processes that traditionally result in more waste, such as fashion design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “tough-tech” segment, using breakthrough science, engineering, and technology, also has the potential to create solutions that both reduce the material impact of existing supply chains and create “drop-in” solutions that can be incorporated into existing supply chains. An example of an entrepreneur in this space is Luciano Bueno, who founded GALY, a firm that grows cotton from cells in a lab using 80% fewer resources compared to traditional agriculture. An important part of the innovation journey in tough tech involves educating investors on the longer innovation cycles and the need for iteration on the path to scalability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Recycled Materials&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most well-known element of a circular business model involves minimizing the use of virgin materials as a percentage of a product&#39;s total materials. For instance, Apple&#39;s products now incorporate 20% recycled materials. Beyond reducing carbon emissions, the use of more recycled materials helps companies increase “materials security,” which is particularly concerning for industries reliant on rare minerals such as lithium and cobalt. Increasing recycled materials is also a key solution for reducing carbon intensity in hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel. However, Joy Chen and Per Anders Enkvist from McKinsey highlighted that the availability of recycled materials is currently limited, and sometimes more expensive than virgin materials. Technological enhancements to increase the availability of high-quality recycled materials and reduce costs therefore are huge opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In particular, scaling up material recovery and separation is key to making recycled material more available and affordable. Bjørn Arve Ofstad, CEO of Norsk Gjenvinning, the largest waste management company in the Nordics, explained that this sector needs an upstream feedstock, technology to sort and process the waste to be used downstream, and a downstream taker. This process needs to be done at an industry scale where materials are accessed at the right time, price, and quality. Robotics can facilitate this sorting process at lower cost. For example, Apple developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-terminator-apples-daisy-teardown-robot-can-rip-your-phone-apart-in-18-secs/&quot;>;Daisy&lt;/a>;, a state-of-the-art robot that can breakdown an iPhone into reusable components in 18 seconds, including rare minerals such as cobalt, gold, and platinum.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opaque supply chains represent significant barriers to understanding the breakdown of materials at end-of-life for recovery and sorting. Maria McClay, from Google, explained how in 2019 Google piloted a solution to use machine learning and analytics to provide a more comprehensive view of impact along the textile value chain, and in 2021 was able to expand the offering to other brands. Another solution described by Hari Nair from Procter &amp;amp; Gamble is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pg.co.uk/blogs/HolyGrail/&quot;>;HolyGrail project&lt;/a>; that uses digital watermarks in products to make the sorting of recyclables easier at the end of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Investing in the Trillion-Dollar Opportunity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To support the adoption and scaling of these digitalization-enabled solutions, we need investment to fund the trillion-dollar opportunity. Yet asset allocators in circularity face a “pattern recognition” challenge, where the capability to identify promising opportunities is still evolving. Venture capital funds have been hesitant to invest in early-stage companies with significant capital expenditure needs, which is often the case in circular solutions. On the other hand, private equity funds have been reluctant to invest in early-stage startups. One solution, described by Andrew Merino of Generate Capital, is the emergence of multi-sector, sustainability-focused funds that bridge the gap between traditional venture capital and private equity. To tap the full investment potential of a circular economy, investors need to develop in-depth sectoral expertise and innovation in investment structures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Video Quick Take &ndash; Google&rsquo;s Gautam Ramdurai on Emerging Consumer Behavior - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM GOOGLE]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/06/video-quick-take-googles-gautam-ramdurai-on-emerging-consumer-behavior]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;p>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6328969026112&amp;quot;}&quot; js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Todd Pruzan, Senior Editor for Research and Special Projects at Harvard Business Review, recently interviewed Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager, Ads Marketing, Google Asia Pacific, for a new episode of HBR Video Quick Take. Since every business today needs to navigate a complex matrix of factors that drive sustainable and profitable growth while keeping in mind that the core of doing so is still about understanding customers and how they make decisions, Pruzan spoke with Ramdurai about new insights into emerging consumer behavior across the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;So much about consumer behavior seems to be in continual motion. What kinds of changes are you seeing in consumer behavior across Asia-Pacific right now?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;The things that we&#39;re finding right now are fascinating. And what&#39;s particularly important to notice is what is truly different about 2023 versus, say, 2020 and even 2022. We know the pandemic fundamentally shifted so many things, but I think as we&#39;ve come out of the pandemic, other crises are stepping in: political turmoil, climate change, and the cost-of-living crisis. When all these kinds of public crises come together, we need to start thinking about the total effect they have. And the answer is this: We are entering a truly hybrid world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about how everyone went online during the pandemic. But then, as we&#39;ve come out of the pandemic, when you&#39;ve thought about your grocery shopping, how have you decided which items to buy in store versus which items to buy online? There&#39;s this complex calculus that goes on in everyone&#39;s head for even the simplest of decisions just because of the number of factors in the decision itself and the number of channels you&#39;re getting information from. For example, think about the number of devices you interact with, and then multiply that by the number of channels you use, from Google Search to YouTube to any other video platform to newspapers. You navigate in and out of the online and offline worlds. And even within the online world, there&#39;s so much multiplicity, and you try to find your way out of it. That is getting very tricky in 2023.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So across Asia-Pacific, our research tells us that the gap between wondering and knowing — which has always existed — has never been this wide. And that&#39;s what we refer to as the confidence gap.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;OK, so trust and confidence are big factors today more than ever, but how are consumers navigating this landscape? How are businesses navigating it?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start with consumers. Consumers are smart. They&#39;ve always been better at keeping up with the times than businesses will ever be. So what consumers have done is found their internal calculus fairly quickly. In other words, everyone has these decision factors that they go through and these information sources that they&#39;re going after to make their decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s take an example of someone wanting to do something: I have a three-year-old, so I have been thinking about when my three-year-old should be riding a bike. And that&#39;s a big moment, right? So when a consumer thinks, “Oh, I need to buy a bike for my daughter,” the first question is never “Where do I buy bikes?” Rather, it is “What is the right age for children to ride bikes?” It&#39;s a more foundational life question and a curiosity-driven question. You start with a question regarding the right time for a child to ride a bike, and then you slowly transition into researching what kinds of bikes there are. You end up getting sucked into videos of kids trying to learn how to ride a bike for the first time. You quickly realize you need to purchase a helmet as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This curiosity path expands the process during which consumers are finding the right information. And as consumers are navigating all this, we found that what they truly look for are six particular confidence cues. These cues are signals amid the noise; they are things that will tell them what they need to know to get closer to being confident in their decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So imagine you&#39;re in the confidence gap. You&#39;re stuck there and don&#39;t know where to go next. You&#39;re letting your curiosity guide you to the next questions. We found there are key pieces of information that bring everything together during this process. One of the confidence cues, for example, is reviews. Is this company that manufactures this particular bike well reviewed or not? Does this company have a reputation for being a company that makes safe bikes or a safe company overall?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are other things that matter too, such as social proof. And sustainability is becoming more important, so a company&#39;s having sustainability practices is becoming a bigger and bigger piece of purchase consideration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, we found an additional, implicit cue. This seventh cue is really about platforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today there is a plethora of digital information, and I know I am preaching to the choir here when I tell you that the digital world is expanding. The number of information sources people have is more than they have ever had before, and with all that comes a lot of disinformation and misinformation.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In short, the platforms themselves are playing a much bigger role in 2023 than we have seen them do before. They become this seventh cue regarding how much trust you have in the platform itself where you are getting your information. It&#39;s like looking at two different news sites and deciding which one you trust more. That same logic is now moving on to the world of platforms: The platform where you look at all your information or find your information is actually as important as any of the other confidence cues that the brands or the businesses themselves might communicate to their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;So the platform has to be part of your daily life. It has to be safe. It has to be a platform that you trust, almost the way you would trust the word of one person over another based on what they&#39;ve told you in the past. The platform is key here?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Yes, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing across multiple platforms, especially Google and YouTube. With a site like Google, where in times of uncertainty people go to find out something, it&#39;s almost like a library of human intentions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So while there are six cues that the brands themselves can look at, it&#39;s not just about what you say in those six confidence cues. Rather, it&#39;s where you show up with those confidence cues that&#39;s equally important.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;So the medium really is the message or a big part of it?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Correct. I would say it is a big part of it, because the medium can never be the full message. You own your brand. You know the truth that it wants to speak to the world. But I think the complications right now — and this goes back to our research on what is unique about 2023 versus ever before — involve needing to think about the calculus that the consumers have to go through. Then we need to pair that with the calculus that the businesses have to go through. So if the consumer doesn&#39;t find the right information, at the right time, in the right place, and in the right medium, they&#39;re going to drop out of their purchase journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Wow, it sounds like that&#39;s a pretty fragile transaction there.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And everything is back on the table. Intuitively — and this is part of a discussion I was having with someone yesterday — you would think, “Oh, in times of uncertainty, we&#39;d go back to the things we know.” But what we&#39;re seeing is people are actually spending more time researching even if they have had brands that they&#39;ve used for a long time. So it&#39;s almost like the pandemic has heightened this need for trust and confidence to such an extent that people are moving their tried-and-trusted brands to the back of the table. What that means is you cannot take trust for granted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, going back to transactional trust, it&#39;s not built when the person has bought the product. It&#39;s built when the person is thinking of using a product; it&#39;s built when the consumer doesn&#39;t even know they have the need for the product. So if you go through the entire consumer journey, you need to be able to establish those confidence cues across the whole board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And it doesn&#39;t end when they&#39;ve bought your product. The more important part of the journey is when they&#39;re actually using your product or your service. That customer experience doesn&#39;t end at the buy button. It almost starts there in many ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;If trust is important to consumers, how does this start translating to business outcomes?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;In 2023, it has a pretty direct impact. If consumers are looking for information to build up their confidence about buying your product or your service, how you show up is super important. If you don&#39;t show up the right way, it has direct implications on your bottom line. For example, in both India and Southeast Asia, one in three consumers decided not to buy a brand they were considering already because they felt a little anxious. They were not assured of their choice.¹ So that&#39;s an abandoned cart right there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And we&#39;re seeing the positive side of trust show up in a big way as well. If you&#39;ve done the job of being with your customers/consumers throughout their buying journey and their overall purchase experience, and you&#39;ve built and fed into that trust account, highly trusted brands are seven times more likely to be purchased² — and it doesn&#39;t end at purchase. Consumers who are confident in their product choices before purchasing are almost 20% more likely to repurchase that brand.³&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus, the consumer journey is cyclical, so the trust and confidence you&#39;ve built with your consumers don&#39;t end when they hit “Buy.” It almost starts there. And if you want to continue building that virtuous loop of trust and confidence, you need to step up everywhere, even when they&#39;ve already bought your products. We&#39;re seeing this come through very clearly in the data. So for the confidence-seeking consumer in 2023, all brands are back on the table, and it&#39;s up to you as the seller to choose whether you want to be part of that transaction or journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;What can businesses do to keep up with what their customers need? And how do you see that changing over the next few years?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Once someone has gotten all the signals they need to make their choice, that&#39;s when we think they&#39;ve made a confidence shift: You&#39;ve helped them find the answer to that life question, and your product or service is a part of that. We think businesses that are smart and able to power this confidence shift are the ones that are going to thrive in this very messy future — and present, for that matter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when you start thinking about how your business can help them make the confidence shift, you need to know which cue to show, when to show it, and whom is it for, because all your consumers are probably not built the same, and all of them are not in the same part of the journey. These are all moving targets: the right cues, right consumers, right formats, right messages, right devices, and right points in the decision journey. The only way to start making sense of this — and these are all predictive decisions in a lot of ways — and to do it at scale, and for large companies, especially, in milliseconds, is by harnessing the power of data and AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, this brings us back to whether you want to be a transactional business or a business that builds trust and confidence over time. This is an investment that you need to make across the entire customer experience. The gold standard of campaigns used to be that you&#39;d have and meet just one KPI a quarter, but we&#39;re moving away from that. Now the gold standard is whether you can drive new customers who also have high lifetime value. Those used to be two different meetings in the marketing rooms, but now they&#39;re being mushed together. The way to unpack this complexity is with data and AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Gautam, thank you for your insights. Do you have any parting words today, especially about how you are going to find that bike for your daughter?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;What a complex question! There are many life questions that exist when it comes to buying that bike. I need to keep the following in mind as I navigate that path: We know that life is a lot more complicated and complex than it has been before, and we don&#39;t know what the next set of uncertainties will be. We also know that they will come; there will be more uncertainty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the confidence gap that has always been there, consumers will still find themselves in it, and maybe it will widen. Maybe the confidence cues will evolve. But I think we have to keep our ear to the ground to understand our consumers&#39; decision making if we want to know which cues they need. Our job is to help them make that confidence shift, and that will only become more and more important as we move into the future. The world of complex decision making is here to stay, and the businesses that invest in their ability to make that confidence shift with the power of data and AI are probably the ones that are going to thrive in this environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Thank you so much for a great conversation and for all of your insights today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Thank you, Todd, for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;To learn more, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/marketing-strategies/automation/build-brand-confidence-ai-marketing/?utm_source=twg_partnership_external&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2023-APAC-GML-EVOS-HBR-VQT-HL&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;Think With Google&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Return to the “&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/multiply-your-marketing-with-ai&quot;>;Multiply Your Marketing With AI&lt;/a>;” Sponsor Content Hub from Google APAC on HBR.org&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;¹Source: Google/Kantar/Quantum, “Emotional Value of Search”, IN, ID, VN, MY, PH, TH, PK, 2021, n=5006 P18M category buyers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;² Source: Edelman, “Trust, The New Brand Equity”, 2022, n=14,000 consumers across 14 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;³ Source: Google/ Ipsos, Decoding Repurchase, AU, IN, ID, JP, KR, VN, 2023, n=1500 per market, Buyers of Home appliances, Personal care, Health and wellbeing products.&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Three Ways To Use The Customer Perspective As A Measure Of Success - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM ZOHO]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/06/three-ways-to-use-the-customer-perspective-as-a-measure-of-success]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-358516&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/05/HBR_KPI-image.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;In business, you can&#39;t improve what you&#39;re not measuring—and today&#39;s organizations typically measure progress and success with key performance indicators (KPIs).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A successful business is synonymous with higher customer satisfaction, retention, and overall brand reputation. So it&#39;s no surprise that most companies rank customer experience as their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;top business priority&lt;/a>;. But all too often, in their mission to track and quantify progress, business leaders end up prioritizing processes that directly oppose customer-centric behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Traditional KPIs include measures of profitability, productivity, and process efficiency—all of which are internal metrics. Analyzing these metrics can undoubtedly give indications of overall performance. But when prioritized above all else, they risk missing the bigger picture of how a business can provide the most value to customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers are increasingly deriving value from their interactions and experiences with a brand. Eighty-three percent of consumers pay as much attention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://khoros.com/resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;how brands treat them&lt;/a>; as they do to the products, and 89% report &lt;a href=&quot;https://harris-interactive.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;switching to a competitor&lt;/a>; following a poor experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So as experience becomes a more important measure of performance, the most successful companies are creating emotional connections at every touchpoint. With today&#39;s consumers firmly in the driver&#39;s seat, business leaders need to have the right tools, processes, and overall customer-centric culture to stay in the game.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Customer Value as a KPI&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Although efficiency, productivity, and profitability will continue to be important, customer value is rapidly becoming the real star of the analytics show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, measuring customer value is more complex than tracking traditional KPIs. Factors such as social value, brand cachet, and the emotional experience a service or product provides come into play—all of which are harder to quantify with standard methods.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s how to shift your KPI scorecard toward customer value to set yourself up for success.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Establish which KPIs will give you rich, customer-centric data.&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Customer engagement metrics are useful at this stage, helping you allocate your resources better and establish standards to monitor and assess—and, crucially, understand—how your customer views you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good range of customer engagement metrics include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Customer satisfaction score &lt;/strong>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Measuring your customer satisfaction score tells you how happy a customer was with their last interaction with your company and gives you a chance to improve based on their feedback. Net promoter score is a similar metric you can use to measure the customer experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Churn rate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Your churn rate reflects the percentage of customers who stop doing business with you during a specific period. Although customers leave for a variety of reasons, you need to know whether there is a consistent theme so you can address the cause.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Customer lifetime value&lt;/strong>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This KPI ties nicely into churn. Your customer lifetime value score will give you the expected revenue your company can generate from a customer, helping you estimate the future return from marketing initiatives.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Let customer value take center stage with customer performance indicators.&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;KPIs are a great place to start, but it can be too easy to get lost in the numbers and distracted from what matters to customers. Another approach to measuring success is to supplement these metrics with customer performance indicators (CPIs).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many companies confuse KPIs with CPIs. Although KPIs can be an effective measure of sentiment, there&#39;s still a risk that KPIs overlook what&#39;s relevant to customers. KPIs are intrinsically linked to a company&#39;s goals, but CPIs focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/customer-performace-indicators-surbhit-suman-banga&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;what customers care about the most&lt;/a>;, such as value and satisfaction, which lead to loyalty and retention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ongoing dialogue with your customers is the best way to get the most out of your CPIs. Ask them what value they derive from your business, what keeps them coming back, and what influences their purchases. Ask, listen, design, implement—and then ask again.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Bring together the right metrics, the right tools, and the right mindset.&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;This continuous loop of monitoring and adjusting requires a more sophisticated approach than isolated measurement tools collecting data from single touchpoints. Unlocking value from customer-centric data requires an analytics platform that can integrate, extract, and synthesize data from across the software stack.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customer-relationship management (CRM) technology with agile, intuitive analytics features can yield results far beyond what managers see in their organization-wide tableau setup. A 360-degree view of your business empowers you to make bigger decisions based on granular detail.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging your measurement of success from traditional KPIs risks creating a situation in which teams are motivated to perform aggressive sales tactics to achieve their targets, which can be destructive to good customer relationships. Complementing these metrics with CPIs cultivates a different type of accountability, encouraging teams to achieve customer satisfaction above all else—which can lead to better retention and more revenue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;The Experience of Customer Experience&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Always remember that customer experience is just that: an experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers are less interested in your brand than you are. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2019/11/21/consumers-are-hungry-for-an-experience-based-connection-with-your-brand/?sh=2974384358fe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;They&#39;re focused on their own experience&lt;/a>;. To truly measure your brand&#39;s impact on their lives, you need to look past individual touchpoints and evaluate their holistic experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this is about more than just the numbers, the only way to know whether you&#39;re hitting the mark is with data.

But harnessing the power of emerging technology requires a new approach. Unlike traditional methods for innovation, such as design thinking, ChatGPT poses a fundamentally different challenge because there are no clear problems to address, user pain points to alleviate, or KPIs to achieve. In fact, ChatGPT can seemingly solve problems in almost any industry, domain, or context. Using it, therefore, requires a different skill: emergent thinking, which involves generating ideas for innovation without fully understanding the problem that needs to be solved.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/discovering-where-chatgpt-can-create-value-for-your-company?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/discovering-where-chatgpt-can-create-value-for-your-company?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When OpenAI released its flagship product ChatGPT last November, it reached 1 million users in only four days and 100 million users in two months, achieving this milestone more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/&quot;>;75% faster than any other tech giant&lt;/a>;. ChatGPT has continued to evolve quickly, beginning as an AI chatbot that only responded to user prompts. Now it includes features such as analyzing data and interpreting images, leaving everyone from high school students to C-suite executives scrambling to learn ChatGPT so they can use it in new and productive ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the speed, scale, and scope of ChatGPT&#39;s impact may be unique, the underlying phenomenon — an emerging technology transforming vast parts of business and society — is not. But harnessing the power of emerging technology requires a new approach. Unlike traditional methods for innovation, such as &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/why-design-thinking-works&quot;>;design thinking&lt;/a>;, ChatGPT poses a fundamentally different challenge because there are no clear problems to address, user pain points to alleviate, or KPIs to achieve. In fact, ChatGPT can seemingly solve problems in almost any industry, domain, or context. Using it, therefore, requires a different skill: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326964001_An_Integrated_Model_of_Dynamic_Problem_Solving_Within_Organizational_Constraints&quot;>;emergent thinking&lt;/a>;, which involves generating ideas for innovation without fully understanding the problem that needs to be solved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two of us (Johnathan and Jennifer) recently conducted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886923001289&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; showing that the main thought process for this style of innovation is to start by understanding the core functions of a technology, &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; explore how it can be used to solve problems across different domains. Other hallmarks of emergent thinking include evaluating ideas without understanding the criteria for success, improvising ideas with little preparation or planning, and changing a project&#39;s target outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These activities tend to run counter to good business practices promoting efficiency and reliability, and they may even violate some of the core tenets of design thinking — namely the need to identify a clear user problem to address &lt;em>;before&lt;/em>; generating ideas for a solution. Yet, they&#39;re also critical when trying to leverage ChatGPT (or any other emerging technology, for that matter) for innovation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many companies have already started integrating ChatGPT into their products, processes, and services. By analyzing this burgeoning landscape of innovation, we&#39;ve identified three emergent-thinking pathways for leaders that can help increase the chances of implementing ChatGPT successfully while also avoiding potential pitfalls.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Pathway 1: Exploiting a Current Value Proposition&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The first pathway involves using ChatGPT to further exploit a value proposition a company already provides to customers. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/instacart-could-do-worse-than-incinerating-32-bln-2023-03-01/&quot;>;Instacart has grown to $2.5 billion in annual revenue&lt;/a>; by focusing on the core value proposition of providing fast, reliable, and affordable grocery delivery to customers at home. Recently, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/instacart-chatgpt/&quot;>;launched a plugin for ChatGPT&lt;/a>; that aims to strengthen this value proposition by increasing the speed and efficiency of ordering groceries online. With this plugin, customers can receive recommendations for meals to prepare, and once they find something they like, ChatGPT will create a new Instacart order that automatically adds all the necessary ingredients.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To pursue this pathway for innovation, start by using ChatGPT without directing it toward any specific customer problems. This thought process can be challenging because most business training teaches us to be strategic thinkers and verify the importance of customer problems before spending any time developing solutions. However, starting with strategic goals like this can actually blind us to seeing ChatGPT&#39;s potential for new and valuable applications. Instead, start with an open mind and deeply engage with the tool to understand its core functions. Once you have that understanding, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733320301463&quot;>;natural human cognition will take over&lt;/a>; and start making connections to any relevant problems you might be aware of.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, one of the core functions of ChatGPT is to interpret and generate natural language text that provides human-like responses to a wide variety of questions, prompts, and requests. Companies can use this function to enhance existing features of products or services that focus specifically on text-based interactions with customers. For instance, the product-management tool Notion now provides customers with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/product/ai&quot;>;immediate access to ChatGPT&lt;/a>; at the tap of the spacebar, which activates a prompt to receive an AI response that can be immediately integrated into existing tasks and workflows. As the functions of ChatGPT continue to grow, new possibilities will emerge for how it can be used to further enhance value propositions across a wider range of companies and contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Pathway 2: Expanding the Value Proposition&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A second pathway uses ChatGPT to expand a company&#39;s value proposition by solving new problems for customers in a way that complements their current offering. For example, Khan Academy was created in 2006 with the mission of providing all students with a free, world-class education. They&#39;ve since grown to nearly 20 million users per month, primarily by offering short online videos that start with a blank canvas and get filled with colorful, hand-written text. Recently, they integrated ChatGPT into their platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.khanacademy.org/sal-khans-2023-ted-talk-ai-in-the-classroom-can-transform-education/&quot;>;by creating a personalized AI tutor called Khanmigo&lt;/a>;. This tool not only helps students by guiding them through online videos and practice questions more effectively, but it can also help teachers by explaining teaching methods and designing lesson plans.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can follow the same pathway by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335242871_Matthew_A_Cronin_and_Jeffrey_Loewenstein_The_Craft_of_Creativity&quot;>;clearly defining your perspective and learning how to change it&lt;/a>;. For emergent thinking, this first involves breaking down a value proposition into three core elements:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;The goals customers are trying to accomplish&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The context in which customers are trying to accomplish those goals&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The specific target demographic of the customers&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Once defined, the next step is to assess how ChatGPT&#39;s core functions (see Pathway 1) can help expand each element in new directions. For example, Khan Academy originally focused on &lt;em>;helping&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;K–12 students&lt;/em>; (target demographic) &lt;em>;learn topics at a self-guided pace&lt;/em>; (goal), &lt;em>;done&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;completely online &lt;/em>;(context). Using ChatGPT, they expanded this goal for students by facilitating online learning either through self-guided practice or via an AI tutor, and they also expanded the target demographic to include teachers, helping them accomplish new goals that were not previously possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This two-step definition and expansion process offers a complementary skillset to design thinking, which typically encourages people to think of many different solutions before converging on one to implement. With emergent thinking, however, you apply those same &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/better-brainstorming&quot;>;brainstorming techniques&lt;/a>; to the problem, rather than the solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this process, it&#39;s key to maintain an open mind and avoid settling on a problem too quickly, which may be particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228198146_Performance_Pressure_as_a_Double-Edged_Sword_Enhancing_Team_Motivation_While_Undermining_the_Use_of_Team_Knowledge&quot;>;challenging to do in conditions of uncertainty&lt;/a>;. ChatGPT has unleashed an unprecedented level of pressure on companies to act quickly, or else suffer dramatic consequences for their future survival. However, research shows it&#39;s also possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jpo/article-abstract/7/1/2/5707381&quot;>;withstand these pressures and explore a wider range of innovation options&lt;/a>;. To do that, work with trusted collaborators so you can navigate ambiguity more effectively and take greater risks together.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Pathway 3: Exploring a New Value Proposition&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The final pathway is based on using ChatGPT to explore a completely new value proposition that customers may not even know they need yet. Although this may run counter to traditional methods for innovation, it also aligns with common advice for creating breakthroughs. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-05-25/steve-jobs-theres-sanity-returning&quot;>;when Steve Jobs was asked&lt;/a>; whether Apple did any market research when developing the iMac, he responded: “It&#39;s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don&#39;t know what they want until you show it to them.” This wisdom seems to have been fully embraced by OpenAI, which released ChatGPT to the public and is now discovering countless ways it can be used in various contexts to accomplish new and unforeseen goals. This pathway for innovation represents the purest form of emergent thinking, which has the greatest uncertainty and therefore must also be pursued with the greatest caution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main challenge comes when trying to converge on a single problem to focus on out of the many dozens identified when brainstorming different goals, contexts, and target demographics (see Pathway 2). When organizations have relatively clearer value propositions — such as increasing the speed of online ordering at Instacart or improving the quality of online education at Khan Academy — it can be easier to filter out problems that seem far-fetched or unlikely to reflect valuable customer needs. However, when customer needs are still unknown and emerging along with the technology, it becomes difficult for teams to agree on a shared direction to pursue. This becomes especially challenging when trying to include the diverse perspectives that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/smarter-collaboration-a-new-approach-to-breaking-down-barriers-and-transforming-work/10535&quot;>;fundamental to innovation&lt;/a>;, because team members can pull the project in different directions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Teaming-Lessons-Cross-Sector-Leadership/dp/1786354500&quot;>;despite their best intentions to collaborate&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help overcome these challenges, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2343944&quot;>;identify a clear and coherent analogy&lt;/a>; that summarizes the core value proposition. For example, Tome is a startup that&#39;s using ChatGPT to help customers create better presentations out of online documents, videos, and digital content. However, instead of highlighting all the specific benefits they can provide, they&#39;ve described their product as an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230427180425/https:/beta.tome.app/&quot;>;AI storytelling partner&lt;/a>;.” This simple concept helps integrate many different features into a coherent product experience so that both developers and customers can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234021855_When_Is_a_New_Thing_a_Good_Thing_Technological_Change_Product_Form_Design_and_Perceptions_of_Value_for_Product_Innovations&quot;>;easily understand its value&lt;/a>;. By creating an analogy for your product, you can avoid wasting valuable resources creating features that might not support the core value proposition, and you can help customers develop a clear mental model of the various features and why they can be useful.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;ChatGPT is an unprecedented technology that has potential to unlock value for millions of customers across many industries. However, pursuing these rewards also comes with considerable risks, as we&#39;re all entering uncharted territory with AI, and we must learn how to use it effectively so it can be leveraged for positive rather than negative outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 09 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
