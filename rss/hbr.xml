Brooks 是畅销书作家、哈佛大学教授，也是《大西洋月刊》的一位广受读者欢迎的专栏作家，他的文章取材于科学和哲学，旨在为我们如何过上最好的生活提供见解和策略。他与奥普拉·温弗瑞 (Oprah Winfrey) 合着了即将出版的新书《构建你想要的生活：获得幸福的艺术与科学》，并与《哈佛商业评论》编辑阿迪·伊格内修斯 (Adi Ignatius) 共同创作了本集新工作世界分享如何在工作和生活中获得快乐的见解。事实证明，幸福是会传染的。但痛苦也是如此。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/harvards-arthur-c- brooks-on-the-secrets-to-happiness-at-work?language=es&quot;>;西班牙语阅读&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/harvards-arthur-c-brooks-on -the-secrets-to-happiness-at-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;对于那里的奋斗者和工作狂，畅销书作家、哈佛大学教授阿瑟·C·布鲁克斯 (Arthur C. Brooks) 说：给你的信息：在为时已晚之前改变你的行为。布鲁克斯就是你们中的一员：一位设定节奏的老板，他希望其他人像他一样每周工作 80 小时，几乎没有时间陪伴朋友和家人。他说他不是对工作上瘾，而是对成功上瘾。他怀念看着自己的孩子长大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，他将像他这样的行为归类为一种可能导致痛苦的病态。他还提供了具体、可行的建议来增加您的生活幸福感。事实上，他&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;在&lt;em>;大西洋月刊&lt;/em>;的常规专栏&lt;/a>;中撰写了相关文章.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我们的视频系列“工作新世界”的这一集中，《哈佛商业评论》主编阿迪·伊格纳修斯与布鲁克斯（与奥普拉·温弗瑞）共同撰写了即将出版的新书《&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot;>;&lt;em>;打造你想要的生活：变得更幸福的艺术与科学&lt;/em>;&lt;/a >;、讨论：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;是什么导致过去几年总体幸福感严重下降？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;在工作中找到真正快乐的人的两个特质&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “交易朋友”和“真正的朋友”之间的区别。真正的人“非常无用”，你比交易朋友更需要他们&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;布鲁克斯说，幸福是会传染的，只要和一个快乐的人在一起就能让你更快乐。 “但是，”他说，“痛苦更具传染性。”&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亚瑟，欢迎。&lt;/p>;

&lt; p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然。事实上，这本书是基于我在哈佛商学院教授的很多内容，我教授的课程名为“领导力与幸福”，这是一个非常超额认购的课程。它有 180 个座位，400 个等候名单，甚至还有一个他们认为我不知道的秘密 Zoom 链接。我很高兴与我的学生以及我们精彩的观众谈论我所谈论的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我希望有一些学生们听到你知道 Zoom 链接时感到震惊。但让我们设置一些背景。从一些数据开始。数据显示，尽管幸福产业蓬勃发展，但像您这样思考这个问题的人却认为我们变得越来越不幸福。&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/follow-subscribe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C·布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确实如此。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至少在美国，抑郁症病例数量有所增加，自我报告自己快乐的人数也有所增加已下降。我知道不可能确切地说出原因，但你的预感是什么？这是怎么回事？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C·布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们确实很清楚发生了什么。你会发现，在 80 年代末、90 年代初，幸福感开始变得有点萎靡，有点下降，但随着社交媒体的出现，幸福感出现了真正的大幅下降。&lt;/p>; &lt;社交媒体对幸福感来说是灾难性的。部分原因是，当我们感到孤独时，我们会用一些类似于社交生活中的汉堡和薯条的东西来分散自己的注意力。它们给你提供大量卡路里，但营养不多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这背后有很多神经科学，但每个人都知道，当你感到无聊或孤独时，你就会开始查看你的设备，然后你的手机，你实际上会变得更无聊，你会变得更孤独。这是一个巨大的问题，特别是对于年轻人来说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后冠状病毒出现了，这是我们长期以来在全球范围内看到的对公众幸福最灾难性的事件。通常，大约 30% 的人会说他们对自己的生活非常幸福，15% 的人会说他们不幸福。其余的都在中间。这些都被翻转了。现在大约有 30% 的人不快乐，15% 的人非常快乐。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些趋势实际上并没有扭转。我们知道它与社会生活息息相关。它与我们的爱情关系息息相关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们知道带来最幸福生活的习惯——你的哲学或信仰生活、你的家庭生活、你真正的友谊，以及亲自为他人服务的工作——这些已经在下降。当这些事情衰退时，没有任何技术可以解决问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你确实掌握了它。我想专注于工作世界。我认为这是从书中的统计数据得出的，我想你说只有 16% 的员工自我报告说他们对自己的工作非常满意。我想问这个问题是因为我们醒着的时间有一半是在办公室度过的，但我们却没有得到应有的成就感和满足感。那么这里发生了什么以及我们如何考虑改变现状？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C.布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我一直在研究什么能给人们带来工作满意度。时间最长，当我刚开始时，我还是一名新博士。我想，好吧，让我们看看营利性工作、非营利性工作和政府工作：哪个能带来最大的幸福？事实证明，这微不足道。所以我说，好吧，高薪与低薪。超过一定的生存水平，那就是洗钱了。受过大学教育，没有受过大学教育，白领，蓝领，这些都不重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最幸福的工人，即从工作中获得最大幸福感的人，会表现出两件事。他们觉得自己正在赢得成功，也就是说，他们正在用自己的生活和工作生活创造价值，他们的成就正在推动发展，他们因这些成就而受到认可。第二，他们觉得自己在为人们服务，所以他们是被需要的。这是两件大事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在很多人都在关注我们，他们都是雇主，我也曾担任过首席执行官。为了招聘、留住人才，你能做的第一件事就是确保你有一个系统，让人们通过自己的优点和个人成就来获得成功，而最终的回报远远超出了金钱的范围。他们知道这一点，他们看到了这一点，他们的朋友也是如此。他们实际上感觉自己正在为其他人服务，并且他们可以看到他们正在为之创造价值的人们的面孔。这些都是大事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一件事要记住，当我们面对面时，这些事情是最容易做的。就是这样。你说我们一生的一半时间都是在工作中与同事度过的。好吧，我不知道，伙计，不再了。很多人一生的一半时间都在 Zoom 屏幕前度过，在那里你很难获得成功，很难感觉自己在为别人服务，甚至看不到你的工作伙伴。这是很难的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你是对的，那么这里一定有一些自欺欺人。如果你问人们，他们喜欢混合动力。他们喜欢在家工作。他们谈论这让他们更好地平衡工作与生活，我们认为所有这些都会转化为满足感和幸福感。但你认为我们在欺骗自己吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C·布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在某种程度上，存在一系列偏见在起作用这里。例如，我们发现的一件事是，当你真的感到孤独时，它会损害你大脑的执行中枢。我们知道这一点。这就是为什么当你真的感到悲伤和孤独时，你会窝在沙发上，盖上舒适的毯子，看 Netflix 视频，吃哈根达斯。你应该做的是起床，到外面去获取一些维生素 D，骑自行车，给你的朋友打电话，但你在那个特定时刻受到了损害。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在大流行期间，人们开始变得更加孤立。我不得不说，他们充分利用了这种隔离，创造了非常非常方便的生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，有些人确实有更好的工作与生活平衡，因为他们想把这一切都花掉与家人共度时光。问题在于，所有与家人和朋友分离的人实际上都看不到工作中的人，这对幸福来说确实是灾难性的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这本书在很多方面都是关于代理的：幸福和满足感不是基于外部变量或发生在我们身上的事情，而是完全在我们的控制范围内。问题是很难采取戏剧性的行动来重新安排一个人的生活。如何让人们明白他们应该这样做，但谁不这样做呢？你如何实现这一飞跃？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C·布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;部分问题在于，很多人注意到他们可以管理自己的资金他们可以管理自己的公司，但无法管理自己的感情。或者他们可以管理自己的家，可以管理自己的家庭生活，但他们无法管理自己的情绪。原因是情感生活是一个不同种类的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们工作中周围的事情，这些都是复杂的问题，这意味着它们很难弄清楚。但是一旦你这样做了，你就可以掌握它们并一遍又一遍地重复解决方案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生活和你的情绪，内心的事情和你所得到的感受，无论是积极的还是消极的，它们都会”一点也不复杂。它们就是数学家所说的复杂问题。这是一个非常容易理解的问题，没有任何计算能力可以为您解决它。你只能进入其中、体验它并实时处理它。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;猫是一个复杂的问题。烤面包机是一个复杂的问题。你的工作更像是烤面包机，而你的人际关系则更像是一只猫。你的感受非常复杂。结果是，我可以掌握所有这些高度复杂的事情，但我无法专注于自己的感受。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决方案始于理解人类情感科学。这就是我在很多工作中所做的事情。这就是我的哈佛商学院学生来找我的时候，这些才华横溢、成功的 MBA 学生，确实是在世界上最好的商学院。他们会说，“我最大的问题是我无法控制自己的感受，我觉得我真的失控了。”因此，我们获得的首要技能是像对待您要管理的其他任何东西一样对待您的情感系统、大脑边缘系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;将其视为您正在参与的复杂系统并使用我们在课堂上讨论的技术，这些技术基本上是从学习如何体验你的情绪开始的，不是当它们传递给你时，而是在你大脑的前额叶皮层中，这样你就可以决定如何反应，替代情绪，甚至无视情绪，而是故意的。这是一套称为元认知的特定技术，我基于尖端神经科学来介绍它。任何人都可以做到。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题是，我们不教孩子们这样做。我们不教小学生这样做。我们不教商人这样做。如果按照我的方式，每个商学院、每个高中都会有这个课程，当你来到大公司工作时，他们会开设元认知和情绪自我管理课程，你必须首先学习这些课程。一周的迎新活动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为，正如您所说，无论以何种标准衡量，这些商科学生都取得了令人难以置信的成功。可能存在分歧，但您是否发现他们渴望您所教的内容，或者他们对您所教的内容持怀疑态度？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C.布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/他们真的很渴望它。我的意思是，最持怀疑态度的人可能没有参加这门课。毕竟这是选修课。真正持怀疑态度的人来自供应链管理之类的领域。但事实是，他们真的渴望它，因为他们想要它。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的方法基本上是这样的：你可以更快乐，但你必须了解科学。你需要利用科学来改变你的习惯和生活方式，然后你需要将其传授给其他人，使其永久存在于你的生活中。这门课被称为“领导力与幸福”，因为我希望每个领导者都成为一名幸福老师。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我每年在哈佛以外的地方进行 175 场演讲，主要是与商业观众交谈。我说，“听着，我要给你看一堆关于幸福科学的幻灯片，我想让你做的就是拿着这些幻灯片，把我的名字去掉，写上你的名字，然后我想要你把它教给别人，这样你就能永久地理解这项技术，并且在自己的生活中也不会忘记它。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是完成它的方法。这就是我们在哈佛教授的方式，而且它确实非常有效。我告诉你，阿迪，坦率地说，我是这项工作中我自己的第一个病人。因为我想变得更快乐。作为一名社会科学家，我将自己的工具包应用于自己。我想成为一个更快乐的人。因为我一直在写关于幸福的科学，所以我在自己身上进行了实验，我在 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>; 中建议的一切我在&lt;em>;大西洋月刊&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;上的专栏以及我的学生，我首先要确保我确实相信它有效。我不仅仅是阅读学术期刊文章，然后将其传授给其他人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在过去四年中，我的幸福感提高了 60%。短短四年时间。可以肯定的是，它一开始的基线较低，但 60% 很大程度上是基于幸福感的最佳测量技术。所以我知道它是有效的，而且我每天也在我的学生中看到它的结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让我们继续关注沙发多一点。你给人的印象是一个积极的、大概是快乐的人。我知道第一印象可能会有所偏差，但即使是“我的幸福感提高了 60%”这句话，我也无法想象你到底在衡量什么才能得出这样一个具体的数字。有哪些测量值？您的数字为何发生变化以及如何变化？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C·布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人们可以参加一些一般幸福感调查。它们遍布互联网。如果他们的心理测量能力强，他们就能做得很好。然而，我喜欢看的是我将情感中的消极和积极强度水平分开。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;情感意味着情绪。我们发现，如果你有一点不适，如果你是一个忧郁的人，要么你的快乐水平太低，要么你的不快乐水平太高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，它似乎我在这里吹毛求疵，但我没有。很多人认为幸福和不幸福是相反的：如果你不幸福，就意味着你缺乏幸福。这是完全错误的。快乐和不快乐，或者积极和消极的情绪，它们很大程度上存在于大脑的不同半球。它们的产生有不同的原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;恐惧、愤怒、厌恶和悲伤等负面情绪，这些情绪是为了让你活下去而进化出来的。你应该非常非常感谢你的负面情绪。但如果它们太强烈，就会损害您的生活质量。你的快乐、爱和对事物的兴趣等积极情绪，这些都是进化而来的，它们确实是值得拥有的好东西。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题是有些人的幸福水平太低。其他人，他们的不快乐程度太高了。我有一个对我的学生进行的测试。我没有开发它。它是由心理测量学家在大约 20 年前开发的。但这被称为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://psytests.org/emo/panasen.html&quot;>;PANAS 测试&lt;/a>;，即积极情绪消极情绪系列，它可以区分积极情绪和消极情绪的强度.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，你有四种不同的特征。你可以高度积极，也可以高度消极。你可以是低积极的，也可以是低消极的。你可以是高积极和低消极，当然你也可以是高消极和低积极。他们各占人口的四分之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高，高，这是一个高情感的人，它被称为疯狂科学家。这就是我。我的幸福问题不是我不快乐或者我不够快乐。相反，这只是意味着我需要管理我的高水平负面情绪。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其他人有不同的问题。每个人都希望自己的积极性高，消极性低。这就是所谓的啦啦队长。事实证明啦啦队也有问题。例如，如果两个拉拉队队员相遇并结婚，他们将无法承受任何威胁或听到任何坏消息或认为将来可能会发生任何不好的事情。他们会花光所有的钱并破产。拉拉队长，他们往往是相当不稳定的首席执行官，因为他们不会听坏消息，而且他们往往会被威胁消灭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高消极，低积极，这些都是诗人。他们往往非常有创造力，但他们经常遭受悲伤和这些负面情绪的困扰。他们必须处理好这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，低，低，这些人并不是非常不快乐或生活质量低下。他们的影响强度较低。这些是法官。这些人都是清醒的人。他们是伟大的外科医生，他们是伟大的诉讼律师和法官。他们是青少年、高压力职业等的优秀父母。但他们往往看起来有点不热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我给我的学生做这些测试，这样他们就可以知道该嫁给谁，如何管理自己，如何管理自己。围绕他们建立一个与他们互补的管理团队。这真的非常非常有启发性，这是我衡量自己幸福感的方法之一，也是我需要的管理技巧，将神经科学应用于我的生活，并且我可以将其应用到其他人的生活中。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们需要在多大程度上快乐地工作？我的意思是，一种工作方式可以是我这样做，我希望赚到体面的钱来养活自己，并且我专注于我的个人发展，关注工作之外的幸福。显然，在一个理想的世界里，我们到处都是快乐和满足的，但我们需要在工作中快乐吗？这有多重要？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿瑟·C·布鲁克斯：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个关于生活质量高的人是否倾向于工作快乐或者没关系。事实上，如果你在工作中不快乐，你的生活也可能会不快乐。这很简单。我的意思是，就像没有人每天工作一个小时一样。也许您是每周工作四小时的幸运者之一。我的朋友 Tim Ferriss 写了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357&quot;>;那本著名的书&lt;/a>;，事实是，很多人可以在比他们少得多的时间内完成工作。但我们大多数人都没有这样的奢侈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我的整个职业生涯中，我每周工作 80 个小时，其中一部分是一种病态。我不会骗你，我在研究中谈论了很多关于自我客体化、工作狂的话题，这些都是基于成功成瘾和对失败的恐惧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所有人都在观看，你们知道我也在谈论你。因此，要小心这些病症，因为它们和其他任何事情一样都是成瘾的，并且其中有很多大脑化学反应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但关键是，你将花费大量时间来做这件事。如果这是苦差事，那就糟糕了。你不想做苦差事。 At very least it should be something that&#39;s pleasant and making it pleasant sometimes it&#39;s completely out of our grasp. If you have a job that you truly hate and a boss who&#39;s just the worst, well, that&#39;s no good. But a lot of it is in our hands, and this is a lot of what I&#39;m working on and what I&#39;m trying to help people understand they can actually manage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You just mentioned workaholism. I think many of us suspect we suffer from it, but maybe aren&#39;t willing to look too closely at whether that&#39;s true. But the workaholism is a high, we get a sense of who we are, a sense of accomplishment, etc. But surely it&#39;s not fully a good thing. What is your advice to workaholics who may not realize that that is what they are?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To begin with, workaholism is actually horrible for your quality of life. The problem is that when you&#39;re a workaholic, people congratulate you. Nobody says, “Man, you are so good at drinking gin.” Nobody ever says, “Dude, you&#39;re unbelievable at how much methamphetamine you can consume.” These are not compliments. People feel sorry for you when you&#39;re addicted to other substances or gambling or pornography or anything else that&#39;s deleterious, dangerous, and addictive, that captures your brain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But workaholism, man, you work all night, you work 100-hour weeks, people are like, “Dude, you&#39;re killing it.” And you&#39;re like, “Yeah, I feel so good about myself, but how come I can&#39;t maintain a proper relationship?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The truth of the matter is that there are really a portfolio of four things that go into having a truly happy life, and they need to be in both in abundance and in balance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Number one is faith and philosophy, whether it&#39;s religious or not religious, it has to be something that zooms you out on the majesty of life and makes you small so that you have yourself in perspective. You&#39;re going to have peace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, you&#39;ve got to be paying serious attention to your family relationship. No joke, family relationships are the most mystical kind of love, and you can&#39;t substitute anything for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your friendships, now, this is a really bad one for workaholics. Workaholics have a lot of deal friends, but not very many real friends. Everybody watching us knows the difference between real and deal. And if you don&#39;t, take the fellow workaholics, take the 10 people that you see most and spend most of your time with and write real or deal after each one, and see for yourself that you need to tune this up. Deal friends are useful, real friends are beautifully useless to you. Do you have enough useless people? That&#39;s the question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least is work. The two parts of work that really matter are not title, not money, not admiration, not power, [but] earned success and serving other people. Workaholism militates against these sources of fulfillment in our lives. It impoverishes. It makes us poorer so that we actually can&#39;t pursue these other pillars. The result is we just don&#39;t have a balanced portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look, if everything you do for your happiness is work, that&#39;s like putting your entire pension into Greek bonds. It might work out, but I&#39;m an economist. I don&#39;t recommend it. That&#39;s not a diversified strategy. You&#39;re most likely not going to retire the way you want to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Saudi Arabia, it&#39;s a simple, intriguing question. Is happiness contagious?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, happiness is absolutely contagious because social contagion is a real thing. There&#39;s a really great study, Adi, more or less in our neighborhood, they&#39;re called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/&quot;>;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a>; from Framingham, Massachusetts. It looks over 50 years. It was set up to look at people&#39;s lives, at how different social aspects of life are contagious for physical stuff, whether obesity is socially contagious, etc. But they started to look at other things like happiness, and they found that just being in the vicinity of a happy person makes you happier. Having your spouse get happier makes you happier. Having your best friend get happier makes you a lot happier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even more contagious is misery. That&#39;s the reason you don&#39;t want your teenage kids to hang out with a kid who wears all black and looks bummed all the time. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s like, “Oh, that sucks. Everything sucks.” You don&#39;t want that because that&#39;s so socially contagious that your kid is going to become unbelievably negative and become sad. And nobody wants this for their children because they have a sense of the social contagion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number one issue that I see in family dynamics is a social contagion of negativity. That&#39;s what each one of us has to turn around, is to try to inject the happiness virus into our family and to basically do it on purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a question from Nepal that picks up on your themes. You&#39;ve talked about people taking agency in their own life and their own fulfillment and sense of happiness. But how should we deal with people in leadership who don&#39;t believe in any of this stuff, who don&#39;t believe in work-life balance? You can work on yourself, but as you said, misery and all this stuff is contagious. How can you move the needle on leadership that doesn&#39;t appreciate any of this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to leadership, leader lead thyself. Your number one employee is you. Don&#39;t be the pace-setting leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember when Daniel Goleman wrote that famous book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Results-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/1633692620&quot;>;&lt;em>;Leadership That Gets Results&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;? It was about the six types of leaders, and the number one leadership characteristic that everybody thinks is great—but is actually horrible—is workaholic pace-setting leaders that are in the office all the time and saying, “Look, if I&#39;m going to ask people to work hard, I have to work even harder.” It&#39;s incredibly dispiriting for other people. It lowers their quality of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a CEO, I&#39;m telling you, somebody on my executive team says, “Arthur, you got to stop sending email at 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM because people are going to stay up wondering if they&#39;re going to have to answer your email.” I said, “I don&#39;t expect anybody to…” That&#39;s not the point. So I put timers on my email to do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even better was when my wife started clamping down and saying, “You need to sleep more. You need to go to the gym more. You need to have more of a life.” So number one, if you&#39;re a leader, you need to get a hold on this problem because you&#39;re going to be hurting yourself, wrecking your relationships, and disheartening all the people around you. This is a big problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, don&#39;t work for a workaholic. Don&#39;t work for them if you can. And again, not everybody&#39;s got all these degrees of freedom, but most of us have a few choices in what we can do for work. And by the way, if it turns out that your boss is abusing you and hopelessly addicted to drugs, you got to change circumstances. That&#39;s an abusive relationship. I recommend steering clear of workaholics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, what&#39;s behind workaholism, fellow workaholics? It&#39;s the success addiction. Workaholism is a secondary addiction to the addiction of success, and a lot of that&#39;s based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/10/howto-arthurbrooks-happiness-identity-drshefali-mindfulness-meaning-2021/620282/&quot;>;objectification of yourself&lt;/a>;, which is a bad thing to do, and a deep, deep set of fear of failure. Those are the things to actually start working on. You can&#39;t just say, “Work less, what&#39;s the problem?” It&#39;s self-objectification and fear of failure, almost always.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you think of new entries to the workforce, and some of them are your HBS students who are working for investment banks, who are working for law firms, and there is this expectation of exploitation where, yes, I&#39;m working around the clock. It is killing me, but it is getting me to where I will be rich, fulfilled, happy. How can people who are ambitious in those fields do otherwise?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that I tell my students is you&#39;ve got to have a balanced happiness portfolio, and killing all of your relationships to spend 110 hours in an investment bank is the worst, most unbalanced happiness portfolio you can possibly get. Plus, you&#39;re losing your best years to establish the relationships that you&#39;re going to want to cultivate for the rest of your life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People say, “Okay, I&#39;m 28. I&#39;m going to go get an investment bank job, they&#39;re going to expect me to work a hundred hours a week. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll look for a spouse when I&#39;m 35.” Probably not. I got the data, and the data don&#39;t lie. You&#39;re more and more likely to actually not have the thing that&#39;s going to give you the most happiness in your life, which is your marriage. We actually have to think in a balanced-portfolio approach to the happiness that we&#39;re trying to get, and making those sacrifices are really bad sacrifices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, guys like you and me, our age, in our fifties, you notice that we don&#39;t make those sacrifices anymore. And the reason is because our time parameters are shorter. But also we&#39;ve had bitter experience with these types of things. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s like I&#39;m a grandfather now and my grandson was born and suddenly I was a lot less interested in working. But part of it was the bitter experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ll tell you a story actually that will motivate this. When I was interviewing this woman for my last book, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Finding-Success-Happiness-Purpose-ebook/dp/B08WCKY8MB&quot;>;&lt;em>;From Strength to Strength&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, about how to get happier as you get older, a titan of Wall Street. This woman was just famous and rich, a billionaire, and she was horribly unhappy. She was my age, late fifties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What&#39;s wrong?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “Well, my husband and I were roommates. I&#39;m kind of cordial with my adult kids, but it&#39;s not close. I&#39;m getting bad reports from the doctor. I think I drink too much. I need to go to the gym. My employees are starting to doubt the wisdom of my decision-making. And I don&#39;t know, what do I do?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What do you mean? You don&#39;t need a Harvard professor to tell you what to do. You&#39;re prescribing to yourself, stepping back, going away with your husband. You&#39;re already rich. Why don&#39;t you do that?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “It&#39;s true, but I guess I&#39;ve always chosen to be special rather than happy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boom, man. It was like a knife to my heart, Adi. All these years when I was running a company and the 14th hour at the office before the first hour with my kids, well, news flash man, they grew up. They grew up and I missed a lot of it. And I really, really regret that. Now I&#39;m not going to miss it with my grandkids, I get a do-over. I&#39;m not going to screw that up twice. That&#39;s a really important thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I could have had a little bit more perspective, I would not have been less successful. The data don&#39;t lie on this either. The 14th hour is not productive. It&#39;s just compulsive. Just like any other addiction, the 14th drink doesn&#39;t give you more joy. Stop at two, is the bottom line, because you need the balance in this part of your life as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At HBR we try to be super practical, so before you go, can you leave the audience shortcuts to happiness, or just things that viewers can think about or do today that can be a meaningful step in that direction?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in the Atlantic&lt;/a>;, every Thursday morning, I have a big topic and I do talk about the science, but then I always give three ways to live this thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just in general, since we&#39;re on the meta topic of happiness, the way to think about happiness is that it&#39;s not a feeling. If happiness were a feeling, that would be very disappointing. It would depend on how you slept last night and what you ate for breakfast and no good. If your spouse yelled at you this morning, no good. Don&#39;t chase the feeling. Feelings are evidence of happiness, like the smell of the turkey is evidence of your Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is three things that we need to be thinking about and managing in our lives. Enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose. Those are the three big things that we need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enjoyment is not pleasure, pleasure is an animal thing. Enjoyment is the pleasure you get plus the people that you enjoy it with and the memories that you&#39;re making. That&#39;s why beer commercials don&#39;t have a guy alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack. They have people enjoying a few beers together because it&#39;s pleasure plus people plus memory. Don&#39;t do the stuff that makes you feel good alone. That&#39;s the rule of thumb.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second is satisfaction. Satisfaction is the joy you get when you struggle for something and you get that. Now fellow strivers, the striver&#39;s curse is you get on something called the hedonic treadmill where you struggle and struggle and achieve it, but then it doesn&#39;t give you very much satisfaction for very long and so you keep trying and trying and trying again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution to that is not to have more, it&#39;s to want less. Your satisfaction is your haves divided by your wants. Manage your denominator with a wants-management strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least, it&#39;s meaning, it&#39;s purpose in your life. The way to figure out if you have a purpose crisis is asking yourself two simple questions. There&#39;s no right answers, but you have to have answers. “Why am I alive, and for what am I willing to die today?” And if you don&#39;t have answers, go looking for the answers with introspection. When you see somebody that finds those answers, it&#39;s like an actual miracle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the three things practically to think about. “Do I have enjoyment or just pleasure? Am I managing my wants or my haves, so I can have satisfaction? And do I have enough meaning in my life by answering those two questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s great. I hope people took notes, I hope people try to act on that. Arthur, I want to thank you for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you, Adi. And thanks to everybody watching.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Incorporating DEI into Decision-Making]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_01_aJTiW00qqtI_5989933_B3UFXwcVbc4_3neSwyntbQ8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Most people believe in promoting DEI in the workplace. But implicit and unconscious biases &amp;#8212; not to mention the constant juggling of priorities required at work &amp;#8212; can lead to inequitable decision-making. In this article, drawing on recent research, the authors suggest that this problem can be addressed by making DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, to managers immediately before they need to make consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation. The authors discuss three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Most people don&#39;t think of themselves as biased or prejudiced, and people often explicitly endorse diversity as something companies should strive for. But many organizations struggle with DEI. Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implicit or unconscious biases can lead to inequitable decision-making. More mundanely, people are just busy. They have lots of competing priorities and lots to occupy their brains. Even if they care about DEI, they might not have it top of mind as they go about their work. As a result, they might not see how their decisions are relevant for DEI and so might inadvertently make inequitable decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fix this, managers and organizations should make DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, when it matters most — that is, when consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation are being made. Our academic research and experiences partnering with companies suggest that to make real progress on DEI, managers and organizations need to make DEI salient in those moments of consequential decision-making. We&#39;ve identified three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Ask managers to hire for more than one job at a time. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many hiring decisions are made in isolation, with only one person being hired at a time. When this is the case, diversity simply just isn&#39;t that salient to decision-makers, who are often thinking not about diversity but instead about technical skills, cultural fit, or how quickly a candidate can start. This shouldn&#39;t be surprising, because diversity is a property of groups, not individuals. You can describe a group of people as “diverse” or “homogeneous,” after all, but not an individual person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, when people make collective hiring decisions — when they hire multiple people at a time — our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3533&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that people select more diversity. They start thinking about the candidates they&#39;re selecting as a group, which makes diversity more salient and leads to hiring decisions that improve it. For example, rather than hiring one person every month, a company might benefit from grouping these decisions together and hiring three people very quarter. The total number of people hired will be the same, but making collective decisions every quarter should lead to more diversity. Relatedly, it might also be beneficial to give one person oversight over hiring decisions across teams or departments, enabling that person to make collective hiring decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Ask managers to make diversity more salient in the promotion process. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This recommendation comes from work that we&#39;ve done at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morethannow.co.uk/single-post/2022/8/22/the-inclusion-lab&quot;>;Inclusion Lab at MoreThanNow&lt;/a>;, a collaboration of academics and consultants focused on generating empirical evidence about what actually works at improving DEI in the workplace. Specifically, it grows out of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/why-you-should-start-ab-testing-your-dei-initiatives&quot;>;field experiment&lt;/a>; we conducted with a global management, engineering, and development consultancy that wanted to know if we could help it increase equity in its promotions process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this company, promotions are made by a group of high-level senior managers in a bi-annual promotions process, during which managers can nominate their employees for promotion. Managers justify their nominations in a statement of 50 words or less in an online form. In our experiment, 116 of these senior managers were randomly assigned to receive one of two messages in advance of submitting their nominations. The control group was asked to consider promoting people who had displayed excellent performance and competence beyond their current grade. The treatment group was asked to consider the same criteria — but also to consider the diversity of their nominees as a whole, and whether their choices would help to close representation gaps. In other words, we made DEI more salient for this group of managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened when we did this? Although the sample for this experiment was small (which means some caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings), we found that making diversity salient increased the number of employees promoted from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. The effects seem to be driven by male senior managers, who at baseline may have been less likely to think spontaneously about diversity. We did not find any statistically significant positive or negative treatment effects on the promotion rates of female employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Ask managers to view a short diversity training video right before formal people decisions. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This suggestion uses salience to help organizations dramatically rethink how they implement diversity training. Prior research suggests that training is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/does-diversity-training-work-the-way-its-supposed-to&quot;>;largely ineffective at actually changing behavior&lt;/a>;. However, we think this may be because it doesn&#39;t make DEI salient in the moment of consequential decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In most organizations, people are given diversity training when they get onboarded, or perhaps on an annual basis. That&#39;s often months or years before they actually make consequential hiring, promotion, or performance-evaluation decisions for the company, which means they&#39;re extremely unlikely to have the messages of the training in mind when they make those decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine instead if an organization had managers take a short training immediately prior to making a consequential HR decision. Because the training happens just before the decision, it has a much higher likelihood of ensuring that DEI remains salient and encourage managers to make more equitable choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have evidence of exactly this finding from a field experiment that we at the Inclusion Lab have been conducting with Ericsson, a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Sweden. We delivered an automated 5-minute DEI training to some managers before they screened resumes and found that the managers who got this training were significantly more likely to hire people from underrepresented groups at Ericsson.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experiment suggests that the significant amount of time and cost we invest into DEI training can indeed pay off — but only when organizations choose the right moment for it. One-off “blanket” training may well not be the way forward. Instead, organizations may want to consider how to use repeated smaller training modules in advance of key decision points to make DEI salient and therefore effective. We see this as fertile ground for further experimentation in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most people really do want to do the right thing when it comes to DEI, but they often just need a nudge or prompt to keep DEI top of mind at the right time. Our research strongly suggests that managers and organizations can do this by making DEI more salient at moments of consequential decision-making.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are Collaboration Tools Overwhelming Your Team?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/are-collaboration-tools-overwhelming-your-team]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1494319608-2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;master1305/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Today&amp;#8217;s workers feel numbed by a fragmented, unpredictable, and overwhelming collection of collaboration tools &amp;#8212; the very things advertised to boost their productivity. They know they&amp;#8217;re overloaded and feel exhausted but believe there is little or nothing they can do to slow the onslaught of communication.

While doing that, many are also &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/08/how-much-time-and-energy-do-we-waste-toggling-between-applications&quot;>;toggling back and forth between applications&lt;/a>;, bouncing between pings on apps like Slack and Teams, comments on shared documents, and notifications from an array of company web portals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s no surprise then that today&#39;s workers feel numbed by a fragmented, unpredictable, and overwhelming collection of collaboration tools — trapped by the very things advertised to boost their productivity. They know they&#39;re overloaded and feel exhausted but believe there is little or nothing they can do to slow the onslaught of communication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We explored how collaboration technology bloat impacts employees and tried to help people take control over their work. We called our intervention the “collaboration cleanse.” Here we&#39;ll explore our findings (spoiler: there&#39;s good news and bad) and outline what leaders should do to simplify employees&#39; collaboration tool use.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Collaboration Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This “cleanse” was implemented by Asana&#39;s Work Innovation Lab, in concert with Amazon Web Services. We randomly assigned each of our 58 volunteers, which included both Asana and Amazon employees, into one of two groups. We asked all participants to report the collaboration technologies they use at least once a week for interacting with colleagues (for example, Slack, Figma, and Zoom). We also asked them to evaluate how well each tool helps them achieve their current work goals, as well as how much effort it takes to use each one. Finally, we asked them to choose specific technologies to refrain from using for two weeks. We asked people in the first group to stop using half of their collaboration tools for the two weeks. People in the second group could choose which and how many collaboration tools they eliminated. All participants told us which technologies they planned to set aside and kept daily diaries, recording any occasions when they strayed from their “approved” list.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This cleanse was inspired by research on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/the-friction-project/&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>;, including our prior interventions at the Work Innovation Lab that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/meeting-overload-is-a-fixable-problem&quot;>;helped people eliminate and redesign bad meetings&lt;/a>;. This research shows that people are prone to solving problems by heaping &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; complexity and burdens on themselves and others — even when subtraction is a more effective strategy. But prompting them to slow down and think about what they can and should remove from their work helps them overcome the instinct to add instead of &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/when-subtraction-adds-value&quot;>;subtract&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Good News: Participants Became More Aware of Their Digital Burdens&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As they embarked on this cleanse, participants in both groups became more aware of the digital clutter pervading their lives — clutter that they didn&#39;t think about much or at all and hadn&#39;t ever tried to reduce or remove. Forty-one percent reported (without prompting) that they became more mindful of the impact of using too many collaboration tools on their focus and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research scientist put it to us this way: “[The cleanse] made me much more aware of the different tools I was using and the impact that was having on my productivity and sense of focus. There is a subtle cost with switching tools, and that additional friction hurts my focus and productivity.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to reflecting more deeply on how they used their tools, participants also made small strides toward using fewer collaboration tools overall. More than half (53%) of participants told us they would use at least one tool less frequently as a result of their cleanse. They expected this conscious culling of their tech stack to free up their time and cognitive bandwidth for more focused work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A customer insights analyst told us the cleanse taught her to be more deliberate about when she uses some particularly distracting collaboration technologies (eg, messaging platforms) to cut down on interruptions. One change she made was to plan intervals where she would use collaboration technologies intensely for 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes after lunch, and 10 minutes at the end of the day, and otherwise wouldn&#39;t use them at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Bad News: Participants Felt More Helpless and Exhausted After the Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The intervention also appeared to have some negative consequences that surprised us. After we prompted participants to become more mindful of their tool use, they reported that their feelings of helplessness increased. When they paused to identify digital tools to subtract, many realized doing so would be a time-consuming ordeal, or downright impossible. That&#39;s because so many other people inside and outside their teams expected (or required) them to use particular collaboration tools, so the decision to get rid of these shared tools wasn&#39;t theirs alone (or at all). The awareness triggered by the collaboration cleanse made them want to fight back and overhaul their tools. But many felt stymied by inescapable rules, traditions, and power dynamics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One project risk manager, for example, said she would try to minimize the use of collaboration tools but didn&#39;t think she would succeed. With different teams using different tools because of their own preferences or company requirements, she and her colleagues were often confused about which messaging tool they should use to communicate with people in different business units.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in both groups reported a sense of helplessness and the resulting exhaustion, yet it appeared to be more severe in the first group, where we asked participants to abstain from using half of their tools for two weeks — a task that proved to be not just formidable, but often impossible. Many participants realized they were helpless to cut their tool use like they wanted to, which frustrated and exhausted them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in the second group, who were given the flexibility to trim their list of collaboration tools as much as they deemed necessary, also reported feelings of futility and digital exhaustion, though they seemed less vehement in their distress. The task of subtracting tools, we found, is complex and daunting, and becoming mindful about the struggle to achieve it can inadvertently exacerbate feelings of helplessness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This aligns with the findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMPROC.2023.11120abstract&quot;>;related study&lt;/a>; where we interviewed 63 knowledge workers from a variety of industries. We found that feelings of digital exhaustion depended on whether or not employees felt like they had autonomy to decide which tools they would use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our takeaway? When people realize they can&#39;t do much or anything to reduce the number of collaboration tools they use (or when and how often they use them), they&#39;re left feeling even more helpless and exhausted. As one software engineer put it, “This is something that&#39;s really hard to change on an individual level.” He went on to explain that, if he decided not to use a tool that other colleagues used, it would be harder for him and his collaborators to do their jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Change Needs to Come from the Top&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many studies show that effective and long-lasting change in organizations bubbles up from the bottom and that strong dictums from management &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;can create impediments for employees&lt;/a>;. We&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250284426/thefrictionproject&quot;>;cited&lt;/a>; much of that research &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/the-digital-mindset-what-it-really-takes-to-thrive-in-the-age-of-data-algorithms-and-ai/10413&quot;>;in our own work&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;even produced a fair amount of it&lt;/a>;, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when it comes to technology overload and digital exhaustion, the best and sometimes only way to reduce the problem is with strong, persistent, and even downright inflexible top-down intervention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results of our collaboration cleanse show that the interactive and interdependent nature of collaboration technologies makes it near impossible for individual employees to meaningfully reduce their tool use in the workplace on their own. And as participants in our study made clear, attempting and failing to change how and when they use their digital tools may be worse than never trying at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees at lower levels often have the best information about which tools to keep and which to eliminate. But those at the top of the pecking order are in the best position to use their authority to make change throughout the organization and help employees stay afloat amid the digital deluge. Here&#39;s how leaders can help employees get a better handle on their collaboration tools:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Provide purposeful constraints.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Set clear guidelines for when employees should use specific technologies. This will help prevent them from spending time and energy second-guessing what type of work to do with which technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Establish non-negotiables. For example, leaders in one organization we worked with specified that Slack should be used for communication that&#39;s time sensitive and requires a quick response — and not for less-pressing matters. Leaders in other organizations have banned email completely, or made the decision to use only one project management tool. They key here is to be specific and exacting: Don&#39;t let too many tools clutter people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Tackle the root cause and ripple effects.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As a leader, it&#39;s crucial to confront both the visible symptoms and underlying causes of tech overload. Initiate a top-down pruning of your organization&#39;s tool stack, eliminating redundant and inefficient technologies. One data scientist who participated in the cleanse described how his company&#39;s leaders cancelled employee licenses for a redundant file-sharing platform, which helped him and others stick to a single platform when working on documents, rather than being forced to keep switching between different platforms that each required different steps and commands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also your responsibility to help your team mitigate the ripple effects of tool overload. Encourage employees to use features like “do not disturb” and turn off unnecessary notifications to regain some control over their attention. But if you don&#39;t model this behavior, it&#39;s unlikely your employees will do it either.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Fix friction head-on.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Encourage, enable, and even require employees to regularly evaluate their tech habits. Our cleanse suggests this conscious reflection can make your employees more aware of the toll of tech overload. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250249869/subtract&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>; can be a powerful catalyst for change, prompting employees to pause and critically evaluate the impacts of their technologies on their productivity and well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet our intervention also revealed that this increased awareness can lead to heightened feelings of digital exhaustion if employees feel powerless to make changes. As a leader, your job is not only to promote this conscious reflection but also to provide support and resources so employees can change their tech use. This could involve facilitating discussions about tech habits within teams, providing training on how to use collaboration tools more effectively, or using your authority to revamp the organization&#39;s tech stack based on employee feedback. Be prepared to follow through and hold yourself accountable to ensure that increased awareness of tool overload leads to positive change rather than increased despair.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Beware the credit card approach.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s become common for managers to buy subscriptions to digital platforms for their teams — without alerting the IT department — by simply charging the small monthly fee to their company credit cards. Many tech companies design their pricing strategies so managers can make these purchases without going through a lengthy corporate approval process. Although many managers adopt this approach because they think it helps their teams adopt the best technologies quickly, the lack of friction contributes to bloat in each member&#39;s own tech stack and can lead to more feelings of digital exhaustion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers need to be more conscious about how many tools they introduce to their employees and of how difficult it is for them to stop using tools once they start. In one midsize company we worked with, the CTO instructed the accounting team to flag all purchases made to software vendors on the corporate card. Each subscription that was not authorized by IT was cancelled. If the manager wanted to reinstate it, they had to make a formal request to the CTO in writing. Sure, this was a tough top-down approach. But after a year of asking managers not to overwhelm their teams with tools, the CTO finally forced people to tackle the problem rather than just make hollow promises. Six months after the big cancellation, the company was using nearly 30 fewer tools.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Collaboration technology overload can drown employees in choices, leaving them feeling helpless. The irony is that by constraining those choices, adding frustrating obstacles to adopting yet another collaboration technology, and taking control away from individuals, employees can feel more in control of their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Prepare for a GenAI Future You Can&rsquo;t Predict]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-to-prepare-for-a-genai-future-you-cant-predict]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1500235907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Given the staggering pace of generative AI development, it&amp;#8217;s no wonder that so many executives are tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations.

Leaders, understandably concerned about missing out on the next wave of technology, are unwittingly making risky bets on their companies&amp;#8217; futures.

We initially worked through scenarios to improve fraud detection and customer service, but with the ongoing spate of recent announcements, it was clear he had grander ambitions in mind. Like many industries, banking has a workforce problem: There is a discrepancy between the demand for skilled personnel and the supply of workers who are willing to return to an office and play by pre-Covid rules.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI, he thought, might be a silver bullet of sorts. It could create cost savings and efficiencies through automation, but might these new tools also solve the talent shortage issue? To put it plainly: How soon could AI replace human workers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our conversation echoed many I&#39;ve had since last November with executives across an array of businesses, including insurance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and even executives leading Hollywood studios, whose writers and actors are currently on strike. They all want to know how their companies can create more value using fewer human resources. That&#39;s because last fall, ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by OpenAI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt&quot;>;suddenly went viral&lt;/a>;, demonstrating the power of AI to generate its own emails, essays, recipes, financial reports, articles, and ideas. Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html&quot;>;estimates&lt;/a>; that within the decade, 300 million jobs will either be eliminated or largely diminished by generative AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re already starting to see turbulence. Job postings for “prompt engineers” — humans who ask systems like ChatGPT to generate content — are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3&quot;>;offering annual salaries of $300,000 or more&lt;/a>;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389233&quot;>;OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 passed the Uniform Bar Exam&lt;/a>; and hinted that in the near future, we may not need lawyers for transactional work. Indeed, Walmart is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005148/en/Pactum%E2%80%99s-Autonomous-Negotiation-Technology-on-Display-at-the-National-Retail-Federation%E2%80%99s-2023-Retail-Big-Show&quot;>;prototyping&lt;/a>; a generative AI system (unrelated to OpenAI) to negotiate some of its vendor contracts; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2023/walmart-finds-75-percent-vendors-prefer-negotiating-with-chatbot/&quot;>;75% of contract lawyers and procurement officers&lt;/a>; on the other side say they now prefer negotiating with an AI over their flesh-and-blood counterparts. Google&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/sharing-google-med-palm-2-medical-large-language-model&quot;>;Med-PaLM 2&lt;/a>;, which is a specialized model trained on medical knowledge, now answers medical exam problems at the expert level of a doctor. This summer, partners will start testing applications that can look at an X-ray and automatically write a mammography report — without a human doctor in the loop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the staggering pace of development, it&#39;s no wonder that so many executives are coming to the same conclusion: Within just a few years, powerful AI systems will perform cognitive work at the same level (or even above) their human workforce. Tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations, business leaders envision a future of work without nearly as many people as today. From my perspective, this is a huge miscalculation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it&#39;s too early to predict the exact future of AI — especially given that generative AI is just one tiny area of a field with many interdependencies, each in various stages of development. Exactly which jobs AI will eliminate, and when, is guesswork. It isn&#39;t enough for an AI system to perform a task; the output has to be proven trustworthy, integrated into existing workstreams, and managed for compliance, risk, and regulatory issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, in a period of rapid disruption brought by technology, leaders are focused too narrowly on immediate gains, rather than how their value network will transform in the future. As AI evolves, it will require entire segments of business to be reimagined — in real time, but before we have a full sense of what the future will look like. Remember the earliest days of the public internet and web browsers, which were viewed as entertainment? No one planned for the fundamental transformation both would ignite. It would have been impossible then to foretell how it would someday influence presidential elections or create the world&#39;s first trillion-dollar companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be sure, executives today must make decisions in the most complex operating environment I&#39;ve seen since those early internet days. Leaders, understandably concerned about missing out on the next wave of technology, are unwittingly making risky bets on their companies&#39; futures. Here are steps every leader should take to prepare for an uncertain world where generative AI and human workforces coexist but will evolve in ways that are unknowable.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Preparing for a Future You Can&#39;t Predict&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the paradox: We need to think of the workforce as evolving with — rather than being supplanted by — generative AI. The workforce will need to evolve, and workers will have to learn new skills, iteratively and over a period of years. Leaders must adopt a new approach to maximize the potential of AI in their organizations, which requires tracking key developments in AI differently, using an iterative process to cultivate a ready workforce, and most importantly, creating evidence-backed future scenarios that challenge conventional thinking within the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What can leaders do now to navigate this period?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;First, temper expectations about what generative AI can and will do for your business.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Historically, AI cycles through phases that involve breakthroughs, surges of funding and fleeting moments of mainstream interest, followed by missed expectations and funding clawbacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1970, Marvin Minsky, an influential computer scientist and one of the founding parents of AI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiws.net/the-history-of-ai/this-week-in-the-history-of-ai-at-aiws-net-marvin-minsky-was-quoted-in-life-magazine-in-from-three-to-eight-years-we-will-have-a-machine-with-the-general-intelligence-of-an-average-human-b/&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; Life magazine that artificial general intelligence — an AI with cognitive abilities indistinguishable from a person — was just three years away. Bear in mind that in the 1970s, the computing power required for such an AI didn&#39;t yet exist. Supercomputers were mostly theoretical. So were personal computers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://r5.ieee.org/houston/ieee-stepping-stone-award-datapoint-2200-the-first-personal-computer/&quot;>;Datapoint 2200&lt;/a>; and its processor eventually became the foundational architecture for what we came to know as PCs. The grand ambitions promised by Minsky and his colleagues never materialized, so funding and interest dried up. This happened again in 1987, when again, computer scientists and businesses made bold promises on a timeline for AI that was just never feasible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While powerful, today&#39;s mainstream generative AI tools — ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL-E 2 — aren&#39;t finished products. Sometime soon, people will sour on their novelty and realize that while AI can create content, it&#39;s not good enough to actually use. Likewise, it&#39;s still very early days when it comes to domain-specific AI tools for medicine, climate, and life sciences. For generative AI to perform the miracles we&#39;ve been promised — at scale, and cost effectively — a lot more work needs to be done. Remember, these tools were mostly theoretical until very recently.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives need to get clear on the practical functions generative AI will perform in their organizations today. They should also be pragmatic about the opportunities — and risks — generative AI will eventually unlock. AI is not a monolith, and we are just at the beginning of a very long trajectory. This may sound intuitive, but in my observation, few leaders are developing a realistic strategy that links today&#39;s operations to tomorrow&#39;s vision, socializing it within their management teams, and revising their performance indicators accordingly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I met with the executive leadership of a multinational consumer packaged goods (CPG) company eager to partner with a generative AI company. I walked them through a high-probability scenario in which customers using a chat tool answered a few questions about their preferences and goals, and had an online shopping cart automatically filled with the items they would need for the week. But none of the CPG&#39;s brands showed up in the cart — or if they did, they weren&#39;t first on the list. Just as search engines like Google and Amazon invented new mechanisms and rules for search engine optimization, in the future, generative AI integrations across platforms like retailers and shopping cart apps would create new challenges for CPG companies, which might find themselves further down the value chain where critical decisions are made.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Second, evaluate what data your company is generating and how it would today, and in the future, be used by generative AI.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Business data is invaluable because once a model has been trained, it can be costly and technically cumbersome to port those data over to another system. At the moment emerging AI platforms are not easily interoperable, and that&#39;s by design. Generative AI platforms are evolving into walled gardens, where the companies creating the technology control all sides of their ecosystems. The biggest AI companies are competing for market share — and for the enormous amounts of data they need to make their models most competitive. By marketing their platforms to companies, they want to lock them (and their data) in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s AI systems are being created using a technique known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf&quot;>;&lt;em>;reinforcement learning with human feedback&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, or RHLF. Essentially, AI systems need constant human feedback, or they run the risk of learning and remembering the wrong information. The more data that&#39;s ingested, the more annotating, labeling, and training that&#39;s required. Today, this work is automated to gig workers in emerging economies like Kenya and Pakistan. As AI matures, specialists with expert-level knowledge will be needed. Many of the business leaders I&#39;ve met with aren&#39;t planning for a future that includes an internal RHLF unit tasked with continuously monitoring, auditing, and tweaking AI systems and tools. (The last thing any leader should want is an unsupervised AI system making decisions about how to improve itself.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even with trained humans in the loop, businesses must continuously craft scenarios that surface risks of working alongside generative AI systems, especially those operated by third parties. That&#39;s because AI systems aren&#39;t static; they are improving incrementally over time. With each new development, new potential risks and opportunities arise. It would be impossible to game out all of the potential negative outcomes in advance without those predictions quickly becoming outdated. (For now, there is no way to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Monte-Carlo-simulation&quot;>;Monte Carlo simulation&lt;/a>; that would be fully accurate in predicting the future.) Instead, a dedicated team should be charged with monitoring generative AI systems as they are learning, as well as related cybersecurity challenges, and they should develop short “what if” scenarios imagining ways in which things could go wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Likewise, as AI evolves, so too will opportunities to unlock new growth. Which means that businesses should also have a dedicated, internal business development team to develop near- and long-term scenarios for the myriad ways in which emerging tools will improve productivity and efficiency, lead to product development, spur innovation, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Third, when it comes to AI, leaders must shift their focus from the bottom line to top line.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This will seem counterintuitive, as many view generative AI as a means to reduce operational costs. Today&#39;s smart chatbots will soon give way to multimodal systems, which are AIs capable of solving different problems and accomplishing different goals at once. Imagine a property and casualty insurance company where every underwriter is teamed up with an AI. Initially, the underwriter might ask the AI to assess the risk associated with insuring a property; after a preliminary analysis of the text, she might ask it to refine results using the images from inspection reports or audio interviews with the prospective policyholder. She might go back and forth a few times, using different data sources, until an optimal quote is received for both the insurance company and the customer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to making productive use of multimodal AIs is understanding how and what to delegate to a machine, so that both the human and the AI can accomplish more through collaboration than by working independently. However delegation is something professionals routinely struggle with: They either assign too much, or not enough, or not the right tasks. Working alongside a multimodal AI will require workers to master the art of delegation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once a workforce understands how to delegate correctly, it will act as a force multiplier within organizations. Individual teams could be more ambitious in growing the company&#39;s top line through ideating and simulating new revenue streams, finding and acquiring new customers, and seeking out various improvements to the company&#39;s overall operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This portends a future that demands a different approach to upskilling. Most workers won&#39;t need to learn how to code, or how to write basic prompts, as we often hear at conferences. Rather, they&#39;ll need to learn how to leverage multimodal AI to do more, and better, work. Just look at Excel, which is &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/10-excel-functions-everyone-should-know&quot;>;used&lt;/a>; by 750 million knowledge workers every day. The software includes more than 500 functions — but the vast majority of people only use a few dozen, because they don&#39;t fully understand how to match the enormous number of features Excel offers to their daily cognitive tasks. Now, imagine a future in which AI — a far more complicated, more convoluted software — is ubiquitous. How much utility will be left on the table simply because business leaders approached upskilling too narrowly?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Framework for Navigating the Evolving AI Workforce&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Workforce change is an inevitable side effect of technological evolution, and leaders need a systemized way of seeing what the future of their organizations will look like in the wake of generative AI&#39;s developments. To that end, this simple framework will help leaders in any organization anticipate how — and when — their workforce will need to change in order to leverage AI. The goal isn&#39;t to make long-range predictions, or even to be ready for everything — it&#39;s to position organizations to be ready for anything as AI continues to improve.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363183&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_WEBB_IDEA_FRAMEWORK_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;The IDEA Framework.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;620&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This framework should be used to develop scenarios for the future of a business. It is designed to help you see risk and opportunity early enough for action. Used regularly, this framework enables leaders to see the landscape more clearly, evaluate gaps within their organizations, and link emerging technology to existing strategy, positioning them to make decisions with confidence. Importantly, it asks leaders to think exponentially about AI, but to act incrementally in response to new developments. While it won&#39;t predict a singular future for your company —&amp;nbsp;no scenario can do that — it will prepare leaders to make decisions well ahead of their competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The single best thing organizations can do right now — during this period of what feels like a soul-crushing amount of change and uncertainty — is to methodically plan for the future. That requires knowing generative AI&#39;s limitations as well as its strengths and adopting a culture of continual evaluation and improvement. It also means getting past clever product demos to much more mundane, pragmatic conversations about the trajectory of development, how data are being used, and the practical ways in which companies can use emerging tools. Resist the temptation to reduce your workforce — and instead use strategic foresight to create a future where AI is leveraged by a highly skilled workforce, and where human–AI teams are more productive, creative, and efficient working together than apart.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Global Companies Can Create a Consistent Customer Experience]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_30_3850269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Yaroslav Danylchenko/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Building a global company is easier, but also more nuanced and complex, than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run. To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving a GLOBE mindset, one that&amp;#8217;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;On the surface, international business expansion seems easier than ever. Today, any company can reach multiple markets in a matter of seconds: Publish a blog post, launch a mobile app, buy digital ads, and target customers in as many countries as you wish. The rise of online global marketplaces has made it even easier for companies to launch into multiple countries simultaneously, often from their earliest days. This has given rise to a wave of “global native” companies that have an international presence from day one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ian Harkin founded Lottie, a toy company based in Donegal, Ireland that manufactures Barbie doll alternatives with a child&#39;s dimensions instead of an adult&#39;s, he began with international markets in mind from the very start. “In the toy industry, with very high up-front development costs, it&#39;s difficult to justify the expense to launch in just one country,” he explains. Harkin, the company&#39;s CEO, integrated their storefront into Amazon, and immediately reached customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Sweden, and Poland. Nearly 100% of the company&#39;s revenue today comes from outside of Ireland. Harkin points out, “For us, going global early helped our product and brand reach more potential customers, much faster, than if we would have expanded one country at a time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This growing phenomenon of going global as early as possible in the life of a business isn&#39;t only happening with physical products that can launch via global platforms like Amazon or Etsy. Partners at Andreessen Horowitz have written about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2022/07/20/the-company-of-the-future-is-default-global/&quot;>;new wave of “default global” companies&lt;/a>;, which radically compress the timeframe it takes to go global. They contrast these with “default local” firms, which often take five years before operating in just a few foreign markets. The default global companies are often in double the number of markets as default local companies are by year three. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/newsroom/stories/global-natives&quot;>;research from Stripe&lt;/a>; shows that 89% of successful tech companies had expanded internationally prior to achieving “unicorn” status, a valuation of $1 billion or higher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But building a global company is also more nuanced and complex than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, even if you&#39;re already having success as a global company, it&#39;s time to raise the bar. To sustain your success for the long term, you&#39;ll need to build not just a company that has customers or revenue streams from many different countries, but one that operates as a globally equitable organization (GEO for shorthand).&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Rise of the Globally Equitable Organization &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When I ran international expansion efforts for HubSpot, a large public tech company, over the space of nearly eight years, I noticed this pronounced shift toward continuous expansion happening before my eyes. But I also observed another important trend at play in the broader market. In the past, companies that sought to expand internationally measured their success strictly using qualitative measures, usually in the form of revenue or customer count from new markets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, with global becoming the new default, the goal is no longer as simple as just increasing revenue share from between different parts of the world. Instead, the new measure is more customer-oriented in nature. Companies have realized that it&#39;s not enough to initially acquire new customers in other geographies — retaining them is critical, as this ensures that revenue can be sustained. The best global companies ask themselves: How successful can our local customers be with our business in each market, without geography getting in the way?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Teamwork, a project management software company headquartered in Cork, Ireland. “You can sell software from anywhere in the world from the get-go. There are no boundaries,” explains Peter Coppinger, Teamwork CEO and co-founder. “One of the biggest lessons we learned with Teamwork&#39;s international expansion is that once you reach a certain scale, you need to get more deliberate about targeting the regions with the most potential.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the company deepened its presence in specific markets, Coppinger and team found that they needed to ramp up sales and customer talent in order to support customers in new time zones. “There is no substitute for having staff in the same time zone speaking the same language as your target customer,” he points out. When Teamwork recognized some customers were feeling this pain, they were proactive about creating a more equitable experience for all customers. Today, the company has 20,000 customers in 170 countries, and a global workforce of 350 employees in 15 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make Local Customer Experiences Equitable, Not Identical &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the digital age, it&#39;s easy to go global without adapting the customer experience. But if companies fail to make sufficient adaptations, they miss the chance to build true connections of value with their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Making local experiences equitable doesn&#39;t mean they have to be identical. In fact, where many companies go wrong is that they try to enforce a cookie-cutter approach onto all markets, in the name of “global leverage.” But in doing so, they miss out on the importance of local adaptations that ensure their customers across markets are equally happy with the value they&#39;re receiving, even if they define and derive that value in different ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a shining example, look no further than Starbucks. At the product level, customers can order many of the same standard menu items in every location globally. But to appeal to local tastes, a customer in Peru, where the Lúcuma fruit grows, can order a Lúcuma Crème Frappuccino from their local barista. Starbucks adapts not only their physical products, but their digital outreach to customers too. They achieve global consistency offline as well as online, but the company customizes their digital marketing campaigns in each country tied to the seasons, holidays, and local traditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The table below offers some examples of adaptations a company might make in order to ensure it is providing an equitable experience to customers in a new market:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;!-- table start -- Ensuring a Globally Equitable Experience -- -->;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;h4>;Ensuring a Globally Equitable Experience&lt;/h4>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;The table below offers some examples of adaptations a company might make in order to ensure it&#39;s providing an equitable customer experience as it enters new markets around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;>; &lt;thead>; &lt;tr>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Customer experience area&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Current home market approach&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Initial local market approach&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Why it&#39;s globally equitable&lt;/th>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/thead>; &lt;tbody>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Customer experience area&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MARKETING&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Current home market approach&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;A large website that has built up over the years with large amounts of content&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Initial local market approach&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;A microsite with just the core content that enables customers to understand the parts of your offering that matter most to them&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Why it&#39;s globally equitable&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;You didn&#39;t create such a large website for your home market overnight, so you don&#39;t need to localize all of it.

While this is a natural inclination, it actually can have the opposite effect and require investments that are disproportional for each local market. Instead of doing “all things in all markets,” be selective and show a true willingness to adapt. Encourage your employees to flex their creative muscles when thinking about what strategy will work best for a new local market so that they can derive equal value, even if the approaches vary.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Ensure Your Organization Has a Globally Equitable Mindset&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving what I call a GLOBE mindset, one that&#39;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic.

Disintermediation is a sign that your customers don&amp;#8217;t think you are adding as much value as you think you are. Firms struggling with disintermediation can take simple steps to stop the bleeding before it&amp;#8217;s too late &amp;#8212; if they understand what&amp;#8217;s really taking place. They should consider six factors: urgency, rake, risk, skill, frequency, and modularity. The solution for disintermediation is quite simple: Create more value than you take.

The technical term for this is “disintermediation,” and examples of it include readers buying online rather than from bookstores, Upwork and ZBJ (China&#39;s Zhu Bajie) programmers contracting directly with clients, and Airbnb struggling not only with guests contracting directly with hosts, but also with some of its biggest professional hosts &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbnb-stock-falls-after-short-report-says-hosts-directly-compete-with-platform-173546532.html&quot;>;reportedly competing against it on new platforms&lt;/a>;. Disintermediation — and the failure to understand and address it — killed once thriving businesses like Borders books, Blockbuster movies, and Tower records. It&#39;s easy to understand why platform companies worry so much about being cut out of the loop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the thing, though: True disintermediation is rare. Most buyers and sellers don&#39;t cut out the middleman entirely, but rather find a new provider that cuts transaction costs or adds more value so that switching is a natural choice. Readers buy from Amazon, not authors directly. Movie watchers and song listeners don&#39;t buy from Hollywood studios or musicians but from Netflix and Spotify. Simply put, these are not atomic markets of many-to-many interactions. New centers of attraction (Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify) have re-intermediated the old ones (Borders, Blockbuster, and Tower).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The issue is that companies often misunderstand the problem: Disintermediation is a sign that your customers don&#39;t think you are adding as much value as you think you are. Just because you enabled the first transaction doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re entitled to take all the value from the second, the third, and subsequent transactions. The good news, however, is that firms that appear to be struggling with disintermediation can take simple steps to stop the bleeding before it&#39;s too late — if they understand what&#39;s really taking place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Predicting disintermediation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;How can a firm know when deals are sticky and when they will go somewhere else? At least six factors contribute to partners taking deals off your platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, &lt;em>;urgency&lt;/em>; reflects the need to solve a problem now, which helps keep the deal. A large platform that can address a need quickly is more valuable when urgency is high, in contrast to a single off-platform source that is high-quality but unavailable. For instance, the delivery app Drizzly provides on-demand alcohol for parties. A trip to the liquor store might cost less, but it requires advance planning or someone stepping out mid-party.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Rake&lt;/em>; is what a platform charges for facilitating a deal. The higher this fee, the more partners want to avoid it. Groupon&#39;s rake of nearly 50% &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/how-users-drive-value-in-twosided-markets(94885ed2-0e38-40e4-9388-35008ffcc834).html&quot;>;contributed to its plunge and plateau in stock value&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Risk&lt;/em>; is the danger that a deal goes badly. If a project is risky, then both buyers and suppliers prefer having the benefit of reputation systems, insurance, and mediation services the platform provides. Uber covers driver costs and holds riders accountable if riders throw up in the car.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Skill&lt;/em>; is the level of expertise required to perform the task. For low-skill jobs, the main issue is usually price, and a large pool of suppliers helps customers secure the best deal. That means platforms offer the best value for both the first and subsequent deals, as with E-Trade for example. But when a job requires high skill, platforms often only add value to the first deal, where the benefits of reputation systems truly matter. After that, buyers can cut out gatekeepers once they find a reliable supplier. For instance, Rocket Lawyer connects people with expert attorneys to help with legal issues. But once someone has found a reliable attorney, they no longer need the platform. And, they don&#39;t want to explain their situation all over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequent deals highlight related factors, &lt;em>;interaction frequency&lt;/em>;, or how often partners must communicate to complete the task, and &lt;em>;project modularity&lt;/em>;, or the degree to which a task can be divided into smaller, independent components. If a task requires repeated communication or it can be broken easily into separate parts, then buyers and sellers have multiple opportunities to &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4150094&quot;>;establish a relationship independent of the platform&lt;/a>;. On Upwork, for example, working through stages of website deployment — specification, design, coding, backend, test, etc. — gives parties a chance to reduce the rake on each stage. Then later stages can happen off-platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363193&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_VAN_ALSTYNE_DISINTERMEDIATION_FACTORS_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Broadly speaking, these six factors tell companies how to reduce the costs of &lt;em>;search&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;negotiation&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;risk&lt;/em>;, or &lt;em>;delivery&lt;/em>; associated with getting the deal to happen as distinct from producing the work itself. In economic terms, these are known as “transaction costs.” The platform&#39;s role is to lower them compared to the next best alternative. Understanding this principle gives executives control over the outcome even if the superficial attributes change. The platform helps orchestrate the deal, but the supplier actually produces the result, and if the buyer and supplier can handle the transaction costs more efficiently without the platform, then they will disintermediate the deal. Interestingly, the Chief Strategy Officer for Alibaba even defined a test for successful platforms as achieving “the nexus of lowest transaction costs.” Understanding disintermediation in this way then gives you the tools to prevent it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Preventing disintermediation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The solution for disintermediation is quite simple: Create more value than you take. Stop playing the role of toll-taking gatekeeper and start playing the role of value-adding partner. Either decrease transaction costs or increase value for buyers or suppliers, or both.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every platform interaction has a producer side and a consumer side. This is true regardless of whether the activity is a ride, a tweet, a stay, a product, a service, or a piece of art. The trick is to design appropriate carrots and sticks for both sides, with a heavy emphasis on carrots. Why are carrots better than sticks? Carrots &lt;em>;add value&lt;/em>; for keeping interactions on-platform, while sticks &lt;em>;add costs&lt;/em>; for taking interactions off-platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363192&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_VAN_ALSTYNE_DISINTERMEDIATION_CARROTS_STICKS_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Many platforms choose sticks because they are easier to implement or because they feel entitled to a certain level of profit. Sticks, however, do not engender goodwill among customers, service providers, freelancers, or developers. They include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Hiding supplier contact information to prevent direct communication. For years, Angies List (now Angi) hid home service provider contact information, which limited interactions and growth.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Bounties paid to buyers and suppliers who rat on the other side for proposing disintermediation.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Secret shoppers and secret sellers who make such proposals to test partner loyalty. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53948&quot;>;ZBJ&lt;/a>; used both bounties and secret shoppers when freelancers did not want to share large commissions with the platform.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Deplatforming, public shaming, and eventually legal action, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/business/apple-epic-games-appeal.html&quot;>;Apple tried&lt;/a>; when Fortnite tried to use its own system to facilitate payments rather than use Apple&#39;s system with its exorbitant 30% tax.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Carrots are far better because they show a commitment to creating value, which is the only real basis for capturing value. They include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Giving users software tools to enhance the production, delivery, quality, or consumption of the product or service. Instagram and Vimeo offer filters and image editing tools that not only reduce costs for producers but also help them create value for consumers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A variant of this strategy is to offer value-adding services. The freelance platform Upwork will provide project management for large contracts by partitioning it and farming out components to different subcontractors. 99Designs, a design contest platform, helps designers automate their billing, track their progress, and pay their taxes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Frequent buyer or frequent seller rewards. OpenTable gives buyers dining points that they can spend on restaurant meals, while CoachUp gives professional coaches volume discounts. Etsy rewards artists&#39; loyalty by showcasing their work.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Shifting monetization to the point where the platform adds the most value. ZBJ introduced an optional pricing model that shifts from a transaction fee to a subscription fee. Once the fee is paid for the first deal, suppliers&#39; costs for each new deal are zero. When further use of the platform is free, sellers prefer the benefits of automated tracking and billing that happens on-platform.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Insurance, which is one of the most successful benefits to both sellers and buyers. On the seller side, Airbnb insures hosts against fire, theft, and property damage. On the buyer side, Amazon offers free returns and money back guarantees.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Basic safety. Uber introduced a rider emergency help button that most taxis do not offer. When a freelance contract is based on an hourly rate, Upwork has provided monitoring software so that a client knows a programmer is coding and not perusing Facebook.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Introducing buyer and seller rating systems. Almost every major platform now uses some form of review to reduce the adverse selection of finding bad providers and the moral hazard that, having been paid, they might not deliver.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Ironically, these strategies do come with a challenge — a “disintermediation dilemma.” Strategies intended to add value can inadvertently lead to leakage. This occurs when tactics &lt;em>;do&lt;/em>; add value but only to the first interaction and not the second. Consider a five-star rating on a home cleaner or landscaper. Once contact is made and trust established, a platform that adds no further value will be disintermediated. This problem &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/why-some-platforms-thrive-and-others-dont&quot;>;doomed Homejoy&lt;/a>; within a few years of launch. Groupon, likewise, adds value to a first sale by providing group buying discounts for buyers and discovery for merchants. But then deals conclude off-platform at the merchant and its “leaky bucket” adds little value to later deals. Buyers just visit the merchants. By contrast, Meituan, a Chinese successor to Groupon, handles delivery through the platform, generates frequent buyer rewards, and helps merchants design new products and situate new stores. Increased volume increases benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disintermediation is a signal. What it really tells you is that you don&#39;t provide enough value after an initial match. You&#39;re taking more than your fair share. Disintermediation simply means someone else provides more value than you do. Instead, if you create more value than you take, you will attract deals rather than repel them.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 30 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Arrange Your Meeting Schedule to Boost Your Energy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/arrange-your-meeting-schedule-to-boost-your-energy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_29_1464685906.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Olena Koliesnik/iStock/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Most meeting advice focuses on how to make meetings more effective or how to cut down on the number of meetings you have altogether. But what about how to schedule your meetings alongside other work tasks to best manage your productivity? New research explores this question and finds that many people commit two key errors in organizing their schedules: stacking too many meetings together on the same day or pairing intense meetings with other intense tasks. Both strategies can actually diminish your ability to recharge and replenish during the day, which can be a detriment to your work. Instead, this article offers new tips for how to balance work and meetings and suggests questions you can ask yourself when planning your day.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/arrange-your-meeting-schedule-to-boost-your-energy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/arrange-your-meeting-schedule-to-boost-your-energy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Meetings remain a frequent challenge for most knowledge workers. While common advice and prior research often focuses on making meetings more effective or reducing the time we spend in them, there is another critical aspect rarely taken into account: the way we schedule and arrange our meetings on a daily basis. Scheduling can, however, aid or impede our energy and productivity at work, and thus warrants a closer look.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-61289-001&quot;>;our research&lt;/a>;, we investigate the impact of knowledge workers&#39; daily meeting scheduling, including how certain strategies may seem smart but can, in fact, unintentionally drain our own energy. Let&#39;s consider two examples.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taylor, a senior data specialist who leads a team of junior analysts, notices two meetings on his Thursday calendar — one with a vendor liaison and another with senior specialists from other departments. Then he realizes that he also needs to arrange some check-ins with his junior analysts. Should he squeeze in those extra meetings on Thursday alongside the existing two, or should he schedule them for Friday instead? He is tempted to stack the meetings on Thursday, so that he can save time and keep his Friday schedule “clean” to focus on his own portion of a project report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In another context, Minli, a seasoned software engineer and manager of a development team, faces two upcoming meetings this week. On Tuesday, she is scheduled to present to the strategic committee, a critical meeting with potential budget implications. The next day, she is tasked with an orientation session for new interns — a familiar and relatively easy duty. Alongside these meetings, Minli must also tackle her own technical work on two projects: one encountering some serious challenges, and the other nearly complete, needing only a few final touches. Should she work on the difficult project on Tuesday and handle the easier one on Wednesday, or reverse the plan? Minli leans towards the first option. By addressing the most demanding challenges on Tuesday, both in her meetings and her individual work, she anticipates a less stressful remainder of the week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taylor and Minli&#39;s approaches are common: compacting meeting schedules to save time, or pairing critical meetings with intense individual tasks on the same day to finish them as soon as possible. However, our research findings reveal that these strategies come with their own drawbacks, particularly when considering their impact on workday energy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We conducted two studies in which we tracked the daily work activities of over 400 full-time knowledge workers, some from technology companies and others from diverse industries involving intellectual work. Throughout the workweek, workers were surveyed at the middle and the end of each workday about their meetings, individual tasks, and other activities during the morning and the afternoon, as well as their energy levels at the end of each half-day period. Additionally, we drew insights into their work performance, including task performance and creativity, from their supervisors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We made two important discoveries. First, what impacts knowledge workers&#39; energy is not the sheer amount of time they spend in meetings, but the relative proportion of meeting time compared to what they spend on individual tasks. We found that, on a given day, the more time knowledge workers dedicate to meetings relative to their own individual tasks, the less they engage in small break activities (eg, a short walk, casual conversations, brief fun reading) to restore their energy during that day. The absence of such break activities, which are crucial for periodic replenishment, harms their workday energy. The impaired energy in turn has a negative impact on the knowledge workers&#39; task performance, creativity, and job satisfaction at work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Further, we discovered that, when structured appropriately, meetings and individual tasks can create what we call a “pressure complementarity effect” during the workday. Two complementary configurations — high-pressure individual tasks accompanied by a low-pressure meeting, or conversely, low-pressure individual tasks accompanied by a high-pressure meeting—can benefit a person&#39;s energy. For instance, on a day when a data specialist breezes through routine paperwork, she may find a high-stakes meeting where she pitches a new initiative energizing; conversely, on a day when she is wrestling with a high-pressure report, a low-pressure update meeting about the company&#39;s IT system can offer a needed respite for her energy. We found that this complementary effect is most pronounced when a knowledge worker has not yet been consumed by the day&#39;s demands, specifically during the morning rather than the afternoon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These research findings shed light on how Taylor and Minli&#39;s scheduling approaches might inadvertently undermine their workday energy, and they also reveal pathways for potential improvements. Taylor&#39;s decision to stack meetings on a single day creates a substantial imbalance in time between meetings and individual work on that day, which will likely reduce his engagement in short break activities crucial for his energy replenishment. Despite aiming to optimize his schedule, this approach may instead lead to energy depletion and reduced performance. A more balanced spread of meetings and individual tasks across the two days may enhance his energy and effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Minli&#39;s situation, her plan to tackle a difficult project and a critical meeting both on Tuesday could create undue pressure without sufficient opportunity for relief and restoration. Conversely, her Wednesday, filled with a low-pressure meeting and an easier project, may lack stimulation. If, instead, Minli can pair the more demanding individual tasks with the less taxing meeting on one day, and vice versa on the other day, she is more likely to sustain her energy throughout both days.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when faced with the challenge of scheduling your workday, particularly arranging meetings alongside individual tasks, consider the following:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Focus on the relative proportion of meeting time to individual work time on a specific day, not just the total hours spent in meetings.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A reasonable balance between meetings and individual tasks allows for essential breaks and energy replenishment throughout the workday. This approach requires not overloading a single day with many meetings, even if it may sometimes seem like a time-saving strategy. Managing the proportion of meeting time relative to individual work on a daily basis can enhance energy levels at work, thereby contributing to improved performance, creativity, and job satisfaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Design your workday to create complements between meetings and individual tasks.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Recognize the benefits of pairing high-pressure meetings with low-pressure individual tasks, or vice versa. Rather than clustering activities of the same pressure level into a single period, distribute challenging tasks and meetings across different days or different time segments of the day. This approach fosters proper pressure complementarity, thereby enhancing workday energy to facilitate better performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Adopt a more holistic approach to workday scheduling.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Rather than simply fitting a meeting or individual task into the calendar for its own convenience, consider the broader implications for your workday structure. Be mindful of how a scheduling decision may alter the arrangement pattern of your workday, potentially influencing your energy and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following questions might be useful in your planning process:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How will this scheduling decision impact the balance between my meetings and individual work time on this specific day?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Will adding this meeting to this specific segment of the day compress my individual work time too much, sacrificing essential breaks and replenishment?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Will this schedule lead to back-to-back high-pressure meetings and tasks in a single day? How can that be avoided?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is there a better spot in my schedule to place this meeting or task, facilitating a more effective mix of high-pressure and low-pressure work throughout the day?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;For knowledge workers, managing meetings is not merely about increasing effectiveness and time efficiency; it also calls for a strategic approach to everyday scheduling. This means considering daily meetings alongside individual tasks, both in terms of time allocation and how much pressure they will put on you. Being mindful of these aspects can help you steer clear of subtle scheduling traps and prevent unexpected drains on your energy and productivity. Indeed, by embracing a more holistic approach to meeting scheduling, you may transform the way you approach your workday, leading to a more balanced and fruitful arrangement of daily responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 29 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[No, SCOTUS Did Not Make Your Company&rsquo;s DEI Programs Illegal]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/no-scotus-did-not-make-your-companys-dei-programs-illegal]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_30hero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The most effective approach to DEI is also the best for controlling legal risk: Focus your DEI program on interrupting the bias that&amp;#8217;s constantly transmitted through basic business systems.

Also basic: Race-based employment decisions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964&quot;>;already were illegal under Title VII, a federal statute&lt;/a>;. That precludes practices like reserving hiring or promotion slots for people of color and using race as a tiebreaker.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/politics/affirmative-action-ban-states.html&quot;>;nine states&lt;/a>; already prohibit affirmative action based on race, typically based on their state constitutions. In California, where I live, Proposition 209 prohibited affirmative action based on race in state university admissions, state hiring, and state contracting nearly 30 years ago. I have never heard a whisper that Prop 209 makes DEI programs of private companies illegal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So commentary opining that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-06-22/supreme-court-affirmative-action-ruling-jeopardizes-corporate-diversity-too#xj4y7vzkg&quot;>;“corporations…[will] just shut down all their DEI work&lt;/a>;” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-06/yes-the-supreme-court-s-affirmative-action-ruling-really-does-affect-employers#xj4y7vzkg&quot;>;“corporate diversity efforts [are] in legal trouble”&lt;/a>; seems a bit hysterical.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only reason corporate DEI programs are implicated is because of a few sentences in Justice Neil Gorsuch&#39;s concurring opinion, which was joined only by Justice Clarence Thomas. Gorsuch&#39;s concurrence reaches far beyond the issues involved in the case at hand. It briefly discusses the federal statute prohibiting race and sex discrimination in employment, to signal to future plaintiffs that he would welcome future lawsuits against employers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So we&#39;re down to tea leaves and speculation about whether Justice Gorsuch might be able to assemble a Supreme Court majority down the road — particularly since lavishly financed conservative non-profits like America First Legal have promised future litigation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Cynthia Thomas Calvert of Workforce 21C, a human resources consultancy, notes that “&#39;reverse discrimination&#39; lawsuits by white employees already were increasing before the Supreme Court decision.” One employee was awarded &lt;a href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/duvall-v-novant-health-inc-5&quot;>;$3.8 million&lt;/a>;; in a second suit, a jury awarded &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-racism-philadelphia-manager-lawsuit-bfa9cd9a897dff402f8547f167455d10&quot;>;$25.6 million&lt;/a>;. These are big dollar amounts but a small number of lawsuits. And these awards may not survive: The first has been appealed and the second probably will be. Stay tuned.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plaintiffs challenging company diversity statements, or goals that a certain percentage of their workforce be people of color, need to show that the goal resulted in an “adverse employment action” that harmed their careers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/diversity-equity-dei-companies-blum-2040b173&quot;>;Employers will argue it did not&lt;/a>;, and will point out that courts give companies broad discretion to run their businesses as they see fit. All this can make these suits hard to win.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most effective approach to DEI is also the best for controlling legal risk: Focus your DEI program on interrupting the bias that&#39;s constantly transmitted through basic business systems. This is how most corporate DEI programs, which typically focus on trainings and tweaks to organizational systems to level the playing field, already work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How? Let&#39;s take an example of hiring bias found in one of the 25 bias interrupters experiments my team currently has in the field. We found that white men at a tech startup were being hired with much lower ratings than any other group. We also found that white men typically were rejected only if they had very low ratings. Candidates from other groups were rejected even when they had far higher ratings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tech start-up we&#39;re working with went from being reluctant to collect and analyze data to requiring all employees involved in hiring to take a workshop we developed on interrupting bias in hiring. Basing your DEI program on this kind of data can help change a company&#39;s climate. Metrics move mountains.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Collecting this data can also decrease legal risk because Title VII prohibits policies that create a disparate impact based on race or gender. No company wants to learn about this kind of problem only &lt;em>;after&lt;/em>; a plaintiff has sued for discrimination. Forewarned is forearmed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you have the data you&#39;ll need to fix any problems you find. Don&#39;t leave biased systems in place and then try to solve the problems you&#39;ve created by explicitly considering race at the last minute. Instead, follow basic precepts of industrial-organizational psychology by increasing structure. For example, CVs should be reviewed by ranking each candidate on predetermined competencies using a rubric and standardized scale. Then add in procedures designed to protect against the kinds of bias documented by experimental social psychologists. For example, keep track of when requirements get waived, and look for patterns. (Research shows that requirements typically are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610443913&quot;>;applied&lt;/a>; rigorously to out groups but leniently to in groups.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you do this, you will not fall afoul of the &lt;em>;Students for Fair Admissions&lt;/em>; ruling, because you are avoiding precisely what the majority opinion found so offensive: explicit racial preferences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Chief Justice Roberts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf&quot;>;noted in his opinion&lt;/a>;, Harvard&#39;s racial preferences led to a situation where a Black student in the fourth lowest academic decile had a higher chance of admission than an Asian American in the top decile. We have never, ever found anything like this at a company, and we have worked with scores of companies for over a decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The typical problem is epitomized by one telling statistic: In our database of nearly 20,000 people, 80% to 88% of white men report fair access to career-enhancing assignments while the percentage among women of color sinks as low as 50%. This is a recipe for a lawsuit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two final parts of the majority opinion hold messages for the corporate world. If you do want to hire a qualified person of color in a context where a reverse discrimination suit might ensue, the majority opinion tells you exactly what to say. &lt;em>;Students for Fair Admissions&lt;/em>; says that while one cannot give someone an automatic boost based on race, one can consider how a candidate overcame various life obstacles, including racial discrimination. Heads up that this is how to talk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final important part of the majority opinion is its discussion of stereotyping. Harvard&#39;s “admissions process rests on the pernicious stereotype that &#39;a black student can usually bring something that a white student cannot offer,&#39;” Justice Roberts wrote. “UNC is much the same. It argues that race in itself &#39;says [something] about who you are.&#39;” In the court&#39;s view, “it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This language has implications for another common DEI practice: employee resource groups (ERGs), or voluntary groups of employees who align around a shared identity. These groups reflect on the evidence-based-but-now-illegal assumption that (for example) Black employees tend to have a different experience than white employees at your company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The simple fix, according to Laura Maechtlen, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw LLP, to open up ERGs to anyone who supports the mission of the group. You should also make sure your ERGs have a mission statement, business goals, and rules that prevent people from joining the group simply to disrupt it. This is best practice anyway, because this approach can help reduce backlash and develop allies. If your ERG includes capacity building (such as leadership training), make sure that the training also offered in other contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the bottom line: Far-right advocates like American First Legal are pretending that &lt;em>;Students for Fair Admissions&lt;/em>; stands for a lot that it doesn&#39;t stand for. No harm, no foul: that&#39;s what advocates do. But don&#39;t mistake it for a serious assessment of legal risk. It isn&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How a Hybrid Platform Can Help Enable Trusted Generative AI - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM CLOUDERA, AMD & DELL]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/08/how-a-hybrid-platform-can-help-enable-trusted-generative-ai]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;content js-target=&quot;article-content&quot; data-key=&quot;LJH82erDHQp3AvTAeo0Mt+iTzxaGx7qrjFjwWkGV8zlYqv6/tcfKxr2toAHeF+Bc&quot; data-index=&quot;BM5l29iJY6Ee+8B2yfNlrdgbvN4VLOJhHh/T44P8lW6/Kbq5iPmmJvF9sjdH7LhLe1ccDR72ijPS6FDnxIL/8g==&quot; data-waiver=&quot;true&quot; data-page-year=&quot;2023&quot; data-page-month=&quot;08&quot; data-page-seo-title=&quot;how-a-hybrid-platform-can-help-enable-trusted-generative-ai&quot; data-page-adUnit-locations=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3,DFP_IC_pos4&quot; data-page-slug=&quot;sponsored&quot; data-piano-verified=&quot;true&quot; >; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-0&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Clouderahero-1024x536.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is still in its infancy, but it already brings irresistible promise to help businesses serve their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations can use generative AI to quickly and economically sift through large volumes of their own data to help create relevant and high-quality text, audio, images, and other content in response to prompts based on legions of training data. And hosted open-source large language models (LLMs) can help organizations add enterprise data context to their outputs, producing more reliable responses while reducing false information (“hallucinations”).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the dilemma is that, to get more accurate outputs from a generative AI model, organizations need to give third-party AI tools access to enterprise-specific knowledge and proprietary data.

They can benefit from the flexibility of the public cloud for initial experimentation while keeping their most sensitive data safe on on-premises platforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One organization&#39;s experience demonstrates how hybrid cloud-based data management can incorporate public customer data in real time while protecting confidential company and customer information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;A More Personalized Experience&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the largest financial institutions in Southeast Asia, Singapore-based, wanted to use AI and machine learning (ML) to enhance the digital customer experience and improve its decision making. It used a hybrid cloud platform to do so.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;OCBC built a single entry point for all its LLM use cases: a hybrid framework that could seamlessly integrate multiple data sources, including inputs from thousands of customers and a private-cloud data lake that would keep customer data safe, to get real-time insights customized to its own company standards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bank built prompt&amp;nbsp;microservices for accessing LLMs stored on its on-premises servers as well as LLMs available in the public cloud: a cost-effective model that allowed it both to use public cloud LLMs and to host open-source LLMs, depending on the functionality and customization it needed. By deploying and hosting its own code assistant, scaled for 2,000 users, OCBC saved 80% of the cost of using SaaS solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Combining the vast capabilities available on the public cloud with the portability of its private platform helped the bank securely train its AI models and derive more accurate inferences from its outputs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platform integrates with the bank&#39;s ML operations pipelines and fits into its larger ML engineering ecosystem. This cloud-based ML-powered platform lets OCBC build its own applications and use the tools and frameworks its data scientists choose.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The initiative has led to a more personalized customer experience, higher campaign conversion rates, faster transactions, reduced downtime for data centers, and an additional SGD100 million (US$75 million) in revenue a year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Innovating with Generative AI, Securely&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations are racing to adopt generative AI to streamline their operations and turbocharge innovation. They need AI tools that have enterprise-specific context and draw on knowledge from proprietary data sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But while the technology is still maturing, there&#39;s no need to sacrifice privacy, security, and compliance. By using hosted open-source LLMs, businesses can access the latest capabilities and fine-tune models with their own data while maintaining control and avoiding privacy concerns—and limiting expenses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going with a hybrid platform allows organizations to use the advantages of the public cloud while keeping proprietary AI-based insights out of public view. By allowing businesses to store and use their data wherever, whenever, and however they need while offering a significant cost advantage, hybrid workflows incorporating vendor-agnostic and open and flexible solutions are truly democratizing AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Learn more about how you can &lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudera.com/why-cloudera/enterprise-ai.html?internal_keyplay=data-lakehouse&amp;amp;internal_campaign=FY24-Q3_SC_Globl_HBR_ContentArticle_2023-08-11&amp;amp;cid=701Hr0000029gooIAA&amp;amp;internal_link=on-page-body&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;use open-source LLMs with your own data in a secure environment&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;/content>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why We Glorify Overwork and Refuse to Rest]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/why-we-glorify-overwork-and-refuse-to-rest]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_28_590177686.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Orbon Alija/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;None of us want to admit that we would rather feel overwhelmed than underwhelmed. In fact, we often experience a greater sense of our own value when we&amp;#8217;re working than we do when we&amp;#8217;re not. Working is not just a way to stay busy, but also to prove our worthiness &amp;#8211; to others and to ourselves. The result is that without the right guardrails in place, we silently collude with employers who encourage us to overwork through intense pressure to perform. The authors outline strategies for intervening if you find yourself compulsively overworking, including honestly recognizing your tendency to work long and continuous hours, prioritizing sleep and movement, and choosing one activity outside of work that brings you true enjoyment.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;content js-target=&quot;article-content&quot; data-key=&quot;hlFJa4rIESdsHeLrhl0cVa4L0Vs5z6ZL2rREMbIQOaFEaCWWLMGJ9vbjJlQTRUNv&quot; data-index=&quot;BM5l29iJY6Ee+8B2yfNlrdgbvN4VLOJhHh/T44P8lW6/Kbq5iPmmJvF9sjdH7LhLkkr4KLIudCcZ656s9EHxHQ==&quot; data-waiver=&quot;false&quot; data-page-year=&quot;2023&quot; data-page-month=&quot;08&quot; data-page-seo-title=&quot;why-we-glorify-overwork-and-refuse-to-rest&quot; data-page-adUnit-locations=&quot;&quot; data-page-slug=&quot;article&quot; data-piano-verified=&quot;false&quot; >; &lt;p>;Nearly half of all US workers fail to use all their allotted vacation days, according to a recent survey from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/30/how-americans-view-their-jobs/&quot;>;Pew Research Center&lt;/a>;.&amp;nbsp; The reasons they cite include having too much to do, concern about falling behind at work, and a reluctance to ask coworkers to cover their responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;/content>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 28 Aug 2023 21:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
