&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt; div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-retailers-can-capitalize-on-the-refund-effect?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023 /06/how-retailers-can-capitalize-on-the-refund-effect?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;产品退货给零售商带来了重大挑战。 2022 年，美国消费者返回 &lt;a href=&quot;https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/2022-retail-returns-rate-remains-flat-816-billion#:~:text=WASHINGTON% 20%E2%80%93%20Consumers%20are%20expected%20to,Retail%20Federation%20and%20Appriss%20Retail.&quot;>;16.5%&lt;/a>; 的商品购买，估计零售商的成本 &lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/2022-retail-returns-rate-remains-flat-816billion#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20Consumers%20are%20expected% 20to,Retail%20Federation%20and%20Appriss%20Retail。”收入损失超过 8160 亿美元。减少产品退货造成的收入损失的典型策略包括通过提供更多关于产品的信息（例如，评论和常见问题解答）来降低退货的可能性，以及增加退货消费者的财务和交易成本（例如，运输成本和有限的退货窗口） ).但前一种策略对零售商来说成本高昂，而后者对消费者来说成本高昂。我们最近的&lt;a href=&quot;https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcpy.1354&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;确定了一种有效的策略来减少这种对每个人都有利的收入损失：交叉- 在产品退货过程中销售产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在六个实验中，我们发现消费者将退款视为已经损失的钱，因此将这些资金用于另一次购买感觉不那么痛苦。与奖金相比，研究参与者更有可能从产品退款中花钱，甚至比意外收入（如彩票奖金和退税）更可能花钱。我们称之为“退款效应”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，在一项实验室实验中，我们给所有参与者 4 美元。一些参与者被要求用这笔钱购买一个压力球，他们后来得知他们可以退货，大多数人都这样做了。对照组中的其他人没有进行初始购买。然后，我们让每个人都有机会保留他们的 4 美元，或用它以折扣价购买 5 美元的星巴克礼品卡。只有 48% 的对照组用 4 美元购买了礼品卡，而收到退款的参与者中有 78% 购买了礼品卡。我们用一个在线样本重复了这项研究，其中退回的产品是来自大型零售商（即 Best Buy 或 Kohls）的礼品卡。在这个实验中，只有 10% 的对照组选择购买星巴克礼品卡，而 25% 的退款参与者使用它购买了星巴克礼品卡。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;了解动态的零售商退款效应——何时、为何以及如何运作——可以缓解该行业长期存在的头痛问题之一。以下是零售商在充分利用退款效果时应牢记的三个发现：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;交叉销售机会发生在退货过程中 — 在将钱重新发放到客户的原始付款方式之前。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在将钱退还到信用卡或支票账户后，退款效应不太可能促进销售。为什么？退款效果取决于创建和维护一个“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earmarking.asp&quot;>;earmark&lt;/a>;”，提醒消费者钱已经丢失。我们的研究发现，如果退还的钱与其他来源的钱汇集在一起​​，那么指定用途就会被取消，消费者的消费方式与其他来源的钱没有什么不同。例如，如果研究参与者尚未收到退款，他们更有可能使用一双运动鞋的退款来购买一件衬衫。如果钱已经存入他们的活期账户，他们购买 T 恤的可能性并不比仅仅在网上看到 T 恤的参与者高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些零售商已经有效地使用了这种交叉销售策略。默认情况下，亚马逊会询问客户是否愿意使用退货来购买礼品卡。拒绝此交叉销售的客户随后会收到退款。服装商 Todd Snyder 允许客户在邮寄退货之前使用退款立即购买其他产品。收到退货后，将发放剩余的退款。这些交叉销售策略可能会奏效，因为客户在从退货中获得退款之前先购买了退款。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;只有当消费者预计会赔钱时，退款效应才会发挥作用。&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们的研究表明，消费者最初必须期望保留他们购买的商品和服务，以创建使退款效果发挥作用的专用标记。 “先试后买”的策略，即消费者不希望为退回的商品付款，如果这些商品被退回，则不太可能产生退款效果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，研究参与者想象购买两双试穿的鞋子期望他们会退回一双，但与那些只是想象看到夹克并自掏腰包的对照组相比，他们更不可能将退款花在夹克上。相比之下，购买鞋子时不希望退货的参与者更有可能使用鞋子的退款来购买夹克&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;退款效应适用于所有类别。&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;因为退款感觉好像已经丢了，所以退款效果既适用于同品类的交叉销售产品，也适用于其他品类的产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于例如，第五项实验的研究参与者更有可能将一瓶退回的葡萄酒退回杂货店或运动休闲品牌的礼品卡上，而不是自掏腰包购买任何一种礼品卡。这对于提供一系列产品类别的零售商来说是个好消息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;产品退货过程中的追加销售和换货等销售策略应该同样受益于退款效应，并且它们可能比客户关系管理更好增加产品退货成本。新公司已经进入这个市场。例如，Loop Returns 帮助 Allbirds 和 Brooklinen 等 1,500 家 Shopify 商家在产品退货过程中交叉销售、追加销售和交换产品，节省了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loopreturns.com/the-ecommerce -returns-benchmark-report/&quot;>;28% 的收入&lt;/a>;否则会损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;零售商的教训？与其采用交易成本高昂的做法，&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0008125617741125&quot;>;有时会永久疏远客户&lt;/a>;，不如制定退货政策和做法退款效应可能是减少产品退货造成的收入损失的有效方式，对消费者和零售商都有利。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->;

&lt;p>;公司现在有了更多的选择，这要归功于更好的技术、创新的融资机制以及为满足当今需求而重新构想的旧方法。下面，我将解释该领域的五个最大发展。&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;新数字学徒制&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;中世纪如何实践正在推动成千上万的工人走上职业阶梯&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;学徒制可能是最古老的职场学习形式，可以追溯到远古时代，并以 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com /topic/apprenticeship&quot;>;一些杰出的校友&lt;/a>;，包括本杰明富兰克林。目前有超过 580,000 名在职学徒在美国工作——&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apprenticeship.gov/data-and-statistics&quot;>;在过去 10 年中增长了 103%&lt;/a>;，根据劳工部数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于一直努力填补重要职位的公司来说，学徒制可能是一种有效的解决方案。虽然学徒制&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/04/tanners-tailors-and-candlestick-makers-a-history-of-apprenticeships&quot;>;历史上&lt;/a>;与蓝领工作有关，它们越来越成为填补数字和技术领域白领工作的一种方式。 IT 和电信部门的学徒制增长超过in%202020%20there%20were%203%2C654%20registered%20学徒%20in%20telecommunications%20occupations%2C%20increasing%20over%20300%25%20in%20the%20last%20nine%20years.%20%5B2%5D&quot;>; 2011 年至 2020 年间增长了 300%&lt;/a>;，而网络安全学徒培训增长了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211027023746/https:/www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-industries/cybersecurity# :~:text=In%202020%2C%20there%20were%202%2C716%20registered%20apprentices%20in%20cybersecurity%20occupations%2C%20increasing%20over%20600%25%20in%20the%20last%20nine%20years%20 %5B2%5D.&quot;>;600%&lt;/a>;，根据劳工部的数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一趋势是由越来越多的公司推动的，其中许多专注于快速- 代表大型雇主招聘、支持和培训学徒的软件工程和数据科学等不断发展的领域。总部位于英国的供应商 Multiverse 最近&lt;a href=&quot;https://tcrn.ch/3H0ebPR&quot;>;估值&lt;/a>;为 17 亿美元，并声称已为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www. multiverse.io/en-US/blog/multiverse-community-reaches-10-000-apprentices-and-alumni&quot;>;10,000 名学徒&lt;/a>;。 “我们长期以来一直相信学徒制模式，我们发现它对技术和数字工作特别有效，”劳斯莱斯数字制造主管 Rashitha Jayasekara 说，该公司与 Multiverse 合作提高现有员工的技能。 “学徒通过编程马拉松和项目工作获得的体验式学习使他们能够以标准培训无法做到的方式将理论与实践结合起来，并不断发展我们在公司内需要的技能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Verizon，另一家Multiverse 客户，使用学徒制模型来填补软件工程职位和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multiverse.io/en-US/blog/creating-software-engineering-jobs-verizon&quot;>;报告&lt;/a>; 95% 的初始队列在完成学徒计划后接受了公司的全职工作。 Verizon 的首席信息官 Shankar Arumugavelu 说，Verizon 计划旨在“降低进入软件工作的门槛，同时培训真正优秀的软件开发人员，我们从根本上相信他们可以通过数字创新推动我们的业务发展”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学徒制并不适合所有培训需求。一方面，他们需要投入大量时间——在美国，正式的学徒制是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/apprenticeships_occupations-and-outlook.htm#:~ :text=Formal%20apprenticeship%20programs%20usually%20last,Department%20of%20Labor%20(DOL).&quot;>;通常为四年&lt;/a>;。在某些市场中，它们还可能受到限制性监管。例如，在英国，政府的学徒资助计划&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/365530295/Government-urged-to-address-broken-apprenticeship-levy-system&quot;>;已经批评&lt;/a>;过于死板，不符合雇主的需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;学费报销的新方法&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;历史上的精英如何受益所有人都可以访问&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;大公司长期以来一直愿意为员工的继续教育付费。然而，这些福利历来是为少数白领员工保留的，例如那些攻读行政 MBA 学位的人。或者要求员工自掏腰包支付课程费用，然后再报销。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于劳动力市场 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/ how-to-better-support-and-retain-frontline-workers&quot;>;改变了&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/02/companies-offer-tuition- assistance-so-workers-can-go-back-to-college.html&quot;>;更多公司&lt;/a>;正在提供学费福利，作为留住一线员工的一种方式——店员、咖啡师、司机和小时工。作为回应，出现了一类新的公司，以平滑和同步培训提供者、雇主、雇员和（在某些情况下）政府之间的关系。员工会得到指导、建议和支持，以帮助他们找到适合自己的培训计划，培训计划的费用由雇主支付。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，在 2021 年，Target 宣布了一项学费资助名为&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.target.com/article/2022/09/dream-to-be-anniversary#:~:text=Our%20%24200%20million%20investment%20in,skills% 20and%20build%20their%20careers.&quot;>;“Dream to Be&lt;/a>;”与 Guild 合作，Guild 是这个不断发展的领域的领先企业之一。根据首席多元化和包容性官 Kiera Fernandez 的说法，“Target 提供传统的学费报销计划已有二十多年了。现在，通过我们与 Guild 合作提供 Dream to Be，团队成员可以在 40 多所学校、学院和大学上课……无需自付费用。”费尔南德斯说，截至 2023 年 4 月，已有超过 25,000 名员工获准参加该计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果设计得当，学费援助计划对雇主的好处是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www. fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/human-resources/articles/tuition-reimbursement/&quot;>;清除&lt;/a>;。例如，休闲快餐连锁店 Chipotle 的首席财务官 Jack Hartung &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/04/09/chipotle-cfo-says-debt-free- degree-is-a-way-to-invest-in-employees.html&quot;>;告诉 CNBC&lt;/a>;，“利用公司免费学位的员工留在公司的可能性高出三倍半，并且晋升到管理层的可能性要高出七倍。”然而，研究表明，虽然 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180108006550/en/New-Study-Shows-Lasting-Impact-Tuition-Assistance#:~:text=84% 25%20say%20access%20to%20a%20tuition%20assistance%20program%20was%20important%20in%20their%20decision%20to%20join%20the%20company&quot;>;84%&lt;/a>; 的员工高度重视学费报销福利，在平均，&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/nulr/vol117/iss6/5/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20despite%20their%20increasing%20availability%2C%20only%202 %25%20of%20employees%2C%20as%20a%20percentage%20of%20those%20interested%20in%20pursuing%20further%20education%2C%20are%20utilizing%20these%20reimbursement%20programs&quot;>;只有 2%&lt;/a>;符合条件的员工使用此福利。这意味着雇主必须采取更多措施来利用这一强大的工具。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;向学习体验平台的转变&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;员工如何知道接下来要学习什么&lt;/ h3>; &lt;p>;组织和跟踪员工正在学习的内容可能是一项繁琐的任务。多年来，这项工作一直由称为“学习管理系统”(LMS) 的软件完成，这是一种相对简单的工具，用于存储学习材料，通常以演示文稿、视频和文本的形式。大多数大公司 &lt;a href=&quot;https://trainingmag.com/2021-training-industry-report/#:~:text=Some%2098%20percent%20of%20large%20companies%20and%2096%20percent%20of% 20midsize%20ones%20currently%20use%20LMSs%20vs.%2080%20percent%20of%20small%20companies.&quot;>;有一个&lt;/a>;，但员工很少&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/网站/kevinkruse/2021/04/27/学位的使用是传统学习平台的两倍/?sh=58ba9a1a2d3d#:~:text=most%20LMS%20and%20online%20content% 20companies%20only%20see%205%25%20to%2015%25%20of%20licensed%20seats%20used%20in%20any%20given%20month.&quot;>;花很多时间&lt;/a>;在他们身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;在过去几年中，新一波工具将 LMS 转变为“学习体验平台”(LXP)，具有技能评估、Netflix 风格的下一步学习建议以及内部社交网络等功能。 LXP“让学习与个人相关，而不仅仅是管理培训计划，”Degreed 战略高级副总裁 Todd Tauber 表示，Degreed 是该领域的领先供应商之一。行业分析师 Josh Bersin 估计 LXP 市场为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2022/06/corporate-learning-bombshel​​l-degreed-acquires-learnin-david-blake-returns/&quot;>;5 亿美元， &lt;/a>; 从 &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2018/07/edcast-expands-the-lxp-market-with-focus-on-global-upskilling/&quot;>;2 亿美元&lt;/a >; 2018 年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;客户报告该模型正在运行。 Chris Harry 是 TEK Systems 的首席学习官，这是一家一直在使用 Degreed 的人力资源公司。 “自从将我们的各种员工发展计划转移到 Degreed 上以来，我们已经看到了有史以来最高的参与度和满意度，”他说。根据 Harry 的说法，96% 的 TEK 员工都在 Degreed 中创建了一个帐户，公司始终看到其中 40% 到 50% 的员工每个月都在积极使用该平台，他说这“远远高于我们之前看到的任何东西”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像这样的结果需要真正的投资，而不仅仅是购买技术。对于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.degreed.com/hubfs/Client%20Case%20Studies/Ericsson/Ericsson+Degreed%20Case%20Study_Q2-22_EN-US.pdf?utm_campaign=Ericsson%20Case%20Study%20May% 20%2722&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=214005662&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_8Z515BnP5WAJI5xGCg8ZF2Zi2ftiYmmfHEKikOYkDheoBPQzXBzi5mM6FOcyAZGppjQgdYXltDyoeVVC1bEnUM 8xfnubGHUldzPilsSLH3Yk90&amp;amp;utm_content=214005662&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_automation&quot;>;示例&lt;/a>;，另一家 Degreed 客户爱立信表示，它聘请了内部拥护者并开发了广泛的内部营销&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;教练的民主化&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;我们所有人如何才能拥有一个夏尔巴协作我们的职业&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;专业教练是一种&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-12395-008&quot;>;易于理解&lt;/a>;的促进员工学习的方式、信心和有效性。然而，它通常是 &lt;a href=&quot;/2009/01/what-c​​an-coaches-do-for-you#:~:text=they%E2%80%99re%20usually%20called%20executive%20coaches% 2C%20and%20they%20can%20earn%20up%20to%20%243%2C500%20an%20hour.&quot;>;昂贵&lt;/a>;工具，仅供高级管理人员使用。此外，即使对于那些负担得起的人来说，寻找教练也可能是一个挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新平台的出现利用技术让寻找、匹配教练以及与教练合作变得更加容易。新公司提供工具来评估每个员工对教练的需求，为他们匹配具有合适经验和专业知识的教练，甚至通过数字平台进行辅导课程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;空间正在扩大。根据国际教练联合会的数据，2021 年有 &lt;a href=&quot;https://coachfederation.org/app/uploads/2020/09/FINAL_ICF_GCS2020_ExecutiveSummary.pdf&quot;>;71,000&lt;/a>; 名执业教练，比 2016 年增长 33% . 投资者预计增长将继续：领先的数字教练初创公司 BetterUp 在 2021 年以 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterup&quot;>;50 亿美元的估值&lt;/a>; 筹集了 3 亿美元&lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2022/01/online-coaching-is-so-hot-its-now-disrupting-leadership-development/&quot;>;投资&lt;/a>;浪潮的一部分教练初创公司。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种增长的很大一部分是由大公司为员工提供更广泛的教练服务所推动的。总部位于法国的食品公司达能一直在与供应商 CoachHub 合作，为 250 名员工提供这项福利。荷兰达能多元化和包容性负责人马克西姆·奥朗德 (Maxime Hollande) 表示，“这些辅导课程为员工带来了巨大的附加值……我们密切关注的指标之一是每位员工在实现个人目标方面取得的进展程度他们与他们的教练一起定义。该指标的平均分为 4.9 分（满分 5 分）。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国全球能源公司雪佛龙 (Chevron) 通过 BetterUp 为其全球 7,000 名经理提供了辅导课程。 “在 BetterUp 之前，我们利用了各种内部教练资源和多个外部教练供应商，”雪佛龙首席人力资源官 Rhonda Morris 解释说。 “BetterUp 的虚拟教练模式……使我们的教练文化更加成熟，让所有想要它的人都能更容易地使用它。&amp;nbsp;教练不再需要出差去见我们的员工。我们的员工对他们在 BetterUp 的积极体验直言不讳。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于辅导课程本质上是私人体验，因此雇主可能很难确保关注对他们来说最重要的主题。在雪佛龙，他们每个季度都通过要求员工对接受过辅导的领导者的效率进行评分来衡量成功与否。 “领导效能一直是我们组织中得分最高的类别之一，”莫里斯说。 “这表明我们的 BetterUp 产品正在对我们的员工队伍和文化产生积极影响。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;基于队列的课程的兴起&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;如何构建在线真技能&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;谈到在线学习，大多数参与者&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7958&quot;>;没有完成&lt;/a >; 他们开始的课程，主要是因为学习体验是异步的。个人必须有纪律和勤奋，才能独立完成大量的学习材料。这在今天的工作场所尤其困难，会议和分心的次数已经&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/great-expectations-making-hybrid -work-work&quot;>;近年来激增&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，一种名为“&lt;a href=&quot;https://future.com/cohort-based-courses/&quot; >;基于队列的课程&lt;/a>;”已成为提高完成率的一种方式。一组参与者一起参加一门课程，课程有明确的开始和结束日期、定期的家庭作业，并由一位讲师主持定期的在线在线讨论会。在这种更加结构化的形式中，参与者仍然可以在自己的时间访问大部分学习材料，从而使他们更容易完成课程并有机会在课程期间应用所学知识。这个领域的先驱之一 altMBA 表示，它的学习者已经取得了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/behavior-design/how-to-design-an-online-course-with-a-96 -completion-rate-180678117a85&quot;>;96% 的完成率&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boston Consulting Group (BCG) 是采用队列课程的领先雇主，与 Emeritus 合作（我在那里工作）。 BCG 全球学习和团队执行总监 Lidia Juszko 描述了这种模式如何特别适合像她这样的专业服务公司。 “我们发现，基于队列的课程提供了一定程度的结构和支持，使它们比标准在线学习更具吸引力，”她说。 “我们的同事报告说，与讲师的‘办公时间’、与其他学员的现场讨论会以及每周完成的短视频和练习的组合和节奏是他们更容易学习的方式。像这样的学习和发展机会让我们能够继续吸引和留住最优秀的人才。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全球银行业组织汇丰银行最近也开始试行基于队列的在线课程，早期结果令人鼓舞.人力资源全球主管 David Morris 表示：“鉴于我们市场的范围和复杂性，我们面临的挑战之一是以在线形式提供深度学习。我们的早期结果表明，基于队列的在线形式在完成度、信心和能力等关键指标方面取得了显着改善。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种形式的缺点是使其有效的实时学习元素来了付出巨大的代价。标准在线课程开放图书馆的单一许可费用约为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/comparing-subscription-pricing-2023.png&quot;每月 >;30 到 60 美元&lt;/a>; 即可访问数千门课程（大多数供应商还提供大量折扣）。同时，基于队列的课程的费用可能介于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2021/12/17/how-cohort-based-learning-is-transforming-online-education/ #:~:text=Another%20notable%20difference%20is%20the%20price%3B%20cohort%20based%20courses%20can%20range%20anywhere%20from%20%24500%20up%20to%20more%20than%20%245% 2C000。”>;每门课程 500 美元和 5,000 美元&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;。&lt;/em>;这意味着基于群组的学习不太可能成为所有员工的选择，雇主必须谨慎决定谁能从中受益最多。&lt;/em>; p>; &lt;p>;我们正处于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2022/12/02/many-indicators-imply-a-2023-recession-the-jobs- market-disagrees/&quot;>;不寻常的&lt;/a>;经济形势，经济衰退的担忧加剧，但就业市场&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/b1b710a1-6d12-43e5-8508- ae4584a7289a&quot;>;仍然紧张&lt;/a>;。由于培训预算不可避免地&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1812542/half-organisations-looking-cut-ld-costs-amid-economic-difficulty-survey-reveals&quot;>;受到限制压力&lt;/a>;，组织将需要找到更有针对性的方法来解决他们的技能差距。上述五种方法可以帮助公司超越 MOOC，找到适合其员工的学习计划。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;总的来说，美国对患有慢性病的贫困老人的照顾还有很多不足之处。 PACE 是一种全面、综合、以社区为基础的护理方法，可以让老年人尽可能长时间地继续住在家里，可以作为改善这一人群需求的典范。本文介绍了 PACE Southeast Michigan，一个出色的 PACE 项目。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;美国医疗保健系统的建立并不是为了改善最脆弱、长期患病、老人，尤其是穷人。年长的穷人经常面临&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016701/&quot;>;孤独、抑郁&lt;/a>;目标感丧失以及无力独立生活在自己的家中。他们还遇到许多医疗服务障碍，包括护理协调不足、&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/how-to-pay-for-health-care&quot;>;按服务付费&lt;/a>;，这通常会反射性地鼓励医疗优于其他形式的护理，以及&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2759755&quot;>;功能失调&lt;/a>;疗养院行业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;帮助为了改善对这些患者的服务，我们分析了一项名为 PACE 的国家计划的设计和实施：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/Medicare-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare-and-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare- Medicaid-Coordination-Office/PACE/PACE&quot;>;老年人综合护理计划&lt;/a>;。我们专注于此计划，因为所有 PACE 参与者都很脆弱：他们需要疗养院级别的护理，并且 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npaonline.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/Issue%20Brief_Medicaid%20Rate% 20Setting%20for%20PACE%202.21.pdf&quot;>;90%&lt;/a>; 有资格享受医疗保险和医疗补助。&lt;em>;&lt;/em>;很少有综合护理计划为这一双重资格人群提供服务，现在人数 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/a-profile-of-medicare-medicaid-enrollees-dual- eligibles/#:~:text=The%2012.5%20million%20people%20who,from%20their%20state%20Medicaid%20program.&quot;>;1250 万&lt;/a>;美国人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深入采访由我们两人（Len Berry 和 Sunjay Letchuman）主持的 PACE 工作人员和项目参与者；与 PACE 领导人合作，包括本文的两位合著者（Mary Kummer Naber 和 Peter Fitzgerald）；我们对密歇根州东南部 PACE 模式（由 Mary 领导）的特点和日常运营进行的集体分析揭示了 PACE 如何成功地为贫困老年人提供个性化的、以家庭为中心的护理，同时降低总体成本。鉴于 PACE 目前仅服务于其中约 60,000 名患者，扩大该计划对全国医疗保健系统具有有益的管理和成本影响。尽管疗养院和其他制度化的养老服务显然需要改进，但美国也必须投资重新构想养老服务。 PACE 提供了一个路线图。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;更全面、成本更低的护理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PACE 计划于 1973 年在旧金山首次开发，是一个全面、综合、以社区为基础的护理模式，让老年人尽可能长时间地继续住在家里。现在在 32 个州有 150 个 PACE 项目。基本理念是，护理应包括对老年穷人最重要的事情：包括营养、社交互动、交通和家庭保养在内的全包式护理，以及医疗和相关服务。目标是让患者有尊严地接受治疗，因为他们安全地住在家里，而不是在机构中，并从一个实体获得所有需要的服务——同时降低成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所有需要疗养院级别的 Medicare 受益人照顾但希望住在家里的人有资格获得 PACE。但是，不符合所在州医疗补助收入要求的医疗保险受益人必须支付相当于每月医疗补助付款的金额，这限制了数百万可以从该计划中受益的老年人的使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该计划为患者提供（称为“参与者”）他们所有的 Medicare 和 Medicaid 承保的福利，包括初级保健、成人日托、康复护理和在当地 PACE 中心的膳食。 PACE 提供交通和各种家庭服务，并支付其无法在内部提供的医疗服务，例如急诊室就诊和住院治疗。 PACE 组织由 Medicare 和 Medicaid 按月支付风险调整后按人头计算的费用，这意味着他们支付 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-education/american-indian-alaska- native/aian/ltss-ta-center/info/pace#:~:text=The%20program%20receives%20capitaated%20reimbursements,each%20patient%20the%20program%20serves.&quot;>;每月固定金额&lt;/a>;部分基于参与者的医疗复杂性。 PACE 计划承担所有护理的全部财务风险，参与者无需自付费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可用 &lt;a href=&quot;https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs .12637&quot;>;证据&lt;/a>;表明 PACE 降低了医疗保健的利用率和成本。与类似人群相比，PACE 参与者的住院率要低得多（每 1,000 人住院率 539 对 962 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430746/&quot;>;人年&lt; /a>;）。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/68/1/47/549686?login=true&quot;>;南卡罗来纳州&lt;/a>;相比之下，每位 PACE 参与者每年可节省近 9,000 美元与疗养院等替代性长期护理机构的居民一起； &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.wyo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SFY-2020-Wyoming-Medicaid-Annual-Report.pdf&quot;>;怀俄明州&lt;/a>;每个 PACE 节省超过 12,000 美元参与者。然而，PACE 远不止是省钱——它是为了恢复人们生活的尊严和快乐。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;一个典型的模型&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一个出色的 PACE 计划是 PACE Southeast Michigan (PACE SEMI)，国家 PACE 协会将其确定为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npaonline.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/2018%20AC%20PowerPoint.pdf&quot;>;“亮点”&lt;/a>; 因其增长和质量指标。 PACE SEMI 是一家免税非营利组织，由 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henryford.com/&quot;>;Henry Ford Health&lt;/a>; (55%) 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.pvm.org/&quot;>;密歇根长老会村庄&lt;/a>; (45%)。 PACE SEMI 拥有 7 个中心，为 1,600 名参与者提供服务并雇用 700 名员工，平均每月增加 30 名参与者的净注册人数，而全国 PACE 中心每月只有两名参与者。与 &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/9739cab65ad0221a66ebe45463d10d37/dual-eligible-beneficiaries- integrated-care.pdf&quot;>;25%&lt;/a>; 全国 PACE 参与者和 31% 的 Medicare Advantage 参保者。 PACE SEMI 参与者使用住院医院服务的频率也较低：2019 年，PACE SEMI 参与者减少了 302 &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service -type-reports/cms-program-statistics-medicare-advantage-inpatient-hospital&quot;>;每 1,000 人的住院率&lt;/a>; 与 Medicare Advantage 参保者相比。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PACE 模型建立在跨学科团队合作的基础上。所有 PACE SEMI 员工都应将自己视为身体、心理、情感和精神上的“治疗师”。他们包括强调预防疾病和伤害的初级保健医生，协调护理的护士和社会工作者，对可能对特定患者弊大于利的处方药保持警惕的现场药剂师，厨房厨师根据参与者的口味和过敏情况定制膳食的人，为日常活动（包括淋浴）提供支持性护理的参与者护理助理，以及将参与者往返 PACE 中心和其他重要目的地的司机。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与某些 PACE 计划不同，PACE SEMI 在每个中心都有行为健康和精神护理专家，他们了解他们所服务的每个参与者。在一位 PACE 医生提到的一个案例中，一位精神护理提供者要求诊所工作人员立即检查一名看起来“不正常”的病人。原来病人中风了，很快就得到了救命的救治。在一个不那么引人注目的案例中，一名社会工作者亲自说服当地一家 Trader Joe&#39;s 商店每周捐赠鲜花供参与者带回家。团队成员每周举行一次会议，在会上每个人都对如何避免可避免的急诊室就诊和提高参与者的生活质量发表平等的意见。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;全人护理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PACE 模型的核心是基于关系：参与者和工作人员彼此非常了解，这有助于为每个人量身定制“全人治疗”。事实上，成员之所以被称为“参与者”，正是因为他们在规划他们的护理方面发挥了积极作用，这远远超出了医疗服务，并且直面许多独居老年人所忍受的孤立。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天在 PACE SEMI 中心，包括所需的医疗和康复服务，并充满定制活动，例如音乐、绘画、游戏、与朋友共进早餐和午餐，以及参与者分享“我感激的事情”的定期小组会议，培养一种归属感和社区。参与者可以洗头、剪发和定型。他们接受有关在家中安全生活的指导，并获得专为老年人设计的 iPad（称为“GrandPads”），让他们可以轻松联系家人或 PACE 工作人员或玩游戏。厨房准备食物供参与者在一天结束时带回家。参与者还可以使用配备物理和职业治疗师的现场健身房。 （“看到一个 90 岁的老人锻炼身体真是太棒了，”一位治疗师说。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Dancing Kathy”坐在轮椅上来到 PACE SEMI。在康复人员的帮助下，她最终学会了助行器，几个月后，她学会了使用拐杖。在加入 PACE 一年后接受采访时，凯西说她大部分时间不再需要手杖，现在可以跳舞了。然后，她与几名工作人员一起在自助餐厅午餐人群面前跳“Hustle”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;积极投资于健康&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;大多数巨大的美国在医疗保健上的花费是被动的。病人生病了，随之而来的是治疗，产生了费用。 PACE 显示了主动投资于健康，而不仅仅是医疗保健的潜力。 PACE SEMI 和其他运行良好的 PACE 计划几乎可以做任何事情来帮助人们继续安全地生活在家里。例如，如果参与者在家中需要一把淋浴椅以防止跌倒，PACE SEMI 会购买并安装这把椅子，并教参与者如何使用它。 PACE SEMI 利用社区筹款筹集的资金修复门廊和楼梯、更换加热器、改善照明，甚至根除臭虫。它与救护车服务合作，救护车服务的护理人员经常提供家庭护理，以防止急诊就诊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此类支出可以极大地改善人们的生活质量，同时降低下游成本。 PACE SEMI 的参与者之一，“先生。 B，”曾是一名音乐家，但现在独自生活。每周离开 PACE 中心后，B 先生都会因心理健康相关问题和焦虑症而经常去急诊室就诊。 PACE 工作人员发现 B 先生生活中缺少音乐后，中心为他买了耳机和播放器，让他可以听自己喜欢的音乐。急诊就诊停止了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;全心服务&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PACE SEMI 的秘诀在于其文化。雇用护理人员，而不仅仅是能力，与对员工进行集中培训以区分非医疗治疗和医疗干预一样重要。一些具有传统医疗保健背景的工作人员必须“忘掉”他们对偶发性护理的偏见。在与弱势群体打交道时，工作人员必须超越风险规避，这在机构老年护理中很常见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如 Atul Gawande 在 &lt;a href=&quot;https: //atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/&quot;>;&lt;em>;终有一死&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;：“……我们的老年人只能在受控制和监督的机构中生存，这是针对无法解决的问题的医学设计答案，一种旨在安全但没有任何他们关心的东西的生活。”凭借创造力、同情心和承诺，经过精心挑选、训练有素且自身受到尊严对待的员工可以向 PACE 参与者灌输尊严、归属感，甚至快乐。正如 PACE SEMI 的食品服务人员 Renee 所说，“我们为食物增添了爱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PACE 是关于投资于人们的福祉，尽可能长时间地保持他们的健康可能的。它为老年人提供了在家中享受更高质量护理和生活的机会。目前的模式主要服务于低收入的老年人；然而，更大的机会是将其扩大到包括所有患有慢性病的老年人。这些模型将有助于国会&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/congress-considers-strategies-improve-medicare-and-medicaid-integration-dual-eligible&quot;>;工艺立法&lt; /a>; 扩大 PACE，因为医疗保健组织计划如何有效地启动 PACE 计划，并且随着计划负责人和经理寻求开发护理的具体细节，为患者提供治疗并激励员工。&lt;/p>; &lt; !-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Your Love for Work May Alienate Your Colleagues]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/research-your-love-for-work-may-alienate-your-colleagues]]><description> &lt;div>;

— 更有激情的员工更有生产力、创新性和协作性，并且他们对组织表现出更高水平的承诺。对于渴望实现持续增长、创新和成功的组织而言，培养热情是制胜法宝。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，在追求培养热情的过程中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org /doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2020.1761?af=R&quot;>;我们最近的研究&lt;/a>;表明，雇主可能忽视并忽视了员工的需求，这些需求是由其他动力来源驱动的，例如财务稳定性、社会地位、或家庭义务。这些员工&lt;a href=&quot;/2003/06/lets-hear-it-for-b-players&quot;>;在他们公司的成功中发挥着关键作用&lt;/a>;，但可能会因为以下原因而受到无形的惩罚他们认为自己对工作缺乏热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;做自己喜欢的事会让你“道德化”热爱自己的工作&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们的研究涉及 1,245 名全职员工对规模和行业各不相同的几个组织的调查揭示了当代工作场所的一个新现象：人们越热爱自己的工作，就越将其视为一种道德责任。对工作更有热情的员工更强烈地同意“为个人享受而工作在道德上是美德”和“内在动机是道德的”这样的句子。对于这些人来说，热爱自己的工作除了个人成就感之外还有道德意义，他们更有可能根据自己的道德标准来判断同事的工作动机，或者问，“我的同事来这里是为了&lt;em>;正确的&lt;/em>;理由吗？ ?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;将热爱工作作为一种道德义务的强调具有深远的影响。我们的研究表明，那些更热爱工作的人也更有可能不喜欢为外部奖励而工作。赞同“内在动机是道德的”这样的句子的人也认同“只为金钱而工作的人不是有道德的员工”和“受外部奖励激励的员工往往是不道德的”这样的句子。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;至关重要的是，我们发现了这些性格判断的后果。更热爱工作的员工也会优先帮助更有热情的同事，他们认为这些同事在道德上更优越。相比之下，因其他原因工作的员工从更有热情的同事那里得到的帮助较少，这使他们更难在组织中晋升，并更有可能被排除在重要项目之外。这种待遇会对员工士气、保留和整体组织绩效产生严重后果。相比之下，为获得外部奖励而工作的员工平等对待他们的同事，无论他们为什么工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;创造重视员工多样化动机的环境&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;管理者需要意识到，重视激情的组织会给一些员工带来疏远感。承认和庆祝所有员工的独特贡献，无论他们的潜在动机如何，将有助于在您的员工中建立归属感和目标感，从而提高敬业度和生产力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经理还应该努力培养开放和包容的工作场所文化，员工可以自在地讨论他们的动机和目标，即使他们与激情驱动的精神不一致。这既可以鼓励不同工作动机的员工之间进行对话，也可以为员工提供在工作场所内外探索和发展激情的机会。例如，指导、网络关系或工作重塑（即花更多时间在对他们更有意义的任务上）可以让员工接触到他们可能更感兴趣的角色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您是一名员工谁热爱他们的工作，请记住，这可能会让你对你的同事更有判断力，并影响你帮助他们的程度。不是每个人都需要做这项工作，因为他们对此充满热情。一些员工可能需要照顾家人，需要福利作为安全网，或者尚未发现他们对工作的真正热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，组织应该检查他们的福利和津贴是否对具有不同背景的员工具有吸引力动机。虽然一些员工可能会因为对工作充满热情而被工作吸引，但其他员工可能会因为灵活的工作安排或获得职业发展机会而受到激励。通过提供一系列福利和津贴，领导者可以创造一个吸引具有不同动机的员工并帮助留住顶尖人才的工作场所。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管人们普遍认为激情是成功的关键，但所有员工都应该受到赞赏他们是谁以及他们如何做出贡献——无论他们的工作动机如何。领导者应该认识到驱动员工的多样化动机，并创造一个支持和重视所有形式动机的包容性环境，而不是惩罚那些不符合以激情为中心模式的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Apple&rsquo;s Vision Pro Really For?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/what-is-apples-vision-pro-really-for]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;你应该用空间计算机做什么？目前，Apple 已经概述了看似平淡无奇的用例。您可以像普通计算机或 iPad 一样使用它，但当前的 2D 信息会显示在更加灵活和不受约束的显示器上。有这样的需求。如果您没有太多空间，这将很有价值。对于那些目前使用大量大型显示器的空间的人来说，这将是有价值的。从这个意义上说，最接近的类似物是超大屏幕电视。人们会为此支付 3,500 美元吗？他们现在就这样做。甚至 Apple 也销售售价高达 6,000 美元的显示器（Pro Display XDR）。从这个角度来看，它很容易在当前用例的成本范围内。这种策略还有一个好处，即为这个新平台播种 iPad 和 iPhone 已经存在的大量应用程序。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;让我们回顾一下这些概念.增强现实（或 AR）涉及获取您周围的环境并改变您对它的看法。谷歌眼镜通过智能眼镜向您显示通知来做到这一点。 Vision Pro 通过将 2D 显示器放置在该环境中并固定它们来实现这一点，这样当您的头部移动时，显示器就不会移动。它似乎存在于您当前的环境中。这是通过将真实世界的非常准确的视频通过设备传递给您来实现的。你没有直接看到你的环境，但你认为你正在这样做。因此，从技术上讲，Apple 正在增强您所处环境的视频捕获，而不是在您直接观看时叠加内容。对于用户来说，没有真正的区别。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;; :276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;虚拟现实（或 VR）涉及让用户沉浸在虚拟环境中。 Vision Pro 会吸引您的全部注意力，因此您会沉浸在虚拟环境中。在一种模式下，这看起来就像你实际所处的环境。转动表盘，它会改变，你可以被传送到其他地方。来自您当前环境的视频直通被数字创建的 3D 环境所取代。从这个角度来看，这显然是一个 VR 设备。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;需要注意的重要一点是，尽管能够支持 AR 和 VR，但 Apple 并未强调这些用例。因此，他们生产了一种能够同时具备这两种功能的设备，但在任何一个领域都没有找到令人信服的用例。这是他们在年度开发者大会上宣布它的原因之一。 Apple 需要应用程序，他们需要其他人想象它们。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;

&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;大多数决策都涉及某种程度的不确定性。信息是解决这个问题的良方，它能让你了解更多，从而减少错误。但是在决策中使用信息有两个方面。首先，您需要获得正确的信息。其次，您需要有认知空间来提炼和解析有用的信息。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;;

:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;相比之下，AR 将信息呈现在一个给定的上下文并解析它以产生相关的信息。例如，当您在会议上遇到某人时，它可以识别该人是谁，而无需您搜索自己的记忆。或者，如果您正在处理火灾，它可以提供有用的逃生路线覆盖图。在每种情况下，目标都是从用户环境中提取大量信息并呈现所需信息。需要注意的一件事是，Vision Pro 并不是一款可以在家庭或工作场所之外使用的便携式计算机，这限制了它在导航外部环境（例如驾车时）中的适用性。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;This perspective highlights why many previous AR and VR purported use cases have been of low value. VR meetings with avatars in pretty rooms do not provide information that is obviously more useful to those in the meetings that might arise from a Zoom call. AR glasses that provide text notifications as you walk around are increasing your cognitive load rather than decreasing it. Our framework suggests that the best use cases will be in contexts where it is normally expensive or dangerous to get information, highlighting the value of VR, or where the environment is so complex that the value of digital overlays to clarify it via AR is high &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;— &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;or both. Think applications like prototyping the design of a new aircraft or building, or assisting in remote medical procedures. The Vision Pro exhibits capabilities of being able to do each of these things but the job of experimenting and designing for these use cases has been left to others. Developers looking to profit off the platform Apple has created would do well to focus on applications that provide users with hard-to-access contextual information at just the right level of detail.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;This is par for the course for Apple when they first introduce a device. The iPod was a digital walkman. The iPhone was a connected iPod. The iPad was a bigger iPhone. The Apple Watch was a better smartwatch. And the Vision Pro is an unconstrained 3D screen. In the previous cases, the device is outgrown and becomes more than that initial use by enabling developer innovation.

They can impact team performance, collaboration, and productivity, create operational friction among teams, and cause employees to feel disengaged, distrustful, and unmotivated. While conflict at work is inevitable, we often have our own agency to proactively root out problems and stop them from escalating swiftly with empathy, accountability, self-awareness, and courage. The author, a Chief People Officer, offers five steps to do this: 1) Root out toxic behavior and tensions, 2) seek to understand, not just be understood, 3) assess the right time to intervene, 4) ask for help, and 5) repair harm; repair trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-proactively-defuse-tension-on-your-team?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-proactively-defuse-tension-on-your-team?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As a chief people officer, I have seen firsthand how unaddressed and unresolved interpersonal tensions and toxic behavior can lead to organizational failure. A subtle racial slight, an argument over a project&#39;s deliverables, or gossip over perceived unfair advantages can negatively impact team performance, collaboration, and productivity, create operational friction among teams, and cause employees to feel disengaged, distrustful, and unmotivated. These issues can arise due to various factors, including differences in personality and perspectives, racial,&amp;nbsp;class&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>; and gender privilege, work and communication styles, power imbalances, and/or lack of transparency and clarity over work processes and business goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/how-to-navigate-conflict-with-a-coworker&quot;>;interpersonal conflict at work is inevitable&lt;/a>;, we often forget our own agency to root out problems and stop them from escalating swiftly with empathy, accountability, self-awareness, and courage. Doing so can feel scary and dangerous, especially when you&#39;re a junior team member or belong to one or more underrepresented groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, a young woman of color, a rising star at my organization, expressed reservations about joining a new team that could significantly advance her career. During a conversation with the team&#39;s manager, she was troubled when he made an insensitive remark about what he perceived as racial segregation of employees at a social event. Concerned about her career and the potential for a racially hostile or uncomfortable work environment where this manager may not respect her identity and experiences, she sought guidance from her HR business partner, who directed her to me.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We discussed her desired outcome of joining the team while holding the manager accountable for the impact of his words and encouraging improvements in his behavior. I offered her the choice of addressing the issue directly or receiving support from me in the conversation, prioritizing her safety and dignity. After careful consideration, she chose to engage directly. I coached her on how to express herself confidently and thoughtfully. Subsequently, she shared a positive outcome—the manager demonstrated empathy, offered a genuine apology, and committed to openly acknowledging the dismissive comments with the entire team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the experience of this employee and many others I&#39;ve coached throughout my career, here are five actions that you&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;can take to reduce or stop interpersonal tensions and toxic behavior if you witness or experience harm in the workplace:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Identify the root cause of the tension.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When dealing with interpersonal friction in the workplace, the first step is to identify the root causes — the true sources of tension. In her book, &lt;em>;The Fearless Organization&lt;/em>;, Amy Edmondson explores the cost of a lack of psychological safety in organizations, including toxic work environments, burnout, and human capital loss.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Removing unhealthy behaviors that reduce individuals&#39; and teams&#39; safety, comfort, and performance requires us to face what needs to be changed. Power imbalances and differences of opinion over how to run a project, which partners to engage with, and performance measures are often the root cause of misunderstandings, disagreements, and collaboration collapse. In those situations, junior employees, women of color, and underrepresented employees are often afraid to speak up about conflict for fear of retaliation or being judged negatively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above example, the root cause of tension was the manager&#39;s racially insensitive comment, leading to concerns about a potentially hostile or uncomfortable work environment, lack of respect, and disregard for the lived experiences of this woman of color and others. By approaching such situations with support, empathy, and courage, we can uncover and address the underlying causes of tensions and prevent them from negatively impacting individuals&#39; well-being and professional development. It&#39;s important to recognize that this approach may not always be feasible or safe. In this case, the employee trusted that I would intervene if the conversation veered off course.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Seek to understand, not just be understood.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Professional relationships are human relationships fraught with shared misunderstandings. A wrongly placed, unintentional word in a stressful moment, especially those fed by gender and racial biases, can drive a deep wedge between coworkers. To build shared understanding, it is important to hold space for others&#39; opinions, empathize with complex and nuanced situations, and take responsibility for nurturing a sense of safety and trust among colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this instance, the manager embraced the opportunity to connect, learn, and grow, seeking to comprehend the impact of their words and actions instead of adopting a defensive stance. This response demonstrated a willingness to acknowledge mistakes and make an effort to change without fearing appearing incompetent or being canceled. Rather than deflecting or bemoaning leadership challenges, the manager prioritized their team&#39;s well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By helping the manager see and understand her concerns, the employee demonstrated a remarkable level of empathy. Though it would have been fair for her to write off this manager, she recognized the opportunity for growth and engaged in a constructive dialogue. This approach allowed her to assert her agency in addressing the manager&#39;s lack of awareness regarding insensitive comments. She chose to model a collaborative approach where others could learn and improve.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their interaction vividly demonstrated the transformative power of open, safe, and trusting communication, highlighting the remarkable potential for positive change when both parties approach tricky, uncomfortable conversations with an authentic intention to understand and be understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Assess the right time to intervene.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Saying something and not saying something are both choices that carry profound consequences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, an intervention can occur in the moment or shortly after that. If you&#39;re alone with someone who has just shared an offensive, denigrating, or derogatory comment and feel at risk of saying something that may be misunderstood or weaponized against you, wait until there are others around that can offer support or report it to HR or an anonymous hotline. Alternatively, if you feel comfortable, you can try saying, “When you said ___, I felt ____” or “I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t mean it, but that comment didn&#39;t land well on me.” The person receiving the feedback may need to be made aware of the impact of their words and actions. Waiting too long risks negative feelings lingering and growing within yourself and others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Had the employee not shared her concerns, or had the manager responded defensively and retaliated, it would have resulted in a missed opportunity to cultivate a healthy and thriving workplace environment. Moreover, it could have perpetuated a culture of fear and burdened her and other employees who share similar fears, ultimately hindering their growth and well-being throughout their careers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Ask for help.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As I advanced in my career, I yearned for leaders who would use their position of authority to challenge toxic behavior. As I assumed leadership roles myself, I realized the responsibility fell on me to exemplify the behaviors I desired.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you lack guidance from a manager or leader on navigating tricky situations or your organization&#39;s conflict resolution, grievance, and disciplinary procedures, turn to your HR team. I understand the hesitation in reaching out, especially if your relationship with HR isn&#39;t strong. Nevertheless, HR is there to advocate for employee voice, agency, and safety. They can assist you in gathering information, understanding root causes, and determining appropriate actions. An HR partner can facilitate constructive dialogue, coach you and others involved, and find proactive solutions to address behavioral issues. It&#39;s important to approach this option carefully, as it may intensify tensions or discomfort among team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/diversity%20and%20inclusion/women%20in%20the%20workplace%202022/women-in-the-workplace-2022.pdf&quot;>;Women in the Workplace 2022&lt;/a>;, LeanIn and McKinsey&#39;s annual report about the state of women in corporate America, women overall, and Black women and women with disabilities in particular, frequently experience microaggressions at work, such as having their judgment questioned or receiving criticism for their demeanor. Seeking support from the resources available in the workplace can make a significant difference in fostering a thriving and healthy career. Holding colleagues, managers, and leadership accountable is crucial in addressing and mitigating these harmful experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this example, the employee approached HR for coaching to navigate this complex situation. By utilizing available resources, she empowered herself to address the issue effectively, making a significant difference in her experience and that of others on the team. Her proactive approach, seeking assistance, being open to feedback, and engaging in self-reflection, played a pivotal role in achieving a positive outcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Repair harm; repair trust.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Repeated acts of harm, such as subtle &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/research-the-real-time-impact-of-microaggressions&quot;>;microaggressions&lt;/a>;, can weigh heavily on well-being, workplace satisfaction, and productivity. To heal from interpersonal tensions that arise from misunderstandings, misaligned perspectives or expectations, hurtful language, abuses of power, or breaches of trust, the person harmed must feel heard, respected, and valued.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Kay Pranis, a national leader in restorative justice, assuming accountability and implementing measures to rectify the damage caused and prevent its recurrence requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://irp.cdn-website.com/76b5fa75/files/uploaded/Kay%20Pranis%20Article%20for%20March%20Blog.pdf&quot;>;five elements&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Acknowledge that your actions caused harm.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Acknowledge that you had agency in those actions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Understand the full impact of your actions on anyone who was impacted.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Take steps to repair the harm and make amends.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Identify patterns or habits that led to causing harm and take steps to change those habits.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;Repairing harm can manifest in various ways: acknowledging the harm, expressing remorse, admitting guilt, and committing to behavioral change through new policies, commitments, or agreements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a woman of color, I&#39;ve heard my fair share of comments that offend, upset, or hurt me, and I have regrettably done the same to others. Whenever I&#39;ve been the target of microaggressions, I try to collect my thoughts and emotions before addressing a coworker, respond assertively with “I” statements, and often reply with kindness and humor to defuse the tension. For example: “When you restated my recommendation in the recap meeting without giving me credit, I felt erased from our conversation. I&#39;d like us to have a healthy working relationship. Can you help me understand why you omitted my contribution?” Or: “When you confused me for the other Latina on the floor, I felt we were both invisible to you. And I think I&#39;m pretty memorable!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I unintentionally make an insensitive comment, such as misgendering someone, I immediately approach the impacted individual with humility. I sincerely listen to understand the impact of my words and offer a heartfelt apology while taking complete accountability for my words and actions. I also encourage them to call me in if I repeat such behavior because I am committed to learning from my mistakes and growing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be clear, it is not the responsibility of women, BIPOC, or members of marginalized communities to educate their colleagues on how to foster healthy interactions. To proactively create more meaningful relationships, ask yourself these questions: How can I focus on what the person is saying, and not solely on how they say it or how they look? What else do I need to know to understand what my colleague is trying to communicate instead of dismissing or avoiding what they say? And before addressing someone&#39;s uncomfortable comment, ask yourself: Am I responding to being shut down, ignored, or offended, or am I trying to be right? If both parties are willing, there are ways of responding that can lead to constructive conversations and shared understanding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Repeated acts of harm in particular must be addressed. MIT&#39;s Sloan School of Management conducted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/&quot;>;a study in 2022&lt;/a>; that found that employee turnover is 10 times more influenced by a toxic corporate culture than compensation. Taking responsibility means understanding the wide range of perspectives and experiences across teams and proactively identifying sources of tension. A good starting point is asking yourself, “What do I need to hear, what do I need to say, and what would I like to see as an outcome?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this example, the manager took essential steps to repair the trust his insensitive comments had initially broken. He demonstrated accountability by acknowledging the harm his words caused and engaged in open dialogue. By actively working to understand the impact of his words and offering to take tangible steps to change his behavior, he successfully began repairing the trust with his new employee and, quite possibly, his relationship with the broader team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of us want to change workplace conditions so everyone can thrive, yet sometimes, we are terrified of messing up, saying the wrong thing, or not being able to do enough. Addressing interpersonal tensions and toxicity requires an ongoing, proactive effort that fosters empathy, intentionality, and courage. By identifying the true source of the tension, seeking understanding, assessing when to intervene, involving neutral third parties if necessary, and repairing harm and trust quickly and often, you can prevent conflict from escalating and build a stronger, more connected, and more effective team.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Game Plan for Funding Carbon Offsets]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_13_-537715290_-1363813940.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration: Edmon de Haro; Baloncici/Getty Images (chimney); Vitalina/Getty Images (butterflies)&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The most common types of carbon offsets are nature-based offsets such as forests. Unfortunately, while emissions remain in the atmosphere around 1,000 years, possibly longer, a tree can only remove carbon for its lifespan of 10o or so years, which means a forest planted as a carbon offset must be maintained with trees replanted at least ten times to &amp;#160;match the emission it is offsetting. Most businesses will be reluctant to tie up capital in this way, but such projects can be (and have been) financed by perpetual bonds, which represent attractive investments for investors such as university endowments that have very long liability streams extending far into the future. The use of financial instruments such as perpetual bonds can make considerable quantities of capital available to offset producers, spurring the production and the creation of spot markets in offsets that can definitively and reliably be offset against emissions.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;In September 2015, a curator from Yale&#39;s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library traveled to Amsterdam to collect the previous 12 years&#39; worth of interest on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.yale.edu/2015/09/22/living-artifact-dutch-golden-age-yale-s-367-year-old-water-bond-still-pays-interest&quot;>;a bond issued on May 15, 1648&lt;/a>;. At the bond&#39;s issuance, the borrower, an autonomous Dutch water authority, had promised to pay the holder interest &lt;em>;in perpetuity&lt;/em>;. Cash from sale of the bond had been used to pay for an infrastructure project that protected against rising sea levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Such perpetual bonds may prove useful in today&#39;s fight against climate change by enabling the funding of projects that will remove and store carbon indefinitely. Carbon removals can be used to offset carbon-emissions liabilities (or &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/accounting-for-climate-change&quot;>;E-liabilities&lt;/a>;), thereby helping businesses and other organizations achieve net-zero goals. Perpetual bonds can also support the development of efficient &lt;em>;spot markets&lt;/em>; in removal offsets, spurring both their production and their use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Perpetual bonds help resolve a key mismatch between the duration of many carbon offsets and the duration of the E-liabilities they are to be netted against. As we note in our July-August HBR print article, “&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/accounting-for-carbon-offsets&quot;>;Accounting for Carbon Offsets&lt;/a>;,”&amp;nbsp;E-liabilities from greenhouse gas emissions pose a particular challenge to financial markets since emissions produced today are expected to linger in the atmosphere for more than 1,000 years, a duration far longer than typical financial liabilities. Given that, we establish the need for offsetable carbon-emission assets (E-assets) to also have &lt;em>;indefinite &lt;/em>;duration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Certain E-assets such as carbon capture and storage via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/making-minerals-how-growing-rocks-can-help-reduce-carbon-emissions&quot;>;subterranean mineralization&lt;/a>; explicitly meet this criterion, but such E-assets are currently uncommon. Far more widespread today are nature-based offsets (NBOs) such as virgin forestation programs, which typically have shorter durations stemming from the &lt;em>;finite&lt;/em>; (unreplenished) lifetime of forests (potentially less than 100 years). At issue, then, is whether NBOs can be used to net E-liabilities: if they cannot, then most removal offsets being supplied today are only down-payments against long-term emissions liabilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For NBOs to have indefinite duration, the issuer must commit to managing the underlying (forest) asset in perpetuity — that is, replanting the forest as its constituent trees naturally decay or are destroyed by disease, fire, etc. To finance this operation, the offset provider needs capital not only to buy the land and plant trees but also to provide for predictable outlays in perpetuity. In other words, they must invest part of any capital raised in an endowment fund, the returns on which can go towards financing the management of the forest so that the carbon remains sequestered indefinitely (defined as, say, 1,000 years, a reasonable scientific estimate of how long carbon emitted today will stay in the atmosphere).&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Moreover, given the indefinite commitment, an issuer wanting to qualify some fraction of its presently delivered (or “earned”) removal offsets as being immediately and fully nettable against the purchaser&#39;s E-liabilities will have to set aside a separate (significantly larger) fraction of its available earned offsets against future commitments to sequester carbon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;All this implies that providers of capital to producers of NBO offsets can expect relatively low returns on their investments, albeit distributed in perpetuity. Individual offset buyers (usually for-profit businesses) will not find it attractive to tie up their own capital in this way. But such an investment might well be attractive to institutions that require endowments to cover predictable liabilities far into the future, such as universities and churches. The investment would take the form of a perpetual bond — such as that issued by the Dutch water authority — or of preferred equity with a fixed dividend. Ordinary equity is likely not suitable to finance indefinite-duration removal offsets since investors usually want a guaranteed return for tying up capital in perpetuity with limited upside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Consider, as a hypothetical example of how a perpetual bond approach can work, an indigenous tribe in Canada that wants to sell nettable E-assets from a virgin forest that it will plant on its land and manage indefinitely. To do so, it must raise capital to develop and maintain the forest. The tribe can issue a perpetual bond and place some of the capital in an everlasting financial endowment. The tribe uses the interest from the endowment to pay for the costs of managing the forest. As offsets from the forest become “earned” — that is, trees mature and sequester carbon — the tribe can sell some portion of these E-assets to pay for expenses, including the interest on the perpetual bond.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Let&#39;s assume that 20 megatons of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; equivalent (MtCO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;e) of offsets from the forest&#39;s current trees is “captured” this year and will be so for the next 100 years, but the trees will then have to be replanted at least 10 more times to be nettable against a 1,000-year E-liability. To distribute the risks of this commitment, the tribe can sell 2 MtCO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;e of this year&#39;s offset as “earned” in perpetuity (ie, 20 Mt divided by 10).&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;If there are enough producers of NBO offsets and enough demand for them, the nettable offsets can be sold into a liquid market, which distributes the future risks of the forest across a range of offset purchasers and helps the tribe to meet its interest obligations. Next year&#39;s spot buyers may be different from this year&#39;s, and, indeed, spot buyers hundreds of years thence likely will be very different, but collectively, through contributing to the perpetual bond&#39;s interest costs, they share in the long time-series risks of NBOs. The scheme is profitable for the tribe as long as the proceeds from spot sales of nettable offsets and from endowment returns exceed the bond&#39;s interest expenses and the ongoing forest-management costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Very likely, no one 375 years ago expected the Dutch seawall-management bonds would make interest payments in the present day to a New England university library 3,500 miles away. Likewise, we cannot predict how financial markets will develop to meet the needs of emissions liability management. But the pathway set out here suggests a feasible market solution to mitigate the long-term consequences from today&#39;s carbon emissions.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Your Company Prepared for the Effects of Wildfires?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_13_1258513476.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Angela Weiss/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Today&amp;#8217;s wildfires and smoke can travel hundreds of miles, blurring the lines between what happens within and outside the workplace when it comes to workforce health.

The author recommends taking six actions: 1) Connect global wildfires to local health; 2) Collect and assess air quality data, developing thresholds for workforce advisories; 3) Identify the key stakeholders in your corporate response team and activate your command center; 4) Identify when to take action for outdoor workers; 5) Identify how to support indoor office employees; and 6) Develop communication and education plans for your employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Wildfires. The word has struck fear into the hearts of small and midsize rural communities for generations. Now, thanks to smoke blanketing parts of North America, urban America and the corporations headquartered there are beginning to understand themselves as vulnerable, too. Last week, East Coast cities from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/07/us/canada-wildfires-air-quality-smoke&quot;>;New York&lt;/a>; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/air-quality-toronto-fires-smoke-1.6868010&quot;>;Toronto&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-wildfire-smoke-canada-updates-june-7/&quot;>;Montreal&lt;/a>; saw air quality rapidly decline to some of the worst in the world as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/smoke-air-quality-nyc-northeast-canadian-wildfires-6b5ffc01&quot;>;smoke from wildfires in Canada&lt;/a>; drifts south. This means the conversation in Corporate America has moved beyond indoor air circulation or filtration, to encompass outdoor air quality as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poor air quality impacts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ishn.com/articles/113569-how-poor-iaq-impacts-employee-safety-and-productivity&quot;>;employee health and productivity&lt;/a>;, from diminished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/office-air-quality-may-affect-employees-cognition-productivity/&quot;>;cognitive function&lt;/a>; and poor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w20648&quot;>;concentration&lt;/a>; to lowered &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/air-pollution-is-making-office-workers-less-productive&quot;>;productivity&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8b8c&quot;>;sentiment&lt;/a>;. It can also exacerbate health conditions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503605/&quot;>;asthma&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.926534/full&quot;>;anxiety&lt;/a>; and lead to increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org/mongolia/media/2926/file/UNICEF-Absenteeism-ENG-final.pdf&quot;>;absenteeism&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9554460/&quot;>;presenteeism&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/sites/internet/files/2021-04/HHW_2020.pdf&quot;>;leaves of absence&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wildfires and smoke have disrupted corporate travel, postponed company activities, and sent employees to their doctors for a host of related health issues, including difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, there&#39;s likely more to come in the future — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires&quot;>;climate change&lt;/a>; means increases in wildfire season length, frequency, and burned area.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a physician working for an international organization advising corporate leaders, we are seeing a rapid rise in employer inquiries related to employee health and the best practices around air quality concerns. HR teams are fielding complex questions from employees and leaders — and many don&#39;t feel prepared with the right information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is reminiscent of the height of Covid in March 2020, when leaders asked: Is this an issue we need to respond to? What do I need to know? What action do I need to take now? Here are six actions for employers to consider as they navigate this ongoing issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Connect global wildfires to local health.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Air pollution can harm anyone. But it is more dangerous for specific employee segments and their family members. This includes infants and young children, seniors over 65, pregnant women, anyone who exercises or works outdoors, and people with existing illness or chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, lung, or heart conditions. During heavy smoke conditions, all employees may be at risk regardless of their age or health. Impacts can be both physical and psychological, especially for employees experiencing the trauma of wildfire evacuation from their homes and workplaces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Smoke can travel thousands of miles from an initial fire zone, which means that wildfires in other parts of the world will impact your people in the local communities where your company operates. Smoke from wildfires includes a complex mixture of pollutants, like fine particulate matter. Invisible to the human eye, these particles get deep into our lungs and bloodstream, sometimes leading to serious health effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no evidence of a safe level of exposure for some pollutants, meaning that smoke can impact employees&#39; health even at very low levels. And as local smoke levels increase, the health risks to your workforce will generally increase as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Collect and assess air quality data.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Data can typically be found through an Air Quality Index (AQI), which is a system used to warn the public when air pollution reaches dangerous levels. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues year-round AQI forecasts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airnow.gov/&quot;>;maps&lt;/a>; showing how pollution levels change and move throughout the day, and other countries have similar resources. This “real-time” information can help employers to quantify current outdoor air quality that impacts both their employees and customers far before it hits front-page news.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recommend working with health care experts such as physicians or medical consultants to develop specific thresholds for workforce advisories that go along with these levels. Doing so will help you take steps to protect your employees from unhealthy levels of air pollution and enable them to proactively seek appropriate supports for their health and safety. Specific thresholds paired with health care guidance will also prepare managers to communicate with and guide their teams in line with corporate policy. Once your organization understands how to use air quality data and sets monitoring thresholds, it will help trigger your corporate response at the right time and place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Activate your command center.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Identify who needs to be brought together to respond when AQI thresholds are met, especially if there is an immediate physical health and safety threat to employees. Wildfire-related local evacuations &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/how-kaiser-permanente-prepares-for-disasters&quot;>;are particularly high stakes&lt;/a>;, especially when hundreds of thousands evacuate all at once as seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/southern-california-wildfires-blaze&quot;>;Southern California&lt;/a>;. Your corporate response team may include local business leaders in impacted areas, communications specialists, medical advisors, HR leaders and even risk practitioners given broader enterprise issues involved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your multi-disciplinary approach may look similar to governance models &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/leader/early/2020/04/07/leader-2020-000244.full.pdf&quot;>;developed during the Covid pandemic&lt;/a>; and will ensure timely information is continuously flowing to and from the right stakeholders, including executives and the board. It will also enable rapid, holistic decision-making and related corporate response. This may range from meeting occupational health and safety standards to regulatory compliance for different employee segments like indoor versus outdoor workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Focus on outdoor workers, and comply with regulation.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Depending on your industry, outdoor work exposure to wildfire smoke is regulated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/wffsmoke.html&quot;>;occupational health and safety&lt;/a>; standards and regulatory bodies like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;>;Occupational Safety and Health Administration&lt;/a>; (OSHA). Long work schedules and physical work demands may impact a worker&#39;s exposure risk and health response. Geography matters, as local regulations differ. For example, California&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dir.ca.gov/title8/5141_1.html&quot;>;emergency regulation&lt;/a>; applies to workplaces where AQI is greater than 151 or if employees are expected to be exposed to wildfire smoke.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers should know their local air quality regulations and take action to limit outdoor workers&#39; exposure, particularly when wildfire smoke is in or around the work environment. This may include relocating or rescheduling work tasks to smoke-free or less smoky areas or times of the day, reducing levels of physical activity when possible, providing workers with frequent breaks in places that are free from smoke, and offering special accommodations where required.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some situations, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as well-fitted N95 respirators, should be considered to limit workers&#39; exposure. When US employers require use of respiratory protection to limit exposure to smoke, this should occur as part of a comprehensive respiratory protection program as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;>;OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard&lt;/a>;. (When use is voluntary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppD&quot;>;other OSHA standards&lt;/a>; apply.)&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Support indoor office employees.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Air quality can be unexpectedly complex for indoor office workers. Corporate safety standards related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/staying-compliant-in-an-era-of-hybrid-and-remote-work-c0e0938e&quot;>;home office&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalguardian.com/global-digest/at-home-duty-of-care&quot;>;worker travel&lt;/a>; have been elevated in recent years. And while it is arguable whether an employer&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1741438/does-employers-duty-care-extend-commuting&quot;>;duty of care&lt;/a>; extends to the employee journey to and from work, the commute matters, especially if an employee needs to navigate significant outdoor air pollution to get to and from the office. Taking a holistic “employee experience journey” approach can help calibrate potential risks for employee segments in hard-hit local areas or where there are specific individual health risk factors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As many office buildings have advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and optimized Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) ratings, the air quality at the office may be superior to that of the average home during wildfire season. Employers may need to take additional actions to reduce exposure to and protect occupants from wildfire smoke. This may include installing air cleaners equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, ensuring that windows and other building openings are kept closed to reduce overall smoke exposure inside, operating HVAC systems in the re-circulate setting, or temporarily reducing the amount of outdoor air supplied to the building. If you currently lease office space, engage your landlord to ensure that they optimize protection of your indoor workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More broadly, consider security, medical, and mental-health coverage to keep your people safe in times of crisis. This includes extending fulsome protection to the entire workforce, whether they commute or work indoors or outside. Employees working from home in your local corporate backyard might need that same 24/7 evacuation coverage you previously only considered for international travelers. This coverage applies equally to wildfires as it does to other natural disasters, like flooding or hurricanes, when companies often provide assistance such as food and water, shelter, or emergency evacuation. At many companies, this extra layer of coverage requires a mentality shift, but it is one worth making today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. Communicate and educate broadly.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Depending on the scope and scale of a wildfire and its impact on your organization, consider what should be communicated proactively (eg, that your organization is aware of and actively responding to worsening local air quality) and reactively (eg, messaging from HR in relation to very specific individual circumstances requiring accommodations).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Education is an important part of any communication plan related to wildfires and air quality, so alert your employees to symptoms of wildfire smoke exposure. Milder and more common symptoms include headaches, mild cough, sore and watery eyes, and nose, throat, and sinus irritation. More serious but less common symptoms include dizziness, chest pains, severe cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and even irregular heartbeat. Encourage employees to seek care from a health care provider and consider urgent medical attention if warranted for severe cases such as risks for asthma attacks, stroke, or heart attack.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of severe wildfire events, communication may include addressing immediate physical health and safety threats and extend to longer-term practices around air quality and respiratory health. Providing individual employee guidance on what to do to safeguard their health when air quality level is at different thresholds can help. For example, at higher levels, employees can be guided to avoid prolonged vigorous activity outdoors and stay away from high-traffic areas. It may also mean postponing or cancelling certain corporate and team-building events, or moving outdoor gatherings indoors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/how-prepare-wildfire-smoke.html#:~:text=Checklist%20for%20wildfire%20smoke%20season%20preparedness,-Are%20you%20or&amp;amp;text=Do%20you%20have%20an%20adequate%20supply%20of%20food%20and%20water,a%20break%20from%20the%20smoke%3F&quot;>;Preparedness checklists&lt;/a>; can help and may cover home, office, and personal medical preparedness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s wildfires and smoke can travel hundreds of miles, blurring the lines between what happens within and outside the workplace when it comes to workforce health. Now is the time to get ahead of this and other climate change-driven health issues.

We all struggle with feedback, so extend a little grace to yourself for having strong emotions, and to the other person for initiating a difficult conversation. The authors present the three most common ways people deliver feedback in a way that causes harm and elicits strong emotions, as well as five key steps to take when you get poorly delivered feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-your-boss-gives-you-bad-feedback-badly?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-your-boss-gives-you-bad-feedback-badly?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Hearing about what you&#39;re not doing well at work can feel bad. That doesn&#39;t make you “defensive” or “shut down to feedback.” It just means you&#39;re human and that you care about your performance — both good things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when you receive kind, clear feedback from a manager, peer, or employee, it can still be difficult to learn what you could be doing better. Say to yourself: “This is uncomfortable, and that&#39;s okay. My reaction will pass.” And then do something that allows you to sit with the discomfort for a while. Meditate, take a walk, or journal. Remind yourself that the person is giving you feedback because they care about helping you&lt;em>;. &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what happens when the person doesn&#39;t care about you, or when the feedback is poorly delivered? What if the person was rude, insensitive, or unclear? Now is not the time to criticize the criticism. But how can you navigate your own emotional responses to different types of feedback? The only way out of feeling bad about critical feedback is through.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mollie and Liz are experts in emotions at work and Kim is an expert in feedback at work. Kim&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://review.firstround.com/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss&quot;>;radical candor&lt;/a>; framework explains the three most common ways people deliver feedback in a way that causes harm and elicits strong emotions: obnoxious aggression, manipulative insincerity, and ruinous empathy. Together, we&#39;ve identified five key steps to take when you get poorly delivered feedback:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Name your emotion.&lt;/strong>; Figure out how you&#39;re feeling and don&#39;t judge yourself.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/strong>; Look for something helpful in the feedback even if it wasn&#39;t delivered well.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Reward the candor&lt;/strong>; — even if you disagree. Note that this doesn&#39;t mean pretending to agree. Sometimes the best reward for feedback you disagree with is a respectful explanation of why.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/strong>; Talk to the person about the impact of their delivery.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Fish or cut bait.&lt;/strong>; Figure out if you can continue to improve the relationship or if this is someone you need to avoid.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;As with most advice, this is much easier said than done. Here&#39;s how to apply these steps in the face of three common types of poorly delivered feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Obnoxiously Aggressive Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;What should you do when someone is yelling or using disparaging language? For example, a person once gave Kim some feedback by jabbing his finger in her face as he yelled, “You are the most aggressive woman I ever met!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of feedback usually makes us feel a mix of anger, fear, defensiveness, and anxiety. In addition to the steps below, if you feel that you&#39;re being bullied or verbally abused at work, it&#39;s important to escalate that to a trusted leader or HR rep if you feel safe doing so. If there&#39;s nobody you feel safe going to at work, it&#39;s a sign to start looking for a new job.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Give yourself a minute. If you find your emotions are overwhelming, try to create space for yourself or remove yourself from the situation entirely. You might say something like, “I&#39;d like to come back to this later” or “I&#39;m having a strong reaction to your feedback, and I need a moment.” Liz has learned to evaluate her emotions on a scale from 1 (okay) to 10 (enraged or panicking). She aims to wait until she&#39;s settled down to a 3 or 4 before taking action or even responding.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;re calm, think about what was said, not how it was said. Is there some information, no matter how terribly imparted, that can be useful to you or help you succeed? Some people will never tell you what they&#39;re thinking until they&#39;re so angry that they aren&#39;t able to communicate it well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It may be the case that you disagree with the content of the feedback as well as the way it was delivered. That&#39;s okay. But challenge yourself to find one thing the person said, or even one aspect of what they said, that you can agree with. There may be a whole bushel of chaff and only one grain of wheat. Find that grain, and use it to your advantage!&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you agree with any of the feedback, make changes and update the person on what you&#39;re doing differently. If you disagree with it, offer a respectful explanation of why.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Is there a way to relay how their words and actions impacted you? In some situations, it may be effective to share how an overly harsh delivery affects your ability to perform well on the job. In a workshop Liz and Mollie led, for example, a participant shared that her boss used to yell at her frequently. One day she finally said to him, “I know that you&#39;re upset right now, but when you yell at me, I&#39;m not able to focus on my work.” Her boss apologized and realized that he was inadvertently hurting her performance. His outbursts became much less frequent.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Of course, sometimes when you talk to the person about how what they said impacted you, you&#39;ll learn the person is trying to upset you. In those cases, telling them how they made you feel won&#39;t work. Why tell them they succeeded in upsetting you?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, limit how much you interact with the person. Once Kim told her boss he was being disrespectful; he replied he was offended that she didn&#39;t genuflect enough, or appreciate how superior he was to her. She quit. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/i-hate-my-boss/id1148704291?mt=2&quot;>;TV writer Elizabeth Craft advises&lt;/a>;, “If someone handed you a literal glass of poison, you would not drink it — so don&#39;t drink the verbal poison. If someone&#39;s coming at you negatively at work, just don&#39;t ingest.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Manipulatively Insincere Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When people are worried about their own reputation more than helping you improve, they may say things they don&#39;t really mean. Sometimes people say things to you that feel passive aggressive, or they praise you to your face but criticize you behind your back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all do this sometimes. Kim confesses that she had a direct report to whom she gave manipulatively insincere feedback. His work was riddled with careless mistakes. And he was popular and very sensitive. What if he started to cry when she pointed out the mistakes? Worried about her reputation as a leader rather than her direct report&#39;s performance, she&#39;d say something to him along the lines of, “Oh, Alex, this is a great start. You are so incredible. Maybe you can make this a little better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What can you do if someone is giving you praise that feels more like an ego salve than something real? How can you encourage them to say what they really think?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When confronted with this behavior, it&#39;s easy to feel confused. If you find out the person is saying nice things to your face and bad things behind your back, you may feel angry, betrayed, or mistrustful. Take a deep breath. Figure out how you&#39;re feeling.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Remember, you&#39;re trying to get feedback that will help you grow. Try asking the person making the comment to clarify what they meant. You might say, “Can you share a bit more about what you mean by that?” or “What would you recommend I do differently?” By asking for more detail, you help prevent miscommunication and give yourself an opportunity to address any underlying issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It might be that the person is simply conflict avoidant. You might make them feel more comfortable sharing if you say something like: “I feel like you have valuable feedback for me, but I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to communicate. Can you tell me what you&#39;re thinking more directly?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another tactic is to tell the person that you&#39;re working on improving something, and ask them to help you: “I&#39;ve been told I interrupt a lot. Can you help me by passing me this pen if you notice me interrupting someone during the meeting?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When a well-intentioned person has a hard time giving feedback, it&#39;s especially important to prove to them that not only is it safe to give you feedback, but that they&#39;ll be rewarded richly if they do. When their feedback results in your action, the risk they took has paid off. Saying thanks is never enough —&amp;nbsp;you need to fix the problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when a person praises you to your face and criticizes you behind your back, it&#39;s really hard to reward that kind of passive aggression because you&#39;re not supposed to know what they think. You could ask: “Is there something I could do differently so next time you can tell me what you really think? You told me you thought the presentation went well, but I heard you told others it was terrible. I promise not to bite your head off if you tell me when I&#39;m not hitting the mark. In fact, I&#39;ll be grateful because your feedback is exactly what I need in order to do better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Now that you&#39;re talking, you can ask the person if they can commit to talking to you directly rather than behind your back in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If the person apologizes and seems sincere, you can begin to rebuild trust. But if they respond in a way that erodes trust further, aim to regulate your emotions so that their behavior affects you less. Try an imaginary time-travel technique called temporal distancing. “Imagine it is a day, a week, or a year later,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://msande.stanford.edu/research-impact/stories-voices/faculty/faculty-spotlight-bob-sutton&quot;>;says Bob Sutton&lt;/a>;, author of books including &lt;em>;The No Asshole Rule&lt;/em>;. “And you are looking back on it, and it really didn&#39;t last that long or wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as it seemed at the time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Ruinously Empathetic Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sometimes you get the sense the person is so worried about hurting your feelings or offending you that they won&#39;t tell you what they really think. They care, but they&#39;re not challenging you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The part of Kim that was reluctant to tell her popular and sensitive employee Alex when his work wasn&#39;t good enough because of her concern for her reputation as a leader was manipulative insincerity; the “too nice” part of her that was reluctant to tell Alex what he needed to know because she was afraid of hurting his feelings was ruinous empathy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When someone is overly nice about their feedback, you may feel unsure about their intentions, or frustrated that they&#39;re not telling you what you need to know to improve. You may wonder if they think you can&#39;t handle the feedback. Maybe that makes you angry. Maybe their ruinous empathy makes them seem weak to you, and maybe that makes you feel disgusted. Emotional responses to ruinous empathy vary widely.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You might say, “While I appreciate that you think I&#39;m doing a great job, I know that there is always room for improvement. When I repeatedly don&#39;t get any constructive feedback from you, it makes me feel like you&#39;re holding back. The only way I can improve is if you give me candid feedback.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You may then need to sit through the other person&#39;s discomfort. Many people who give overly nice feedback will try to wriggle out of saying anything critical. They might repeat, “No really, you&#39;re doing great.” Their discomfort might make you feel that you should let them off the hook.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Push back against this instinct and stick with the conversation until you get a genuine response. One technique Kim recommends is to count to six before saying anything else. This forces the other person to endure the silence. After six seconds, if they still can&#39;t come up with anything else in the moment, suggest finding a time to meet again.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This is really important if you ever want to get more feedback from the person. Be effusive in your thanks. If you agree with the feedback, fix the issue, and then ask if you over or under-corrected. If you disagree, first look for something they said that you can agree with. Then, respectfully explain why you disagree with the rest. If possible, agree to do it their way — even if you disagree. Maybe they&#39;re right and you&#39;re wrong. Even so, explaining your reasoning and still deferring to them is a sign of respect.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Having demonstrated how helpful their feedback was, tell them you&#39;ll be asking for more. Let them know that while you appreciate their concern for your feelings, when they fail to tell you things that would help you do better work, it hurts your ability to succeed, and it doesn&#39;t improve your relationship. Reassure them that you really do want them to be candid with you, and that you not only can take it, but will appreciate it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Encouraging others to give you feedback often demands patience and takes work. But not everyone will offer it to you. If you&#39;ve taken all the steps suggested above, and the person still will not share any direct feedback, look to others for candor. If your boss seems constitutionally unable to give real performance feedback and their boss is not holding them accountable, start looking for a new boss.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s difficult to manage your feelings when getting feedback that feels too harsh, overly nice, or somehow dishonest. We all struggle with feedback, so extend a little grace to yourself for having strong emotions, and to the other person for initiating a difficult conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Large Language Models Reflect Human Judgment]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_10_1448510799.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Olena Koliesnik/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Artificial intelligence is based around prediction. But decision making requires both prediction and judgment. That leaves a role for humans, in providing the judgment about which types of outcomes are better and worse. But large language models represent a key advance: OpenAI has found a way to teach its AI human judgment by using a simple form of human feedback, through chat. That opens the door to a new way for humans to work with AI, essentially talking to them about which outcomes are better or worse for any given type of decision.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Artificial intelligences are prediction machines. They can tell you the probability it will rain today, but they cannot tell you whether or not you should pack an umbrella. That&#39;s because the umbrella decision requires more than just prediction — if the probability of rain is 10%, some people will choose to carry an umbrella, but others won&#39;t. Why will different people behave differently even though they are faced with the same information? Because they have different preferences. In this case, some people care much more than others about getting wet. Only you or someone who knows you well can judge the costs and benefits of carrying an umbrella. Making that decision for you requires both a prediction and a judgment based on your preferences.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;AIs excel at prediction but they do not possess judgment. To be sure, there are many decisions where we know the rewards or can work them out easily. Fundamentally, we know what a driver should do in most situations — accelerate, brake, turn — because we know the consequences of not doing the right thing. But ask Google to give you advice on a new dishwasher, and the best it can do is predict which pages are likely to provide the information you are looking for. It isn&#39;t feeling lucky enough to tell you what to do. Likewise, while you might be worried that your employer will use an AI to determine if you should be fired, the machine isn&#39;t ultimately responsible. AI might provide a prediction about your performance, but it is your employer who applies judgment and decides whom to fire.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;It was for this reason that, in our 2018 book &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Prediction-Machines-Economics-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1633695670&quot;>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Prediction Machines&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, we saw a role for reward function engineers whose job it would be to “determine the rewards to various actions, given the predictions that AI makes.” AI prediction could improve so many decisions that the reward function engineers who understood those predictions and the decision at stake would provide a skilled complement as AI adoption continued apace. But innovation in reward function engineering has been slow. There has been little progress in developing tools to codify appropriate human judgment into machines before they are deployed at scale. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Until recently. Large language models (LLMs) are, for all their seeming intelligence, still just prediction machines. But they are transforming the way AI assists in decision-making because they are changing the way humans provide judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Ask ChatGPT to rewrite a paragraph more clearly for a certain audience, and it does not give you options or a lecture on grammar and rhetoric. It gives you a paragraph. It is impressive, but the real miracle here is that ChatGPT could write the paragraph &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;you wanted&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;. There are a ton of reward and risk issues that go into writing a paragraph. Will the writing be honest (consistent with the facts), harmless (not including words that might offend), and helpful (accomplishing the goal of the paragraph)? Just think about that last one. These models are trained on existing writing by people. The paragraph produced is, at its core, written using a type of “autocomplete” over and over again. When we have our phones autocomplete, they do a good but not perfect job. So how is it that ChatGPT is able to produce written outcomes that are so much better than what the average person can do? How was ChatGPT able to judge quality from all of the content, good and bad, it was trained on? More generally, why didn&#39;t it develop into the toxic cesspool that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;>;Microsoft&#39;s Tay chatbot turned into after a day on Twitter&lt;/a>;?&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Some people, such as &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;Stephen Wolfram&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, believe that LLMs are uncovering some fundamental rules of grammar. Yes, that can make the writing readable, but it surely can&#39;t make it clear and compelling.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;A &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;2022 paper from OpenAI researchers&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; provides an important clue. That paper describes how raw, unmodified LLMs were taken and used to offer up outputs to real people. For the most part, the people were asked to &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;use their judgment to rank several alternative outcomes&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; to the same prompt. The ranking criteria were carefully specified (ie, prioritize helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness). It turns out that with clear instructions and some person-to-person training, different people could quite readily agree on those things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Those rankings were then used to tweak or “fine tune” the algorithm. The model learned human judgment and adjusted based on positive and negative reinforcement. Writings that ranked highly received a positive bump. Those that did not got a negative hit. Interestingly, even for a model trained on billions of pages, with just a few thousand examples of human judgment in the form of ranked responses, the AI began producing outcomes for all queries that were highly ranked. This occurred even for queries that seemed far from the ones the evaluators had ranked. Somehow, human judgment on writing quality spread quite far throughout the model.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;The evaluators were effectively reward function engineers. But unlike with a statistical model, the output of which can be offputting for many people, LLMs interact in plain language — anyone can help teach the model judgment. In other words, anyone who can speak or type can be a reward function engineer. The amazing discovery behind ChatGPT was that with comparatively little effort, reward function engineers were able to train LLMs to be useful and safe. This is how OpenAI was able to launch a consumer-facing model that did not suffer from the flaws of its predecessors when released into the wild. This simple method of codifying human judgment into machines supercharged AI performance. The machine was now imbued with the ability to not only predict word sequences that were likely, but also to apply the reward function engineers&#39; judgment to those sequences to increase their appeal to readers. The discovery of an easy method for machines to apply human judgment — the complement to any AI prediction machine in specifying the risks and rewards in a wide variety of circumstances — made all the difference.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;For many decisions, specialized reward function engineers will be needed to deploy AI prediction machines at scale. The discovery of this intuitive approach for codifying human judgment into machine — fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback — may unlock many valuable applications of AI where human judgment is difficult to codify in advance but easy to implement when you see it.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI Will Accelerate the Circular Economy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_12_1295939564.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Almost Green Studio/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Despite living on a planet with finite resources, our economy remains largely linear and full of single-use products. The shift toward a circular economy, where companies recover or recycle resources, has hit roadblocks, including low value of used products and high recycling costs. Harvard&amp;#8217;s D^3 Institute recently highlighted how digital tools and AI can help overcome these hurdles. They discussed three key strategies: extending the life of products, using fewer materials in production, and using more recycled materials. These tech-enabled strategies promise significant financial returns, but unlocking their full potential will need serious investment. Simply put, it&amp;#8217;s high time businesses recognized the potential of turning waste into wealth.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The global economy still functions in a linear manner and is characterized by the extraction, production, consumption, and disposal of materials. This is a problem given that we live on a planet with finite resources. Yet the shift to a circular economy, in which businesses recover or recycle resources used in their value chain, has remained elusive, despite offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.summaequity.com/assets/Reports/PDF/230417-Investing-in-a-circular-and-waste-free-Europe.pdf&quot;>;trillions of dollars in value creation&lt;/a>;. Barriers include the low residual value of used products, an inability to collect materials, prohibitive costs of separating and processing materials, and lack of traceability of products and materials that are being recycled.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To accelerate the pace of innovation and learning, the Digital, Data, and Design (D^3) Institute at Harvard Business School recently hosted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://environment.harvard.edu/event/d3-catalyst-circular-economy-conference&quot;>;event focused on the circular economy&lt;/a>;, where entrepreneurs and business leaders shared how they&#39;re using digital tools and artificial intelligence to remove those barriers and create entirely new markets and business models. Specifically, the conference helped identify three main ways to achieve a more circular economy: increasing product utilization, material efficiency, and use of recycled materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Product Utilization&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Product utilization seeks to extend the useful life of a product, such as through sharing economy platforms, product refurbishment programs, or enhancing product duration. One new way companies are extending the life of the product is through over-the-air software updates that increase the residual value of a product. Take the example of the iPhone. Today, the iPhone constitutes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-used-smartphone-market-is-booming-surprisingly-thats-good-news-for-apple/&quot;>;80% of the market&lt;/a>; among 300 million or so phones in the secondhand market. A primary reason for this success, Marcelo Claure, former CEO of Sprint and Softbank International, explained at the event, is the forward compatibility of the iOS operating system, which ensures a user can access the app ecosystem and all the new features that Apple releases, maintaining iPhones&#39; appeal as a high-quality product in the secondhand market. Over-the-air updates of software is becoming the norm for more products — even cars. As a result, we expect an increase in the residual value of used products and an increase in product utilization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contrary to the belief that prolonging product lifespan might hinder sales growth and therefore firms should implement a planned obsolescence strategy, leading firms perceive enhanced product utilization as a mechanism for reaching new consumers, enhancing customer satisfaction, and building business models that monetize their efforts to create more durable products through services. Apple now has &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/apple-says-it-now-has-935-million-paid-subscriptions/&quot;>;935 million subscribers&lt;/a>; in its services segment, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16157374&quot;>;has grown&lt;/a>; to almost $80 billion in revenues and runs at close to double the gross margin compared to the hardware business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another opportunity to extend the useful life of products is through the product-as-a-service model, where companies retain ownership of a product while consumers pay for its use. Advancements in data and tracing technology has enabled better information flow to facilitate this business model. For example, SuperCircle developed a digital infrastructure that enabled circularity in the fashion industry by integrating customer purchase data with warehouse and distribution systems to trace the lifecycle of clothing. Entrepreneur Chloe Songer, cofounder of SuperCircle, explained how they partner with apparel brands like Reformation to create a customer experience that allows for goods to be returned for a credit or discount, while also facilitating the logistics infrastructure for aggregating and selling these clothes to the recycling sector. Identifying the consumer as a temporary owner of a long-lived asset opens up a world of opportunities to continue engaging customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Material Efficiency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Material efficiency, which refers to making products with fewer materials, is not a novel concept for many firms that have long pursued a lean operating model, characterized by minimizing waste in production processes. However, with recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and innovative technology, material efficiency is witnessing the emergence of even more opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, our conference heard how entrepreneur Shelly Xu&#39;s SXD Zero Waste applies artificial intelligence to redesign garment mockups that generate less pre-consumer waste from offcuts during apparel production. The result is the creation of sweaters, dresses, or pants with close to zero waste in fabric and about 55% lower cost, as opposed to 10–30% waste in traditional designs. Successful entrepreneurial solutions will be those that invest time in educating B2B customers about the potential for cost savings and the need to revise legacy processes that traditionally result in more waste, such as fashion design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “tough-tech” segment, using breakthrough science, engineering, and technology, also has the potential to create solutions that both reduce the material impact of existing supply chains and create “drop-in” solutions that can be incorporated into existing supply chains. An example of an entrepreneur in this space is Luciano Bueno, who founded GALY, a firm that grows cotton from cells in a lab using 80% fewer resources compared to traditional agriculture. An important part of the innovation journey in tough tech involves educating investors on the longer innovation cycles and the need for iteration on the path to scalability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Recycled Materials&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most well-known element of a circular business model involves minimizing the use of virgin materials as a percentage of a product&#39;s total materials. For instance, Apple&#39;s products now incorporate 20% recycled materials. Beyond reducing carbon emissions, the use of more recycled materials helps companies increase “materials security,” which is particularly concerning for industries reliant on rare minerals such as lithium and cobalt. Increasing recycled materials is also a key solution for reducing carbon intensity in hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel. However, Joy Chen and Per Anders Enkvist from McKinsey highlighted that the availability of recycled materials is currently limited, and sometimes more expensive than virgin materials. Technological enhancements to increase the availability of high-quality recycled materials and reduce costs therefore are huge opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In particular, scaling up material recovery and separation is key to making recycled material more available and affordable. Bjørn Arve Ofstad, CEO of Norsk Gjenvinning, the largest waste management company in the Nordics, explained that this sector needs an upstream feedstock, technology to sort and process the waste to be used downstream, and a downstream taker. This process needs to be done at an industry scale where materials are accessed at the right time, price, and quality. Robotics can facilitate this sorting process at lower cost. For example, Apple developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-terminator-apples-daisy-teardown-robot-can-rip-your-phone-apart-in-18-secs/&quot;>;Daisy&lt;/a>;, a state-of-the-art robot that can breakdown an iPhone into reusable components in 18 seconds, including rare minerals such as cobalt, gold, and platinum.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opaque supply chains represent significant barriers to understanding the breakdown of materials at end-of-life for recovery and sorting. Maria McClay, from Google, explained how in 2019 Google piloted a solution to use machine learning and analytics to provide a more comprehensive view of impact along the textile value chain, and in 2021 was able to expand the offering to other brands. Another solution described by Hari Nair from Procter &amp;amp; Gamble is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pg.co.uk/blogs/HolyGrail/&quot;>;HolyGrail project&lt;/a>; that uses digital watermarks in products to make the sorting of recyclables easier at the end of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Investing in the Trillion-Dollar Opportunity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To support the adoption and scaling of these digitalization-enabled solutions, we need investment to fund the trillion-dollar opportunity. Yet asset allocators in circularity face a “pattern recognition” challenge, where the capability to identify promising opportunities is still evolving. Venture capital funds have been hesitant to invest in early-stage companies with significant capital expenditure needs, which is often the case in circular solutions. On the other hand, private equity funds have been reluctant to invest in early-stage startups. One solution, described by Andrew Merino of Generate Capital, is the emergence of multi-sector, sustainability-focused funds that bridge the gap between traditional venture capital and private equity. To tap the full investment potential of a circular economy, investors need to develop in-depth sectoral expertise and innovation in investment structures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
