&lt;span>;&lt;p>;我们正处于一种不寻常的经济形势中，人们对经济衰退的担忧很高，但就业市场却很紧张。由于培训预算不可避免地面临压力，组织将需要找到更有针对性的方法来解决他们的技能差距。作者研究了该领域的五个最大发展：1) 数字学徒制有助于填补数字和技术领域的工作岗位； 2）针对一线工人的学费资助计划； 3) 具有技能评估、算法驱动的下一步学习建议和内部社交网络等功能的学习体验平台； 4）教练的民主化； 5) 基于队列的课程的兴起。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;公司现在有了更多的选择，这要归功于更好的技术、创新的融资机制以及为满足当今需求而重新构想的旧方法。下面，我将解释该领域的五个最大发展。&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;新数字学徒制&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;中世纪如何实践正在推动成千上万的工人走上职业阶梯&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;学徒制可能是最古老的职场学习形式，可以追溯到远古时代，并以 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com /topic/apprenticeship&quot;>;一些杰出的校友&lt;/a>;，包括本杰明富兰克林。目前有超过 580,000 名在职学徒在美国工作——&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apprenticeship.gov/data-and-statistics&quot;>;在过去 10 年中增长了 103%&lt;/a>;，根据劳工部数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于一直努力填补重要职位的公司来说，学徒制可能是一种有效的解决方案。虽然学徒制&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/04/tanners-tailors-and-candlestick-makers-a-history-of-apprenticeships&quot;>;历史上&lt;/a>;与蓝领工作有关，它们越来越成为填补数字和技术领域白领工作的一种方式。 IT 和电信部门的学徒制增长超过in%202020%20there%20were%203%2C654%20registered%20学徒%20in%20telecommunications%20occupations%2C%20increasing%20over%20300%25%20in%20the%20last%20nine%20years.%20%5B2%5D&quot;>; 2011 年至 2020 年间增长了 300%&lt;/a>;，而网络安全学徒培训增长了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211027023746/https:/www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-industries/cybersecurity# :~:text=In%202020%2C%20there%20were%202%2C716%20registered%20apprentices%20in%20cybersecurity%20occupations%2C%20increasing%20over%20600%25%20in%20the%20last%20nine%20years%20 %5B2%5D.&quot;>;600%&lt;/a>;，根据劳工部的数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一趋势是由越来越多的公司推动的，其中许多专注于快速- 代表大型雇主招聘、支持和培训学徒的软件工程和数据科学等不断发展的领域。总部位于英国的供应商 Multiverse 最近&lt;a href=&quot;https://tcrn.ch/3H0ebPR&quot;>;估值&lt;/a>;为 17 亿美元，并声称已为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www. multiverse.io/en-US/blog/multiverse-community-reaches-10-000-apprentices-and-alumni&quot;>;10,000 名学徒&lt;/a>;。 “我们长期以来一直相信学徒制模式，我们发现它对技术和数字工作特别有效，”劳斯莱斯数字制造主管 Rashitha Jayasekara 说，该公司与 Multiverse 合作提高现有员工的技能。 “学徒通过编程马拉松和项目工作获得的体验式学习使他们能够以标准培训无法做到的方式将理论与实践结合起来，并不断发展我们在公司内需要的技能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Verizon，另一家Multiverse 客户，使用学徒制模型来填补软件工程职位和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multiverse.io/en-US/blog/creating-software-engineering-jobs-verizon&quot;>;报告&lt;/a>; 95% 的初始队列在完成学徒计划后接受了公司的全职工作。 Verizon 的首席信息官 Shankar Arumugavelu 说，Verizon 计划旨在“降低进入软件工作的门槛，同时培训真正优秀的软件开发人员，我们从根本上相信他们可以通过数字创新推动我们的业务发展”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学徒制并不适合所有培训需求。一方面，他们需要投入大量时间——在美国，正式的学徒制是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/apprenticeships_occupations-and-outlook.htm#:~ :text=Formal%20apprenticeship%20programs%20usually%20last,Department%20of%20Labor%20(DOL).&quot;>;通常为四年&lt;/a>;。在某些市场中，它们还可能受到限制性监管。例如，在英国，政府的学徒资助计划&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/365530295/Government-urged-to-address-broken-apprenticeship-levy-system&quot;>;已经批评&lt;/a>;过于死板，不符合雇主的需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;学费报销的新方法&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;历史上的精英如何受益所有人都可以访问&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;大公司长期以来一直愿意为员工的继续教育付费。然而，这些福利历来是为少数白领员工保留的，例如那些攻读行政 MBA 学位的人。或者要求员工自掏腰包支付课程费用，然后再报销。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于劳动力市场 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/ how-to-better-support-and-retain-frontline-workers&quot;>;改变了&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/02/companies-offer-tuition- assistance-so-workers-can-go-back-to-college.html&quot;>;更多公司&lt;/a>;正在提供学费福利，作为留住一线员工的一种方式——店员、咖啡师、司机和小时工。作为回应，出现了一类新的公司，以平滑和同步培训提供者、雇主、雇员和（在某些情况下）政府之间的关系。员工会得到指导、建议和支持，以帮助他们找到适合自己的培训计划，培训计划的费用由雇主支付。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，在 2021 年，Target 宣布了一项学费资助名为&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.target.com/article/2022/09/dream-to-be-anniversary#:~:text=Our%20%24200%20million%20investment%20in,skills% 20and%20build%20their%20careers.&quot;>;“Dream to Be&lt;/a>;”与 Guild 合作，Guild 是这个不断发展的领域的领先企业之一。根据首席多元化和包容性官 Kiera Fernandez 的说法，“Target 提供传统的学费报销计划已有二十多年了。现在，通过我们与 Guild 合作提供 Dream to Be，团队成员可以在 40 多所学校、学院和大学上课……无需自付费用。”费尔南德斯说，截至 2023 年 4 月，已有超过 25,000 名员工获准参加该计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果设计得当，学费援助计划对雇主的好处是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www. fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/human-resources/articles/tuition-reimbursement/&quot;>;清除&lt;/a>;。例如，休闲快餐连锁店 Chipotle 的首席财务官 Jack Hartung &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/04/09/chipotle-cfo-says-debt-free- degree-is-a-way-to-invest-in-employees.html&quot;>;告诉 CNBC&lt;/a>;，“利用公司免费学位的员工留在公司的可能性高出三倍半，并且晋升到管理层的可能性要高出七倍。”然而，研究表明，虽然 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180108006550/en/New-Study-Shows-Lasting-Impact-Tuition-Assistance#:~:text=84% 25%20say%20access%20to%20a%20tuition%20assistance%20program%20was%20important%20in%20their%20decision%20to%20join%20the%20company&quot;>;84%&lt;/a>; 的员工高度重视学费报销福利，在平均，&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/nulr/vol117/iss6/5/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20despite%20their%20increasing%20availability%2C%20only%202 %25%20of%20employees%2C%20as%20a%20percentage%20of%20those%20interested%20in%20pursuing%20further%20education%2C%20are%20utilizing%20these%20reimbursement%20programs&quot;>;只有 2%&lt;/a>;符合条件的员工使用此福利。这意味着雇主必须采取更多措施来利用这一强大的工具。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;向学习体验平台的转变&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;员工如何知道接下来要学习什么&lt;/ h3>; &lt;p>;组织和跟踪员工正在学习的内容可能是一项繁琐的任务。多年来，这项工作一直由称为“学习管理系统”(LMS) 的软件完成，这是一种相对简单的工具，用于存储学习材料，通常以演示文稿、视频和文本的形式。大多数大公司 &lt;a href=&quot;https://trainingmag.com/2021-training-industry-report/#:~:text=Some%2098%20percent%20of%20large%20companies%20and%2096%20percent%20of% 20midsize%20ones%20currently%20use%20LMSs%20vs.%2080%20percent%20of%20small%20companies.&quot;>;有一个&lt;/a>;，但员工很少&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/网站/kevinkruse/2021/04/27/学位的使用是传统学习平台的两倍/?sh=58ba9a1a2d3d#:~:text=most%20LMS%20and%20online%20content% 20companies%20only%20see%205%25%20to%2015%25%20of%20licensed%20seats%20used%20in%20any%20given%20month.&quot;>;花很多时间&lt;/a>;在他们身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;在过去几年中，新一波工具将 LMS 转变为“学习体验平台”(LXP)，具有技能评估、Netflix 风格的下一步学习建议以及内部社交网络等功能。 LXP“让学习与个人相关，而不仅仅是管理培训计划，”Degreed 战略高级副总裁 Todd Tauber 表示，Degreed 是该领域的领先供应商之一。行业分析师 Josh Bersin 估计 LXP 市场为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2022/06/corporate-learning-bombshel​​l-degreed-acquires-learnin-david-blake-returns/&quot;>;5 亿美元， &lt;/a>; 从 &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2018/07/edcast-expands-the-lxp-market-with-focus-on-global-upskilling/&quot;>;2 亿美元&lt;/a >; 2018 年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;客户报告该模型正在运行。 Chris Harry 是 TEK Systems 的首席学习官，这是一家一直在使用 Degreed 的人力资源公司。 “自从将我们的各种员工发展计划转移到 Degreed 上以来，我们已经看到了有史以来最高的参与度和满意度，”他说。根据 Harry 的说法，96% 的 TEK 员工都在 Degreed 中创建了一个帐户，公司始终看到其中 40% 到 50% 的员工每个月都在积极使用该平台，他说这“远远高于我们之前看到的任何东西”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像这样的结果需要真正的投资，而不仅仅是购买技术。对于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.degreed.com/hubfs/Client%20Case%20Studies/Ericsson/Ericsson+Degreed%20Case%20Study_Q2-22_EN-US.pdf?utm_campaign=Ericsson%20Case%20Study%20May% 20%2722&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=214005662&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_8Z515BnP5WAJI5xGCg8ZF2Zi2ftiYmmfHEKikOYkDheoBPQzXBzi5mM6FOcyAZGppjQgdYXltDyoeVVC1bEnUM 8xfnubGHUldzPilsSLH3Yk90&amp;amp;utm_content=214005662&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_automation&quot;>;示例&lt;/a>;，另一家 Degreed 客户爱立信表示，它聘请了内部拥护者并开发了广泛的内部营销&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;教练的民主化&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;我们所有人如何才能拥有一个夏尔巴协作我们的职业&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;专业教练是一种&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-12395-008&quot;>;易于理解&lt;/a>;的促进员工学习的方式、信心和有效性。然而，它通常是 &lt;a href=&quot;/2009/01/what-c​​an-coaches-do-for-you#:~:text=they%E2%80%99re%20usually%20called%20executive%20coaches% 2C%20and%20they%20can%20earn%20up%20to%20%243%2C500%20an%20hour.&quot;>;昂贵&lt;/a>;工具，仅供高级管理人员使用。此外，即使对于那些负担得起的人来说，寻找教练也可能是一个挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新平台的出现利用技术让寻找、匹配教练以及与教练合作变得更加容易。新公司提供工具来评估每个员工对教练的需求，为他们匹配具有合适经验和专业知识的教练，甚至通过数字平台进行辅导课程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;空间正在扩大。根据国际教练联合会的数据，2021 年有 &lt;a href=&quot;https://coachfederation.org/app/uploads/2020/09/FINAL_ICF_GCS2020_ExecutiveSummary.pdf&quot;>;71,000&lt;/a>; 名执业教练，比 2016 年增长 33% . 投资者预计增长将继续：领先的数字教练初创公司 BetterUp 在 2021 年以 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterup&quot;>;50 亿美元的估值&lt;/a>; 筹集了 3 亿美元&lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2022/01/online-coaching-is-so-hot-its-now-disrupting-leadership-development/&quot;>;投资&lt;/a>;浪潮的一部分教练初创公司。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种增长的很大一部分是由大公司为员工提供更广泛的教练服务所推动的。总部位于法国的食品公司达能一直在与供应商 CoachHub 合作，为 250 名员工提供这项福利。荷兰达能多元化和包容性负责人马克西姆·奥朗德 (Maxime Hollande) 表示，“这些辅导课程为员工带来了巨大的附加值……我们密切关注的指标之一是每位员工在实现个人目标方面取得的进展程度他们与他们的教练一起定义。该指标的平均分为 4.9 分（满分 5 分）。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国全球能源公司雪佛龙 (Chevron) 通过 BetterUp 为其全球 7,000 名经理提供了辅导课程。 “在 BetterUp 之前，我们利用了各种内部教练资源和多个外部教练供应商，”雪佛龙首席人力资源官 Rhonda Morris 解释说。 “BetterUp 的虚拟教练模式……使我们的教练文化更加成熟，让所有想要它的人都能更容易地使用它。&amp;nbsp;教练不再需要出差去见我们的员工。我们的员工对他们在 BetterUp 的积极体验直言不讳。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于辅导课程本质上是私人体验，因此雇主可能很难确保关注对他们来说最重要的主题。在雪佛龙，他们每个季度都通过要求员工对接受过辅导的领导者的效率进行评分来衡量成功与否。 “领导效能一直是我们组织中得分最高的类别之一，”莫里斯说。 “这表明我们的 BetterUp 产品正在对我们的员工队伍和文化产生积极影响。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;基于队列的课程的兴起&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;如何构建在线真技能&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;谈到在线学习，大多数参与者&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7958&quot;>;没有完成&lt;/a >; 他们开始的课程，主要是因为学习体验是异步的。个人必须有纪律和勤奋，才能独立完成大量的学习材料。这在今天的工作场所尤其困难，会议和分心的次数已经&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/great-expectations-making-hybrid -work-work&quot;>;近年来激增&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，一种名为“&lt;a href=&quot;https://future.com/cohort-based-courses/&quot; >;基于队列的课程&lt;/a>;”已成为提高完成率的一种方式。一组参与者一起参加一门课程，课程有明确的开始和结束日期、定期的家庭作业，并由一位讲师主持定期的在线在线讨论会。在这种更加结构化的形式中，参与者仍然可以在自己的时间访问大部分学习材料，从而使他们更容易完成课程并有机会在课程期间应用所学知识。这个领域的先驱之一 altMBA 表示，它的学习者已经取得了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/behavior-design/how-to-design-an-online-course-with-a-96 -completion-rate-180678117a85&quot;>;96% 的完成率&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boston Consulting Group (BCG) 是采用队列课程的领先雇主，与 Emeritus 合作（我在那里工作）。 BCG 全球学习和团队执行总监 Lidia Juszko 描述了这种模式如何特别适合像她这样的专业服务公司。 “我们发现，基于队列的课程提供了一定程度的结构和支持，使它们比标准在线学习更具吸引力，”她说。 “我们的同事报告说，与讲师的‘办公时间’、与其他学员的现场讨论会以及每周完成的短视频和练习的组合和节奏是他们更容易学习的方式。像这样的学习和发展机会让我们能够继续吸引和留住最优秀的人才。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全球银行业组织汇丰银行最近也开始试行基于队列的在线课程，早期结果令人鼓舞.人力资源全球主管 David Morris 表示：“鉴于我们市场的范围和复杂性，我们面临的挑战之一是以在线形式提供深度学习。我们的早期结果表明，基于队列的在线形式在完成度、信心和能力等关键指标方面取得了显着改善。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种形式的缺点是使其有效的实时学习元素来了付出巨大的代价。标准在线课程开放图书馆的单一许可费用约为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/comparing-subscription-pricing-2023.png&quot;每月 >;30 到 60 美元&lt;/a>; 即可访问数千门课程（大多数供应商还提供大量折扣）。同时，基于队列的课程的费用可能介于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2021/12/17/how-cohort-based-learning-is-transforming-online-education/ #:~:text=Another%20notable%20difference%20is%20the%20price%3B%20cohort%20based%20courses%20can%20range%20anywhere%20from%20%24500%20up%20to%20more%20than%20%245% 2C000。”>;每门课程 500 美元和 5,000 美元&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;。&lt;/em>;这意味着基于群组的学习不太可能成为所有员工的选择，雇主必须谨慎决定谁能从中受益最多。&lt;/em>; p>; &lt;p>;我们正处于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2022/12/02/many-indicators-imply-a-2023-recession-the-jobs- market-disagrees/&quot;>;不寻常的&lt;/a>;经济形势，经济衰退的担忧加剧，但就业市场&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/b1b710a1-6d12-43e5-8508- ae4584a7289a&quot;>;仍然紧张&lt;/a>;。由于培训预算不可避免地&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1812542/half-organisations-looking-cut-ld-costs-amid-economic-difficulty-survey-reveals&quot;>;受到限制压力&lt;/a>;，组织将需要找到更有针对性的方法来解决他们的技能差距。上述五种方法可以帮助公司超越 MOOC，找到适合其员工的学习计划。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;总的来说，美国对患有慢性病的贫困老人的照顾还有很多不足之处。 PACE 是一种全面、综合、以社区为基础的护理方法，可以让老年人尽可能长时间地继续住在家里，可以作为改善这一人群需求的典范。本文介绍了 PACE Southeast Michigan，一个出色的 PACE 项目。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;美国医疗保健系统的建立并不是为了改善最脆弱、长期患病、老人，尤其是穷人。年长的穷人经常面临&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016701/&quot;>;孤独、抑郁&lt;/a>;目标感丧失以及无力独立生活在自己的家中。他们还遇到许多医疗服务障碍，包括护理协调不足、&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/how-to-pay-for-health-care&quot;>;按服务付费&lt;/a>;，这通常会反射性地鼓励医疗优于其他形式的护理，以及&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2759755&quot;>;功能失调&lt;/a>;疗养院行业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;帮助为了改善对这些患者的服务，我们分析了一项名为 PACE 的国家计划的设计和实施：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/Medicare-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare-and-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare- Medicaid-Coordination-Office/PACE/PACE&quot;>;老年人综合护理计划&lt;/a>;。我们专注于此计划，因为所有 PACE 参与者都很脆弱：他们需要疗养院级别的护理，并且 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npaonline.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/Issue%20Brief_Medicaid%20Rate% 20Setting%20for%20PACE%202.21.pdf&quot;>;90%&lt;/a>; 有资格享受医疗保险和医疗补助。&lt;em>;&lt;/em>;很少有综合护理计划为这一双重资格人群提供服务，现在人数 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/a-profile-of-medicare-medicaid-enrollees-dual- eligibles/#:~:text=The%2012.5%20million%20people%20who,from%20their%20state%20Medicaid%20program.&quot;>;1250 万&lt;/a>;美国人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深入采访由我们两人（Len Berry 和 Sunjay Letchuman）主持的 PACE 工作人员和项目参与者；与 PACE 领导人合作，包括本文的两位合著者（Mary Kummer Naber 和 Peter Fitzgerald）；我们对密歇根州东南部 PACE 模式（由 Mary 领导）的特点和日常运营进行的集体分析揭示了 PACE 如何成功地为贫困老年人提供个性化的、以家庭为中心的护理，同时降低总体成本。鉴于 PACE 目前仅服务于其中约 60,000 名患者，扩大该计划对全国医疗保健系统具有有益的管理和成本影响。尽管疗养院和其他制度化的养老服务显然需要改进，但美国也必须投资重新构想养老服务。 PACE 提供了一个路线图。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;更全面、成本更低的护理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PACE 计划于 1973 年在旧金山首次开发，是一个全面、综合、以社区为基础的护理模式，让老年人尽可能长时间地继续住在家里。现在在 32 个州有 150 个 PACE 项目。基本理念是，护理应包括对老年穷人最重要的事情：包括营养、社交互动、交通和家庭保养在内的全包式护理，以及医疗和相关服务。目标是让患者有尊严地接受治疗，因为他们安全地住在家里，而不是在机构中，并从一个实体获得所有需要的服务——同时降低成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所有需要疗养院级别的 Medicare 受益人照顾但希望住在家里的人有资格获得 PACE。但是，不符合所在州医疗补助收入要求的医疗保险受益人必须支付相当于每月医疗补助付款的金额，这限制了数百万可以从该计划中受益的老年人的使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该计划为患者提供（称为“参与者”）他们所有的 Medicare 和 Medicaid 承保的福利，包括初级保健、成人日托、康复护理和在当地 PACE 中心的膳食。 PACE 提供交通和各种家庭服务，并支付其无法在内部提供的医疗服务，例如急诊室就诊和住院治疗。 PACE 组织由 Medicare 和 Medicaid 按月支付风险调整后按人头计算的费用，这意味着他们支付 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-education/american-indian-alaska- native/aian/ltss-ta-center/info/pace#:~:text=The%20program%20receives%20capitaated%20reimbursements,each%20patient%20the%20program%20serves.&quot;>;每月固定金额&lt;/a>;部分基于参与者的医疗复杂性。 PACE 计划承担所有护理的全部财务风险，参与者无需自付费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可用 &lt;a href=&quot;https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs .12637&quot;>;证据&lt;/a>;表明 PACE 降低了医疗保健的利用率和成本。与类似人群相比，PACE 参与者的住院率要低得多（每 1,000 人住院率 539 对 962 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430746/&quot;>;人年&lt; /a>;）。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/68/1/47/549686?login=true&quot;>;南卡罗来纳州&lt;/a>;相比之下，每位 PACE 参与者每年可节省近 9,000 美元与疗养院等替代性长期护理机构的居民一起； &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.wyo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SFY-2020-Wyoming-Medicaid-Annual-Report.pdf&quot;>;怀俄明州&lt;/a>;每个 PACE 节省超过 12,000 美元参与者。然而，PACE 远不止是省钱——它是为了恢复人们生活的尊严和快乐。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;一个典型的模型&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一个出色的 PACE 计划是 PACE Southeast Michigan (PACE SEMI)，国家 PACE 协会将其确定为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npaonline.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/2018%20AC%20PowerPoint.pdf&quot;>;“亮点”&lt;/a>; 因其增长和质量指标。 PACE SEMI 是一家免税非营利组织，由 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henryford.com/&quot;>;Henry Ford Health&lt;/a>; (55%) 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.pvm.org/&quot;>;密歇根长老会村庄&lt;/a>; (45%)。 PACE SEMI 拥有 7 个中心，为 1,600 名参与者提供服务并雇用 700 名员工，平均每月增加 30 名参与者的净注册人数，而全国 PACE 中心每月只有两名参与者。与 &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/9739cab65ad0221a66ebe45463d10d37/dual-eligible-beneficiaries- integrated-care.pdf&quot;>;25%&lt;/a>; 全国 PACE 参与者和 31% 的 Medicare Advantage 参保者。 PACE SEMI 参与者使用住院医院服务的频率也较低：2019 年，PACE SEMI 参与者减少了 302 &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service -type-reports/cms-program-statistics-medicare-advantage-inpatient-hospital&quot;>;每 1,000 人的住院率&lt;/a>; 与 Medicare Advantage 参保者相比。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PACE 模型建立在跨学科团队合作的基础上。所有 PACE SEMI 员工都应将自己视为身体、心理、情感和精神上的“治疗师”。他们包括强调预防疾病和伤害的初级保健医生，协调护理的护士和社会工作者，对可能对特定患者弊大于利的处方药保持警惕的现场药剂师，厨房厨师根据参与者的口味和过敏情况定制膳食的人，为日常活动（包括淋浴）提供支持性护理的参与者护理助理，以及将参与者往返 PACE 中心和其他重要目的地的司机。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与某些 PACE 计划不同，PACE SEMI 在每个中心都有行为健康和精神护理专家，他们了解他们所服务的每个参与者。在一位 PACE 医生提到的一个案例中，一位精神护理提供者要求诊所工作人员立即检查一名看起来“不正常”的病人。原来病人中风了，很快就得到了救命的救治。在一个不那么引人注目的案例中，一名社会工作者亲自说服当地一家 Trader Joe&#39;s 商店每周捐赠鲜花供参与者带回家。团队成员每周举行一次会议，在会上每个人都对如何避免可避免的急诊室就诊和提高参与者的生活质量发表平等的意见。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;全人护理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PACE 模型的核心是基于关系：参与者和工作人员彼此非常了解，这有助于为每个人量身定制“全人治疗”。事实上，成员之所以被称为“参与者”，正是因为他们在规划他们的护理方面发挥了积极作用，这远远超出了医疗服务，并且直面许多独居老年人所忍受的孤立。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天at a PACE SEMI center includes needed medical and rehabilitative services and is filled with customized activities such as music, painting, games, breakfast and lunch with friends, and regular group sessions where participants share “what I am grateful for,” cultivating a sense of belonging and community. Participants can get their hair shampooed, cut, and styled. They receive instruction on living safely at home and are given iPads (called “GrandPads”), designed for senior use, that let them easily contact family or PACE staff or play games. The kitchen prepares food for participants to take home at the end of the day. Participants can also use the onsite gym staffed with physical and occupational therapists. (“To see a 90-year-old working out is amazing,” one therapist said.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Dancing Kathy” arrived at PACE SEMI in a wheelchair. Aided by the rehabilitation staff, she eventually graduated to a walker and, months later, a cane. In an interview one year after starting at PACE, Kathy said she no longer needed the cane most of the time and could now dance. She then joined several staff members to dance the “Hustle” in front of the cafeteria lunch crowd.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Proactive Investments in Health&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Most of the enormous amount spent on health care in the United States is reactive. Patients get sick, treatment ensues, costs are incurred. PACE shows the potential of investing in health, not just health care, proactively. PACE SEMI and other well-run PACE programs do just about anything to help people continue to live at home safely. For instance, if a participant needs a shower chair at home to prevent a fall, PACE SEMI buys the chair, sets it up, and teaches the participant how to use it. With money generated by community fundraising, PACE SEMI fixes porches and stairs, replaces heaters, improves lighting, and even roots out bedbugs. It partners with an ambulance service whose paramedics often provide in-home care that prevents ER visits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such spending can greatly improve the quality of people&#39;s lives while reducing downstream costs. One of PACE SEMI&#39;s participants, “Mr. B,” had a career as a musician but now lives alone. After leaving the PACE center each week, Mr. B was a frequent visitor to ERs for mental health–related issues and anxiety. After the PACE staff realized Mr. B was missing music in his life, the center bought him a headset and player so he could listen to his favorite music. The ER visits stopped.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Service with a Soul&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PACE SEMI&#39;s secret sauce is its culture. Hiring for caring, not just competence, is as central as intensively training staff to distinguish between nonmedical healing and medical interventions. Some staff members with traditional health care backgrounds must “unlearn” their bias for episodic care. And in working with a vulnerable population, staff must move beyond risk aversion, common in institutional elder care.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keeping people safe does not require stealing their freedom, as Atul Gawande discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Being Mortal&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;: “…our elderly are left with a controlled and supervised institutional existence, a medically designed answer to unfixable problems, a life designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about.” With creativity, compassion, and commitment, a carefully selected, well-trained staff who are themselves treated with dignity can instill dignity, a sense of belonging, and even joy in PACE participants. As Renee, a food service worker at PACE SEMI, puts it, “We add love to the food.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PACE is about investing in people&#39;s well-being, keeping them as well as possible for as long as possible. It offers older adults the chance to live at home with a higher quality of care — and of life. The current model serves primarily low-income seniors; however, the bigger opportunity is to expand it to include all chronically ill older adults. Such models will be useful as Congress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/congress-considers-strategies-improve-medicare-and-medicaid-integration-dual-eligible&quot;>;crafts legislation&lt;/a>; to expand PACE, as health care organizations plan how to launch PACE programs efficiently and effectively, and as program leaders and managers seek to develop the nuts and bolts of care that offers healing to patients and energizes staff.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Your Love for Work May Alienate Your Colleagues]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/research-your-love-for-work-may-alienate-your-colleagues]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_14_1344042166-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;humanmade/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Research shows that employees who are passionate about their work are more productive, innovative, and collaborative.

The research on this topic &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.2434?casa_token=qK7aO_h5mzMAAAAA:00L4l-RKd7-sc3yfdVz-ToizgtmmobloM6Cvvd4-yWz19BX5JUsGmKTIzANA9GpjMzDpoGdT_LYoiw&quot;>;is clear&lt;/a>; — more passionate employees are more productive, innovative, and collaborative, and they demonstrate higher levels of commitment to their organizations. Fostering passion is a winning strategy for organizations that aspire to achieve sustained growth, innovation, and success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the pursuit of nurturing passion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2020.1761?af=R&quot;>;our recent research&lt;/a>; reveals that employers may have overlooked and neglected the needs of employees driven by other sources of motivation, such as financial stability, social status, or familial obligations. These employees &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/06/lets-hear-it-for-b-players&quot;>;play a critical role in the success of their companies&lt;/a>;, but may be subject to an invisible penalty due to their perceived lack of passion for their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Doing What You Love Makes You “Moralize” Loving Your Work&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Our research involving 1,245 full-time employees across several organizations that varied in size and industry revealed a novel phenomenon in the contemporary workplace: The more people love their work, the more they see it as a moral imperative. Employees who were more passionate about their work agreed more strongly with sentences like “Working for personal enjoyment is morally virtuous” and “Being intrinsically motivated is moral.” For these individuals, loving their work had moral significance beyond personal fulfillment, and they were more likely to judge their colleagues&#39; work motivations against their own moral yardstick or ask, “Are my colleagues here for the &lt;em>;right&lt;/em>; reasons?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This emphasis on loving your work as a moral obligation has far-reaching implications. Our research suggests that those who love their work more are also more likely to view working for external rewards less favorably. Those who agreed with sentences like “Being intrinsically motivated is moral” also agreed with sentences like “Those who do their work for money alone are not virtuous employees” and “Employees who are motivated by external rewards tend to be immoral.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Critically, we found consequences to these character judgements. Employees who love their work more also prioritized helping their more passionate colleagues, whom they consider morally superior. In contrast, employees who worked for other reasons received less help from their more passionate colleagues, making it more difficult for them to advance in their organizations and making them more likely to be excluded from important projects. Such treatment can have severe consequences for employee morale, retention, and overall organizational performance. By contrast, employees who worked for external rewards treated their colleagues equally, regardless of why they worked.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Creating an Environment that Values Employees&#39; Diverse Motivations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Managers need to be aware that organizations that valorize passion can create a sense of alienation for some employees. Recognizing and celebrating the unique contributions of all employees, regardless of their underlying motivations, will help create a sense of belonging and purpose among your workforce, leading to increased engagement and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers should also strive to foster an open and inclusive workplace culture where employees feel comfortable discussing their motivations and goals, even when they are misaligned with a passion-driven ethos. This can both encourage dialogue between employees who vary in their motivations for working and provide opportunities for employees to explore and develop their passion both inside and outside the workplace. For example, mentorship, networking relationships, or job crafting (ie, spending more time on tasks that are more meaningful to them) can expose employees to roles they may be more excited about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are an employee who loves their work, keep in mind that this could make you more judgmental about your colleagues and affect how much you help them. Not everyone needs to do the work because they are passionate about it. Some employees may have families to take care of, need benefits as a safety net, or have not yet discovered their true passion for work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, organizations should examine whether their benefits and perks appeal to employees with diverse motivations. While some employees may be attracted to work because they are passionate about it, others may be motivated by flexible work arrangements, or access to professional development opportunities. By offering a range of benefits and perks, leaders can create a workplace that appeals to employees with diverse motivations and help retain top talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the prevalent belief that passion is crucial for success, all employees should be appreciated for who they are and how they contribute — regardless of their motivations for working. Leaders should recognize the diverse motivations that drive their workforce and create an inclusive environment that supports and values all forms of motivation, rather than penalizing those who do not fit the passion-centric mold.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Apple&rsquo;s Vision Pro Really For?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/what-is-apples-vision-pro-really-for]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_14_1496199364_1363676153.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Justin Sullivan/ Damian Pawlos/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;To understand the value of Apple&amp;#8217;s new goggles, it&amp;#8217;s helpful to think about how virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) correspond to two fundamental tasks in decision making. VR presents new information; AR distills information from an existing environment. But previous headsets and internet-enabled glasses haven&amp;#8217;t tapped into the potential for either of these in a decision-making context. Apple is betting that it can build an ecosystem of app developers who can.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-is-apples-vision-pro-really-for?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-is-apples-vision-pro-really-for?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Apple announced a new computer last week, to great fanfare. The Vision Pro is a computer that is worn on your face, but the novel aspect is how you use it. Rather than view the computer&#39;s output through a physical screen, that output is projected directly into your eyes with two very small but high-resolution displays a very small distance in front of you. Rather than control the computer through a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen, the primary user interface is through eye tracking and gestures. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Just as they removed the stylus for screens when they launched the iPhone, Apple requires no physical controller to use the computer. The computer senses what you are interested in interacting with by watching your eye movement and then looks at your hands to determine what you want to do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;There have been antecedents to each of these things — a myriad of worn devices for viewing such as the Google Glass or Meta&#39;s Quest Pro and technologies such as &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/reviews/leap-motion-controller-review/&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;Leap Motion&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; and the &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVDPrFvBvWw&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;Myo Armband&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; for gesture control. But none of these predecessors put it all together as a coherent vision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Apple has termed this new device &lt;/span>;a spatial computer&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;. The name is apt, because the device can use any physical space around you as a canvas to display digital outputs. There is no need for a desk (or lap) to place the device, and there are no limits on the size of the perceived viewing area. That means you could technically sit in a small space, like an airplane seat, and watch a cinema-sized movie. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;What should you be aiming to do with a spatial computer? Right now, Apple has outlined use cases that seem pedestrian. You can use it like a normal computer or iPad but with the current 2D information presented on a much more flexible and unconstrained display. There&#39;s demand for that. It will be of value where you do not have much space. And it will be of value to those who currently use their space with a host of large displays. In that sense, the closest analogue is a very large-screen TV. Would people pay $3,500 for that? They do right now. Even Apple sells a display (the Pro Display XDR) that can cost up to $6,000. From that perspective, it is easily in the cost ballpark for current use cases. This strategy also has the benefit of seeding this new platform with the vast number of applications that already exist for the iPad and the iPhone.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;A better and more convenient display for 2D content, however, does not appear to justify the technological and R&amp;amp;D weight that has gone into the Vision Pro. The real question is whether this device can lead to the augmented and virtual reality applications that would justify strapping a computer to your head. It certainly has the technical capabilities to do so. The Vision Pro can display 3D objects in your current space or even transport you to new spaces. Apple, however, barely mentioned the terms AR and VR during their announcement. In doing so, they drew a line people have not drawn before. This is no AR or VR device or technology. The technology is a spatial computer, and if there is a role for AR and VR, it is in applications that run on a spatial computer.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Let&#39;s review those concepts. Augmented reality (or AR) involves taking the environment around you and changing your perception of it. Google Glass did this by showing you notifications via smart glasses. The Vision Pro does this by placing 2D displays in that environment and fixing them so that when your head moves, the display does not. It appears to be there in your current environment. This is achieved by passing a very accurate video of the real world through the device to you. You don&#39;t see your environment directly, but you think you are doing so. Thus, technically, Apple is augmenting a video capture of your environment, not overlaying things on your direct viewing of it. To a user, there&#39;s no real difference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Virtual reality (or VR) involves taking the user and immersing them in a virtual environment. The Vision Pro captures the full attention of your eye, and so you are, by definition, immersed in a virtual environment. In one mode, that looks like the environment you are actually in. Turn the dial, and that can change, and you can be transported somewhere else. The video pass-through from your current environment is replaced by a digitally created 3D environment. From that perspective, this is clearly a VR device. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;The important thing to note is that despite being capable of AR and VR, these use-cases were not emphasized by Apple. Thus, they have produced a device capable of both but have not found compelling use cases in either domain. This is one of the reasons that they announced it at their annual developer conference. Apple needs apps, and they need other people to imagine them.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;In a &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16872&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;recent paper&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, we outlined what we believed were the ways that AR and VR apps could add unique value. Beyond gaming and entertainment, our focus is on economic uses — specifically, those that would increase users&#39; productivity. In this respect, we ask: Which AR and VR applications can create real value by assisting users in making better decisions? For someone looking to build applications for the platform Apple has created, understanding the possibilities is crucial. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Most decisions involve some degree of uncertainty. Information is the cure for that, allowing you to know more and, therefore, make fewer errors. But there are two aspects to using information in decisions. First, you need to have the right information available. Second, you need to have the cognitive space to distill and parse that information for usefulness.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;As it turns out, AR and VR map into each of these things. VR has the ability to present the user with more relevant information, especially when that information is either not with them or is costly to acquire. By immersing users in new contexts, what it does is bring that information to them. In some cases, it may be a realistic view of what is going on inside a building, say, during a fire. In other cases, it presents a safe, simulated environment, such as a flight simulator that facilitates training without the high stakes.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;By contrast, AR takes information presented in a given context and parses it to yield the information that is relevant. For instance, when you meet someone at a conference, it provides identification of who that person is without you having to search your own memory. Or, it can provide a helpful overlay with exit routes if you are dealing with a fire. In each case, the goal is to distill the quantity of information from the user&#39;s environment and present the information that is needed. The one thing to note is that the Vision Pro is not meant to be a portable computer to be used outside of the home or the workplace, which limits its applicability in navigating external environments (such as while driving).&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;This perspective highlights why many previous AR and VR purported use cases have been of low value. VR meetings with avatars in pretty rooms do not provide information that is obviously more useful to those in the meetings that might arise from a Zoom call. AR glasses that provide text notifications as you walk around are increasing your cognitive load rather than decreasing it. Our framework suggests that the best use cases will be in contexts where it is normally expensive or dangerous to get information, highlighting the value of VR, or where the environment is so complex that the value of digital overlays to clarify it via AR is high &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;— &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;or both. Think applications like prototyping the design of a new aircraft or building, or assisting in remote medical procedures. The Vision Pro exhibits capabilities of being able to do each of these things but the job of experimenting and designing for these use cases has been left to others. Developers looking to profit off the platform Apple has created would do well to focus on applications that provide users with hard-to-access contextual information at just the right level of detail.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;This is par for the course for Apple when they first introduce a device. The iPod was a digital walkman. The iPhone was a connected iPod. The iPad was a bigger iPhone. The Apple Watch was a better smartwatch. And the Vision Pro is an unconstrained 3D screen. In the previous cases, the device is outgrown and becomes more than that initial use by enabling developer innovation. The Vision Pro is a welcome new&lt;/span>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshuagans.substack.com/p/apples-big-experiment&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;experiment&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; along a well-trodden path in computing.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Proactively Defuse Tension on Your Team]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-proactively-defuse-tension-on-your-team]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_13_691050121.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Westend61/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Unaddressed and unresolved interpersonal tensions and toxic behavior can lead to organizational failure. They can impact team performance, collaboration, and productivity, create operational friction among teams, and cause employees to feel disengaged, distrustful, and unmotivated. While conflict at work is inevitable, we often have our own agency to proactively root out problems and stop them from escalating swiftly with empathy, accountability, self-awareness, and courage. The author, a Chief People Officer, offers five steps to do this: 1) Root out toxic behavior and tensions, 2) seek to understand, not just be understood, 3) assess the right time to intervene, 4) ask for help, and 5) repair harm; repair trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-proactively-defuse-tension-on-your-team?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-proactively-defuse-tension-on-your-team?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As a chief people officer, I have seen firsthand how unaddressed and unresolved interpersonal tensions and toxic behavior can lead to organizational failure. A subtle racial slight, an argument over a project&#39;s deliverables, or gossip over perceived unfair advantages can negatively impact team performance, collaboration, and productivity, create operational friction among teams, and cause employees to feel disengaged, distrustful, and unmotivated. These issues can arise due to various factors, including differences in personality and perspectives, racial,&amp;nbsp;class&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>; and gender privilege, work and communication styles, power imbalances, and/or lack of transparency and clarity over work processes and business goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/how-to-navigate-conflict-with-a-coworker&quot;>;interpersonal conflict at work is inevitable&lt;/a>;, we often forget our own agency to root out problems and stop them from escalating swiftly with empathy, accountability, self-awareness, and courage. Doing so can feel scary and dangerous, especially when you&#39;re a junior team member or belong to one or more underrepresented groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, a young woman of color, a rising star at my organization, expressed reservations about joining a new team that could significantly advance her career. During a conversation with the team&#39;s manager, she was troubled when he made an insensitive remark about what he perceived as racial segregation of employees at a social event. Concerned about her career and the potential for a racially hostile or uncomfortable work environment where this manager may not respect her identity and experiences, she sought guidance from her HR business partner, who directed her to me.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We discussed her desired outcome of joining the team while holding the manager accountable for the impact of his words and encouraging improvements in his behavior. I offered her the choice of addressing the issue directly or receiving support from me in the conversation, prioritizing her safety and dignity. After careful consideration, she chose to engage directly. I coached her on how to express herself confidently and thoughtfully. Subsequently, she shared a positive outcome—the manager demonstrated empathy, offered a genuine apology, and committed to openly acknowledging the dismissive comments with the entire team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the experience of this employee and many others I&#39;ve coached throughout my career, here are five actions that you&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;can take to reduce or stop interpersonal tensions and toxic behavior if you witness or experience harm in the workplace:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Identify the root cause of the tension.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When dealing with interpersonal friction in the workplace, the first step is to identify the root causes — the true sources of tension. In her book, &lt;em>;The Fearless Organization&lt;/em>;, Amy Edmondson explores the cost of a lack of psychological safety in organizations, including toxic work environments, burnout, and human capital loss.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Removing unhealthy behaviors that reduce individuals&#39; and teams&#39; safety, comfort, and performance requires us to face what needs to be changed. Power imbalances and differences of opinion over how to run a project, which partners to engage with, and performance measures are often the root cause of misunderstandings, disagreements, and collaboration collapse. In those situations, junior employees, women of color, and underrepresented employees are often afraid to speak up about conflict for fear of retaliation or being judged negatively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above example, the root cause of tension was the manager&#39;s racially insensitive comment, leading to concerns about a potentially hostile or uncomfortable work environment, lack of respect, and disregard for the lived experiences of this woman of color and others. By approaching such situations with support, empathy, and courage, we can uncover and address the underlying causes of tensions and prevent them from negatively impacting individuals&#39; well-being and professional development. It&#39;s important to recognize that this approach may not always be feasible or safe. In this case, the employee trusted that I would intervene if the conversation veered off course.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Seek to understand, not just be understood.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Professional relationships are human relationships fraught with shared misunderstandings. A wrongly placed, unintentional word in a stressful moment, especially those fed by gender and racial biases, can drive a deep wedge between coworkers. To build shared understanding, it is important to hold space for others&#39; opinions, empathize with complex and nuanced situations, and take responsibility for nurturing a sense of safety and trust among colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this instance, the manager embraced the opportunity to connect, learn, and grow, seeking to comprehend the impact of their words and actions instead of adopting a defensive stance. This response demonstrated a willingness to acknowledge mistakes and make an effort to change without fearing appearing incompetent or being canceled. Rather than deflecting or bemoaning leadership challenges, the manager prioritized their team&#39;s well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By helping the manager see and understand her concerns, the employee demonstrated a remarkable level of empathy. Though it would have been fair for her to write off this manager, she recognized the opportunity for growth and engaged in a constructive dialogue. This approach allowed her to assert her agency in addressing the manager&#39;s lack of awareness regarding insensitive comments. She chose to model a collaborative approach where others could learn and improve.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their interaction vividly demonstrated the transformative power of open, safe, and trusting communication, highlighting the remarkable potential for positive change when both parties approach tricky, uncomfortable conversations with an authentic intention to understand and be understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Assess the right time to intervene.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Saying something and not saying something are both choices that carry profound consequences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, an intervention can occur in the moment or shortly after that. If you&#39;re alone with someone who has just shared an offensive, denigrating, or derogatory comment and feel at risk of saying something that may be misunderstood or weaponized against you, wait until there are others around that can offer support or report it to HR or an anonymous hotline. Alternatively, if you feel comfortable, you can try saying, “When you said ___, I felt ____” or “I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t mean it, but that comment didn&#39;t land well on me.” The person receiving the feedback may need to be made aware of the impact of their words and actions. Waiting too long risks negative feelings lingering and growing within yourself and others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Had the employee not shared her concerns, or had the manager responded defensively and retaliated, it would have resulted in a missed opportunity to cultivate a healthy and thriving workplace environment. Moreover, it could have perpetuated a culture of fear and burdened her and other employees who share similar fears, ultimately hindering their growth and well-being throughout their careers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Ask for help.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As I advanced in my career, I yearned for leaders who would use their position of authority to challenge toxic behavior. As I assumed leadership roles myself, I realized the responsibility fell on me to exemplify the behaviors I desired.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you lack guidance from a manager or leader on navigating tricky situations or your organization&#39;s conflict resolution, grievance, and disciplinary procedures, turn to your HR team. I understand the hesitation in reaching out, especially if your relationship with HR isn&#39;t strong. Nevertheless, HR is there to advocate for employee voice, agency, and safety. They can assist you in gathering information, understanding root causes, and determining appropriate actions. An HR partner can facilitate constructive dialogue, coach you and others involved, and find proactive solutions to address behavioral issues. It&#39;s important to approach this option carefully, as it may intensify tensions or discomfort among team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/diversity%20and%20inclusion/women%20in%20the%20workplace%202022/women-in-the-workplace-2022.pdf&quot;>;Women in the Workplace 2022&lt;/a>;, LeanIn and McKinsey&#39;s annual report about the state of women in corporate America, women overall, and Black women and women with disabilities in particular, frequently experience microaggressions at work, such as having their judgment questioned or receiving criticism for their demeanor. Seeking support from the resources available in the workplace can make a significant difference in fostering a thriving and healthy career. Holding colleagues, managers, and leadership accountable is crucial in addressing and mitigating these harmful experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this example, the employee approached HR for coaching to navigate this complex situation. By utilizing available resources, she empowered herself to address the issue effectively, making a significant difference in her experience and that of others on the team. Her proactive approach, seeking assistance, being open to feedback, and engaging in self-reflection, played a pivotal role in achieving a positive outcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Repair harm; repair trust.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Repeated acts of harm, such as subtle &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/research-the-real-time-impact-of-microaggressions&quot;>;microaggressions&lt;/a>;, can weigh heavily on well-being, workplace satisfaction, and productivity. To heal from interpersonal tensions that arise from misunderstandings, misaligned perspectives or expectations, hurtful language, abuses of power, or breaches of trust, the person harmed must feel heard, respected, and valued.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Kay Pranis, a national leader in restorative justice, assuming accountability and implementing measures to rectify the damage caused and prevent its recurrence requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://irp.cdn-website.com/76b5fa75/files/uploaded/Kay%20Pranis%20Article%20for%20March%20Blog.pdf&quot;>;five elements&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Acknowledge that your actions caused harm.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Acknowledge that you had agency in those actions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Understand the full impact of your actions on anyone who was impacted.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Take steps to repair the harm and make amends.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Identify patterns or habits that led to causing harm and take steps to change those habits.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;Repairing harm can manifest in various ways: acknowledging the harm, expressing remorse, admitting guilt, and committing to behavioral change through new policies, commitments, or agreements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a woman of color, I&#39;ve heard my fair share of comments that offend, upset, or hurt me, and I have regrettably done the same to others. Whenever I&#39;ve been the target of microaggressions, I try to collect my thoughts and emotions before addressing a coworker, respond assertively with “I” statements, and often reply with kindness and humor to defuse the tension. For example: “When you restated my recommendation in the recap meeting without giving me credit, I felt erased from our conversation. I&#39;d like us to have a healthy working relationship. Can you help me understand why you omitted my contribution?” Or: “When you confused me for the other Latina on the floor, I felt we were both invisible to you. And I think I&#39;m pretty memorable!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I unintentionally make an insensitive comment, such as misgendering someone, I immediately approach the impacted individual with humility. I sincerely listen to understand the impact of my words and offer a heartfelt apology while taking complete accountability for my words and actions. I also encourage them to call me in if I repeat such behavior because I am committed to learning from my mistakes and growing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be clear, it is not the responsibility of women, BIPOC, or members of marginalized communities to educate their colleagues on how to foster healthy interactions. To proactively create more meaningful relationships, ask yourself these questions: How can I focus on what the person is saying, and not solely on how they say it or how they look? What else do I need to know to understand what my colleague is trying to communicate instead of dismissing or avoiding what they say? And before addressing someone&#39;s uncomfortable comment, ask yourself: Am I responding to being shut down, ignored, or offended, or am I trying to be right? If both parties are willing, there are ways of responding that can lead to constructive conversations and shared understanding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Repeated acts of harm in particular must be addressed. MIT&#39;s Sloan School of Management conducted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/&quot;>;a study in 2022&lt;/a>; that found that employee turnover is 10 times more influenced by a toxic corporate culture than compensation. Taking responsibility means understanding the wide range of perspectives and experiences across teams and proactively identifying sources of tension. A good starting point is asking yourself, “What do I need to hear, what do I need to say, and what would I like to see as an outcome?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this example, the manager took essential steps to repair the trust his insensitive comments had initially broken. He demonstrated accountability by acknowledging the harm his words caused and engaged in open dialogue. By actively working to understand the impact of his words and offering to take tangible steps to change his behavior, he successfully began repairing the trust with his new employee and, quite possibly, his relationship with the broader team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of us want to change workplace conditions so everyone can thrive, yet sometimes, we are terrified of messing up, saying the wrong thing, or not being able to do enough. Addressing interpersonal tensions and toxicity requires an ongoing, proactive effort that fosters empathy, intentionality, and courage. By identifying the true source of the tension, seeking understanding, assessing when to intervene, involving neutral third parties if necessary, and repairing harm and trust quickly and often, you can prevent conflict from escalating and build a stronger, more connected, and more effective team.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Game Plan for Funding Carbon Offsets]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_13_-537715290_-1363813940.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration: Edmon de Haro; Baloncici/Getty Images (chimney); Vitalina/Getty Images (butterflies)&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The most common types of carbon offsets are nature-based offsets such as forests. Unfortunately, while emissions remain in the atmosphere around 1,000 years, possibly longer, a tree can only remove carbon for its lifespan of 10o or so years, which means a forest planted as a carbon offset must be maintained with trees replanted at least ten times to &amp;#160;match the emission it is offsetting. Most businesses will be reluctant to tie up capital in this way, but such projects can be (and have been) financed by perpetual bonds, which represent attractive investments for investors such as university endowments that have very long liability streams extending far into the future. The use of financial instruments such as perpetual bonds can make considerable quantities of capital available to offset producers, spurring the production and the creation of spot markets in offsets that can definitively and reliably be offset against emissions.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-game-plan-for-funding-carbon-offsets?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;In September 2015, a curator from Yale&#39;s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library traveled to Amsterdam to collect the previous 12 years&#39; worth of interest on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.yale.edu/2015/09/22/living-artifact-dutch-golden-age-yale-s-367-year-old-water-bond-still-pays-interest&quot;>;a bond issued on May 15, 1648&lt;/a>;. At the bond&#39;s issuance, the borrower, an autonomous Dutch water authority, had promised to pay the holder interest &lt;em>;in perpetuity&lt;/em>;. Cash from sale of the bond had been used to pay for an infrastructure project that protected against rising sea levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Such perpetual bonds may prove useful in today&#39;s fight against climate change by enabling the funding of projects that will remove and store carbon indefinitely. Carbon removals can be used to offset carbon-emissions liabilities (or &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/accounting-for-climate-change&quot;>;E-liabilities&lt;/a>;), thereby helping businesses and other organizations achieve net-zero goals. Perpetual bonds can also support the development of efficient &lt;em>;spot markets&lt;/em>; in removal offsets, spurring both their production and their use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Perpetual bonds help resolve a key mismatch between the duration of many carbon offsets and the duration of the E-liabilities they are to be netted against. As we note in our July-August HBR print article, “&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/accounting-for-carbon-offsets&quot;>;Accounting for Carbon Offsets&lt;/a>;,”&amp;nbsp;E-liabilities from greenhouse gas emissions pose a particular challenge to financial markets since emissions produced today are expected to linger in the atmosphere for more than 1,000 years, a duration far longer than typical financial liabilities. Given that, we establish the need for offsetable carbon-emission assets (E-assets) to also have &lt;em>;indefinite &lt;/em>;duration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Certain E-assets such as carbon capture and storage via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/making-minerals-how-growing-rocks-can-help-reduce-carbon-emissions&quot;>;subterranean mineralization&lt;/a>; explicitly meet this criterion, but such E-assets are currently uncommon. Far more widespread today are nature-based offsets (NBOs) such as virgin forestation programs, which typically have shorter durations stemming from the &lt;em>;finite&lt;/em>; (unreplenished) lifetime of forests (potentially less than 100 years). At issue, then, is whether NBOs can be used to net E-liabilities: if they cannot, then most removal offsets being supplied today are only down-payments against long-term emissions liabilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For NBOs to have indefinite duration, the issuer must commit to managing the underlying (forest) asset in perpetuity — that is, replanting the forest as its constituent trees naturally decay or are destroyed by disease, fire, etc. To finance this operation, the offset provider needs capital not only to buy the land and plant trees but also to provide for predictable outlays in perpetuity. In other words, they must invest part of any capital raised in an endowment fund, the returns on which can go towards financing the management of the forest so that the carbon remains sequestered indefinitely (defined as, say, 1,000 years, a reasonable scientific estimate of how long carbon emitted today will stay in the atmosphere).&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Moreover, given the indefinite commitment, an issuer wanting to qualify some fraction of its presently delivered (or “earned”) removal offsets as being immediately and fully nettable against the purchaser&#39;s E-liabilities will have to set aside a separate (significantly larger) fraction of its available earned offsets against future commitments to sequester carbon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;All this implies that providers of capital to producers of NBO offsets can expect relatively low returns on their investments, albeit distributed in perpetuity. Individual offset buyers (usually for-profit businesses) will not find it attractive to tie up their own capital in this way. But such an investment might well be attractive to institutions that require endowments to cover predictable liabilities far into the future, such as universities and churches. The investment would take the form of a perpetual bond — such as that issued by the Dutch water authority — or of preferred equity with a fixed dividend. Ordinary equity is likely not suitable to finance indefinite-duration removal offsets since investors usually want a guaranteed return for tying up capital in perpetuity with limited upside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Consider, as a hypothetical example of how a perpetual bond approach can work, an indigenous tribe in Canada that wants to sell nettable E-assets from a virgin forest that it will plant on its land and manage indefinitely. To do so, it must raise capital to develop and maintain the forest. The tribe can issue a perpetual bond and place some of the capital in an everlasting financial endowment. The tribe uses the interest from the endowment to pay for the costs of managing the forest. As offsets from the forest become “earned” — that is, trees mature and sequester carbon — the tribe can sell some portion of these E-assets to pay for expenses, including the interest on the perpetual bond.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Let&#39;s assume that 20 megatons of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; equivalent (MtCO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;e) of offsets from the forest&#39;s current trees is “captured” this year and will be so for the next 100 years, but the trees will then have to be replanted at least 10 more times to be nettable against a 1,000-year E-liability. To distribute the risks of this commitment, the tribe can sell 2 MtCO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;e of this year&#39;s offset as “earned” in perpetuity (ie, 20 Mt divided by 10).&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;If there are enough producers of NBO offsets and enough demand for them, the nettable offsets can be sold into a liquid market, which distributes the future risks of the forest across a range of offset purchasers and helps the tribe to meet its interest obligations. Next year&#39;s spot buyers may be different from this year&#39;s, and, indeed, spot buyers hundreds of years thence likely will be very different, but collectively, through contributing to the perpetual bond&#39;s interest costs, they share in the long time-series risks of NBOs. The scheme is profitable for the tribe as long as the proceeds from spot sales of nettable offsets and from endowment returns exceed the bond&#39;s interest expenses and the ongoing forest-management costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Very likely, no one 375 years ago expected the Dutch seawall-management bonds would make interest payments in the present day to a New England university library 3,500 miles away.

The author recommends taking six actions: 1) Connect global wildfires to local health; 2) Collect and assess air quality data, developing thresholds for workforce advisories; 3) Identify the key stakeholders in your corporate response team and activate your command center; 4) Identify when to take action for outdoor workers; 5) Identify how to support indoor office employees; and 6) Develop communication and education plans for your employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Wildfires. The word has struck fear into the hearts of small and midsize rural communities for generations. Now, thanks to smoke blanketing parts of North America, urban America and the corporations headquartered there are beginning to understand themselves as vulnerable, too. Last week, East Coast cities from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/07/us/canada-wildfires-air-quality-smoke&quot;>;New York&lt;/a>; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/air-quality-toronto-fires-smoke-1.6868010&quot;>;Toronto&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-wildfire-smoke-canada-updates-june-7/&quot;>;Montreal&lt;/a>; saw air quality rapidly decline to some of the worst in the world as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/smoke-air-quality-nyc-northeast-canadian-wildfires-6b5ffc01&quot;>;smoke from wildfires in Canada&lt;/a>; drifts south. This means the conversation in Corporate America has moved beyond indoor air circulation or filtration, to encompass outdoor air quality as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poor air quality impacts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ishn.com/articles/113569-how-poor-iaq-impacts-employee-safety-and-productivity&quot;>;employee health and productivity&lt;/a>;, from diminished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/office-air-quality-may-affect-employees-cognition-productivity/&quot;>;cognitive function&lt;/a>; and poor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w20648&quot;>;concentration&lt;/a>; to lowered &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/air-pollution-is-making-office-workers-less-productive&quot;>;productivity&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8b8c&quot;>;sentiment&lt;/a>;. It can also exacerbate health conditions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503605/&quot;>;asthma&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.926534/full&quot;>;anxiety&lt;/a>; and lead to increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org/mongolia/media/2926/file/UNICEF-Absenteeism-ENG-final.pdf&quot;>;absenteeism&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9554460/&quot;>;presenteeism&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/sites/internet/files/2021-04/HHW_2020.pdf&quot;>;leaves of absence&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wildfires and smoke have disrupted corporate travel, postponed company activities, and sent employees to their doctors for a host of related health issues, including difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, there&#39;s likely more to come in the future — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires&quot;>;climate change&lt;/a>; means increases in wildfire season length, frequency, and burned area.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a physician working for an international organization advising corporate leaders, we are seeing a rapid rise in employer inquiries related to employee health and the best practices around air quality concerns. HR teams are fielding complex questions from employees and leaders — and many don&#39;t feel prepared with the right information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is reminiscent of the height of Covid in March 2020, when leaders asked: Is this an issue we need to respond to? What do I need to know? What action do I need to take now? Here are six actions for employers to consider as they navigate this ongoing issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Connect global wildfires to local health.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Air pollution can harm anyone. But it is more dangerous for specific employee segments and their family members. This includes infants and young children, seniors over 65, pregnant women, anyone who exercises or works outdoors, and people with existing illness or chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, lung, or heart conditions. During heavy smoke conditions, all employees may be at risk regardless of their age or health. Impacts can be both physical and psychological, especially for employees experiencing the trauma of wildfire evacuation from their homes and workplaces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Smoke can travel thousands of miles from an initial fire zone, which means that wildfires in other parts of the world will impact your people in the local communities where your company operates. Smoke from wildfires includes a complex mixture of pollutants, like fine particulate matter. Invisible to the human eye, these particles get deep into our lungs and bloodstream, sometimes leading to serious health effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no evidence of a safe level of exposure for some pollutants, meaning that smoke can impact employees&#39; health even at very low levels. And as local smoke levels increase, the health risks to your workforce will generally increase as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Collect and assess air quality data.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Data can typically be found through an Air Quality Index (AQI), which is a system used to warn the public when air pollution reaches dangerous levels. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues year-round AQI forecasts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airnow.gov/&quot;>;maps&lt;/a>; showing how pollution levels change and move throughout the day, and other countries have similar resources. This “real-time” information can help employers to quantify current outdoor air quality that impacts both their employees and customers far before it hits front-page news.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recommend working with health care experts such as physicians or medical consultants to develop specific thresholds for workforce advisories that go along with these levels. Doing so will help you take steps to protect your employees from unhealthy levels of air pollution and enable them to proactively seek appropriate supports for their health and safety. Specific thresholds paired with health care guidance will also prepare managers to communicate with and guide their teams in line with corporate policy. Once your organization understands how to use air quality data and sets monitoring thresholds, it will help trigger your corporate response at the right time and place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Activate your command center.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Identify who needs to be brought together to respond when AQI thresholds are met, especially if there is an immediate physical health and safety threat to employees. Wildfire-related local evacuations &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/how-kaiser-permanente-prepares-for-disasters&quot;>;are particularly high stakes&lt;/a>;, especially when hundreds of thousands evacuate all at once as seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/southern-california-wildfires-blaze&quot;>;Southern California&lt;/a>;. Your corporate response team may include local business leaders in impacted areas, communications specialists, medical advisors, HR leaders and even risk practitioners given broader enterprise issues involved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your multi-disciplinary approach may look similar to governance models &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/leader/early/2020/04/07/leader-2020-000244.full.pdf&quot;>;developed during the Covid pandemic&lt;/a>; and will ensure timely information is continuously flowing to and from the right stakeholders, including executives and the board. It will also enable rapid, holistic decision-making and related corporate response. This may range from meeting occupational health and safety standards to regulatory compliance for different employee segments like indoor versus outdoor workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Focus on outdoor workers, and comply with regulation.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Depending on your industry, outdoor work exposure to wildfire smoke is regulated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/wffsmoke.html&quot;>;occupational health and safety&lt;/a>; standards and regulatory bodies like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;>;Occupational Safety and Health Administration&lt;/a>; (OSHA). Long work schedules and physical work demands may impact a worker&#39;s exposure risk and health response. Geography matters, as local regulations differ. For example, California&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dir.ca.gov/title8/5141_1.html&quot;>;emergency regulation&lt;/a>; applies to workplaces where AQI is greater than 151 or if employees are expected to be exposed to wildfire smoke.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers should know their local air quality regulations and take action to limit outdoor workers&#39; exposure, particularly when wildfire smoke is in or around the work environment. This may include relocating or rescheduling work tasks to smoke-free or less smoky areas or times of the day, reducing levels of physical activity when possible, providing workers with frequent breaks in places that are free from smoke, and offering special accommodations where required.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some situations, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as well-fitted N95 respirators, should be considered to limit workers&#39; exposure. When US employers require use of respiratory protection to limit exposure to smoke, this should occur as part of a comprehensive respiratory protection program as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;>;OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard&lt;/a>;. (When use is voluntary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppD&quot;>;other OSHA standards&lt;/a>; apply.)&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Support indoor office employees.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Air quality can be unexpectedly complex for indoor office workers. Corporate safety standards related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/staying-compliant-in-an-era-of-hybrid-and-remote-work-c0e0938e&quot;>;home office&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalguardian.com/global-digest/at-home-duty-of-care&quot;>;worker travel&lt;/a>; have been elevated in recent years. And while it is arguable whether an employer&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1741438/does-employers-duty-care-extend-commuting&quot;>;duty of care&lt;/a>; extends to the employee journey to and from work, the commute matters, especially if an employee needs to navigate significant outdoor air pollution to get to and from the office. Taking a holistic “employee experience journey” approach can help calibrate potential risks for employee segments in hard-hit local areas or where there are specific individual health risk factors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As many office buildings have advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and optimized Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) ratings, the air quality at the office may be superior to that of the average home during wildfire season. Employers may need to take additional actions to reduce exposure to and protect occupants from wildfire smoke. This may include installing air cleaners equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, ensuring that windows and other building openings are kept closed to reduce overall smoke exposure inside, operating HVAC systems in the re-circulate setting, or temporarily reducing the amount of outdoor air supplied to the building. If you currently lease office space, engage your landlord to ensure that they optimize protection of your indoor workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More broadly, consider security, medical, and mental-health coverage to keep your people safe in times of crisis. This includes extending fulsome protection to the entire workforce, whether they commute or work indoors or outside. Employees working from home in your local corporate backyard might need that same 24/7 evacuation coverage you previously only considered for international travelers. This coverage applies equally to wildfires as it does to other natural disasters, like flooding or hurricanes, when companies often provide assistance such as food and water, shelter, or emergency evacuation. At many companies, this extra layer of coverage requires a mentality shift, but it is one worth making today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. Communicate and educate broadly.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Depending on the scope and scale of a wildfire and its impact on your organization, consider what should be communicated proactively (eg, that your organization is aware of and actively responding to worsening local air quality) and reactively (eg, messaging from HR in relation to very specific individual circumstances requiring accommodations).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Education is an important part of any communication plan related to wildfires and air quality, so alert your employees to symptoms of wildfire smoke exposure. Milder and more common symptoms include headaches, mild cough, sore and watery eyes, and nose, throat, and sinus irritation. More serious but less common symptoms include dizziness, chest pains, severe cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and even irregular heartbeat. Encourage employees to seek care from a health care provider and consider urgent medical attention if warranted for severe cases such as risks for asthma attacks, stroke, or heart attack.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of severe wildfire events, communication may include addressing immediate physical health and safety threats and extend to longer-term practices around air quality and respiratory health. Providing individual employee guidance on what to do to safeguard their health when air quality level is at different thresholds can help. For example, at higher levels, employees can be guided to avoid prolonged vigorous activity outdoors and stay away from high-traffic areas. It may also mean postponing or cancelling certain corporate and team-building events, or moving outdoor gatherings indoors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/how-prepare-wildfire-smoke.html#:~:text=Checklist%20for%20wildfire%20smoke%20season%20preparedness,-Are%20you%20or&amp;amp;text=Do%20you%20have%20an%20adequate%20supply%20of%20food%20and%20water,a%20break%20from%20the%20smoke%3F&quot;>;Preparedness checklists&lt;/a>; can help and may cover home, office, and personal medical preparedness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s wildfires and smoke can travel hundreds of miles, blurring the lines between what happens within and outside the workplace when it comes to workforce health. Now is the time to get ahead of this and other climate change-driven health issues.

We all struggle with feedback, so extend a little grace to yourself for having strong emotions, and to the other person for initiating a difficult conversation. The authors present the three most common ways people deliver feedback in a way that causes harm and elicits strong emotions, as well as five key steps to take when you get poorly delivered feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-your-boss-gives-you-bad-feedback-badly?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-your-boss-gives-you-bad-feedback-badly?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Hearing about what you&#39;re not doing well at work can feel bad. That doesn&#39;t make you “defensive” or “shut down to feedback.” It just means you&#39;re human and that you care about your performance — both good things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when you receive kind, clear feedback from a manager, peer, or employee, it can still be difficult to learn what you could be doing better. Say to yourself: “This is uncomfortable, and that&#39;s okay. My reaction will pass.” And then do something that allows you to sit with the discomfort for a while. Meditate, take a walk, or journal. Remind yourself that the person is giving you feedback because they care about helping you&lt;em>;. &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what happens when the person doesn&#39;t care about you, or when the feedback is poorly delivered? What if the person was rude, insensitive, or unclear? Now is not the time to criticize the criticism. But how can you navigate your own emotional responses to different types of feedback? The only way out of feeling bad about critical feedback is through.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mollie and Liz are experts in emotions at work and Kim is an expert in feedback at work. Kim&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://review.firstround.com/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss&quot;>;radical candor&lt;/a>; framework explains the three most common ways people deliver feedback in a way that causes harm and elicits strong emotions: obnoxious aggression, manipulative insincerity, and ruinous empathy. Together, we&#39;ve identified five key steps to take when you get poorly delivered feedback:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Name your emotion.&lt;/strong>; Figure out how you&#39;re feeling and don&#39;t judge yourself.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/strong>; Look for something helpful in the feedback even if it wasn&#39;t delivered well.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Reward the candor&lt;/strong>; — even if you disagree. Note that this doesn&#39;t mean pretending to agree. Sometimes the best reward for feedback you disagree with is a respectful explanation of why.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/strong>; Talk to the person about the impact of their delivery.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Fish or cut bait.&lt;/strong>; Figure out if you can continue to improve the relationship or if this is someone you need to avoid.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;As with most advice, this is much easier said than done. Here&#39;s how to apply these steps in the face of three common types of poorly delivered feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Obnoxiously Aggressive Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;What should you do when someone is yelling or using disparaging language? For example, a person once gave Kim some feedback by jabbing his finger in her face as he yelled, “You are the most aggressive woman I ever met!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of feedback usually makes us feel a mix of anger, fear, defensiveness, and anxiety. In addition to the steps below, if you feel that you&#39;re being bullied or verbally abused at work, it&#39;s important to escalate that to a trusted leader or HR rep if you feel safe doing so. If there&#39;s nobody you feel safe going to at work, it&#39;s a sign to start looking for a new job.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Give yourself a minute. If you find your emotions are overwhelming, try to create space for yourself or remove yourself from the situation entirely. You might say something like, “I&#39;d like to come back to this later” or “I&#39;m having a strong reaction to your feedback, and I need a moment.” Liz has learned to evaluate her emotions on a scale from 1 (okay) to 10 (enraged or panicking). She aims to wait until she&#39;s settled down to a 3 or 4 before taking action or even responding.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;re calm, think about what was said, not how it was said. Is there some information, no matter how terribly imparted, that can be useful to you or help you succeed? Some people will never tell you what they&#39;re thinking until they&#39;re so angry that they aren&#39;t able to communicate it well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It may be the case that you disagree with the content of the feedback as well as the way it was delivered. That&#39;s okay. But challenge yourself to find one thing the person said, or even one aspect of what they said, that you can agree with. There may be a whole bushel of chaff and only one grain of wheat. Find that grain, and use it to your advantage!&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you agree with any of the feedback, make changes and update the person on what you&#39;re doing differently. If you disagree with it, offer a respectful explanation of why.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Is there a way to relay how their words and actions impacted you? In some situations, it may be effective to share how an overly harsh delivery affects your ability to perform well on the job. In a workshop Liz and Mollie led, for example, a participant shared that her boss used to yell at her frequently. One day she finally said to him, “I know that you&#39;re upset right now, but when you yell at me, I&#39;m not able to focus on my work.” Her boss apologized and realized that he was inadvertently hurting her performance. His outbursts became much less frequent.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Of course, sometimes when you talk to the person about how what they said impacted you, you&#39;ll learn the person is trying to upset you. In those cases, telling them how they made you feel won&#39;t work. Why tell them they succeeded in upsetting you?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, limit how much you interact with the person. Once Kim told her boss he was being disrespectful; he replied he was offended that she didn&#39;t genuflect enough, or appreciate how superior he was to her. She quit. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/i-hate-my-boss/id1148704291?mt=2&quot;>;TV writer Elizabeth Craft advises&lt;/a>;, “If someone handed you a literal glass of poison, you would not drink it — so don&#39;t drink the verbal poison. If someone&#39;s coming at you negatively at work, just don&#39;t ingest.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Manipulatively Insincere Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When people are worried about their own reputation more than helping you improve, they may say things they don&#39;t really mean. Sometimes people say things to you that feel passive aggressive, or they praise you to your face but criticize you behind your back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all do this sometimes. Kim confesses that she had a direct report to whom she gave manipulatively insincere feedback. His work was riddled with careless mistakes. And he was popular and very sensitive. What if he started to cry when she pointed out the mistakes? Worried about her reputation as a leader rather than her direct report&#39;s performance, she&#39;d say something to him along the lines of, “Oh, Alex, this is a great start. You are so incredible. Maybe you can make this a little better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What can you do if someone is giving you praise that feels more like an ego salve than something real? How can you encourage them to say what they really think?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When confronted with this behavior, it&#39;s easy to feel confused. If you find out the person is saying nice things to your face and bad things behind your back, you may feel angry, betrayed, or mistrustful. Take a deep breath. Figure out how you&#39;re feeling.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Remember, you&#39;re trying to get feedback that will help you grow. Try asking the person making the comment to clarify what they meant. You might say, “Can you share a bit more about what you mean by that?” or “What would you recommend I do differently?” By asking for more detail, you help prevent miscommunication and give yourself an opportunity to address any underlying issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It might be that the person is simply conflict avoidant. You might make them feel more comfortable sharing if you say something like: “I feel like you have valuable feedback for me, but I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to communicate. Can you tell me what you&#39;re thinking more directly?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another tactic is to tell the person that you&#39;re working on improving something, and ask them to help you: “I&#39;ve been told I interrupt a lot. Can you help me by passing me this pen if you notice me interrupting someone during the meeting?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When a well-intentioned person has a hard time giving feedback, it&#39;s especially important to prove to them that not only is it safe to give you feedback, but that they&#39;ll be rewarded richly if they do. When their feedback results in your action, the risk they took has paid off. Saying thanks is never enough —&amp;nbsp;you need to fix the problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when a person praises you to your face and criticizes you behind your back, it&#39;s really hard to reward that kind of passive aggression because you&#39;re not supposed to know what they think. You could ask: “Is there something I could do differently so next time you can tell me what you really think? You told me you thought the presentation went well, but I heard you told others it was terrible. I promise not to bite your head off if you tell me when I&#39;m not hitting the mark. In fact, I&#39;ll be grateful because your feedback is exactly what I need in order to do better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Now that you&#39;re talking, you can ask the person if they can commit to talking to you directly rather than behind your back in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If the person apologizes and seems sincere, you can begin to rebuild trust. But if they respond in a way that erodes trust further, aim to regulate your emotions so that their behavior affects you less. Try an imaginary time-travel technique called temporal distancing. “Imagine it is a day, a week, or a year later,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://msande.stanford.edu/research-impact/stories-voices/faculty/faculty-spotlight-bob-sutton&quot;>;says Bob Sutton&lt;/a>;, author of books including &lt;em>;The No Asshole Rule&lt;/em>;. “And you are looking back on it, and it really didn&#39;t last that long or wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as it seemed at the time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Ruinously Empathetic Feedback&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sometimes you get the sense the person is so worried about hurting your feelings or offending you that they won&#39;t tell you what they really think. They care, but they&#39;re not challenging you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The part of Kim that was reluctant to tell her popular and sensitive employee Alex when his work wasn&#39;t good enough because of her concern for her reputation as a leader was manipulative insincerity; the “too nice” part of her that was reluctant to tell Alex what he needed to know because she was afraid of hurting his feelings was ruinous empathy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Name your emotion.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When someone is overly nice about their feedback, you may feel unsure about their intentions, or frustrated that they&#39;re not telling you what you need to know to improve. You may wonder if they think you can&#39;t handle the feedback. Maybe that makes you angry. Maybe their ruinous empathy makes them seem weak to you, and maybe that makes you feel disgusted. Emotional responses to ruinous empathy vary widely.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You might say, “While I appreciate that you think I&#39;m doing a great job, I know that there is always room for improvement. When I repeatedly don&#39;t get any constructive feedback from you, it makes me feel like you&#39;re holding back. The only way I can improve is if you give me candid feedback.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You may then need to sit through the other person&#39;s discomfort. Many people who give overly nice feedback will try to wriggle out of saying anything critical. They might repeat, “No really, you&#39;re doing great.” Their discomfort might make you feel that you should let them off the hook.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Push back against this instinct and stick with the conversation until you get a genuine response. One technique Kim recommends is to count to six before saying anything else. This forces the other person to endure the silence. After six seconds, if they still can&#39;t come up with anything else in the moment, suggest finding a time to meet again.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Reward the candor.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This is really important if you ever want to get more feedback from the person. Be effusive in your thanks. If you agree with the feedback, fix the issue, and then ask if you over or under-corrected. If you disagree, first look for something they said that you can agree with. Then, respectfully explain why you disagree with the rest. If possible, agree to do it their way — even if you disagree. Maybe they&#39;re right and you&#39;re wrong. Even so, explaining your reasoning and still deferring to them is a sign of respect.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Offer feedback on feedback.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Having demonstrated how helpful their feedback was, tell them you&#39;ll be asking for more. Let them know that while you appreciate their concern for your feelings, when they fail to tell you things that would help you do better work, it hurts your ability to succeed, and it doesn&#39;t improve your relationship. Reassure them that you really do want them to be candid with you, and that you not only can take it, but will appreciate it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Fish or cut bait.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Encouraging others to give you feedback often demands patience and takes work. But not everyone will offer it to you. If you&#39;ve taken all the steps suggested above, and the person still will not share any direct feedback, look to others for candor. If your boss seems constitutionally unable to give real performance feedback and their boss is not holding them accountable, start looking for a new boss.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s difficult to manage your feelings when getting feedback that feels too harsh, overly nice, or somehow dishonest. We all struggle with feedback, so extend a little grace to yourself for having strong emotions, and to the other person for initiating a difficult conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Large Language Models Reflect Human Judgment]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_10_1448510799.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Olena Koliesnik/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Artificial intelligence is based around prediction. But decision making requires both prediction and judgment. That leaves a role for humans, in providing the judgment about which types of outcomes are better and worse. But large language models represent a key advance: OpenAI has found a way to teach its AI human judgment by using a simple form of human feedback, through chat. That opens the door to a new way for humans to work with AI, essentially talking to them about which outcomes are better or worse for any given type of decision.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-large-language-models-reflect-human-judgment?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Artificial intelligences are prediction machines. They can tell you the probability it will rain today, but they cannot tell you whether or not you should pack an umbrella. That&#39;s because the umbrella decision requires more than just prediction — if the probability of rain is 10%, some people will choose to carry an umbrella, but others won&#39;t. Why will different people behave differently even though they are faced with the same information? Because they have different preferences. In this case, some people care much more than others about getting wet. Only you or someone who knows you well can judge the costs and benefits of carrying an umbrella. Making that decision for you requires both a prediction and a judgment based on your preferences.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;AIs excel at prediction but they do not possess judgment. To be sure, there are many decisions where we know the rewards or can work them out easily. Fundamentally, we know what a driver should do in most situations — accelerate, brake, turn — because we know the consequences of not doing the right thing. But ask Google to give you advice on a new dishwasher, and the best it can do is predict which pages are likely to provide the information you are looking for. It isn&#39;t feeling lucky enough to tell you what to do. Likewise, while you might be worried that your employer will use an AI to determine if you should be fired, the machine isn&#39;t ultimately responsible. AI might provide a prediction about your performance, but it is your employer who applies judgment and decides whom to fire.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;It was for this reason that, in our 2018 book &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Prediction-Machines-Economics-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1633695670&quot;>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Prediction Machines&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, we saw a role for reward function engineers whose job it would be to “determine the rewards to various actions, given the predictions that AI makes.” AI prediction could improve so many decisions that the reward function engineers who understood those predictions and the decision at stake would provide a skilled complement as AI adoption continued apace. But innovation in reward function engineering has been slow. There has been little progress in developing tools to codify appropriate human judgment into machines before they are deployed at scale. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Until recently. Large language models (LLMs) are, for all their seeming intelligence, still just prediction machines. But they are transforming the way AI assists in decision-making because they are changing the way humans provide judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Ask ChatGPT to rewrite a paragraph more clearly for a certain audience, and it does not give you options or a lecture on grammar and rhetoric. It gives you a paragraph. It is impressive, but the real miracle here is that ChatGPT could write the paragraph &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;you wanted&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;. There are a ton of reward and risk issues that go into writing a paragraph. Will the writing be honest (consistent with the facts), harmless (not including words that might offend), and helpful (accomplishing the goal of the paragraph)? Just think about that last one. These models are trained on existing writing by people. The paragraph produced is, at its core, written using a type of “autocomplete” over and over again. When we have our phones autocomplete, they do a good but not perfect job. So how is it that ChatGPT is able to produce written outcomes that are so much better than what the average person can do? How was ChatGPT able to judge quality from all of the content, good and bad, it was trained on? More generally, why didn&#39;t it develop into the toxic cesspool that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;>;Microsoft&#39;s Tay chatbot turned into after a day on Twitter&lt;/a>;?&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Some people, such as &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;Stephen Wolfram&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, believe that LLMs are uncovering some fundamental rules of grammar. Yes, that can make the writing readable, but it surely can&#39;t make it clear and compelling.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;A &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;2022 paper from OpenAI researchers&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; provides an important clue. That paper describes how raw, unmodified LLMs were taken and used to offer up outputs to real people. For the most part, the people were asked to &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;use their judgment to rank several alternative outcomes&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; to the same prompt. The ranking criteria were carefully specified (ie, prioritize helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness). It turns out that with clear instructions and some person-to-person training, different people could quite readily agree on those things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Those rankings were then used to tweak or “fine tune” the algorithm. The model learned human judgment and adjusted based on positive and negative reinforcement. Writings that ranked highly received a positive bump. Those that did not got a negative hit. Interestingly, even for a model trained on billions of pages, with just a few thousand examples of human judgment in the form of ranked responses, the AI began producing outcomes for all queries that were highly ranked. This occurred even for queries that seemed far from the ones the evaluators had ranked. Somehow, human judgment on writing quality spread quite far throughout the model.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;The evaluators were effectively reward function engineers. But unlike with a statistical model, the output of which can be offputting for many people, LLMs interact in plain language — anyone can help teach the model judgment. In other words, anyone who can speak or type can be a reward function engineer. The amazing discovery behind ChatGPT was that with comparatively little effort, reward function engineers were able to train LLMs to be useful and safe. This is how OpenAI was able to launch a consumer-facing model that did not suffer from the flaws of its predecessors when released into the wild. This simple method of codifying human judgment into machines supercharged AI performance. The machine was now imbued with the ability to not only predict word sequences that were likely, but also to apply the reward function engineers&#39; judgment to those sequences to increase their appeal to readers. The discovery of an easy method for machines to apply human judgment — the complement to any AI prediction machine in specifying the risks and rewards in a wide variety of circumstances — made all the difference.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;For many decisions, specialized reward function engineers will be needed to deploy AI prediction machines at scale. The discovery of this intuitive approach for codifying human judgment into machine — fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback — may unlock many valuable applications of AI where human judgment is difficult to codify in advance but easy to implement when you see it.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:276}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI Will Accelerate the Circular Economy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_12_1295939564.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Almost Green Studio/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Despite living on a planet with finite resources, our economy remains largely linear and full of single-use products. The shift toward a circular economy, where companies recover or recycle resources, has hit roadblocks, including low value of used products and high recycling costs. Harvard&amp;#8217;s D^3 Institute recently highlighted how digital tools and AI can help overcome these hurdles. They discussed three key strategies: extending the life of products, using fewer materials in production, and using more recycled materials. These tech-enabled strategies promise significant financial returns, but unlocking their full potential will need serious investment. Simply put, it&amp;#8217;s high time businesses recognized the potential of turning waste into wealth.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-ai-will-accelerate-the-circular-economy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The global economy still functions in a linear manner and is characterized by the extraction, production, consumption, and disposal of materials. This is a problem given that we live on a planet with finite resources. Yet the shift to a circular economy, in which businesses recover or recycle resources used in their value chain, has remained elusive, despite offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.summaequity.com/assets/Reports/PDF/230417-Investing-in-a-circular-and-waste-free-Europe.pdf&quot;>;trillions of dollars in value creation&lt;/a>;. Barriers include the low residual value of used products, an inability to collect materials, prohibitive costs of separating and processing materials, and lack of traceability of products and materials that are being recycled.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To accelerate the pace of innovation and learning, the Digital, Data, and Design (D^3) Institute at Harvard Business School recently hosted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://environment.harvard.edu/event/d3-catalyst-circular-economy-conference&quot;>;event focused on the circular economy&lt;/a>;, where entrepreneurs and business leaders shared how they&#39;re using digital tools and artificial intelligence to remove those barriers and create entirely new markets and business models. Specifically, the conference helped identify three main ways to achieve a more circular economy: increasing product utilization, material efficiency, and use of recycled materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Product Utilization&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Product utilization seeks to extend the useful life of a product, such as through sharing economy platforms, product refurbishment programs, or enhancing product duration. One new way companies are extending the life of the product is through over-the-air software updates that increase the residual value of a product. Take the example of the iPhone. Today, the iPhone constitutes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-used-smartphone-market-is-booming-surprisingly-thats-good-news-for-apple/&quot;>;80% of the market&lt;/a>; among 300 million or so phones in the secondhand market. A primary reason for this success, Marcelo Claure, former CEO of Sprint and Softbank International, explained at the event, is the forward compatibility of the iOS operating system, which ensures a user can access the app ecosystem and all the new features that Apple releases, maintaining iPhones&#39; appeal as a high-quality product in the secondhand market. Over-the-air updates of software is becoming the norm for more products — even cars. As a result, we expect an increase in the residual value of used products and an increase in product utilization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contrary to the belief that prolonging product lifespan might hinder sales growth and therefore firms should implement a planned obsolescence strategy, leading firms perceive enhanced product utilization as a mechanism for reaching new consumers, enhancing customer satisfaction, and building business models that monetize their efforts to create more durable products through services. Apple now has &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/apple-says-it-now-has-935-million-paid-subscriptions/&quot;>;935 million subscribers&lt;/a>; in its services segment, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16157374&quot;>;has grown&lt;/a>; to almost $80 billion in revenues and runs at close to double the gross margin compared to the hardware business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another opportunity to extend the useful life of products is through the product-as-a-service model, where companies retain ownership of a product while consumers pay for its use. Advancements in data and tracing technology has enabled better information flow to facilitate this business model. For example, SuperCircle developed a digital infrastructure that enabled circularity in the fashion industry by integrating customer purchase data with warehouse and distribution systems to trace the lifecycle of clothing. Entrepreneur Chloe Songer, cofounder of SuperCircle, explained how they partner with apparel brands like Reformation to create a customer experience that allows for goods to be returned for a credit or discount, while also facilitating the logistics infrastructure for aggregating and selling these clothes to the recycling sector. Identifying the consumer as a temporary owner of a long-lived asset opens up a world of opportunities to continue engaging customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Material Efficiency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Material efficiency, which refers to making products with fewer materials, is not a novel concept for many firms that have long pursued a lean operating model, characterized by minimizing waste in production processes. However, with recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and innovative technology, material efficiency is witnessing the emergence of even more opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, our conference heard how entrepreneur Shelly Xu&#39;s SXD Zero Waste applies artificial intelligence to redesign garment mockups that generate less pre-consumer waste from offcuts during apparel production. The result is the creation of sweaters, dresses, or pants with close to zero waste in fabric and about 55% lower cost, as opposed to 10–30% waste in traditional designs. Successful entrepreneurial solutions will be those that invest time in educating B2B customers about the potential for cost savings and the need to revise legacy processes that traditionally result in more waste, such as fashion design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “tough-tech” segment, using breakthrough science, engineering, and technology, also has the potential to create solutions that both reduce the material impact of existing supply chains and create “drop-in” solutions that can be incorporated into existing supply chains. An example of an entrepreneur in this space is Luciano Bueno, who founded GALY, a firm that grows cotton from cells in a lab using 80% fewer resources compared to traditional agriculture. An important part of the innovation journey in tough tech involves educating investors on the longer innovation cycles and the need for iteration on the path to scalability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Recycled Materials&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most well-known element of a circular business model involves minimizing the use of virgin materials as a percentage of a product&#39;s total materials. For instance, Apple&#39;s products now incorporate 20% recycled materials. Beyond reducing carbon emissions, the use of more recycled materials helps companies increase “materials security,” which is particularly concerning for industries reliant on rare minerals such as lithium and cobalt. Increasing recycled materials is also a key solution for reducing carbon intensity in hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel. However, Joy Chen and Per Anders Enkvist from McKinsey highlighted that the availability of recycled materials is currently limited, and sometimes more expensive than virgin materials. Technological enhancements to increase the availability of high-quality recycled materials and reduce costs therefore are huge opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In particular, scaling up material recovery and separation is key to making recycled material more available and affordable. Bjørn Arve Ofstad, CEO of Norsk Gjenvinning, the largest waste management company in the Nordics, explained that this sector needs an upstream feedstock, technology to sort and process the waste to be used downstream, and a downstream taker. This process needs to be done at an industry scale where materials are accessed at the right time, price, and quality. Robotics can facilitate this sorting process at lower cost. For example, Apple developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-terminator-apples-daisy-teardown-robot-can-rip-your-phone-apart-in-18-secs/&quot;>;Daisy&lt;/a>;, a state-of-the-art robot that can breakdown an iPhone into reusable components in 18 seconds, including rare minerals such as cobalt, gold, and platinum.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opaque supply chains represent significant barriers to understanding the breakdown of materials at end-of-life for recovery and sorting. Maria McClay, from Google, explained how in 2019 Google piloted a solution to use machine learning and analytics to provide a more comprehensive view of impact along the textile value chain, and in 2021 was able to expand the offering to other brands. Another solution described by Hari Nair from Procter &amp;amp; Gamble is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pg.co.uk/blogs/HolyGrail/&quot;>;HolyGrail project&lt;/a>; that uses digital watermarks in products to make the sorting of recyclables easier at the end of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Investing in the Trillion-Dollar Opportunity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To support the adoption and scaling of these digitalization-enabled solutions, we need investment to fund the trillion-dollar opportunity. Yet asset allocators in circularity face a “pattern recognition” challenge, where the capability to identify promising opportunities is still evolving. Venture capital funds have been hesitant to invest in early-stage companies with significant capital expenditure needs, which is often the case in circular solutions. On the other hand, private equity funds have been reluctant to invest in early-stage startups. One solution, described by Andrew Merino of Generate Capital, is the emergence of multi-sector, sustainability-focused funds that bridge the gap between traditional venture capital and private equity. To tap the full investment potential of a circular economy, investors need to develop in-depth sectoral expertise and innovation in investment structures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Video Quick Take &ndash; Google&rsquo;s Gautam Ramdurai on Emerging Consumer Behavior - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM GOOGLE]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/06/video-quick-take-googles-gautam-ramdurai-on-emerging-consumer-behavior]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;p>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6328969026112&amp;quot;}&quot; js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Todd Pruzan, Senior Editor for Research and Special Projects at Harvard Business Review, recently interviewed Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager, Ads Marketing, Google Asia Pacific, for a new episode of HBR Video Quick Take. Since every business today needs to navigate a complex matrix of factors that drive sustainable and profitable growth while keeping in mind that the core of doing so is still about understanding customers and how they make decisions, Pruzan spoke with Ramdurai about new insights into emerging consumer behavior across the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;So much about consumer behavior seems to be in continual motion. What kinds of changes are you seeing in consumer behavior across Asia-Pacific right now?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;The things that we&#39;re finding right now are fascinating. And what&#39;s particularly important to notice is what is truly different about 2023 versus, say, 2020 and even 2022. We know the pandemic fundamentally shifted so many things, but I think as we&#39;ve come out of the pandemic, other crises are stepping in: political turmoil, climate change, and the cost-of-living crisis. When all these kinds of public crises come together, we need to start thinking about the total effect they have. And the answer is this: We are entering a truly hybrid world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about how everyone went online during the pandemic. But then, as we&#39;ve come out of the pandemic, when you&#39;ve thought about your grocery shopping, how have you decided which items to buy in store versus which items to buy online? There&#39;s this complex calculus that goes on in everyone&#39;s head for even the simplest of decisions just because of the number of factors in the decision itself and the number of channels you&#39;re getting information from. For example, think about the number of devices you interact with, and then multiply that by the number of channels you use, from Google Search to YouTube to any other video platform to newspapers. You navigate in and out of the online and offline worlds. And even within the online world, there&#39;s so much multiplicity, and you try to find your way out of it. That is getting very tricky in 2023.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So across Asia-Pacific, our research tells us that the gap between wondering and knowing — which has always existed — has never been this wide. And that&#39;s what we refer to as the confidence gap.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;OK, so trust and confidence are big factors today more than ever, but how are consumers navigating this landscape? How are businesses navigating it?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start with consumers. Consumers are smart. They&#39;ve always been better at keeping up with the times than businesses will ever be. So what consumers have done is found their internal calculus fairly quickly. In other words, everyone has these decision factors that they go through and these information sources that they&#39;re going after to make their decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s take an example of someone wanting to do something: I have a three-year-old, so I have been thinking about when my three-year-old should be riding a bike. And that&#39;s a big moment, right? So when a consumer thinks, “Oh, I need to buy a bike for my daughter,” the first question is never “Where do I buy bikes?” Rather, it is “What is the right age for children to ride bikes?” It&#39;s a more foundational life question and a curiosity-driven question. You start with a question regarding the right time for a child to ride a bike, and then you slowly transition into researching what kinds of bikes there are. You end up getting sucked into videos of kids trying to learn how to ride a bike for the first time. You quickly realize you need to purchase a helmet as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This curiosity path expands the process during which consumers are finding the right information. And as consumers are navigating all this, we found that what they truly look for are six particular confidence cues. These cues are signals amid the noise; they are things that will tell them what they need to know to get closer to being confident in their decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So imagine you&#39;re in the confidence gap. You&#39;re stuck there and don&#39;t know where to go next. You&#39;re letting your curiosity guide you to the next questions. We found there are key pieces of information that bring everything together during this process. One of the confidence cues, for example, is reviews. Is this company that manufactures this particular bike well reviewed or not? Does this company have a reputation for being a company that makes safe bikes or a safe company overall?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are other things that matter too, such as social proof. And sustainability is becoming more important, so a company&#39;s having sustainability practices is becoming a bigger and bigger piece of purchase consideration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, we found an additional, implicit cue. This seventh cue is really about platforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today there is a plethora of digital information, and I know I am preaching to the choir here when I tell you that the digital world is expanding. The number of information sources people have is more than they have ever had before, and with all that comes a lot of disinformation and misinformation.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In short, the platforms themselves are playing a much bigger role in 2023 than we have seen them do before. They become this seventh cue regarding how much trust you have in the platform itself where you are getting your information. It&#39;s like looking at two different news sites and deciding which one you trust more. That same logic is now moving on to the world of platforms: The platform where you look at all your information or find your information is actually as important as any of the other confidence cues that the brands or the businesses themselves might communicate to their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;So the platform has to be part of your daily life. It has to be safe. It has to be a platform that you trust, almost the way you would trust the word of one person over another based on what they&#39;ve told you in the past. The platform is key here?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Yes, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing across multiple platforms, especially Google and YouTube. With a site like Google, where in times of uncertainty people go to find out something, it&#39;s almost like a library of human intentions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So while there are six cues that the brands themselves can look at, it&#39;s not just about what you say in those six confidence cues. Rather, it&#39;s where you show up with those confidence cues that&#39;s equally important.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;So the medium really is the message or a big part of it?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Correct. I would say it is a big part of it, because the medium can never be the full message. You own your brand. You know the truth that it wants to speak to the world. But I think the complications right now — and this goes back to our research on what is unique about 2023 versus ever before — involve needing to think about the calculus that the consumers have to go through. Then we need to pair that with the calculus that the businesses have to go through. So if the consumer doesn&#39;t find the right information, at the right time, in the right place, and in the right medium, they&#39;re going to drop out of their purchase journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Wow, it sounds like that&#39;s a pretty fragile transaction there.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And everything is back on the table. Intuitively — and this is part of a discussion I was having with someone yesterday — you would think, “Oh, in times of uncertainty, we&#39;d go back to the things we know.” But what we&#39;re seeing is people are actually spending more time researching even if they have had brands that they&#39;ve used for a long time. So it&#39;s almost like the pandemic has heightened this need for trust and confidence to such an extent that people are moving their tried-and-trusted brands to the back of the table. What that means is you cannot take trust for granted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, going back to transactional trust, it&#39;s not built when the person has bought the product. It&#39;s built when the person is thinking of using a product; it&#39;s built when the consumer doesn&#39;t even know they have the need for the product. So if you go through the entire consumer journey, you need to be able to establish those confidence cues across the whole board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And it doesn&#39;t end when they&#39;ve bought your product. The more important part of the journey is when they&#39;re actually using your product or your service. That customer experience doesn&#39;t end at the buy button. It almost starts there in many ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;If trust is important to consumers, how does this start translating to business outcomes?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;In 2023, it has a pretty direct impact. If consumers are looking for information to build up their confidence about buying your product or your service, how you show up is super important. If you don&#39;t show up the right way, it has direct implications on your bottom line. For example, in both India and Southeast Asia, one in three consumers decided not to buy a brand they were considering already because they felt a little anxious. They were not assured of their choice.¹ So that&#39;s an abandoned cart right there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And we&#39;re seeing the positive side of trust show up in a big way as well. If you&#39;ve done the job of being with your customers/consumers throughout their buying journey and their overall purchase experience, and you&#39;ve built and fed into that trust account, highly trusted brands are seven times more likely to be purchased² — and it doesn&#39;t end at purchase. Consumers who are confident in their product choices before purchasing are almost 20% more likely to repurchase that brand.³&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus, the consumer journey is cyclical, so the trust and confidence you&#39;ve built with your consumers don&#39;t end when they hit “Buy.” It almost starts there. And if you want to continue building that virtuous loop of trust and confidence, you need to step up everywhere, even when they&#39;ve already bought your products. We&#39;re seeing this come through very clearly in the data. So for the confidence-seeking consumer in 2023, all brands are back on the table, and it&#39;s up to you as the seller to choose whether you want to be part of that transaction or journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;What can businesses do to keep up with what their customers need? And how do you see that changing over the next few years?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Once someone has gotten all the signals they need to make their choice, that&#39;s when we think they&#39;ve made a confidence shift: You&#39;ve helped them find the answer to that life question, and your product or service is a part of that. We think businesses that are smart and able to power this confidence shift are the ones that are going to thrive in this very messy future — and present, for that matter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when you start thinking about how your business can help them make the confidence shift, you need to know which cue to show, when to show it, and whom is it for, because all your consumers are probably not built the same, and all of them are not in the same part of the journey. These are all moving targets: the right cues, right consumers, right formats, right messages, right devices, and right points in the decision journey. The only way to start making sense of this — and these are all predictive decisions in a lot of ways — and to do it at scale, and for large companies, especially, in milliseconds, is by harnessing the power of data and AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, this brings us back to whether you want to be a transactional business or a business that builds trust and confidence over time. This is an investment that you need to make across the entire customer experience. The gold standard of campaigns used to be that you&#39;d have and meet just one KPI a quarter, but we&#39;re moving away from that. Now the gold standard is whether you can drive new customers who also have high lifetime value. Those used to be two different meetings in the marketing rooms, but now they&#39;re being mushed together. The way to unpack this complexity is with data and AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Gautam, thank you for your insights. Do you have any parting words today, especially about how you are going to find that bike for your daughter?&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;What a complex question! There are many life questions that exist when it comes to buying that bike. I need to keep the following in mind as I navigate that path: We know that life is a lot more complicated and complex than it has been before, and we don&#39;t know what the next set of uncertainties will be. We also know that they will come; there will be more uncertainty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the confidence gap that has always been there, consumers will still find themselves in it, and maybe it will widen. Maybe the confidence cues will evolve. But I think we have to keep our ear to the ground to understand our consumers&#39; decision making if we want to know which cues they need. Our job is to help them make that confidence shift, and that will only become more and more important as we move into the future. The world of complex decision making is here to stay, and the businesses that invest in their ability to make that confidence shift with the power of data and AI are probably the ones that are going to thrive in this environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Thank you so much for a great conversation and for all of your insights today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Gautam Ramdurai, Group Marketing Manager&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Thank you, Todd, for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;To learn more, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/marketing-strategies/automation/build-brand-confidence-ai-marketing/?utm_source=twg_partnership_external&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2023-APAC-GML-EVOS-HBR-VQT-HL&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;Think With Google&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Return to the “&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/multiply-your-marketing-with-ai&quot;>;Multiply Your Marketing With AI&lt;/a>;” Sponsor Content Hub from Google APAC on HBR.org&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;¹Source: Google/Kantar/Quantum, “Emotional Value of Search”, IN, ID, VN, MY, PH, TH, PK, 2021, n=5006 P18M category buyers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;² Source: Edelman, “Trust, The New Brand Equity”, 2022, n=14,000 consumers across 14 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;³ Source: Google/ Ipsos, Decoding Repurchase, AU, IN, ID, JP, KR, VN, 2023, n=1500 per market, Buyers of Home appliances, Personal care, Health and wellbeing products.&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
