&lt;span>;&lt;p>;网络对于正在进行工作和职业转型的高级管理人员至关重要，但很难找到如何最好地进行工作和职业转型的建议。管理流程。在这篇文章中，作者“他们拥有数十年在过渡时期与高管合作的经验——找出高管经常遇到的六个网络障碍，并提供如何克服这些障碍的指导。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot; /2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-challenges-of- networking-as-an-executive?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在线查看数千篇有关工作网络挑战的文章，您就会发现发现他们中的 100% 都针对相对初级的专业人士如何“向上”建立人际网络提出了建议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但令人惊讶的是，对于高级管理人员来说，提供的建议却很少，他们经历着不同但同样具有挑战性的人脉障碍。这是一个问题，因为了解如何获得网络的全部好处对于金字塔顶端的人来说至关重要，尤其是在首席执行官更替率很高的时候&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/04/27 /ceo-turnover-high-pandemic/&quot;>;创历史新高&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们拥有数十年与正在做出职业转变的高级管理人员合作和研究的经验。在本文中，我们将找出他们在职业网络方面经常遇到的六个常见障碍，并且我们将提供一些如何克服这些障碍的指导。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1)不愿意寻求帮助&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为下一个角色建立人际网络意味着寻求帮助。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597897927461&quot;>;社会心理学研究&lt;/a>;表明，地位高的人更容易感受到维护形象的压力力量和能力以及重视自力更生，所有这些都会使他们不愿意寻求帮助。他们害怕遭到拒绝，并担心寻求帮助可能会暴露自己的弱点，从而可能损害他们的地位、地位或声誉。这是自我驱动的不情愿，我们经常看到这种情况。正如赫米尼亚的一位学生所说，“我提供帮助 - 我不会要求帮助。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决这种趋势的一种自然方法是通过伸出援手来开始你的人际网络过程。低风险（和低收益）的联系人——理想情况下，是你熟悉的高管，他们自己建立了人际网络，不仅可以分享他们如何向他人寻求帮助，还可以分享他们从寻求帮助中得到的结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你可能可以与比你想象的更多的人一起做这件事：正如斯坦福大学社会心理学家赵宣所发现的那样，人们经常&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/ 10.1177/09567976221097615?journalCode=pssa&quot;>;低估&lt;/a>;其他人提供帮助的意愿，因为他们没有意识到其他人这样做会多么高兴。低风险的热身和排练——斯皮什称之为“听到可怕的话语从你嘴里说出来”——将帮助你调整你的信息，化解你的情绪，并体验成功。拥有一些积极的经历将使您以后处理更具挑战性的电话和电子邮件变得更加容易。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2) &amp;nbsp;优先考虑保密&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;高管的级别越高，他们就越有可能想要保密，尤其是在他们被解雇的情况下。例如，斯皮什的一位客户问道：“我如何进入市场而不让市场知道我在寻找？我想接触人们，但我不想让他们知道我有兴趣寻找。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种担忧限制了你与他人的接触，这本身就是一个问题正确的。但它们也会迫使你在从事人际网络和职业转变时保持秘密——根据赫米尼亚的研究，这个过程往往比人们预期的要长得多。长期背负的保密负担可能会造成重大的心理损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;限制与他人的接触可能会特别有害，因为它会阻止您退后一步并广泛探索您真正想要的东西接下来做。不管你怎样努力，你都不会通过混淆视听来愚弄人们。在高层，这是一个很小的世界：与你交谈的人可以通过致电他们自己网络中的消息来源，或者可能只是通过在线搜索来了解你在做什么。如果你确实成功地隐瞒了你的故事，那么你可能会感到紧张并花费大量精力才能得到与诚实、直接地说出相同的结果。除了极少数例外，诚实是最好的策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3) &amp;nbsp;不切实际的期望&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;因为他们不愿意寻求帮助并且不寻求帮助为了让消息传出他们正在市场上寻找新职位，高级管理人员通常希望快速完成他们的网络工作。或者他们只是认为因为自己资历较深，所以这个过程不会花费很长时间。不幸的是，你的职位越高，你可能需要更多的时间来寻找和调整合适的人选。根据 Spish 的经验，最短的搜索大约需要 3 个月，最长的可能需要 18 个月。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有效的网络不仅需要很长时间，而且涉及大量的工作。 、耐力、效率和耐心。造成这种情况的主要原因有三个。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，正如我们两人都发现的那样，只有一小部分正在寻找下一个职位的人确切地知道他们想为哪几家公司工作。因为他们对市场或他们真正想要的东西了解不够，无法进行有针对性的搜索，所以他们必须从研究和非常普遍的探索性网络开始。这一切都需要时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，你想要的和最适合的东西可能实际上并不适合你。我们都见过高素质和经验丰富的人花了非常长的时间才能找到他们的下一个角色。赫米尼亚最近观察到的一位高管认为，鉴于他过去的经验，他将是一家大公司董事会审计委员会的理想候选人，但随着选择标准转变为包括更大的多样性第三，当今大多数公司都有复杂、耗时且不可预测的审查流程，这通常会在招聘流程的最后阶段增加几个月的时间.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在高级管理人员就业市场上，认识到在混乱的供求关系中你几乎没有控制权是有帮助的。一个很好的主动策略可以帮助你在建立人际网络时弥补这一点，那就是在你的日历中安排一些刺激的、并行的活动（社区工作、无偿咨询、短期建议、兼职教学），在这些活动中你可以有更多的时间。立竿见影的效果，并得到更令人满意的回应。这弥补了寻求和等待帮助的乏味（如果不是负担的话）。它还为饱受打击的自我提供积极的（如果是临时的）身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4) 不想投入工作&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;习惯于拥有事物的高管为他们做的事情常常不愿花时间去做他们无法委托的繁琐工作。但要成功建立人际网络，您需要将这项任务视为完全值得您投入时间和精力的任务，而且您需要有条不紊、井井有条。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了帮助实现这一点，Spish 开发了一个人际网络流程，其中包括识别并联系三种联系人：信息提供者、开门者和决策者。信息提供者是指能够告诉您有关市场、公司和招聘趋势的人；他们可以帮助你变得聪明并克服对社交的恐惧。开门人通常是你过去共事过的人。他们反应敏捷，并且因为他们了解您和您的工作风格，所以他们愿意为您提供担保，并可以将您介绍给决策者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您想使用此流程，最好的开始方法是首先列出所有雇主、客户和顾客的清单，然后写下您在这些职位上遇到的人的名字。您可能会发现自己很容易就能想出 100 个名字。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论您使用什么方法来组织、定位和细分搜索，您始终需要先生成一长串您想要的人员名单。我与他们合作，然后有条不紊地遵循一个系统来联系他们。因为这是一个学习过程，所以你无法提前计划好一切；您最好采取“滚雪球”的方法，即询问每个联系人您还应该会见谁。如果您正在寻找您不熟悉的市场，则尤其如此。在这种情况下，您需要在斯皮什所说的“云下山谷”中建立人际网络。这些山谷里有很多机会，但它们不熟悉，需要探索。如果你不去探索它们，你的选择就会受到限制，并且可能会损害你的职业发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个高成本、高收益的游戏，但它会带来回报。 Spish 发现，一旦您联系了列表中的 50 个或更多联系人，网络就会开始联系您，此时您可以让该流程引导您继续前进。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong >;5) 过度关注“叙述”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一旦建立了联系，重要的问题就是要说什么。很多时候，高管们在社交对话中大部分时间都在闲聊共同的联系人或经历，直到对话结束才切入主题（他们需要一份新工作）。当他们觉得需要隐瞒正在发生的事情的现实时（例如，他们与老板相处不好，或者他们被解雇了），这种情况尤其常见。当这种情况发生时，他们通常已经处于守势，他们说话闪烁其词，他们把精力投入到保护自己的公众形象上，而不是尽其所能地学习。最终结果是他们浪费了自己以及他们的联系人的大量时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个没有成效的策略是花费 80% 的时间试图解释为什么你不高兴，或者离开，或者被解雇——这是一种消极的方式，让你的谈话停留在过去，而实际上谈话应该是积极的并着眼于未来。如果您花 20% 的分配时间来解释您的情况，然后将剩余的 80% 的时间集中在您正在寻找的内容上，效果会更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;网络对话的最佳做法是直接、简洁，并且积极。人们想知道你为什么打电话给他们以及你想从他们那里得到什么，他们的级别越高，他们就越有可能期待这样的简短执行摘要：“这就是为什么我打电话给他们你。这就是我想要你做的。我希望这两点足以让我们进行 10 分钟的对话。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6) &amp;nbsp;未能定制你的故事&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;寻求转型的高管经常花费大量时间来完善一个脚本——即传说中的关于他们的“核心技能和能力”的“电梯推销”。他们这样做是假设这个脚本将使他们具有普遍的相关性，但几乎总是他们最终得到的结果并不能令人满意地满足接收者的需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们已经看到很多高管尝试这样做他们以与猎头合作的方式建立人际网络：他们写一封通用电子邮件，只需更改名称和一两句话，附上简历，然后发送给一群人。同样，许多人走进会议并机械地陈述他们的一分钟演讲，即使这不符合听众的独特情况和要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是行不通的。是的，弄清楚你的核心故事情节（我是谁，我为什么在这里？）很重要。但你不能假设你会对遇到的每个人说同样的话。您也不能假设每个听众都能够将您的推介转化为他们自己的业务环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，您需要记住以下几点：这与您无关。如果你希望获得一个真正适合你的职位，你需要弄清楚如何从谈论自己转变为深入地谈论公司及其问题，然后阐明你有多么充分的能力去胜任这个职位。解决这些问题。正如斯皮什所发现的，这就是你为自己创造机会的方式：他指导过的最高级管理人员中有很大一部分最终都担任了在他们谈话之前甚至不存在的角色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: center;&quot;>;* * *&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当您是一名高级管理人员时，建立人际网络是一项微妙、复杂且耗时的任务。如果不加以控制，自负和急躁会破坏你的成功。最好的方法是将人际网络视为一个机会，不仅可以帮助您寻找下一个角色，还可以加强或加深您已有的关系，甚至更好的是，增加新的关系，帮助您在新的领域成为更好的专业人士。工作及其之后的其他工作。&lt;/p>;

>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;假期就是为了恢复活力。休假不仅可以帮助您&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-take-a-vacation-improves-your-well-being&quot;>;恢复思想、身体和灵魂&lt;/a>;，还可以对您的工作生活产生积极影响：一项研究发现，休假 11 天或以上的员工&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/the-data-driven-case-for-vacation&quot;>;更有可能获得加薪或奖金&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/02/when-a-vacation-reduces-stress-and-when-it-doesnt&quot;>;并非所有假期都如此正如我们所希望的那样，具有恢复力或活力。长期的工作压力会干扰我们的计划。一旦开始放松就生病的现象甚至有一个名字：&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.thriveglobal.com/the- Five-key-steps-to-take-to-avoid-leisure-疾病/&quot;>;休闲病&lt;/a>;&lt;u>;。&lt;/u>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;那么，当你回来工作时比离开时更疲惫时，你能做什么——尤其是当每个人都认为你很好的时候休息好了，迫不及待地想走了，但您感觉比以前更疲惫（或更疲惫）？您可以采取以下五个步骤在退货时刷新。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.盘点您的健康和精力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;除非您参加过恢复活力的健康静养，否则您可能已经偏离了健康的生活习惯，可能会跳过体育活动或发现自己的日程安排很满，而且有点沉迷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;返回后，评估并确认您的精力水平，盘点您的感受以确定您需要什么。研究发现，在以下领域优化您的能量有助于提高健康和绩效：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/insights/focus/behavioral-economics/sleep-benefits-impact -employee-performance.html&quot;>;睡眠&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/to-improve-your-work-performance-get-some-exercise&quot;>;运动&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201208/connect-thrive&quot;>;连接&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/why-you-should-tell -your-team-to-take-a-break-and-go-outside&quot;>;户外活动&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/to-cope-with-stress-try-learning-something -new&quot;>;放松&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbetechcouncil/2023/04/05/how-relational-energy-impacts-employee-engagement/?sh= 7a3861a047c2&quot;>;有意义&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/05/how-relational-energy-impacts-employee-engagement/?sh=7a3861a047c2&quot; >;敬业度&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先根据您当前在上述各个领域的精力水平，按照 1-10 的等级对自己进行评分。然后确定您希望在每个领域处于什么位置，以及您可以采取的一项行动来加强或改善您的健康的每个要素。一周内每天重新评估，跟踪当您重新养成更健康的习惯时您的能量如何变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.轻松恢复工作。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/what-to-do-on-your-first-day-back-from-vacation&quot;>;从当您在本应放松和享受休息时间的时候却因处理堆积如山的电子邮件和对话而感到不知所措或压力时，假期可能是一种具有挑战性的经历。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抵制在恢复正常之前，通过一天的过渡和恢复来一头投入工作的诱惑。您甚至可以考虑起草自动回复或 &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/ease-the-pain-of-returning-to-work-after-time-off#:~:text=Block%20off%20significant %20chunks%20of,something%20to%20look%20forward%20to.&amp;text=Stay%20in%20stealth%20mode。&quot;>;将 OOO 延长一两天&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在开始一整天的工作之前，为您的时间设置一些护栏，以便您有一个良好的开始。从重要且时间敏感的任务开始，给自己一个缓冲时间，以便赶上稍后可能出现的电子邮件和更新。在日历上留出时间来进行那些能让你充满活力的活动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.反思积极的一面；重新构建，并从消极中学习。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;事情可能不如你所希望的那样，你很容易感到不知所措或失望，但可能会有一些积极的记忆可以保留。花一些时间反思和品味这些经历，以及&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/the-mental-benefits-of-vacationing-somewhere-new&quot;>;获得的经验教训和见解&lt;/a>;。将它们记录在纸上，以便您可以与团队成员分享，并强化您休假期间的好处。如果这次旅行让您感觉一成不变，也许您可​​以在回家后恢复正常的事实中找到安慰。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4.使用全新开始效果来设定新的习惯和惯例&lt;/strong>;。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;全新开始效果是&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/research-explores-how-fresh-starts-affect- our-motivation-at-work&quot;>;与新的开始（例如生日、新年和其他里程碑）相关的行为改变越来越成功的现象&lt;/a>;。您可以通过利用重返工作岗位作为重置的机会来利用这种效应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;度假回来是建立新做法的好时机，以进一步增强您的精力和生产力，例如 &lt;a href= “/2023/05/to-improve-your-work-performance-get-some-exercise&quot;>;锻炼&lt;/a>;、关闭通知、阻止干扰或每晚写日记。寻找让你的日常生活充满活力的习惯和惯例。您可以利用&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive&quot;>;时间盒&lt;/a>;等做法来优化您的精力对你来说重要的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尝试过度补偿可能很诱人，但不要让悔恨驱动你的行为。而是考虑在您的日常生活中有效的惯例，以便您的习惯可以持续下去。确定您今天需要做什么才能&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/09/is-your-motivation-still-on-vacation&quot;>;回到正轨&lt;/a>;，排除悔恨，做您想做的事需要创造前进的动力。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5.明确您未来休假的需要。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;利用这次经历作为学习机会，为&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-take-a-vacation 奠定基础-改善您的健康&quot;>;未来的假期更加充实&lt;/a>;。确定有多少结构为您提供能量，而不是消耗您的能量。您想和谁共度时光以及您想旅行多远？您需要多少&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/set-these-5-boundaries-before-you-go-on-vacation&quot;>;与您的团队沟通&lt;/a>;才能满足您自己的福祉和联系需求？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使是一个美好的假期有时也会让人筋疲力尽。如果您返回时没有正确管理时间和精力，您的疲惫可能会对您的健康、工作、人际关系和表现产生累积影响。如果您没有从这个假期中获得所需的东西，请将其作为动力，确保您在日常生活中建立可持续的节能实践。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt; /div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;本文探讨了管理者在衡量策略绩效时容易陷入的三个陷阱，并解释了如何避免它们。第一个陷阱是战略框架和衡量系统不一致。要解决这个问题，您必须围绕关键利益相关者组织两者。第二个陷阱是，公司衡量的是他们所做的事情，而不是他们取得的成就。要解决这个问题，请关注利益相关者的成果。第三个陷阱是缺乏重点。要解决这个问题，请级联而不是合并您的指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;衡量企业绩效与其业务战略密切相关。或者应该如此。但令人惊讶的是，正如我在很长一段时间内亲眼目睹的那样，所有部门的组织都在努力将其战略设计与其绩效衡量相匹配。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这非常重要，因为几乎不可能跟踪一个项目的成功。如果没有可靠的关键绩效指标 (KPI)，则制定业务策略。相反，糟糕的绩效衡量可能会导致战略目标的误导。两者都可能导致重复执行相同的失败决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这里，我探讨了管理者在衡量策略绩效时陷入的三个常见陷阱，并解释了如何避免它们。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1.不匹配的框架&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;罗杰是州政府主要道路部门的首席执行官。当他被任命时，他根据“地区”建立了他喜欢的战略框架。这些都有自己的缩写——KRA，关键结果领域。因此，他在节能、治理和材料采购等项目下组织了主要道路战略计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题在于，它与主要道路现有的绩效衡量框架不符，该框架是围绕诸如道路安全、道路效率和道路维护等项目。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种脱节造成了巨大的功能障碍，需要花费大量的管理时间和精力来让事情顺利进行。正如一位高管讽刺地指出的那样，“这就像试图将福特汽车的部件装进梅赛德斯奔驰汽车一样。他们就是不适合。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;如何解决这个问题：围绕主要利益相关者进行组织。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Marjorie 领导着一个照顾自闭症患者的非营利实体。当她加入该组织担任首席执行官时，她面临着她所说的“我们的战略规划框架与 KPI 的组合方式之间的脱节。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该组织的战略计划是围绕“关​​键问题”构建的。例如预算超支、获得补助金和雇用员工。 KPI 是从人力资源、会计和财务等各种来源以及运营（包括运营费用和举办的员工培训课程数量）中提取的指标的大杂烩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她的解决方案是重新调整战略和运营的重点。围绕&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/ Five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;组织的主要利益相关者&lt;/a>;的关键绩效指标。这些利益相关者包括自闭症患者及其家人、政府、捐助者和支持者，以及&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，就利益相关者工作人员而言，马乔里的组织希望围绕他们为自闭症患者及其家人提供的服务加强创新。这需要通过提高组织在就业条件方面的地位来吸引一流的临床医生。成功的指标之一是合格心理学家的工作申请数量增加。 “最后，”她说，“我们组织的战略计划和记分卡可以相互交流。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2。衡量活动&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;以下是我在研讨会上向经理小组说明这个问题的方式。我对他们说：“我建议通过测量我使用的幻灯片数量来衡量我今天的表现。如果一天结束时我真的很累，我就会知道我做得很好。你对这些作为我表现的衡量标准感到满意吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的观众总是说不。 “为什么？”我问。 “因为它们衡量的是活动，而不是结果，”他们说。 “谁决定这些结果？”我询问。 “我们愿意”，这是普遍的回应。在那一刻，我的观众“明白了”。我可以从他们的脸上看到这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;如何解决这个问题：关注结果。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Angelo 领导着一个知名建筑工具品牌的国家办事处。当谈到衡量他的业务绩效时，他解释说：“我们会聚在一起，专注于我们所做的事情。我们制定的 KPI 始终与流程有关。”他们通过关注他的组织为其主要利益相关者（客户、供应商、员工和母公司）产生的结果来打破这种执着。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;衡量这种绩效涉及一条双向的道路，结果是双向的 -为了企业和利益相关者。安吉洛和他的团队避免对利益相关者的结果做出假设。相反，他们采访了主要利益相关者，以了解对他们重要的结果是否已被确定。采访还揭示了 Angelo 和他的团队从未想到的新 KPI。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3.缺乏重点&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;塞巴斯蒂安是郊区议会的首席执行官。他希望制定一个与理事会战略计划相关的理事会绩效记分卡。于是，他收集了社区发展、环境与规划、企业服务等下属部门的措施，并制作了一份综合清单。这份清单很长，让他不满意。许多措施似乎与委员会的目标根本无关。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;如何解决这个问题：级联而不是合并你的指标。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Helen 是一个新上任的校长。大型、有声望且非常昂贵的私立女子学校。为了为学校制定记分卡，她收集了科学、英语和数学等学术部门的衡量标准。但是，与塞巴斯蒂安一样，这套综合 KPI 并不能衡量学校的绩效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她通过重新开始解决了这个问题。这一次，她没有从下到上合并衡量指标，而是以相反的顺序（从上到下）制定了 KPI。她说，这个过程“让我用一块石头杀死了两只鸟。它揭示了为学校设定的 KPI 中的差距，并提供了学校围绕学生、家长、教师和工作人员、政府和社区的战略计划之间的契合度……[它还]根据这些结果提供了有效的记分卡同一组。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海伦学到了绩效衡量的一个基本概念——分析水平。适用于某一级别（例如公司级别的利润）的衡量标准不适用于另一级别（例如人力资源等内部部门）。同样，适用于部门级别的措施并不适合公司级别。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;如果您没有在战略计划和 KPI 之间一致地应用框架，那么您的战略计划和 KPI 之间很容易出现差距 - 如果您遇到这种情况，那么您肯定不是唯一的人。然而，当您缩小差距时，请记住，衡量绩效从根本上讲是衡量您与&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/ Five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;组织的主要利益相关者的关系。&lt; /a>;&amp;nbsp;因此，您的 KPI 需要根据利益相关者对您的期望来确定，而不是根据您认为应该做什么来确定。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot;

Brooks 是畅销书作家、哈佛大学教授， and a widely read columnist for &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;, whose writing draws from both science and philosophy and is aimed at providing insight and strategies on how we can live our best lives. He&amp;#8217;s the co-author (with Oprah Winfrey) of the forthcoming book, &lt;em>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/em>;, and he joined HBR editor Adi Ignatius for this episode of New World of Work to share insights in how to be happier at work, and in life. Happiness, it turns out, is contagious. But so is misery.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/harvards-arthur-c-brooks-on-the-secrets-to-happiness-at-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/harvards-arthur-c-brooks-on-the-secrets-to-happiness-at-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;To the strivers and workaholics out there, bestselling author and Harvard professor Arthur C. Brooks has a message for you: change your behavior before it&#39;s too late. Brooks was one of you: a pace-setting boss who expected others to work 80-hour weeks just like him, leaving little time for friends and family. He says he was addicted not to work, but to success. And he missed watching his kids grow up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today he classifies behavior like his as a pathology that can lead to misery. And he has concrete, actionable advice for increasing your life&#39;s happiness. In fact, he writes about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;in a regular column&lt;/a>; for &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Brooks, co-author (with Oprah Winfrey) of the forthcoming book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot;>;&lt;em>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s caused the severe dip in general happiness in the last few years?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The two traits of those who find true happiness in their work&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The difference between “deal friends” and “real friends”. The real kind are “beautifully useless” and you need them more than deal friends&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is contagious, Brooks says, and just being in a happy person&#39;s vicinity can make you happier.&amp;nbsp; “But,” he says, “even more contagious is misery.”&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Arthur, welcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New World of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Previous episodes&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New World of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Previous episodes &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C.

BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And the truth is that the book is based on a lot of the things I&#39;ve been teaching at the Harvard Business School, a class I teach called “Leadership and Happiness”, which is a very oversubscribed class. It has 180 in the seats, 400 on the waiting list, and there&#39;s even a secret Zoom link they think I don&#39;t know about. I&#39;m happy to talk about what I talk about with my students, with our wonderful viewers here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope a few of the students were just horrified to hear that you know about the Zoom link. But let&#39;s set some context. Start with some data. The numbers show that despite a thriving happiness industry, people like you who think about it think we&#39;re becoming less and less happy.&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot; name=&quot;The New World of Work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;follow-subscribe data-name=&quot;hbpnewworldofwork&quot; data-activity=&quot;newsletter&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div style=&quot;color: #000000&quot;>; &lt;svg>; &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;/resources/css/images/hbr-icons.svg#the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;&lt;/use>; &lt;/svg>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Subscribe to our Weekly Newsletter &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; The New World of Work &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; Candid conversations on talent, tech, and the future of business.

BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s true.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the US at least, the number of cases of depression are up, the number of people who self-report themselves to be happy is down. I know it&#39;s impossible to say exactly why, but what&#39;s your hunch? What&#39;s going on here?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We do have a pretty good idea of what&#39;s going on. You find that happiness started to go into a little bit of a malaise, a bit of a decline, in the late &#39;80s, early &#39;90s, but then it took a real big dip when social media came along.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media was catastrophic for happiness. Part of the reason is we distract ourselves when we&#39;re lonely with something that&#39;s the equivalent of burgers and fries for a social life. They give you lots of calories and not very much nutrition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a lot of neuroscience behind this, but everybody knows that when you&#39;re bored or you&#39;re lonely and you start looking at your devices and at your phone, you actually get more bored and you get more lonely. This is a huge problem, especially for young adults.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the coronavirus came along, and this was the most catastrophic event for public happiness that we&#39;ve seen in a long time worldwide. Ordinarily, about 30% of people would say they&#39;re very happy about their lives, and 15% would say they&#39;re not happy. The rest are in the middle. Those are flipped. Now it&#39;s about 30% who are not happy and 15% who are very happy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those trends have not actually turned around. We know that it has everything to do with social life. It has everything to do with our love relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We know the habits that bring the happiest life—your philosophical or your faith life, your family life, your real friendships, and work that serves others in person—these have been in decline. When those things go in decline, there&#39;s no tech that&#39;s going to solve the problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You do have your finger on it. I want to focus on the world of work. I think this is drawing from stats in the book, I think you say just 16% of employees self-report that they&#39;re very satisfied with their work. I want to ask about that because we&#39;re spending half our waking hours in the office, and yet we&#39;re not getting the kind of fulfillment and satisfaction that we deserve. So what&#39;s happening here and how can we think about moving the needle?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been studying what brings work satisfaction for the longest time, and when I first started off, I was a fresh PhD. I thought, well, let&#39;s see if for-profit versus nonprofit versus government work: which brings the most happiness? Turns out, that&#39;s insignificant. So I said, well, high salaries versus low salaries. Above a certain level of subsistence, it&#39;s a wash. College educated, not college educated, white collar, blue collar, none of it matters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two things show up on the happiest workers, the people who have the greatest happiness from work. They feel like they&#39;re earning their success, which is to say that they&#39;re creating value with their lives and with their work lives, that their accomplishments are moving the needle and they&#39;re being recognized for those accomplishments. And number two, they feel like they&#39;re serving people so that they&#39;re needed. These are the two big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of people are watching us right now who are employers, and I&#39;ve been a CEO too. The number one thing that you can do for recruitment, for retention, the ultimate rewards that go far beyond money are making sure that you have a system where people are earning their success through their merit and personal accomplishment. They know it, they see it, and so do their friends. And they actually feel like they&#39;re serving other people and they can see the faces of the people for whom they&#39;re creating value. These are the big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One more thing to keep in mind, those things are easiest to do when we&#39;re in person. That&#39;s just it. You said we spend half of our lives with our coworkers at work. Well, I don&#39;t know, man, not anymore. A lot of people are spending half of their lives in front of a Zoom screen where it&#39;s hard to earn your success, it&#39;s hard to feel like you&#39;re serving other people, and you don&#39;t even get to see your work buddies. That&#39;s tough stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re right, then there must be some self-deception here. If you ask people, they like hybrid. They like working from home. They talk about it giving them a better work-life balance, all of that we think would translate into fulfillment and happiness. But do you think we&#39;re fooling ourselves?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, there&#39;s a set of biases that are at play here. For example, one of the things we find is that when you&#39;re really lonely, it impairs the executive centers of your brain. We know this. This is the reason that when you&#39;re really sad and lonely, you cocoon on the couch with a comfortable blanket streaming Netflix and eating Haagen-Dazs. What you should do is get up and go outside and get some vitamin D and ride your bike and call your friends, but you&#39;re impaired at that particular moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the pandemic people started to become more isolated. They made the best of that isolation by creating lives that were very, very convenient, I have to say.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, some people do have a way better work-life balance because they want to spend all that time with their families. The problem is all of the people that are separated from their family and their friends and actually not seeing people at work, that&#39;s really catastrophic when it comes to happiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book in many ways is about agency: happiness and fulfillment are not based on external variables or things that happen to us, but all very much within our control. The problem is it&#39;s very hard to take dramatic actions to reorder one&#39;s life. How do you get people who understand they should be doing this, but who don&#39;t? How do you make that leap?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the problem is that a lot of people notice that they can manage their money and they can manage their company, but they can&#39;t manage their feelings. Or they can manage their home and they can manage their family life, but they can&#39;t manage their emotions. The reason is that emotional life is a different species of problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stuff around us in our work, these are complicated problems, meaning they&#39;re hard to figure out. But once you do, you can master them and repeat the solutions over and over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life and your emotions, the affairs of the heart and the feelings that you&#39;re getting, positive and negative, they&#39;re not complicated at all. They&#39;re what mathematicians would call a complex problem. That&#39;s a problem that&#39;s very easy to understand and that no amount of computational horsepower can solve it for you. You can only get in it and experience it and work with it in real time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cat is a complex problem. A toaster is a complicated problem. Your job is more like a toaster and your relationships are more like a cat. Your feelings are highly complex. The result is that I can master all these highly complicated things, but I can&#39;t get my mind around my feelings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution starts with understanding the science of human emotion. This is what I&#39;m doing in a lot of my work. This is when my HBS students come to me, these phenomenally talented and successful MBA students, really at the best business school in the world. And they&#39;ll say, “My biggest problem is I can&#39;t manage how I feel, and I feel like I&#39;m really out of control.” So the number one skill that we get is to treat your emotional system, the limbic system of your brain, like anything else that you would be managing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about it as a complex system that you&#39;re participating in, and using the techniques that we talk about in the class, which start with basically this idea of learning how to experience your emotions, not as they&#39;re delivered to you, but in the prefrontal cortex of your brain so that you can decide how to react, substitute emotions, and even disregard the emotions, but on purpose. That&#39;s a specific set of techniques called metacognition that I walk through based on cutting-edge neuroscience. Anybody can do it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is, we don&#39;t teach kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach school kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach business people to do this. If I had my way, every business school and every high school would have this class, and when you came to work for a big company, they would have a class in metacognition and emotional self-management that you have to go through for the first week in orientation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I assume these business students are, as you said, incredibly successful by any measure. There&#39;s probably a split, but do you find they crave what you&#39;re teaching or that they come in skeptical of what you&#39;re teaching?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They really crave it. I mean, the most skeptical ones are probably not taking the class. It&#39;s an elective, after all. The ones who are really skeptical are across the hall in supply chain management or something. But the truth is that they really crave it and it&#39;s because they want it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My approach is basically this: you can be happier, but you have to understand the science. You need to use the science to change your habits and your lifestyle, and then you need to teach it to other people to make it permanent in your life. The class is called “Leadership and Happiness” because I want every leader to become a happiness teacher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m doing 175 talks a year outside of Harvard, talking to business audiences primarily. And I say, “Look, I&#39;m going to show you a bunch of PowerPoints on the science of happiness, and what I want you to do is to take these slides, take my name off, put your name on, and I want you to teach it to somebody so that you permanently understand this technology and you don&#39;t forget it in your own life.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s the way to get it done. That&#39;s the way that we teach it at Harvard, and it really, really works. I&#39;m telling you, Adi, I am my own first patient in this work, quite frankly. Because I wanted to be happier. As a social scientist, I applied my own toolkit to myself. I wanted to be a happier person. And since I&#39;ve been writing about the science of happiness, guinea-pigging it on myself, everything that I suggest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; and to my students, I do myself first to make sure that I actually believe it works. I&#39;m not just reading academic journal articles and then teaching it to other people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My happiness has risen by 60% in the last four years. In just four years. To be sure it started at kind of a low baseline, but 60% is a lot based on the best measurement techniques for happiness. So I know it works, and I see the results of this every day among my students as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s keep you on the couch a bit more. You come across as a positive, presumably happy person. I know first impressions can be off, but even the sentence, “My happiness is up 60%,” I can&#39;t imagine really what you&#39;re measuring to come up with such a specific figure. What are some measurements? Why have your numbers changed and how?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are some general wellbeing surveys people can take. They&#39;re all over the Internet. And if they&#39;re psychometrically robust, they can do a good job. What I like to look at, however, is I pull apart the negative and positive intensity levels in affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affect means mood. What we find is that if you have a little bit of a malaise, if you&#39;re kind of a melancholic person, either your happiness levels are too low or your unhappiness levels are too high.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, it seems like I&#39;m splitting hairs here, but I&#39;m not. A lot of people think happiness and unhappiness are opposites: that if you&#39;re unhappy, it means you have a lack of happiness. That&#39;s completely wrong. Happiness and unhappiness, or positive and negative emotion, they largely exist in different hemispheres of the brain. They&#39;re produced for different reasons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The negative emotions of fear and anger and disgust and sadness, these are evolved to keep you alive. You should be very, very grateful for your negative emotions. But if they&#39;re too intense, they can hurt your quality of life. Your positive emotions of joy and love and interest in things, again, these are evolved and they&#39;re really good things to have.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that some people, their happiness levels are too low. Other people, their unhappiness levels are too high. I have a test that I administer to my students. I didn&#39;t develop it. It was developed by psychometricians about 20 years ago. But it&#39;s called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psytests.org/emo/panasen.html&quot;>;PANAS test&lt;/a>;, the positive affect negative affect series, and it separates out the intensity of your positive and negative emotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happens is effectively that you have four different characteristics. You can be high positive and high negative. You can be low positive and low negative. You can be high positive and low negative, and of course you could be high negative and low positive. These are a quarter of the population each.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High, high, this is a high affect person, it&#39;s called the mad scientist. That&#39;s me. My problem with wellbeing is not that I&#39;m unhappy or that I&#39;m not happy enough. On the contrary, it just means that I need to manage my high levels of negative affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other people have different issues. Everybody wants to be high positive and low negative. That&#39;s called the cheerleader. It turns out cheerleaders have problems, too. If two cheerleaders meet each other and marry, for example, they won&#39;t be able to bear any threat or listen to any bad news or think that anything bad might happen in the future. They&#39;ll spend all the money and go bankrupt. Cheerleaders, they tend to be pretty rocky CEOs because they will not listen to bad news, and they tend to get wiped out by threats.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High negative, low positive, these are poets. They tend to be extremely creative, but they suffer a lot from sadness and these negative emotions. They have to manage that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last, low, low, these people are not horribly unhappy or low quality of life. They have low intensity affect. These are judges. These are people who are sober. They make great surgeons, they make great litigators and judges. They make great parents of teenagers, high stress professions, etc. But they tend to look a little unenthusiastic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I give these tests to my students so they can know who to marry, how to manage themselves, how to build a management team around them that complements them. It&#39;s really, really instructive, and this is one of the ways that I measure my own happiness and the management techniques that I need, using the neuroscience for my life, and that I can apply to the lives of others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To what extent do we need to be happy at work? I mean, one approach to work could be I do it, I am hopefully making decent money to be able to sustain myself, and I&#39;m focusing on my personal development, on my happiness outside of work. Obviously in an ideal world, we&#39;re happy and contented everywhere, but do we need to be happy at work? How critical is that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s an empirical question about whether or not people that have a high quality of life tend to be happy at work or it doesn&#39;t matter. And the truth is, if you&#39;re unhappy at work, you&#39;re probably unhappy in life.这很简单。 I mean, it&#39;s like nobody works an hour a day. Maybe you&#39;re one of these lucky people that can be on the four-hour work week. My friend Tim Ferriss wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357&quot;>;that famous book&lt;/a>;, and the truth is, a lot of people could get their work done in a lot less time than they do. But most of us don&#39;t have that luxury.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been working 80-hour weeks my whole career, and part of it is a pathology. I&#39;m not going to kid you, I talk a lot in my research about self-objectification, workaholism, which is all based on success addiction, and fears of failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And everybody out there watching, you know I&#39;m talking about you too. So take care of these pathologies because these are addictions like anything else, and there&#39;s a lot of brain chemistry in that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is, you&#39;re going to spend a ton of time doing that. And if it&#39;s drudgery, that&#39;s bad. You don&#39;t want drudgery. At very least it should be something that&#39;s pleasant and making it pleasant sometimes it&#39;s completely out of our grasp. If you have a job that you truly hate and a boss who&#39;s just the worst, well, that&#39;s no good. But a lot of it is in our hands, and this is a lot of what I&#39;m working on and what I&#39;m trying to help people understand they can actually manage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You just mentioned workaholism. I think many of us suspect we suffer from it, but maybe aren&#39;t willing to look too closely at whether that&#39;s true. But the workaholism is a high, we get a sense of who we are, a sense of accomplishment, etc. But surely it&#39;s not fully a good thing. What is your advice to workaholics who may not realize that that is what they are?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To begin with, workaholism is actually horrible for your quality of life. The problem is that when you&#39;re a workaholic, people congratulate you. Nobody says, “Man, you are so good at drinking gin.” Nobody ever says, “Dude, you&#39;re unbelievable at how much methamphetamine you can consume.” These are not compliments. People feel sorry for you when you&#39;re addicted to other substances or gambling or pornography or anything else that&#39;s deleterious, dangerous, and addictive, that captures your brain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But workaholism, man, you work all night, you work 100-hour weeks, people are like, “Dude, you&#39;re killing it.” And you&#39;re like, “Yeah, I feel so good about myself, but how come I can&#39;t maintain a proper relationship?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The truth of the matter is that there are really a portfolio of four things that go into having a truly happy life, and they need to be in both in abundance and in balance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Number one is faith and philosophy, whether it&#39;s religious or not religious, it has to be something that zooms you out on the majesty of life and makes you small so that you have yourself in perspective. You&#39;re going to have peace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, you&#39;ve got to be paying serious attention to your family relationship. No joke, family relationships are the most mystical kind of love, and you can&#39;t substitute anything for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your friendships, now, this is a really bad one for workaholics. Workaholics have a lot of deal friends, but not very many real friends. Everybody watching us knows the difference between real and deal. And if you don&#39;t, take the fellow workaholics, take the 10 people that you see most and spend most of your time with and write real or deal after each one, and see for yourself that you need to tune this up. Deal friends are useful, real friends are beautifully useless to you. Do you have enough useless people? That&#39;s the question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least is work. The two parts of work that really matter are not title, not money, not admiration, not power, [but] earned success and serving other people. Workaholism militates against these sources of fulfillment in our lives. It impoverishes. It makes us poorer so that we actually can&#39;t pursue these other pillars. The result is we just don&#39;t have a balanced portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look, if everything you do for your happiness is work, that&#39;s like putting your entire pension into Greek bonds. It might work out, but I&#39;m an economist. I don&#39;t recommend it. That&#39;s not a diversified strategy. You&#39;re most likely not going to retire the way you want to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Saudi Arabia, it&#39;s a simple, intriguing question. Is happiness contagious?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, happiness is absolutely contagious because social contagion is a real thing. There&#39;s a really great study, Adi, more or less in our neighborhood, they&#39;re called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/&quot;>;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a>; from Framingham, Massachusetts. It looks over 50 years. It was set up to look at people&#39;s lives, at how different social aspects of life are contagious for physical stuff, whether obesity is socially contagious, etc. But they started to look at other things like happiness, and they found that just being in the vicinity of a happy person makes you happier. Having your spouse get happier makes you happier. Having your best friend get happier makes you a lot happier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even more contagious is misery. That&#39;s the reason you don&#39;t want your teenage kids to hang out with a kid who wears all black and looks bummed all the time. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s like, “Oh, that sucks. Everything sucks.” You don&#39;t want that because that&#39;s so socially contagious that your kid is going to become unbelievably negative and become sad. And nobody wants this for their children because they have a sense of the social contagion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number one issue that I see in family dynamics is a social contagion of negativity. That&#39;s what each one of us has to turn around, is to try to inject the happiness virus into our family and to basically do it on purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a question from Nepal that picks up on your themes. You&#39;ve talked about people taking agency in their own life and their own fulfillment and sense of happiness. But how should we deal with people in leadership who don&#39;t believe in any of this stuff, who don&#39;t believe in work-life balance? You can work on yourself, but as you said, misery and all this stuff is contagious. How can you move the needle on leadership that doesn&#39;t appreciate any of this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to leadership, leader lead thyself. Your number one employee is you. Don&#39;t be the pace-setting leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember when Daniel Goleman wrote that famous book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Results-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/1633692620&quot;>;&lt;em>;Leadership That Gets Results&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;? It was about the six types of leaders, and the number one leadership characteristic that everybody thinks is great—but is actually horrible—is workaholic pace-setting leaders that are in the office all the time and saying, “Look, if I&#39;m going to ask people to work hard, I have to work even harder.” It&#39;s incredibly dispiriting for other people. It lowers their quality of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a CEO, I&#39;m telling you, somebody on my executive team says, “Arthur, you got to stop sending email at 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM because people are going to stay up wondering if they&#39;re going to have to answer your email.” I said, “I don&#39;t expect anybody to…” That&#39;s not the point. So I put timers on my email to do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even better was when my wife started clamping down and saying, “You need to sleep more. You need to go to the gym more. You need to have more of a life.” So number one, if you&#39;re a leader, you need to get a hold on this problem because you&#39;re going to be hurting yourself, wrecking your relationships, and disheartening all the people around you. This is a big problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, don&#39;t work for a workaholic. Don&#39;t work for them if you can. And again, not everybody&#39;s got all these degrees of freedom, but most of us have a few choices in what we can do for work. And by the way, if it turns out that your boss is abusing you and hopelessly addicted to drugs, you got to change circumstances. That&#39;s an abusive relationship. I recommend steering clear of workaholics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, what&#39;s behind workaholism, fellow workaholics? It&#39;s the success addiction. Workaholism is a secondary addiction to the addiction of success, and a lot of that&#39;s based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/10/howto-arthurbrooks-happiness-identity-drshefali-mindfulness-meaning-2021/620282/&quot;>;objectification of yourself&lt;/a>;, which is a bad thing to do, and a deep, deep set of fear of failure. Those are the things to actually start working on. You can&#39;t just say, “Work less, what&#39;s the problem?” It&#39;s self-objectification and fear of failure, almost always.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you think of new entries to the workforce, and some of them are your HBS students who are working for investment banks, who are working for law firms, and there is this expectation of exploitation where, yes, I&#39;m working around the clock. It is killing me, but it is getting me to where I will be rich, fulfilled, happy. How can people who are ambitious in those fields do otherwise?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that I tell my students is you&#39;ve got to have a balanced happiness portfolio, and killing all of your relationships to spend 110 hours in an investment bank is the worst, most unbalanced happiness portfolio you can possibly get. Plus, you&#39;re losing your best years to establish the relationships that you&#39;re going to want to cultivate for the rest of your life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People say, “Okay, I&#39;m 28. I&#39;m going to go get an investment bank job, they&#39;re going to expect me to work a hundred hours a week. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll look for a spouse when I&#39;m 35.”可能不会。 I got the data, and the data don&#39;t lie. You&#39;re more and more likely to actually not have the thing that&#39;s going to give you the most happiness in your life, which is your marriage. We actually have to think in a balanced-portfolio approach to the happiness that we&#39;re trying to get, and making those sacrifices are really bad sacrifices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, guys like you and me, our age, in our fifties, you notice that we don&#39;t make those sacrifices anymore. And the reason is because our time parameters are shorter. But also we&#39;ve had bitter experience with these types of things. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s like I&#39;m a grandfather now and my grandson was born and suddenly I was a lot less interested in working. But part of it was the bitter experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ll tell you a story actually that will motivate this. When I was interviewing this woman for my last book, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Finding-Success-Happiness-Purpose-ebook/dp/B08WCKY8MB&quot;>;&lt;em>;From Strength to Strength&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, about how to get happier as you get older, a titan of Wall Street. This woman was just famous and rich, a billionaire, and she was horribly unhappy. She was my age, late fifties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What&#39;s wrong?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “Well, my husband and I were roommates. I&#39;m kind of cordial with my adult kids, but it&#39;s not close. I&#39;m getting bad reports from the doctor. I think I drink too much. I need to go to the gym. My employees are starting to doubt the wisdom of my decision-making. And I don&#39;t know, what do I do?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What do you mean? You don&#39;t need a Harvard professor to tell you what to do. You&#39;re prescribing to yourself, stepping back, going away with your husband. You&#39;re already rich. Why don&#39;t you do that?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “It&#39;s true, but I guess I&#39;ve always chosen to be special rather than happy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boom, man. It was like a knife to my heart, Adi. All these years when I was running a company and the 14th hour at the office before the first hour with my kids, well, news flash man, they grew up. They grew up and I missed a lot of it. And I really, really regret that. Now I&#39;m not going to miss it with my grandkids, I get a do-over. I&#39;m not going to screw that up twice. That&#39;s a really important thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I could have had a little bit more perspective, I would not have been less successful. The data don&#39;t lie on this either. The 14th hour is not productive. It&#39;s just compulsive. Just like any other addiction, the 14th drink doesn&#39;t give you more joy. Stop at two, is the bottom line, because you need the balance in this part of your life as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At HBR we try to be super practical, so before you go, can you leave the audience shortcuts to happiness, or just things that viewers can think about or do today that can be a meaningful step in that direction?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in the Atlantic&lt;/a>;, every Thursday morning, I have a big topic and I do talk about the science, but then I always give three ways to live this thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just in general, since we&#39;re on the meta topic of happiness, the way to think about happiness is that it&#39;s not a feeling. If happiness were a feeling, that would be very disappointing. It would depend on how you slept last night and what you ate for breakfast and no good. If your spouse yelled at you this morning, no good. Don&#39;t chase the feeling. Feelings are evidence of happiness, like the smell of the turkey is evidence of your Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is three things that we need to be thinking about and managing in our lives. Enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose. Those are the three big things that we need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enjoyment is not pleasure, pleasure is an animal thing. Enjoyment is the pleasure you get plus the people that you enjoy it with and the memories that you&#39;re making. That&#39;s why beer commercials don&#39;t have a guy alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack. They have people enjoying a few beers together because it&#39;s pleasure plus people plus memory. Don&#39;t do the stuff that makes you feel good alone. That&#39;s the rule of thumb.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second is satisfaction. Satisfaction is the joy you get when you struggle for something and you get that. Now fellow strivers, the striver&#39;s curse is you get on something called the hedonic treadmill where you struggle and struggle and achieve it, but then it doesn&#39;t give you very much satisfaction for very long and so you keep trying and trying and trying again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution to that is not to have more, it&#39;s to want less. Your satisfaction is your haves divided by your wants. Manage your denominator with a wants-management strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least, it&#39;s meaning, it&#39;s purpose in your life. The way to figure out if you have a purpose crisis is asking yourself two simple questions. There&#39;s no right answers, but you have to have answers. “Why am I alive, and for what am I willing to die today?” And if you don&#39;t have answers, go looking for the answers with introspection. When you see somebody that finds those answers, it&#39;s like an actual miracle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the three things practically to think about. “Do I have enjoyment or just pleasure? Am I managing my wants or my haves, so I can have satisfaction? And do I have enough meaning in my life by answering those two questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s great. I hope people took notes, I hope people try to act on that. Arthur, I want to thank you for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you, Adi. And thanks to everybody watching.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Incorporating DEI into Decision-Making]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_01_aJTiW00qqtI_5989933_B3UFXwcVbc4_3neSwyntbQ8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Most people believe in promoting DEI in the workplace. But implicit and unconscious biases &amp;#8212; not to mention the constant juggling of priorities required at work &amp;#8212; can lead to inequitable decision-making. In this article, drawing on recent research, the authors suggest that this problem can be addressed by making DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, to managers immediately before they need to make consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation. The authors discuss three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Most people don&#39;t think of themselves as biased or prejudiced, and people often explicitly endorse diversity as something companies should strive for. But many organizations struggle with DEI. Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implicit or unconscious biases can lead to inequitable decision-making. More mundanely, people are just busy. They have lots of competing priorities and lots to occupy their brains. Even if they care about DEI, they might not have it top of mind as they go about their work. As a result, they might not see how their decisions are relevant for DEI and so might inadvertently make inequitable decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fix this, managers and organizations should make DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, when it matters most — that is, when consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation are being made. Our academic research and experiences partnering with companies suggest that to make real progress on DEI, managers and organizations need to make DEI salient in those moments of consequential decision-making. We&#39;ve identified three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Ask managers to hire for more than one job at a time. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many hiring decisions are made in isolation, with only one person being hired at a time. When this is the case, diversity simply just isn&#39;t that salient to decision-makers, who are often thinking not about diversity but instead about technical skills, cultural fit, or how quickly a candidate can start. This shouldn&#39;t be surprising, because diversity is a property of groups, not individuals. You can describe a group of people as “diverse” or “homogeneous,” after all, but not an individual person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, when people make collective hiring decisions — when they hire multiple people at a time — our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3533&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that people select more diversity. They start thinking about the candidates they&#39;re selecting as a group, which makes diversity more salient and leads to hiring decisions that improve it. For example, rather than hiring one person every month, a company might benefit from grouping these decisions together and hiring three people very quarter. The total number of people hired will be the same, but making collective decisions every quarter should lead to more diversity. Relatedly, it might also be beneficial to give one person oversight over hiring decisions across teams or departments, enabling that person to make collective hiring decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Ask managers to make diversity more salient in the promotion process. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This recommendation comes from work that we&#39;ve done at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morethannow.co.uk/single-post/2022/8/22/the-inclusion-lab&quot;>;Inclusion Lab at MoreThanNow&lt;/a>;, a collaboration of academics and consultants focused on generating empirical evidence about what actually works at improving DEI in the workplace. Specifically, it grows out of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/why-you-should-start-ab-testing-your-dei-initiatives&quot;>;field experiment&lt;/a>; we conducted with a global management, engineering, and development consultancy that wanted to know if we could help it increase equity in its promotions process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this company, promotions are made by a group of high-level senior managers in a bi-annual promotions process, during which managers can nominate their employees for promotion. Managers justify their nominations in a statement of 50 words or less in an online form. In our experiment, 116 of these senior managers were randomly assigned to receive one of two messages in advance of submitting their nominations. The control group was asked to consider promoting people who had displayed excellent performance and competence beyond their current grade. The treatment group was asked to consider the same criteria — but also to consider the diversity of their nominees as a whole, and whether their choices would help to close representation gaps. In other words, we made DEI more salient for this group of managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened when we did this? Although the sample for this experiment was small (which means some caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings), we found that making diversity salient increased the number of employees promoted from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. The effects seem to be driven by male senior managers, who at baseline may have been less likely to think spontaneously about diversity. We did not find any statistically significant positive or negative treatment effects on the promotion rates of female employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Ask managers to view a short diversity training video right before formal people decisions. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This suggestion uses salience to help organizations dramatically rethink how they implement diversity training. Prior research suggests that training is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/does-diversity-training-work-the-way-its-supposed-to&quot;>;largely ineffective at actually changing behavior&lt;/a>;. However, we think this may be because it doesn&#39;t make DEI salient in the moment of consequential decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In most organizations, people are given diversity training when they get onboarded, or perhaps on an annual basis. That&#39;s often months or years before they actually make consequential hiring, promotion, or performance-evaluation decisions for the company, which means they&#39;re extremely unlikely to have the messages of the training in mind when they make those decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine instead if an organization had managers take a short training immediately prior to making a consequential HR decision. Because the training happens just before the decision, it has a much higher likelihood of ensuring that DEI remains salient and encourage managers to make more equitable choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have evidence of exactly this finding from a field experiment that we at the Inclusion Lab have been conducting with Ericsson, a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Sweden. We delivered an automated 5-minute DEI training to some managers before they screened resumes and found that the managers who got this training were significantly more likely to hire people from underrepresented groups at Ericsson.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experiment suggests that the significant amount of time and cost we invest into DEI training can indeed pay off — but only when organizations choose the right moment for it. One-off “blanket” training may well not be the way forward. Instead, organizations may want to consider how to use repeated smaller training modules in advance of key decision points to make DEI salient and therefore effective. We see this as fertile ground for further experimentation in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most people really do want to do the right thing when it comes to DEI, but they often just need a nudge or prompt to keep DEI top of mind at the right time. Our research strongly suggests that managers and organizations can do this by making DEI more salient at moments of consequential decision-making.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are Collaboration Tools Overwhelming Your Team?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/are-collaboration-tools-overwhelming-your-team]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1494319608-2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;master1305/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Today&amp;#8217;s workers feel numbed by a fragmented, unpredictable, and overwhelming collection of collaboration tools &amp;#8212; the very things advertised to boost their productivity.

They called their intervention the &amp;#8220;collaboration cleanse.&amp;#8221; Here are their findings, as well as strategies for leaders to simplify employees&amp;#8217; collaboration tool use.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/are-collaboration-tools-overwhelming-your-team?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/are-collaboration-tools-overwhelming-your-team?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The typical worker checks their email &lt;a href=&quot;https://ppm.express/blog/how-much-time-your-employees-spend-on-checking-emails/&quot;>;77 times&lt;/a>; and receives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2019/apr/08/how-many-work-emails-is-too-many&quot;>;121 new emails&lt;/a>; each day. While doing that, many are also &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/08/how-much-time-and-energy-do-we-waste-toggling-between-applications&quot;>;toggling back and forth between applications&lt;/a>;, bouncing between pings on apps like Slack and Teams, comments on shared documents, and notifications from an array of company web portals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s no surprise then that today&#39;s workers feel numbed by a fragmented, unpredictable, and overwhelming collection of collaboration tools — trapped by the very things advertised to boost their productivity. They know they&#39;re overloaded and feel exhausted but believe there is little or nothing they can do to slow the onslaught of communication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We explored how collaboration technology bloat impacts employees and tried to help people take control over their work. We called our intervention the “collaboration cleanse.” Here we&#39;ll explore our findings (spoiler: there&#39;s good news and bad) and outline what leaders should do to simplify employees&#39; collaboration tool use.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Collaboration Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This “cleanse” was implemented by Asana&#39;s Work Innovation Lab, in concert with Amazon Web Services. We randomly assigned each of our 58 volunteers, which included both Asana and Amazon employees, into one of two groups. We asked all participants to report the collaboration technologies they use at least once a week for interacting with colleagues (for example, Slack, Figma, and Zoom). We also asked them to evaluate how well each tool helps them achieve their current work goals, as well as how much effort it takes to use each one. Finally, we asked them to choose specific technologies to refrain from using for two weeks. We asked people in the first group to stop using half of their collaboration tools for the two weeks. People in the second group could choose which and how many collaboration tools they eliminated. All participants told us which technologies they planned to set aside and kept daily diaries, recording any occasions when they strayed from their “approved” list.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This cleanse was inspired by research on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/the-friction-project/&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>;, including our prior interventions at the Work Innovation Lab that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/meeting-overload-is-a-fixable-problem&quot;>;helped people eliminate and redesign bad meetings&lt;/a>;. This research shows that people are prone to solving problems by heaping &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; complexity and burdens on themselves and others — even when subtraction is a more effective strategy. But prompting them to slow down and think about what they can and should remove from their work helps them overcome the instinct to add instead of &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/when-subtraction-adds-value&quot;>;subtract&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Good News: Participants Became More Aware of Their Digital Burdens&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As they embarked on this cleanse, participants in both groups became more aware of the digital clutter pervading their lives — clutter that they didn&#39;t think about much or at all and hadn&#39;t ever tried to reduce or remove. Forty-one percent reported (without prompting) that they became more mindful of the impact of using too many collaboration tools on their focus and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research scientist put it to us this way: “[The cleanse] made me much more aware of the different tools I was using and the impact that was having on my productivity and sense of focus. There is a subtle cost with switching tools, and that additional friction hurts my focus and productivity.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to reflecting more deeply on how they used their tools, participants also made small strides toward using fewer collaboration tools overall. More than half (53%) of participants told us they would use at least one tool less frequently as a result of their cleanse. They expected this conscious culling of their tech stack to free up their time and cognitive bandwidth for more focused work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A customer insights analyst told us the cleanse taught her to be more deliberate about when she uses some particularly distracting collaboration technologies (eg, messaging platforms) to cut down on interruptions. One change she made was to plan intervals where she would use collaboration technologies intensely for 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes after lunch, and 10 minutes at the end of the day, and otherwise wouldn&#39;t use them at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Bad News: Participants Felt More Helpless and Exhausted After the Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The intervention also appeared to have some negative consequences that surprised us. After we prompted participants to become more mindful of their tool use, they reported that their feelings of helplessness increased. When they paused to identify digital tools to subtract, many realized doing so would be a time-consuming ordeal, or downright impossible. That&#39;s because so many other people inside and outside their teams expected (or required) them to use particular collaboration tools, so the decision to get rid of these shared tools wasn&#39;t theirs alone (or at all). The awareness triggered by the collaboration cleanse made them want to fight back and overhaul their tools. But many felt stymied by inescapable rules, traditions, and power dynamics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One project risk manager, for example, said she would try to minimize the use of collaboration tools but didn&#39;t think she would succeed. With different teams using different tools because of their own preferences or company requirements, she and her colleagues were often confused about which messaging tool they should use to communicate with people in different business units.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in both groups reported a sense of helplessness and the resulting exhaustion, yet it appeared to be more severe in the first group, where we asked participants to abstain from using half of their tools for two weeks — a task that proved to be not just formidable, but often impossible. Many participants realized they were helpless to cut their tool use like they wanted to, which frustrated and exhausted them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in the second group, who were given the flexibility to trim their list of collaboration tools as much as they deemed necessary, also reported feelings of futility and digital exhaustion, though they seemed less vehement in their distress. The task of subtracting tools, we found, is complex and daunting, and becoming mindful about the struggle to achieve it can inadvertently exacerbate feelings of helplessness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This aligns with the findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMPROC.2023.11120abstract&quot;>;related study&lt;/a>; where we interviewed 63 knowledge workers from a variety of industries. We found that feelings of digital exhaustion depended on whether or not employees felt like they had autonomy to decide which tools they would use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our takeaway? When people realize they can&#39;t do much or anything to reduce the number of collaboration tools they use (or when and how often they use them), they&#39;re left feeling even more helpless and exhausted. As one software engineer put it, “This is something that&#39;s really hard to change on an individual level.” He went on to explain that, if he decided not to use a tool that other colleagues used, it would be harder for him and his collaborators to do their jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Change Needs to Come from the Top&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many studies show that effective and long-lasting change in organizations bubbles up from the bottom and that strong dictums from management &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;can create impediments for employees&lt;/a>;. We&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250284426/thefrictionproject&quot;>;cited&lt;/a>; much of that research &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/the-digital-mindset-what-it-really-takes-to-thrive-in-the-age-of-data-algorithms-and-ai/10413&quot;>;in our own work&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;even produced a fair amount of it&lt;/a>;, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when it comes to technology overload and digital exhaustion, the best and sometimes only way to reduce the problem is with strong, persistent, and even downright inflexible top-down intervention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results of our collaboration cleanse show that the interactive and interdependent nature of collaboration technologies makes it near impossible for individual employees to meaningfully reduce their tool use in the workplace on their own. And as participants in our study made clear, attempting and failing to change how and when they use their digital tools may be worse than never trying at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees at lower levels often have the best information about which tools to keep and which to eliminate. But those at the top of the pecking order are in the best position to use their authority to make change throughout the organization and help employees stay afloat amid the digital deluge. Here&#39;s how leaders can help employees get a better handle on their collaboration tools:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Provide purposeful constraints.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Set clear guidelines for when employees should use specific technologies. This will help prevent them from spending time and energy second-guessing what type of work to do with which technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Establish non-negotiables. For example, leaders in one organization we worked with specified that Slack should be used for communication that&#39;s time sensitive and requires a quick response — and not for less-pressing matters. Leaders in other organizations have banned email completely, or made the decision to use only one project management tool. They key here is to be specific and exacting: Don&#39;t let too many tools clutter people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Tackle the root cause and ripple effects.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As a leader, it&#39;s crucial to confront both the visible symptoms and underlying causes of tech overload. Initiate a top-down pruning of your organization&#39;s tool stack, eliminating redundant and inefficient technologies. One data scientist who participated in the cleanse described how his company&#39;s leaders cancelled employee licenses for a redundant file-sharing platform, which helped him and others stick to a single platform when working on documents, rather than being forced to keep switching between different platforms that each required different steps and commands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also your responsibility to help your team mitigate the ripple effects of tool overload. Encourage employees to use features like “do not disturb” and turn off unnecessary notifications to regain some control over their attention. But if you don&#39;t model this behavior, it&#39;s unlikely your employees will do it either.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Fix friction head-on.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Encourage, enable, and even require employees to regularly evaluate their tech habits. Our cleanse suggests this conscious reflection can make your employees more aware of the toll of tech overload. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250249869/subtract&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>; can be a powerful catalyst for change, prompting employees to pause and critically evaluate the impacts of their technologies on their productivity and well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet our intervention also revealed that this increased awareness can lead to heightened feelings of digital exhaustion if employees feel powerless to make changes. As a leader, your job is not only to promote this conscious reflection but also to provide support and resources so employees can change their tech use. This could involve facilitating discussions about tech habits within teams, providing training on how to use collaboration tools more effectively, or using your authority to revamp the organization&#39;s tech stack based on employee feedback. Be prepared to follow through and hold yourself accountable to ensure that increased awareness of tool overload leads to positive change rather than increased despair.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Beware the credit card approach.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s become common for managers to buy subscriptions to digital platforms for their teams — without alerting the IT department — by simply charging the small monthly fee to their company credit cards. Many tech companies design their pricing strategies so managers can make these purchases without going through a lengthy corporate approval process. Although many managers adopt this approach because they think it helps their teams adopt the best technologies quickly, the lack of friction contributes to bloat in each member&#39;s own tech stack and can lead to more feelings of digital exhaustion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers need to be more conscious about how many tools they introduce to their employees and of how difficult it is for them to stop using tools once they start. In one midsize company we worked with, the CTO instructed the accounting team to flag all purchases made to software vendors on the corporate card. Each subscription that was not authorized by IT was cancelled. If the manager wanted to reinstate it, they had to make a formal request to the CTO in writing. Sure, this was a tough top-down approach. But after a year of asking managers not to overwhelm their teams with tools, the CTO finally forced people to tackle the problem rather than just make hollow promises. Six months after the big cancellation, the company was using nearly 30 fewer tools.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Collaboration technology overload can drown employees in choices, leaving them feeling helpless. The irony is that by constraining those choices, adding frustrating obstacles to adopting yet another collaboration technology, and taking control away from individuals, employees can feel more in control of their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Prepare for a GenAI Future You Can&rsquo;t Predict]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-to-prepare-for-a-genai-future-you-cant-predict]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1500235907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Given the staggering pace of generative AI development, it&amp;#8217;s no wonder that so many executives are tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations.

Leaders, understandably concerned about missing out on the next wave of technology, are unwittingly making risky bets on their companies&amp;#8217; futures.

We initially worked through scenarios to improve fraud detection and customer service, but with the ongoing spate of recent announcements, it was clear he had grander ambitions in mind. Like many industries, banking has a workforce problem: There is a discrepancy between the demand for skilled personnel and the supply of workers who are willing to return to an office and play by pre-Covid rules.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI, he thought, might be a silver bullet of sorts. It could create cost savings and efficiencies through automation, but might these new tools also solve the talent shortage issue? To put it plainly: How soon could AI replace human workers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our conversation echoed many I&#39;ve had since last November with executives across an array of businesses, including insurance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and even executives leading Hollywood studios, whose writers and actors are currently on strike. They all want to know how their companies can create more value using fewer human resources. That&#39;s because last fall, ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by OpenAI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt&quot;>;suddenly went viral&lt;/a>;, demonstrating the power of AI to generate its own emails, essays, recipes, financial reports, articles, and ideas. Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html&quot;>;estimates&lt;/a>; that within the decade, 300 million jobs will either be eliminated or largely diminished by generative AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re already starting to see turbulence. Job postings for “prompt engineers” — humans who ask systems like ChatGPT to generate content — are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3&quot;>;offering annual salaries of $300,000 or more&lt;/a>;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389233&quot;>;OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 passed the Uniform Bar Exam&lt;/a>; and hinted that in the near future, we may not need lawyers for transactional work. Indeed, Walmart is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005148/en/Pactum%E2%80%99s-Autonomous-Negotiation-Technology-on-Display-at-the-National-Retail-Federation%E2%80%99s-2023-Retail-Big-Show&quot;>;prototyping&lt;/a>; a generative AI system (unrelated to OpenAI) to negotiate some of its vendor contracts; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2023/walmart-finds-75-percent-vendors-prefer-negotiating-with-chatbot/&quot;>;75% of contract lawyers and procurement officers&lt;/a>; on the other side say they now prefer negotiating with an AI over their flesh-and-blood counterparts. Google&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/sharing-google-med-palm-2-medical-large-language-model&quot;>;Med-PaLM 2&lt;/a>;, which is a specialized model trained on medical knowledge, now answers medical exam problems at the expert level of a doctor. This summer, partners will start testing applications that can look at an X-ray and automatically write a mammography report — without a human doctor in the loop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the staggering pace of development, it&#39;s no wonder that so many executives are coming to the same conclusion: Within just a few years, powerful AI systems will perform cognitive work at the same level (or even above) their human workforce. Tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations, business leaders envision a future of work without nearly as many people as today. From my perspective, this is a huge miscalculation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it&#39;s too early to predict the exact future of AI — especially given that generative AI is just one tiny area of a field with many interdependencies, each in various stages of development. Exactly which jobs AI will eliminate, and when, is guesswork. It isn&#39;t enough for an AI system to perform a task; the output has to be proven trustworthy, integrated into existing workstreams, and managed for compliance, risk, and regulatory issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, in a period of rapid disruption brought by technology, leaders are focused too narrowly on immediate gains, rather than how their value network will transform in the future. As AI evolves, it will require entire segments of business to be reimagined — in real time, but before we have a full sense of what the future will look like. Remember the earliest days of the public internet and web browsers, which were viewed as entertainment? No one planned for the fundamental transformation both would ignite. It would have been impossible then to foretell how it would someday influence presidential elections or create the world&#39;s first trillion-dollar companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be sure, executives today must make decisions in the most complex operating environment I&#39;ve seen since those early internet days. Leaders, understandably concerned about missing out on the next wave of technology, are unwittingly making risky bets on their companies&#39; futures. Here are steps every leader should take to prepare for an uncertain world where generative AI and human workforces coexist but will evolve in ways that are unknowable.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Preparing for a Future You Can&#39;t Predict&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the paradox: We need to think of the workforce as evolving with — rather than being supplanted by — generative AI. The workforce will need to evolve, and workers will have to learn new skills, iteratively and over a period of years. Leaders must adopt a new approach to maximize the potential of AI in their organizations, which requires tracking key developments in AI differently, using an iterative process to cultivate a ready workforce, and most importantly, creating evidence-backed future scenarios that challenge conventional thinking within the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What can leaders do now to navigate this period?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;First, temper expectations about what generative AI can and will do for your business.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Historically, AI cycles through phases that involve breakthroughs, surges of funding and fleeting moments of mainstream interest, followed by missed expectations and funding clawbacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1970, Marvin Minsky, an influential computer scientist and one of the founding parents of AI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiws.net/the-history-of-ai/this-week-in-the-history-of-ai-at-aiws-net-marvin-minsky-was-quoted-in-life-magazine-in-from-three-to-eight-years-we-will-have-a-machine-with-the-general-intelligence-of-an-average-human-b/&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; Life magazine that artificial general intelligence — an AI with cognitive abilities indistinguishable from a person — was just three years away. Bear in mind that in the 1970s, the computing power required for such an AI didn&#39;t yet exist. Supercomputers were mostly theoretical. So were personal computers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://r5.ieee.org/houston/ieee-stepping-stone-award-datapoint-2200-the-first-personal-computer/&quot;>;Datapoint 2200&lt;/a>; and its processor eventually became the foundational architecture for what we came to know as PCs. The grand ambitions promised by Minsky and his colleagues never materialized, so funding and interest dried up. This happened again in 1987, when again, computer scientists and businesses made bold promises on a timeline for AI that was just never feasible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While powerful, today&#39;s mainstream generative AI tools — ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL-E 2 — aren&#39;t finished products. Sometime soon, people will sour on their novelty and realize that while AI can create content, it&#39;s not good enough to actually use. Likewise, it&#39;s still very early days when it comes to domain-specific AI tools for medicine, climate, and life sciences. For generative AI to perform the miracles we&#39;ve been promised — at scale, and cost effectively — a lot more work needs to be done. Remember, these tools were mostly theoretical until very recently.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives need to get clear on the practical functions generative AI will perform in their organizations today. They should also be pragmatic about the opportunities — and risks — generative AI will eventually unlock. AI is not a monolith, and we are just at the beginning of a very long trajectory. This may sound intuitive, but in my observation, few leaders are developing a realistic strategy that links today&#39;s operations to tomorrow&#39;s vision, socializing it within their management teams, and revising their performance indicators accordingly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I met with the executive leadership of a multinational consumer packaged goods (CPG) company eager to partner with a generative AI company. I walked them through a high-probability scenario in which customers using a chat tool answered a few questions about their preferences and goals, and had an online shopping cart automatically filled with the items they would need for the week. But none of the CPG&#39;s brands showed up in the cart — or if they did, they weren&#39;t first on the list. Just as search engines like Google and Amazon invented new mechanisms and rules for search engine optimization, in the future, generative AI integrations across platforms like retailers and shopping cart apps would create new challenges for CPG companies, which might find themselves further down the value chain where critical decisions are made.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Second, evaluate what data your company is generating and how it would today, and in the future, be used by generative AI.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Business data is invaluable because once a model has been trained, it can be costly and technically cumbersome to port those data over to another system. At the moment emerging AI platforms are not easily interoperable, and that&#39;s by design. Generative AI platforms are evolving into walled gardens, where the companies creating the technology control all sides of their ecosystems. The biggest AI companies are competing for market share — and for the enormous amounts of data they need to make their models most competitive. By marketing their platforms to companies, they want to lock them (and their data) in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s AI systems are being created using a technique known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf&quot;>;&lt;em>;reinforcement learning with human feedback&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, or RHLF. Essentially, AI systems need constant human feedback, or they run the risk of learning and remembering the wrong information. The more data that&#39;s ingested, the more annotating, labeling, and training that&#39;s required. Today, this work is automated to gig workers in emerging economies like Kenya and Pakistan. As AI matures, specialists with expert-level knowledge will be needed. Many of the business leaders I&#39;ve met with aren&#39;t planning for a future that includes an internal RHLF unit tasked with continuously monitoring, auditing, and tweaking AI systems and tools. (The last thing any leader should want is an unsupervised AI system making decisions about how to improve itself.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even with trained humans in the loop, businesses must continuously craft scenarios that surface risks of working alongside generative AI systems, especially those operated by third parties. That&#39;s because AI systems aren&#39;t static; they are improving incrementally over time. With each new development, new potential risks and opportunities arise. It would be impossible to game out all of the potential negative outcomes in advance without those predictions quickly becoming outdated. (For now, there is no way to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Monte-Carlo-simulation&quot;>;Monte Carlo simulation&lt;/a>; that would be fully accurate in predicting the future.) Instead, a dedicated team should be charged with monitoring generative AI systems as they are learning, as well as related cybersecurity challenges, and they should develop short “what if” scenarios imagining ways in which things could go wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Likewise, as AI evolves, so too will opportunities to unlock new growth. Which means that businesses should also have a dedicated, internal business development team to develop near- and long-term scenarios for the myriad ways in which emerging tools will improve productivity and efficiency, lead to product development, spur innovation, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Third, when it comes to AI, leaders must shift their focus from the bottom line to top line.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This will seem counterintuitive, as many view generative AI as a means to reduce operational costs. Today&#39;s smart chatbots will soon give way to multimodal systems, which are AIs capable of solving different problems and accomplishing different goals at once. Imagine a property and casualty insurance company where every underwriter is teamed up with an AI. Initially, the underwriter might ask the AI to assess the risk associated with insuring a property; after a preliminary analysis of the text, she might ask it to refine results using the images from inspection reports or audio interviews with the prospective policyholder. She might go back and forth a few times, using different data sources, until an optimal quote is received for both the insurance company and the customer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to making productive use of multimodal AIs is understanding how and what to delegate to a machine, so that both the human and the AI can accomplish more through collaboration than by working independently. However delegation is something professionals routinely struggle with: They either assign too much, or not enough, or not the right tasks. Working alongside a multimodal AI will require workers to master the art of delegation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once a workforce understands how to delegate correctly, it will act as a force multiplier within organizations. Individual teams could be more ambitious in growing the company&#39;s top line through ideating and simulating new revenue streams, finding and acquiring new customers, and seeking out various improvements to the company&#39;s overall operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This portends a future that demands a different approach to upskilling. Most workers won&#39;t need to learn how to code, or how to write basic prompts, as we often hear at conferences. Rather, they&#39;ll need to learn how to leverage multimodal AI to do more, and better, work. Just look at Excel, which is &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/10-excel-functions-everyone-should-know&quot;>;used&lt;/a>; by 750 million knowledge workers every day. The software includes more than 500 functions — but the vast majority of people only use a few dozen, because they don&#39;t fully understand how to match the enormous number of features Excel offers to their daily cognitive tasks. Now, imagine a future in which AI — a far more complicated, more convoluted software — is ubiquitous. How much utility will be left on the table simply because business leaders approached upskilling too narrowly?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Framework for Navigating the Evolving AI Workforce&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Workforce change is an inevitable side effect of technological evolution, and leaders need a systemized way of seeing what the future of their organizations will look like in the wake of generative AI&#39;s developments. To that end, this simple framework will help leaders in any organization anticipate how — and when — their workforce will need to change in order to leverage AI. The goal isn&#39;t to make long-range predictions, or even to be ready for everything — it&#39;s to position organizations to be ready for anything as AI continues to improve.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363183&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_WEBB_IDEA_FRAMEWORK_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;The IDEA Framework.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;620&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This framework should be used to develop scenarios for the future of a business. It is designed to help you see risk and opportunity early enough for action. Used regularly, this framework enables leaders to see the landscape more clearly, evaluate gaps within their organizations, and link emerging technology to existing strategy, positioning them to make decisions with confidence. Importantly, it asks leaders to think exponentially about AI, but to act incrementally in response to new developments. While it won&#39;t predict a singular future for your company —&amp;nbsp;no scenario can do that — it will prepare leaders to make decisions well ahead of their competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The single best thing organizations can do right now — during this period of what feels like a soul-crushing amount of change and uncertainty — is to methodically plan for the future. That requires knowing generative AI&#39;s limitations as well as its strengths and adopting a culture of continual evaluation and improvement. It also means getting past clever product demos to much more mundane, pragmatic conversations about the trajectory of development, how data are being used, and the practical ways in which companies can use emerging tools. Resist the temptation to reduce your workforce — and instead use strategic foresight to create a future where AI is leveraged by a highly skilled workforce, and where human–AI teams are more productive, creative, and efficient working together than apart.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Global Companies Can Create a Consistent Customer Experience]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_30_3850269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Yaroslav Danylchenko/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Building a global company is easier, but also more nuanced and complex, than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run. To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving a GLOBE mindset, one that&amp;#8217;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;On the surface, international business expansion seems easier than ever. Today, any company can reach multiple markets in a matter of seconds: Publish a blog post, launch a mobile app, buy digital ads, and target customers in as many countries as you wish. The rise of online global marketplaces has made it even easier for companies to launch into multiple countries simultaneously, often from their earliest days. This has given rise to a wave of “global native” companies that have an international presence from day one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ian Harkin founded Lottie, a toy company based in Donegal, Ireland that manufactures Barbie doll alternatives with a child&#39;s dimensions instead of an adult&#39;s, he began with international markets in mind from the very start. “In the toy industry, with very high up-front development costs, it&#39;s difficult to justify the expense to launch in just one country,” he explains. Harkin, the company&#39;s CEO, integrated their storefront into Amazon, and immediately reached customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Sweden, and Poland. Nearly 100% of the company&#39;s revenue today comes from outside of Ireland. Harkin points out, “For us, going global early helped our product and brand reach more potential customers, much faster, than if we would have expanded one country at a time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This growing phenomenon of going global as early as possible in the life of a business isn&#39;t only happening with physical products that can launch via global platforms like Amazon or Etsy. Partners at Andreessen Horowitz have written about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2022/07/20/the-company-of-the-future-is-default-global/&quot;>;new wave of “default global” companies&lt;/a>;, which radically compress the timeframe it takes to go global. They contrast these with “default local” firms, which often take five years before operating in just a few foreign markets. The default global companies are often in double the number of markets as default local companies are by year three. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/newsroom/stories/global-natives&quot;>;research from Stripe&lt;/a>; shows that 89% of successful tech companies had expanded internationally prior to achieving “unicorn” status, a valuation of $1 billion or higher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But building a global company is also more nuanced and complex than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, even if you&#39;re already having success as a global company, it&#39;s time to raise the bar. To sustain your success for the long term, you&#39;ll need to build not just a company that has customers or revenue streams from many different countries, but one that operates as a globally equitable organization (GEO for shorthand).&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Rise of the Globally Equitable Organization &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When I ran international expansion efforts for HubSpot, a large public tech company, over the space of nearly eight years, I noticed this pronounced shift toward continuous expansion happening before my eyes. But I also observed another important trend at play in the broader market. In the past, companies that sought to expand internationally measured their success strictly using qualitative measures, usually in the form of revenue or customer count from new markets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, with global becoming the new default, the goal is no longer as simple as just increasing revenue share from between different parts of the world. Instead, the new measure is more customer-oriented in nature. Companies have realized that it&#39;s not enough to initially acquire new customers in other geographies — retaining them is critical, as this ensures that revenue can be sustained. The best global companies ask themselves: How successful can our local customers be with our business in each market, without geography getting in the way?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Teamwork, a project management software company headquartered in Cork, Ireland. “You can sell software from anywhere in the world from the get-go. There are no boundaries,” explains Peter Coppinger, Teamwork CEO and co-founder. “One of the biggest lessons we learned with Teamwork&#39;s international expansion is that once you reach a certain scale, you need to get more deliberate about targeting the regions with the most potential.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the company deepened its presence in specific markets, Coppinger and team found that they needed to ramp up sales and customer talent in order to support customers in new time zones. “There is no substitute for having staff in the same time zone speaking the same language as your target customer,” he points out. When Teamwork recognized some customers were feeling this pain, they were proactive about creating a more equitable experience for all customers. Today, the company has 20,000 customers in 170 countries, and a global workforce of 350 employees in 15 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make Local Customer Experiences Equitable, Not Identical &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the digital age, it&#39;s easy to go global without adapting the customer experience. But if companies fail to make sufficient adaptations, they miss the chance to build true connections of value with their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Making local experiences equitable doesn&#39;t mean they have to be identical. In fact, where many companies go wrong is that they try to enforce a cookie-cutter approach onto all markets, in the name of “global leverage.” But in doing so, they miss out on the importance of local adaptations that ensure their customers across markets are equally happy with the value they&#39;re receiving, even if they define and derive that value in different ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a shining example, look no further than Starbucks. At the product level, customers can order many of the same standard menu items in every location globally. But to appeal to local tastes, a customer in Peru, where the Lúcuma fruit grows, can order a Lúcuma Crème Frappuccino from their local barista. Starbucks adapts not only their physical products, but their digital outreach to customers too. They achieve global consistency offline as well as online, but the company customizes their digital marketing campaigns in each country tied to the seasons, holidays, and local traditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The table below offers some examples of adaptations a company might make in order to ensure it is providing an equitable experience to customers in a new market:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;!-- table start -- Ensuring a Globally Equitable Experience -- -->;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;h4>;Ensuring a Globally Equitable Experience&lt;/h4>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;The table below offers some examples of adaptations a company might make in order to ensure it&#39;s providing an equitable customer experience as it enters new markets around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;>; &lt;thead>; &lt;tr>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Customer experience area&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Current home market approach&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Initial local market approach&lt;/th>; &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;>;Why it&#39;s globally equitable&lt;/th>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/thead>; &lt;tbody>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Customer experience area&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MARKETING&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Current home market approach&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;A large website that has built up over the years with large amounts of content&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Initial local market approach&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;A microsite with just the core content that enables customers to understand the parts of your offering that matter most to them&lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;p>;Why it&#39;s globally equitable&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;You didn&#39;t create such a large website for your home market overnight, so you don&#39;t need to localize all of it.

While this is a natural inclination, it actually can have the opposite effect and require investments that are disproportional for each local market. Instead of doing “all things in all markets,” be selective and show a true willingness to adapt. Encourage your employees to flex their creative muscles when thinking about what strategy will work best for a new local market so that they can derive equal value, even if the approaches vary.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Ensure Your Organization Has a Globally Equitable Mindset&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving what I call a GLOBE mindset, one that&#39;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic.

Disintermediation is a sign that your customers don&amp;#8217;t think you are adding as much value as you think you are. Firms struggling with disintermediation can take simple steps to stop the bleeding before it&amp;#8217;s too late &amp;#8212; if they understand what&amp;#8217;s really taking place. They should consider six factors: urgency, rake, risk, skill, frequency, and modularity. The solution for disintermediation is quite simple: Create more value than you take.

The technical term for this is “disintermediation,” and examples of it include readers buying online rather than from bookstores, Upwork and ZBJ (China&#39;s Zhu Bajie) programmers contracting directly with clients, and Airbnb struggling not only with guests contracting directly with hosts, but also with some of its biggest professional hosts &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbnb-stock-falls-after-short-report-says-hosts-directly-compete-with-platform-173546532.html&quot;>;reportedly competing against it on new platforms&lt;/a>;. Disintermediation — and the failure to understand and address it — killed once thriving businesses like Borders books, Blockbuster movies, and Tower records. It&#39;s easy to understand why platform companies worry so much about being cut out of the loop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the thing, though: True disintermediation is rare. Most buyers and sellers don&#39;t cut out the middleman entirely, but rather find a new provider that cuts transaction costs or adds more value so that switching is a natural choice. Readers buy from Amazon, not authors directly. Movie watchers and song listeners don&#39;t buy from Hollywood studios or musicians but from Netflix and Spotify. Simply put, these are not atomic markets of many-to-many interactions. New centers of attraction (Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify) have re-intermediated the old ones (Borders, Blockbuster, and Tower).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The issue is that companies often misunderstand the problem: Disintermediation is a sign that your customers don&#39;t think you are adding as much value as you think you are. Just because you enabled the first transaction doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re entitled to take all the value from the second, the third, and subsequent transactions. The good news, however, is that firms that appear to be struggling with disintermediation can take simple steps to stop the bleeding before it&#39;s too late — if they understand what&#39;s really taking place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Predicting disintermediation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;How can a firm know when deals are sticky and when they will go somewhere else? At least six factors contribute to partners taking deals off your platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, &lt;em>;urgency&lt;/em>; reflects the need to solve a problem now, which helps keep the deal. A large platform that can address a need quickly is more valuable when urgency is high, in contrast to a single off-platform source that is high-quality but unavailable. For instance, the delivery app Drizzly provides on-demand alcohol for parties. A trip to the liquor store might cost less, but it requires advance planning or someone stepping out mid-party.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Rake&lt;/em>; is what a platform charges for facilitating a deal. The higher this fee, the more partners want to avoid it. Groupon&#39;s rake of nearly 50% &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/how-users-drive-value-in-twosided-markets(94885ed2-0e38-40e4-9388-35008ffcc834).html&quot;>;contributed to its plunge and plateau in stock value&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Risk&lt;/em>; is the danger that a deal goes badly. If a project is risky, then both buyers and suppliers prefer having the benefit of reputation systems, insurance, and mediation services the platform provides. Uber covers driver costs and holds riders accountable if riders throw up in the car.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Skill&lt;/em>; is the level of expertise required to perform the task. For low-skill jobs, the main issue is usually price, and a large pool of suppliers helps customers secure the best deal. That means platforms offer the best value for both the first and subsequent deals, as with E-Trade for example. But when a job requires high skill, platforms often only add value to the first deal, where the benefits of reputation systems truly matter. After that, buyers can cut out gatekeepers once they find a reliable supplier. For instance, Rocket Lawyer connects people with expert attorneys to help with legal issues. But once someone has found a reliable attorney, they no longer need the platform. And, they don&#39;t want to explain their situation all over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequent deals highlight related factors, &lt;em>;interaction frequency&lt;/em>;, or how often partners must communicate to complete the task, and &lt;em>;project modularity&lt;/em>;, or the degree to which a task can be divided into smaller, independent components. If a task requires repeated communication or it can be broken easily into separate parts, then buyers and sellers have multiple opportunities to &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4150094&quot;>;establish a relationship independent of the platform&lt;/a>;. On Upwork, for example, working through stages of website deployment — specification, design, coding, backend, test, etc. — gives parties a chance to reduce the rake on each stage. Then later stages can happen off-platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363193&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_VAN_ALSTYNE_DISINTERMEDIATION_FACTORS_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Broadly speaking, these six factors tell companies how to reduce the costs of &lt;em>;search&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;negotiation&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;risk&lt;/em>;, or &lt;em>;delivery&lt;/em>; associated with getting the deal to happen as distinct from producing the work itself. In economic terms, these are known as “transaction costs.” The platform&#39;s role is to lower them compared to the next best alternative. Understanding this principle gives executives control over the outcome even if the superficial attributes change. The platform helps orchestrate the deal, but the supplier actually produces the result, and if the buyer and supplier can handle the transaction costs more efficiently without the platform, then they will disintermediate the deal. Interestingly, the Chief Strategy Officer for Alibaba even defined a test for successful platforms as achieving “the nexus of lowest transaction costs.” Understanding disintermediation in this way then gives you the tools to prevent it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Preventing disintermediation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The solution for disintermediation is quite simple: Create more value than you take. Stop playing the role of toll-taking gatekeeper and start playing the role of value-adding partner. Either decrease transaction costs or increase value for buyers or suppliers, or both.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every platform interaction has a producer side and a consumer side. This is true regardless of whether the activity is a ride, a tweet, a stay, a product, a service, or a piece of art. The trick is to design appropriate carrots and sticks for both sides, with a heavy emphasis on carrots. Why are carrots better than sticks? Carrots &lt;em>;add value&lt;/em>; for keeping interactions on-platform, while sticks &lt;em>;add costs&lt;/em>; for taking interactions off-platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363192&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_VAN_ALSTYNE_DISINTERMEDIATION_CARROTS_STICKS_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Many platforms choose sticks because they are easier to implement or because they feel entitled to a certain level of profit. Sticks, however, do not engender goodwill among customers, service providers, freelancers, or developers. They include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Hiding supplier contact information to prevent direct communication. For years, Angies List (now Angi) hid home service provider contact information, which limited interactions and growth.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Bounties paid to buyers and suppliers who rat on the other side for proposing disintermediation.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Secret shoppers and secret sellers who make such proposals to test partner loyalty. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53948&quot;>;ZBJ&lt;/a>; used both bounties and secret shoppers when freelancers did not want to share large commissions with the platform.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Deplatforming, public shaming, and eventually legal action, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/business/apple-epic-games-appeal.html&quot;>;Apple tried&lt;/a>; when Fortnite tried to use its own system to facilitate payments rather than use Apple&#39;s system with its exorbitant 30% tax.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Carrots are far better because they show a commitment to creating value, which is the only real basis for capturing value. They include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Giving users software tools to enhance the production, delivery, quality, or consumption of the product or service. Instagram and Vimeo offer filters and image editing tools that not only reduce costs for producers but also help them create value for consumers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A variant of this strategy is to offer value-adding services. The freelance platform Upwork will provide project management for large contracts by partitioning it and farming out components to different subcontractors. 99Designs, a design contest platform, helps designers automate their billing, track their progress, and pay their taxes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Frequent buyer or frequent seller rewards. OpenTable gives buyers dining points that they can spend on restaurant meals, while CoachUp gives professional coaches volume discounts. Etsy rewards artists&#39; loyalty by showcasing their work.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Shifting monetization to the point where the platform adds the most value. ZBJ introduced an optional pricing model that shifts from a transaction fee to a subscription fee. Once the fee is paid for the first deal, suppliers&#39; costs for each new deal are zero. When further use of the platform is free, sellers prefer the benefits of automated tracking and billing that happens on-platform.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Insurance, which is one of the most successful benefits to both sellers and buyers. On the seller side, Airbnb insures hosts against fire, theft, and property damage. On the buyer side, Amazon offers free returns and money back guarantees.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Basic safety. Uber introduced a rider emergency help button that most taxis do not offer. When a freelance contract is based on an hourly rate, Upwork has provided monitoring software so that a client knows a programmer is coding and not perusing Facebook.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Introducing buyer and seller rating systems. Almost every major platform now uses some form of review to reduce the adverse selection of finding bad providers and the moral hazard that, having been paid, they might not deliver.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Ironically, these strategies do come with a challenge — a “disintermediation dilemma.” Strategies intended to add value can inadvertently lead to leakage. This occurs when tactics &lt;em>;do&lt;/em>; add value but only to the first interaction and not the second. Consider a five-star rating on a home cleaner or landscaper. Once contact is made and trust established, a platform that adds no further value will be disintermediated. This problem &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/why-some-platforms-thrive-and-others-dont&quot;>;doomed Homejoy&lt;/a>; within a few years of launch. Groupon, likewise, adds value to a first sale by providing group buying discounts for buyers and discovery for merchants. But then deals conclude off-platform at the merchant and its “leaky bucket” adds little value to later deals. Buyers just visit the merchants. By contrast, Meituan, a Chinese successor to Groupon, handles delivery through the platform, generates frequent buyer rewards, and helps merchants design new products and situate new stores. Increased volume increases benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disintermediation is a signal. What it really tells you is that you don&#39;t provide enough value after an initial match. You&#39;re taking more than your fair share. Disintermediation simply means someone else provides more value than you do. Instead, if you create more value than you take, you will attract deals rather than repel them.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 30 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Arrange Your Meeting Schedule to Boost Your Energy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/arrange-your-meeting-schedule-to-boost-your-energy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_29_1464685906.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Olena Koliesnik/iStock/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Most meeting advice focuses on how to make meetings more effective or how to cut down on the number of meetings you have altogether. But what about how to schedule your meetings alongside other work tasks to best manage your productivity? New research explores this question and finds that many people commit two key errors in organizing their schedules: stacking too many meetings together on the same day or pairing intense meetings with other intense tasks. Both strategies can actually diminish your ability to recharge and replenish during the day, which can be a detriment to your work. Instead, this article offers new tips for how to balance work and meetings and suggests questions you can ask yourself when planning your day.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/arrange-your-meeting-schedule-to-boost-your-energy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/arrange-your-meeting-schedule-to-boost-your-energy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Meetings remain a frequent challenge for most knowledge workers. While common advice and prior research often focuses on making meetings more effective or reducing the time we spend in them, there is another critical aspect rarely taken into account: the way we schedule and arrange our meetings on a daily basis. Scheduling can, however, aid or impede our energy and productivity at work, and thus warrants a closer look.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-61289-001&quot;>;our research&lt;/a>;, we investigate the impact of knowledge workers&#39; daily meeting scheduling, including how certain strategies may seem smart but can, in fact, unintentionally drain our own energy. Let&#39;s consider two examples.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taylor, a senior data specialist who leads a team of junior analysts, notices two meetings on his Thursday calendar — one with a vendor liaison and another with senior specialists from other departments. Then he realizes that he also needs to arrange some check-ins with his junior analysts. Should he squeeze in those extra meetings on Thursday alongside the existing two, or should he schedule them for Friday instead? He is tempted to stack the meetings on Thursday, so that he can save time and keep his Friday schedule “clean” to focus on his own portion of a project report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In another context, Minli, a seasoned software engineer and manager of a development team, faces two upcoming meetings this week. On Tuesday, she is scheduled to present to the strategic committee, a critical meeting with potential budget implications. The next day, she is tasked with an orientation session for new interns — a familiar and relatively easy duty. Alongside these meetings, Minli must also tackle her own technical work on two projects: one encountering some serious challenges, and the other nearly complete, needing only a few final touches. Should she work on the difficult project on Tuesday and handle the easier one on Wednesday, or reverse the plan? Minli leans towards the first option. By addressing the most demanding challenges on Tuesday, both in her meetings and her individual work, she anticipates a less stressful remainder of the week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taylor and Minli&#39;s approaches are common: compacting meeting schedules to save time, or pairing critical meetings with intense individual tasks on the same day to finish them as soon as possible. However, our research findings reveal that these strategies come with their own drawbacks, particularly when considering their impact on workday energy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We conducted two studies in which we tracked the daily work activities of over 400 full-time knowledge workers, some from technology companies and others from diverse industries involving intellectual work. Throughout the workweek, workers were surveyed at the middle and the end of each workday about their meetings, individual tasks, and other activities during the morning and the afternoon, as well as their energy levels at the end of each half-day period. Additionally, we drew insights into their work performance, including task performance and creativity, from their supervisors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We made two important discoveries. First, what impacts knowledge workers&#39; energy is not the sheer amount of time they spend in meetings, but the relative proportion of meeting time compared to what they spend on individual tasks. We found that, on a given day, the more time knowledge workers dedicate to meetings relative to their own individual tasks, the less they engage in small break activities (eg, a short walk, casual conversations, brief fun reading) to restore their energy during that day. The absence of such break activities, which are crucial for periodic replenishment, harms their workday energy. The impaired energy in turn has a negative impact on the knowledge workers&#39; task performance, creativity, and job satisfaction at work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Further, we discovered that, when structured appropriately, meetings and individual tasks can create what we call a “pressure complementarity effect” during the workday. Two complementary configurations — high-pressure individual tasks accompanied by a low-pressure meeting, or conversely, low-pressure individual tasks accompanied by a high-pressure meeting—can benefit a person&#39;s energy. For instance, on a day when a data specialist breezes through routine paperwork, she may find a high-stakes meeting where she pitches a new initiative energizing; conversely, on a day when she is wrestling with a high-pressure report, a low-pressure update meeting about the company&#39;s IT system can offer a needed respite for her energy. We found that this complementary effect is most pronounced when a knowledge worker has not yet been consumed by the day&#39;s demands, specifically during the morning rather than the afternoon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These research findings shed light on how Taylor and Minli&#39;s scheduling approaches might inadvertently undermine their workday energy, and they also reveal pathways for potential improvements. Taylor&#39;s decision to stack meetings on a single day creates a substantial imbalance in time between meetings and individual work on that day, which will likely reduce his engagement in short break activities crucial for his energy replenishment. Despite aiming to optimize his schedule, this approach may instead lead to energy depletion and reduced performance. A more balanced spread of meetings and individual tasks across the two days may enhance his energy and effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Minli&#39;s situation, her plan to tackle a difficult project and a critical meeting both on Tuesday could create undue pressure without sufficient opportunity for relief and restoration. Conversely, her Wednesday, filled with a low-pressure meeting and an easier project, may lack stimulation. If, instead, Minli can pair the more demanding individual tasks with the less taxing meeting on one day, and vice versa on the other day, she is more likely to sustain her energy throughout both days.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when faced with the challenge of scheduling your workday, particularly arranging meetings alongside individual tasks, consider the following:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Focus on the relative proportion of meeting time to individual work time on a specific day, not just the total hours spent in meetings.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A reasonable balance between meetings and individual tasks allows for essential breaks and energy replenishment throughout the workday. This approach requires not overloading a single day with many meetings, even if it may sometimes seem like a time-saving strategy. Managing the proportion of meeting time relative to individual work on a daily basis can enhance energy levels at work, thereby contributing to improved performance, creativity, and job satisfaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Design your workday to create complements between meetings and individual tasks.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Recognize the benefits of pairing high-pressure meetings with low-pressure individual tasks, or vice versa. Rather than clustering activities of the same pressure level into a single period, distribute challenging tasks and meetings across different days or different time segments of the day. This approach fosters proper pressure complementarity, thereby enhancing workday energy to facilitate better performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Adopt a more holistic approach to workday scheduling.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Rather than simply fitting a meeting or individual task into the calendar for its own convenience, consider the broader implications for your workday structure. Be mindful of how a scheduling decision may alter the arrangement pattern of your workday, potentially influencing your energy and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following questions might be useful in your planning process:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How will this scheduling decision impact the balance between my meetings and individual work time on this specific day?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Will adding this meeting to this specific segment of the day compress my individual work time too much, sacrificing essential breaks and replenishment?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Will this schedule lead to back-to-back high-pressure meetings and tasks in a single day? How can that be avoided?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is there a better spot in my schedule to place this meeting or task, facilitating a more effective mix of high-pressure and low-pressure work throughout the day?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;For knowledge workers, managing meetings is not merely about increasing effectiveness and time efficiency; it also calls for a strategic approach to everyday scheduling. This means considering daily meetings alongside individual tasks, both in terms of time allocation and how much pressure they will put on you. Being mindful of these aspects can help you steer clear of subtle scheduling traps and prevent unexpected drains on your energy and productivity. Indeed, by embracing a more holistic approach to meeting scheduling, you may transform the way you approach your workday, leading to a more balanced and fruitful arrangement of daily responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 29 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[No, SCOTUS Did Not Make Your Company&rsquo;s DEI Programs Illegal]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/no-scotus-did-not-make-your-companys-dei-programs-illegal]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_30hero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The most effective approach to DEI is also the best for controlling legal risk: Focus your DEI program on interrupting the bias that&amp;#8217;s constantly transmitted through basic business systems.

Harvard&lt;/em>;. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-puts-woke-corporations-law-firms-and-hospitals-on-notice-all-dei-programs-and-workplace-balancing-based-on-race-national-origin-and-sex-violate-the-law/&quot;>;blog post&lt;/a>; titled “America First Legal Puts Woke Corporations… on Notice,” America First Legal, an organization headed by former Trump advisor Stephen Miller, asserts that “all DEI programs” are now “illegal.” Miller offers pro bono legal help against “institutions perpetuating woke fascist bigotry against our fellow citizens.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is politics, folks; don&#39;t mistake it for law.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the most basic level, the Supreme Court&#39;s decision interpreted the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution, which does not typically apply to private employers. Also basic: Race-based employment decisions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964&quot;>;already were illegal under Title VII, a federal statute&lt;/a>;. That precludes practices like reserving hiring or promotion slots for people of color and using race as a tiebreaker.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/politics/affirmative-action-ban-states.html&quot;>;nine states&lt;/a>; already prohibit affirmative action based on race, typically based on their state constitutions. In California, where I live, Proposition 209 prohibited affirmative action based on race in state university admissions, state hiring, and state contracting nearly 30 years ago. I have never heard a whisper that Prop 209 makes DEI programs of private companies illegal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So commentary opining that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-06-22/supreme-court-affirmative-action-ruling-jeopardizes-corporate-diversity-too#xj4y7vzkg&quot;>;“corporations…[will] just shut down all their DEI work&lt;/a>;” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-06/yes-the-supreme-court-s-affirmative-action-ruling-really-does-affect-employers#xj4y7vzkg&quot;>;“corporate diversity efforts [are] in legal trouble”&lt;/a>; seems a bit hysterical.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only reason corporate DEI programs are implicated is because of a few sentences in Justice Neil Gorsuch&#39;s concurring opinion, which was joined only by Justice Clarence Thomas. Gorsuch&#39;s concurrence reaches far beyond the issues involved in the case at hand. It briefly discusses the federal statute prohibiting race and sex discrimination in employment, to signal to future plaintiffs that he would welcome future lawsuits against employers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So we&#39;re down to tea leaves and speculation about whether Justice Gorsuch might be able to assemble a Supreme Court majority down the road — particularly since lavishly financed conservative non-profits like America First Legal have promised future litigation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Cynthia Thomas Calvert of Workforce 21C, a human resources consultancy, notes that “&#39;reverse discrimination&#39; lawsuits by white employees already were increasing before the Supreme Court decision.” One employee was awarded &lt;a href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/duvall-v-novant-health-inc-5&quot;>;$3.8 million&lt;/a>;; in a second suit, a jury awarded &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-racism-philadelphia-manager-lawsuit-bfa9cd9a897dff402f8547f167455d10&quot;>;$25.6 million&lt;/a>;. These are big dollar amounts but a small number of lawsuits. And these awards may not survive: The first has been appealed and the second probably will be. Stay tuned.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plaintiffs challenging company diversity statements, or goals that a certain percentage of their workforce be people of color, need to show that the goal resulted in an “adverse employment action” that harmed their careers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/diversity-equity-dei-companies-blum-2040b173&quot;>;Employers will argue it did not&lt;/a>;, and will point out that courts give companies broad discretion to run their businesses as they see fit. All this can make these suits hard to win.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most effective approach to DEI is also the best for controlling legal risk: Focus your DEI program on interrupting the bias that&#39;s constantly transmitted through basic business systems. This is how most corporate DEI programs, which typically focus on trainings and tweaks to organizational systems to level the playing field, already work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How? Let&#39;s take an example of hiring bias found in one of the 25 bias interrupters experiments my team currently has in the field. We found that white men at a tech startup were being hired with much lower ratings than any other group. We also found that white men typically were rejected only if they had very low ratings. Candidates from other groups were rejected even when they had far higher ratings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tech start-up we&#39;re working with went from being reluctant to collect and analyze data to requiring all employees involved in hiring to take a workshop we developed on interrupting bias in hiring. Basing your DEI program on this kind of data can help change a company&#39;s climate. Metrics move mountains.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Collecting this data can also decrease legal risk because Title VII prohibits policies that create a disparate impact based on race or gender. No company wants to learn about this kind of problem only &lt;em>;after&lt;/em>; a plaintiff has sued for discrimination. Forewarned is forearmed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you have the data you&#39;ll need to fix any problems you find. Don&#39;t leave biased systems in place and then try to solve the problems you&#39;ve created by explicitly considering race at the last minute. Instead, follow basic precepts of industrial-organizational psychology by increasing structure. For example, CVs should be reviewed by ranking each candidate on predetermined competencies using a rubric and standardized scale. Then add in procedures designed to protect against the kinds of bias documented by experimental social psychologists. For example, keep track of when requirements get waived, and look for patterns. (Research shows that requirements typically are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610443913&quot;>;applied&lt;/a>; rigorously to out groups but leniently to in groups.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you do this, you will not fall afoul of the &lt;em>;Students for Fair Admissions&lt;/em>; ruling, because you are avoiding precisely what the majority opinion found so offensive: explicit racial preferences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Chief Justice Roberts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf&quot;>;noted in his opinion&lt;/a>;, Harvard&#39;s racial preferences led to a situation where a Black student in the fourth lowest academic decile had a higher chance of admission than an Asian American in the top decile. We have never, ever found anything like this at a company, and we have worked with scores of companies for over a decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The typical problem is epitomized by one telling statistic: In our database of nearly 20,000 people, 80% to 88% of white men report fair access to career-enhancing assignments while the percentage among women of color sinks as low as 50%. This is a recipe for a lawsuit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two final parts of the majority opinion hold messages for the corporate world. If you do want to hire a qualified person of color in a context where a reverse discrimination suit might ensue, the majority opinion tells you exactly what to say. &lt;em>;Students for Fair Admissions&lt;/em>; says that while one cannot give someone an automatic boost based on race, one can consider how a candidate overcame various life obstacles, including racial discrimination. Heads up that this is how to talk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final important part of the majority opinion is its discussion of stereotyping. Harvard&#39;s “admissions process rests on the pernicious stereotype that &#39;a black student can usually bring something that a white student cannot offer,&#39;” Justice Roberts wrote. “UNC is much the same. It argues that race in itself &#39;says [something] about who you are.&#39;” In the court&#39;s view, “it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This language has implications for another common DEI practice: employee resource groups (ERGs), or voluntary groups of employees who align around a shared identity. These groups reflect on the evidence-based-but-now-illegal assumption that (for example) Black employees tend to have a different experience than white employees at your company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The simple fix, according to Laura Maechtlen, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw LLP, to open up ERGs to anyone who supports the mission of the group. You should also make sure your ERGs have a mission statement, business goals, and rules that prevent people from joining the group simply to disrupt it. This is best practice anyway, because this approach can help reduce backlash and develop allies. If your ERG includes capacity building (such as leadership training), make sure that the training also offered in other contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the bottom line: Far-right advocates like American First Legal are pretending that &lt;em>;Students for Fair Admissions&lt;/em>; stands for a lot that it doesn&#39;t stand for. No harm, no foul: that&#39;s what advocates do. But don&#39;t mistake it for a serious assessment of legal risk. It isn&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
