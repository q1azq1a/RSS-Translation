&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/ 06/why-chief-data-and-ai-officers-are-set-up-to-fail?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/why -chief-data-and-ai-officers-are-set-up-to-fail?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;今年，首席执行官的角色已经很脆弱数据、分析和人工智能官 (CDO/CDAO/CDAIO) 变得更加不稳定。许多公司已经看到了离职和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/cios-meet-your-new-colleagues-chief-data-analytics-and-ai-officers-af6b58b9&quot;>;重新校准&lt; /a>; 企业数据和 AI 领导职责。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些角色仍然相对较新。 CDO 职位是为应对 2008 年至 2009 年的金融危机而在大型银行设立的，随后扩展到制药、医疗保健、消费品、娱乐和联邦政府等多种行业。 2012 年至 2023 年间，&lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62adf3ca029a6808a6c5be30/t/63a477e23d7f9162b7771d6b/1671722982363/WAVESTONE+NVP--+Data+%26+Analytics+Executive+Le adership+2023--调查+Findings.pdf&quot;>;根据调查数据&lt;/a>;，任命了 CDO 的公司从 12.0% 增长到 82.6%，随着时间的推移，职责范围扩大到包括分析 (CDAO) 和 AI (CDAIO)。然而，只有 35.5% 的大公司表示该角色是成功的并且已经确立，只有 40.5% 的公司表示 CDAIO 的角色在他们的公司内得到了很好的理解。显然，有些地方出了问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于一些数据和分析领导者来说，2023 年感觉像是回到了该角色最早的乏味日子：金融动荡和生成式 AI 的爆炸式增长迫使他们专注于防御风险和监管任务，而不是专注于增长、客户获取以及新产品和服务创造的前瞻性举措。企业领导层要求 CDAIO 部署 GenAI 的潜在变革能力，同时避免伤害——一种高压平衡行为与提供巨大风险和机遇的技术。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在越来越多的公司想要和需要 CDAIO，这个角色一如既往地具有挑战性——而且常常注定失败。公司可以采取以下五个步骤来解决这个问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;CDAIO 工作有什么问题？&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;作为合著者，我们是 CDAIO 兴起和发展的第一手见证者和参与者角色。二十多年来，Randy 一直担任领先公司的数据和分析使用顾问。 Allison 曾担任行业 CDO 五年，目前正在就如何实现商业价值向 CDAIO 和公司提供建议。虽然我们都同意这个角色让人感觉不可能，但我们也相信当前的迭代包括为更好、更有效的工作版本奠定基础。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一代首席数据官经常被聘用到大型公司医疗保健和金融等受监管行业的公司。最初，该角色被理解为侧重于控制和风险的防御性角色，而不是业务角色，尽管这两个功能使用相同的数据和分析技能。银行用来检测欺诈模式的交易数据也被用来发现现有或潜在的客户需求，但公司投资于前者而不是后者。随着重点转向数据商业化，公司往往将其视为技术和人才问题，而不是业务问题。他们在技术和人员方面投入了大量资金，建立了数据基础架构以及数据工程师和数据科学家团队，但没有足够重视业务关系的重要性和最关键的业务问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结果，公司最终并没有从他们的数据程序中得到他们想要的东西。虽然 91.9% 的公司报告说他们已经从对数据和分析的投资中获得了一些可衡量的价值，但只有可怜的 23.9% 的公司表示他们已经创建了一个数据驱动的组织，而更微不足道的 20.6% 的公司报告说已经建立了一个数据驱动的组织文化。 CDAIO 一直被那些需要巨额投资并涉及到公司各个角落的重大项目所困扰，但往往无法带来可衡量的收益。即使他们完全按照要求完成了任务，也很难说他们已经成功了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们认为有两个因素在很大程度上导致了这种情况：错误的重点和缺乏信任.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该角色的重点应该放在业务成果上，而不是技术和基础架构问题：确定您要为客户解决的问题，确定业务回报最高的用例的优先级，以及交叉授粉能力，无论目标是商业、风险控制，还是两者兼而有之。 “工作中最困难的部分是了解您要为客户解决什么问题，”Google 首席决策科学家、决策智能领域的先驱 Cassie Kozyrkov 说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;缺乏信任是一个等效因素。企业领导者需要相信他们在数据、分析和人工智能方面的投资正在带来业务回报——他们的钱花得值。如果没有明确交付商业价值，这种信任就会受到侵蚀，企业领导者将不愿进行进一步投资。 CDAIO，特别是在大公司中，已经建立了人员、政策、流程和管理模型的治理基础设施，以努力联合整个组织对数据的信任所有权。这些努力很复杂，通常不受欢迎，而且收益也难以量化。由于数字经济中的几乎所有问题都可以描述为数据问题，因此除非有商定的衡量进展的指标，否则很难取得胜利。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;如何解决&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;任何创新时代的进步都是断断续续的，而且很难衡量。可以公平地说，数据和业务战略错位，没有成为 C 级和董事会的优先事项，治理工作过于笨拙，无法广泛采用和衡量，而且纪律不完整。生成式 AI 的出现放大了这些问题，并引发了信任、质量和道德方面的新问题we-stop-the-singularity&quot;>;在新闻中&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/20/ai-existential-risk-debate/&quot;>;正在引起高管和董事会的关注&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公司可以而且必须解决他们管理数据、分析和 AI 的方式，并让 CDAIO 角色为成功做好准备。此要求只会扩展，尤其是当023 --Survey+Findings.pdf&quot;>;83.9% 的公司&lt;/a>;计划明年增加对数据、分析和人工智能的投资。以下是公司今天可以采取的一些具体建议，以修复 CDAIO 的角色并从他们的数据、分析和 AI 投资中创造商业价值：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;让数据成为每个人的业务。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然 CDAIO尽管长期以来一直在宣传数据素养的重要性，但在强有力的治理、政策和标准等实践方面的采用并不一致。数据最成熟和最严格的领域通常是财务和合规相关职能。在这些领域取得的成功，再加上 C 级和董事会的参与，可以作为企业的榜样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在全球能源管理和数字自动化领导者施耐德电气，Philippe Rambach 是首席人工智能官，谈到施耐德如何建立关乎每个人的企业文化：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;认真对待数据管理需要专门的组织。为了支持这一雄心壮志，我​​们决定从 IT 中提取数据，将数据集中在整个公司的治理、业务和绩效议程上。然后我们决定设立首席数据官和首席人工智能官这两个角色。以数据为中心的旅程的关键是努力在公司中拥有单一的事实来源，并使公司内的所有决策者都能轻松访问高质量的数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h3>;让业务领导者成为数据项目的支持者。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;业务领导者需要成为数据和分析投资的支持者和倡导者。成功的数据领导者是业务领导者的重要合作伙伴，他们开始依赖他们作为得力助手，提供关键数据和决策点，以推动成功的业务成果。 CDAIO 不应寻求强加议程（“数据和人工智能很棒；我们应该做得更多”），无论其用意多么好。寻找准备好在其业务线内支持数据和 AI 并通过建立可信度的结果成为值得信赖的合作伙伴的业务领导者。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;审查所有数据和 AI 投资以确保资金用得其所。&lt;/h3 >; &lt;p>;区分“最好拥有”和“需要拥有”投资。仅继续关注那些正在为组织提供可衡量的商业价值或可以在短期内展示快速实现价值的途径。公司必须重新将投资重点放在那些对发展和竞争至关重要且需要的能力上。数据分析和 AI 领导力需要时间、注意力、清晰有效的沟通以及讲故事的技巧来阐明需求、建立切合实际的期望并获得认可。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;转向生态系统思维方式。&lt;/h3 >; &lt;p>;要充分利用数据和人工智能，与供应商、大学和其他合作伙伴建立伙伴关系和协作非常重要。 Schneider 的 Rambach 补充说：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;竞争的新本质实际上与技术无关；人工智能技术发展得太快了。这是关于您为客户提供的价值。无论您提供什么价值，它都可以通过合作伙伴关系得到增强。我们为第三方创新开放我们的物联网平台，这样合作伙伴就可以使用我们的软件开发工具包开发新的应用程序来进行创新，以提高建筑物的效率和可持续性。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h3>;谨慎行事。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h3>;谨慎行事。&lt;/p>; h3>; &lt;p>;虽然生成式 AI 提供了改变游戏规则的机会，但 Rambach 重申了理解风险和谨慎行事的重要性，因为这些模型：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;…使公司面临新型漏洞，特别是通过让更多用户更轻松、更快速地访问更大量、更多样化的数据。现在是建立数据治理和网络安全措施以负责任地使用这些新功能的时候了。公司和用户应始终谨慎对待生成式 AI 并注重保密性，例如用户不应在可公开访问的 AI 聊天机器人平台上上传任何机密信息。 LLM 的安全/私有版本应该是首选。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;许多 CDAIO 领导企业委员会，其领导者来自风险、财务、技术、网络安全、法律/道德、隐私、人力资源和业务线。这些团队需要提高地位和问责制。公司还应在其公司董事会中增加数据、分析和人工智能专业知识。只有 23.8% 的人表示该行业在解决数据和 AI 伦理方面做得足够。如果不以负责任和有效的方式管理，AI 和数据隐私、治理和道德问题将对公司构成威胁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在许多公司都在认真审视 CDAIO 职能的时候，现在是数据和人工智能领导者必须站出来展示他们如何为公司的商业价值做出贡献的时候。那些对如何从数据和 AI 投资中创造商业价值有着清晰愿景的公司将是未来十年及以后最有可能取得成功的公司。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt; /div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 20 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Leading Through a Sustained Crisis Requires a Different Approach]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/leading-through-a-sustained-crisis-requires-a-different-approach]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/leading-through -a-sustained-crisis-requires-a-different-approach?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;5 月，世界卫生组织 &lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/health/covid-who-emergency-end.html&quot;>;宣布&lt;/a>; Covid-19 全球紧急状态结束。最后。但对于许多领导人来说，这一宣布并没有减轻他们背负的负担。虽然紧急情况已经结束，但危机并未结束。我们已经从大流行病到来的&lt;em>;突然&lt;/em>;危机转变为我们所说的&lt;em>;持续&lt;/em>;危机——一段持续存在的巨大困难和不确定性的时期。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;持续危机的麻烦在于，与突发危机不同，它的到来带有模棱两可的&lt;a href=&quot;/2006/11/facing-ambiguous-threats&quot;>;信号&lt;/a>;，而且没有明确的开始日期。结果，领导者，包括那些擅长处理突发危机的领导者，可能会错过当前需要做的事情。更糟糕的是，一些在突发危机中奏效的领导行为可能会加剧倦怠并限制在持续危机中的适应。我们已经确定了突发危机和持续危机之间的主要区别，以帮助领导者了解未来会发生什么，以及如何重新调整他们的组织，以便他们能够在这个新环境中取得成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;领导者当前面临的挑战&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;今天的领导者面临着 Covid 释放或暴露的许多相互交织的问题：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2023/02/07/new-outlook-on首先，-burnout-for-2023-limitations-on-what-managers-can-do/?sh=b969ee243430&quot;>;倦怠&lt;/a>;和沮丧的员工队伍。管理人员应对&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/5-challenges-of-hybrid-work-and-how-to-overcome-them&quot;>;混合会议&lt;/a>;并引入不可避免地&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/23161501/return-to-office-remote-not-working&quot;>;无法满足所有人&lt;/a>;都渴望清晰。教育领导者努力应对&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/school-shootings-database/&quot;>;学校枪击事件&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/01/07/1070969456/kids-are-back-in-school-and-struggling-with-mental-health-issues&quot;>;心理健康&lt;/a>;孩子之间的问题。城市领导人面临&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/04/24/downtown-revitalize-covid-office-vacancy-rates-housing-real-estate/&quot;>;空荡荡的市中心&lt;/a>;。清单还在继续。在许多方面，当前时刻并不比三年前袭击我们的意外事件容易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但它&lt;em>;&lt;/em>;不同。以 SickKids 的首席执行官 Ronni Cohn 为例，这是一家一流的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/worlds-best-specialized-hospitals-2022/pediatrics&quot;>;儿科专科医院&lt;/a>;。当 Cohn 于 2019 年开始担任首席执行官时，他为精准儿童健康设定了鼓舞人心的愿景。他所在的医院将利用来自儿童健康决定因素（基因、生物学、环境）所有领域的数据整合来显着推进儿科护理。这对儿科医生和著名遗传学家科恩个人来说意义重大。然后 Covid 来袭。可以理解，该计划不再是首要任务。三年后，就在他开始恢复自己的愿景时，流感季节加剧，再加上新冠病毒，再次使他的组织严重紧张。现在愿景的作用是什么？他疲惫不堪的员工需要什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他并不孤单。在一场持续的危机中，问题更加模棱两可，权衡取舍也不那么明确。激动人心的时刻已经过去了。储备已经耗尽。这就是当今如此需要领导力的原因：应对和应对持续危机带来的新挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;认识和阐明当今的不同之处——及其重要性&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;领导者必须帮助他们的团队理解突发危机和持续危机之间的对比，以培养在这个新领域取得成功的正确心态。考虑突发危机造成的紧急情况——需要立即采取行动的意想不到的、通常是危险的情况——比如 2020 年 3 月 Covid 死亡人数上升或 &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/07/leadership-lessons-from-the-chilean-mine-rescue &quot;>;2010 年智利矿山倒塌&lt;/a>;。一场突如其来的危机提出了限制伤害的&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/04/what-good-leadership-looks-like-during-this-pandemic&quot;>;明确的必要性&lt;/a>;。利害关系显而易见，时间有限。风险承受能力适当高，因为无所作为的风险显然更糟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;持续的危机是不同的。在困难重重、麻烦重重或充满不确定性的持续时期，首要目标是建立复原力，而不是防止直接伤害。赌注是微妙的，时间框架更长。随着人们试图在资源枯竭的情况下恢复审慎决策，风险承受能力逐渐下降。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人类的反应也不同：突发危机引发恐惧和对威胁的全神贯注。人们想知道：&lt;em>;我们会没事吗？&lt;/em>;在持续的危机中，持续的挑战让人们想知道：&lt;em>;为什么要麻烦？ &lt;/em>;意识到他们的世界发生了多么深刻的变化，人们渴望过去，可能会感到与世隔绝和随波逐流。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;从快速反应到有意主动&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p >;适用于突发危机的方法不适用于持续危机。在后者中，领导者必须练习有意识的主动性，而不是快速反应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于速度在紧急情况下至关重要，因此需要对影响每个人的问题进行集中决策。想一想 2020 年 3 月 CEO 做出关于在家工作的决定的速度。我们工作的哈佛大学校长在 3 月 13 日命令所有不需要在场的人（例如，病人护理）回家&lt;sup>;th&lt;/sup>;。是否进行虚拟教学&lt;em>;不&lt;/em>;由个别教师或团队决定。由于危机，所有人都接受了该决策的集中化和速度——这与以分布式自治和参与决策为常态的大学环境截然不同。果断和执行速度是最重要的。然后，当然，要由个人和团队来弄清楚如何使它全部正常工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天坚持这种方法是很诱人的。做出决定并指挥大胆的行动来解决问题感觉很好。但是，如果习惯将其带入一场持续的危机中，这种方法会使人们筋疲力尽并感到沮丧，同时养成优先考虑紧急事项而不是重要事项的习惯。而且，如果持续时间足够长，这些方法会破坏最初吸引许多领导者担任其角色的目的：对未来的令人信服的愿景。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比之下，在持续危机中，需要的是广泛的-规模化实验和地方决策，让人们参与广泛的优先事项，以分散的方式寻找新的解决方案，从而激发活力。更强调停下来学习、探索和实验，而不是简单地行动和快速行动。这并不是说突如其来的危机不需要试验。在大流行期间，许多组织通过前所未有的本地实验和学习水平幸存下来。但是重点指令是自上而下设定的，而且通常是没有商量余地的。例如，当一家医院取消择期手术时，工作人员会重新集中精力并进行试验，以弄清楚如何建立额外的肺部重症监护能力。随之而来的是实验和（有时是痛苦的）学习。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多领导者在突如其来的危机中似乎是天生的。控制感觉是对的。要知道何时以及如何摆脱这种方法更加困难。它需要判断力和深思熟虑。例如，在我们中的一个人 (Michaela) 最近与 Ronni Cohn 的谈话中，他反映说：“在大流行初期，我知道我必须成为这艘船的船长。现在，随着危机的演变和目前的演变，我扮演着多重角色。”他发现了这种转变并随之转变——想方设法在解决眼前需求的同时带回远大的愿景。他在组织的前线认真倾听并重建了积极主动的文化。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;在动荡的世界中领导&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们确定了三个关键的领导行动可以帮助每个人参与在动荡的世界中茁壮成长所需的持续学习。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;首先，引起人们对转变的关注&lt;/strong>;。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;因为持续的危机冗长且模棱两可，每个人（不仅是领导者！）很容易错过变化。明确声明是时候进行转变以超越员工的自动感知。这种赋予意义是一项核心领导任务。邀请您的人事经理停止说“这是计划”，而开始说“我们可以尝试通过以下方法了解在这个新环境中什么有效。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;其次，停止奖励救火&lt;/strong>;。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在突发危机中，紧急情况优先。但紧迫感可能会变成习惯，让许多团队气喘吁吁地匆忙通过议程项目，在紧急情况消退很久之后，这种方式会抑制问题和思考。领导者在打破这些习惯方面发挥着至关重要的作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;第三，拓宽视野。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;建立实验和改进的结构和流程，以吸引更广泛的群体的声音。海尔等一些组织已采取重大措施&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/11/the-end-of-bureaucracy&quot;>;扁平化组织&lt;/a>;，以保持快速执行，同时拒绝自上而下的命令。其他人追求流程转变（没有重大结构变化）以建立更广泛的参与，例如通过建立多元化团队来改进或重新设计工作流程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着动荡延伸到未来，通过协商流程重新吸引不同的声音至关重要.经过多年的紧急响应，在此期间指令方法必然优先，如今的领导团队必须有意识地改变他们的惯例并引入（或重新引入）分散和协作决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;新现实&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;今天，我们生活在一个动荡和不确定的世界中。 Covid 不是我们生活中唯一或最后的危机。从气候变化到大量银行倒闭，我们无需放眼未来。正如前美国财政部长和哈佛大学教授劳伦斯萨默斯最近&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/498398e7-11b1-494b-9cd3-6d669dc3de33&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;，“这是最我记得 40 年来我一直在关注这些事情。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这个新的现实中，识别和转换的能力突发和持续的危机是一项核心领导能力。伟大的领导者将善于在正确的时间选择正确的框架，并使用它来帮助他们的组织蓬勃发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 20 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Should You Start a Generative AI Company?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/should-you-start-a-generative-ai-company]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;许多企业家正在考虑创办公司，利用最新的生成式 AI 技术，但他们必须问问自己，他们是否具备在日益商品化的基础上进行竞争的能力模型，或者他们是否应该在利用这些模型的应用程序上进行区分。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06 /should-you-start-a-generative-ai-company?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>;

&lt;p>;今年，问我这个问题的企业家比其他任何人都多。生成式 AI 令人兴奋的部分原因在于它的优势似乎是无限的。例如，如果你已经设法创建了一个具有某种通用语言推理能力的人工智能模型，那么你就有了一种智能，可以适应各种新产品，这些新产品也可以利用这种能力——比如屏幕写作、营销材料、教学软件、客户服务等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，软件公司 Luka 构建了一个名为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://replika.com/&quot;>;Replika&lt;/a>; 的 AI 伴侣，它使客户能够与“人工智能朋友”进行开放式对话。由于这项技术非常强大，Luka 的管理人员开始收到入站请求，要求为希望改善聊天机器人客户服务的企业提供白标企业解决方案。最后，Luka 的经理使用相同的底层技术衍生出了企业解决方案和直接面向消费者的 AI 约会应用程序（想想 Tinder，但用于“约会”AI 角色）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在决定无论生成式人工智能公司是否适合你，我建议确定以下两个大问题的答案：1）你的公司会在基础模型上竞争，还是在利用这些基础模型的顶层应用程序上竞争？以及 2) 在高度脚本化的解决方案和高度生成的解决方案之间的连续统一体中，贵公司将位于何处？根据您对这两个问题的回答，这将对您在竞争中保护自己的能力产生长期影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;基础模型还是应用程序？&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;科技巨头现在正在租赁出他们最通用的专有模型——即“基础模型”——像 Eluether.ai 和 Stability AI 这样的公司正在以极低的成本提供这些基础模型的开源版本。基础模型正在变得&lt;em>;商品化&lt;/em>;，只有少数初创公司有能力在这个领域竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您可能认为基础模型最有吸引力，因为它们将被广泛使用它们的许多应用将为增长提供有利可图的机会。更重要的是，我们生活在激动人心的时代，一些最复杂的 AI 已经可以“现成”使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;想要将公司建立在基础模型之上的企业家正在不过，这是一个挑战。与任何商品化市场一样，能够生存下来的公司是那些以低价提供非捆绑产品或提供日益增强的能力的公司。例如，Deepgram 和 Assembly AI 等语音转文本 API 不仅相互竞争，而且还通过提供更便宜的非捆绑解决方案与亚马逊和谷歌等公司竞争。即便如此，这些公司仍在价格、速度、模型准确性和其他功能方面展开激烈的竞争。相比之下，亚马逊、Meta 和谷歌等科技巨头进行了大量的研发投资，使他们能够在图像、语言和（越来越多的）音频和视频推理方面不断取得前沿进展。例如，它是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/13/chatgpt-and-generative-ai-are-booming-but-at-a-very-expensive-price。 html&quot;>;估计&lt;/a>; OpenAI 花费了 2 到 1200 万美元来计算训练 ChatGPT——这只是他们提供的几个 API 之一，还有更多 API 正在开发中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与其竞争在日益商品化的基础模型上，大多数初创公司应该通过提供利用其他公司基础模型的“顶层”软件应用程序来区分自己。为此，他们可以根据客户解决方案独有的高质量专有数据集微调基础模型，为客户提供高价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，营销内容创建者，&lt;em >;Jasper AI，&lt;/em>;主要通过利用 OpenAI 的基础模型成长为独角兽。时至今日，该公司仍在使用 OpenAI 帮助客户为博客、社交媒体帖子、网站副本等生成内容。同时，该应用程序为其营销人员和撰稿人客户量身定制，提供专门的营销内容。该公司还提供其他专业工具，例如多个团队成员可以协同工作的编辑器。既然该公司已经获得了牵引力，那么它可以在未来花费更多的资源来减少对基础模型的依赖，而基础模型正是这些基础模型首先使它能够实现增长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于顶层应用程序are where these companies find their competitive advantage, they lie in a delicate balance between protecting the privacy of their datasets from large tech players even as they rely on these players for foundational models. Given this, some startups may be tempted to build their own in-house foundational models. Yet, this is unlikely to be a good use of precious startup funds, given the challenges noted above. Most startups are better off leveraging foundational models to grow fast, instead of reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;From Scripted to Generative&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Your company will need to live somewhere along a continuum from a purely scripted solution to a purely generative one. Scripted solutions involve selecting an appropriate response from a dataset of predefined, scripted responses, whereas generative ones involve generating new, unique responses from scratch.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scripted solutions are safer and constrained, but also less creative and human-like, whereas generative solutions are riskier and unconstrained, but also more creative and human-like. More scripted approaches are necessary for certain use-cases and industries, like medical and educational applications, where there need to be clear guardrails on what the app can do. Yet, when the script reaches its limit, users may lose their engagement and customer retention may suffer. Moreover, it is more challenging to grow a scripted solution because you constrain yourself right from the start, limiting your options down the road.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, more generative solutions carry their own challenges. Because AI-based offerings include intelligence, there are more degrees of freedom in how consumers can interact with them, increasing the risks. For example, one married father tragically committed suicide following a conversation with an AI chatbot app, Chai&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; that encouraged him to sacrifice himself to save the planet. The app leveraged a foundational language model (a bespoke version of GPT-4) from EluetherAI. The founders of Chai have since modified the app to so that mentions of suicidal ideation are served with helpful text. Interestingly, one of the founders of Chai, Thomas Rianlan, took the blame, saying: “It wouldn&#39;t be accurate to blame EleutherAI&#39;s model for this tragic story, as all the optimization towards being more emotional, fun and engaging are the result of our efforts.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is challenging for managers to anticipate all the ways in which things can go wrong with a highly generative app, given the “black box” nature of the underlying AI. Doing so involves anticipating risky scenarios that may be highly rare. One way of anticipating such cases is to pay human annotators to screen content for potentially harmful categories, such as sex, hate speech, violence, self-harm, and harassment, then use these labels to train models that automatically flag such content. Yet, it is still difficult to come up with an exhaustive taxonomy. Thus, managers who deploy highly generative solutions must be prepared to proactively anticipate the risks, which can be both difficult and expensive. The same goes for if later you decide to offer your solution as a service to other companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because a fully generative solution is closer to natural, human-like intelligence, it is more attractive from the standpoint of retention and growth, because it is more engaging and can be applied to more new use cases.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;strong>;&lt;br>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many entrepreneurs are considering starting companies that leverage the latest generative AI technology, but they must ask themselves whether they have what it takes to compete on increasingly commoditized foundational models, or whether they should instead differentiate on an app that leverages these models.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They must also consider what type of app they want to offer on the continuum from a highly scripted to a highly generative solution, given the different pros and cons accompanying each. Offering a more scripted solution may be safer but limit their retention and growth options, whereas offering a more generative solution is fraught with risk but is more engaging and flexible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We hope that entrepreneurs will ask these questions &lt;em>;before &lt;/em>;diving into their first generative AI venture, so that they can make informed decisions about what kind of company they want to be, scale fast, and maintain long-term defensibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 19 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Advance Your Career When Your Company Is Downsizing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-advance-your-career-when-your-company-is-downsizing]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_14_I6JrdSA3DwE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Simone Hutsch/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Advancing your career during a company downsizing requires a shift in your mindset and actions.

In the last year, her team had doubled in size, thanks in large part to her ability to shepherd them through turbulent change and push through a number of important supply-chain initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Marlow&#39;s results and dedication had positioned her for an exciting opportunity — a newly created role as the vice president of process optimization. A promotion was a goal she had set her sights on and represented a chance to make an even greater impact while shaping the future of the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Unfortunately, just as Marlow was on the cusp of this major career move, the market took a downturn and the company&#39;s profits quickly plummeted with it. In the face of economic challenges, difficult decisions had to be made. Marlow&#39;s once flourishing team was cut in half, and to make matters worse, the vice president role she had been eagerly anticipating was dissolved. She found herself at a crossroads, questioning how to move forward when her aspirations were &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/what-to-do-when-youre-passed-over-for-an-internal-position&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;seemingly derailed&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Many leaders and professionals find themselves in Marlow&#39;s position — feeling disheartened and &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/how-to-deal-with-layoff-anxiety&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;uncertain&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; as to how to advance their careers as their companies downsize.

While that can mean devastating changes like spending freezes and job cuts, it doesn&#39;t have to doom your career prospects. In fact, it can be a springboard for growth. Here&#39;s how to navigate the disruptions that come with cost-cutting measures and emerge stronger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Reframe your thinking.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Experiencing a range of emotions — sadness, anger, &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/stop-being-so-hard-on-yourself&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;self-doubt&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; — is natural during times of organizational turmoil. But shutting down, avoiding the situation, and feeling sorry for yourself will get you nowhere and only leave you feeling stuck. Instead, embrace change and uncertainty as part of the job description.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Whether the cause is technological advancements, shifting market dynamics, or evolving customer expectations, companies are restructuring &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2022/01/recent-trends-in-corporate-debt-and-reorganizations-laying-the-groundwork-for-future-large-chapter-11-cases-or-just-more&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;at a rapid pace&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;. You have to be ready for transitions both big and small at any moment. Hard times reveal your character and where your leadership is needed most.

Change can be unsettling, and that&#39;s why stability becomes crucial. Align your efforts with the company&#39;s new priorities, which typically include a focus on core offerings, cost containment, and operational efficiency, as well as employee and customer retention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Despite the setbacks she faced, Marlow quickly recognized the importance of reducing costs during the downturn and having a laser-like focus on key business areas. Marlow realigned her team&#39;s efforts towards essential operations only. Tabling several innovation projects was a hard decision, but Marlow&#39;s shrewdness caught the eye of senior management, who appreciated her display of strategic prioritization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Look for quick wins.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;During turbulent times, everyone is looking for a savior. It&#39;s likely that morale and confidence are rattled up and down the chain, from junior employees all the way up to the C-suite. By identifying — and quickly acting on — areas for improvement, you can position yourself as a valuable asset, someone who gets results while keeping the company&#39;s best interests at heart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Look for ways to make a tangible impact in a small amount of time. For example, you could:&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;br>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Renegotiate a supplier contract&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Find a cheaper way to source materials&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Collaborate with another department to conserve resources&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Implement automation to streamline a process&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Launch your product to an untapped customer segment&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Develop a campaign to boost repeat purchases&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Negotiate for later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;After the VP role was dissolved, Marlow explained to her manager that she understood the company&#39;s financial constraints and why the process optimization role that she had been looking forward to was dissolved. Then she proposed a way forward balanced the organization&#39;s needs while keeping her long-term goals in mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“While I understand that major changes might not be possible right now, I wanted to discuss the possibility of revisiting my scope down the road,” she said. “I could take on X responsibilities now, but with a commitment to explore opportunities in the process optimization domain in the future when the market improves.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Like Marlow, you also want to read the room. Right now might not be the time to ask for a major change to your role, responsibilities, or compensation, but you can try to get a commitment for later. For example, “I&#39;m happy to take on X right now, as long as there is a commitment to revisit my scope down the road.” Or “I want to help, but my ultimate goal is to go in Y direction. When do you think you could make this happen?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Make a sideways move.&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;While up-and-to-the-left career advancement may be limited during a downsizing, lateral moves can still provide opportunities to learn new skills and gain new experiences. A sideways move allows you to broaden your skill set, which enhances your versatility and makes you a more valuable asset to the organization. Suppose you&#39;re in a sales role. A sideways move to the product development team can give you a deep understanding of the product development process, market research, and customer needs analysis. Offering your sales insights means the company can better align their offerings with market demands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Moving laterally also exposes you to new colleagues and expands your professional network. This can open the door to collaboration on future projects, mentorship opportunities, and access to a wider range of knowledge about internal politics. Plus, it exposes you to new stakeholders, decision-makers, and senior leaders. The more people you know — &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/what-to-do-when-your-hard-work-is-being-overlooked&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;and the more people that know you&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; — the more opportunities will come your way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Advancing your career during a company downsizing requires a shift in your mindset and actions. By adopting these strategies, you can turn adversity into a stepping stone for professional growth.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 19 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Will AI Replace the Front Office in Pro Sports?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/will-ai-replace-the-front-office-in-pro-sports]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_16_516776669.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Gizelka/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;With accurate player-availability predictions for all active players, AI-powered decision-making is dramatically improved around three dimensions: 1) Risk management: If a productive wide-receiver is likely to get hurt, for example, a team might invest more in talented backups, to minimize drop-off in team performance during injury. 2) Training and targeted interventions: If AI suggests a player is injury-prone, teams can target that player with customized training, nutrition, or other regimens to reduce the likelihood of injury. Alternatively, a team might choose to reduce a player&amp;#8217;s workload, also reducing risk. 3) Personnel decisions: By identifying factors that predict injury or other unavailability, teams can draft, trade for, or otherwise acquire players that they believe are more likely to be available season-long. Additionally, teams may choose to trade players for whom injury seems likely.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/will-ai-replace-the-front-office-in-pro-sports?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/will-ai-replace-the-front-office-in-pro-sports?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;March 15, 2023, marked the official beginning of the National Football League&#39;s new season. It also meant the start of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/nfl-free-agency-tracker-2023-top-players-signings-start-time-cap-space&quot;>;free agency period&lt;/a>;, when teams make deals with players no longer under contract with their former teams; each new contract can literally mean millions of dollars of a team&#39;s budget.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it&#39;s critical to get recruiting right. Like any business, NFL executives and leaders of other professional sports teams must make decisions about how best to allocate their limited budgets, placing informed bets on the ROI they will gain from assets (players, in this case), including as related to expected performance (on and off the field), future injuries, and other factors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what if this year, AI could tell us how many games a player has left in their career, how many points they will score next season, or whether they will suffer a major injury in the near future?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While free agency and other recruiting mechanisms have been around for decades, &lt;em>;how &lt;/em>;decisions about players get made is changing rapidly. Specifically, the application of AI-based technologies to massive sets of sports data is enhancing the front office&#39;s ability to make decisions about players — whom to recruit, develop, bench, or trade. And it will change the workings of all pro sports, permanently.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But will AI replace the front offices of sports teams anytime soon?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While this new technology is definitely augmenting human decision-making, we don&#39;t see it replacing general management teams in the near future — in sports or other businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Game-Changing Predictive Power&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Amid a large, growing number of AI-based sports-focused offerings, some are aimed are helping team decision-makers with predictions about athlete injury and longevity. Knowing the likelihood of injury within a specific time frame has a large impact on recruitment, as teams would naturally aim for players expected to remain injury-free longer. Industry executives have always had some experience-based intuition for factors that go into injury, such as time and “mileage” on the field. Sometimes these predictions hold true, but often they don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference now is that AI can back up some conventional wisdom — in the NFL for instance, a wide-receiver over 30 years of age is more prone to injury and other challenges, for example — but can also provide much more specific estimates of likelihood of injury or diminished performance, and what that means for a given player&#39;s availability and what that might cost the team. One company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://probility.ai/&quot;>;Probility AI&lt;/a>;, claims 96% accuracy in predicting which players will miss time next season. Executives can use these results to go from “I think this is probably an important factor” to “I know this is an important factor and can estimate its impact and cost with unprecedented confidence.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI-generated insights go well beyond existing ones or those backed by intuition. For example, Probility AI trained its injury-prediction models on data from specific NFL teams, along with other public and private data sources, to understand the impact of factors like where a given player went to college, combinations of head and assistant coaches they played under, and consequent practice and workload demands. While these nascent insights warrant further research, they show how deep AI can go in its predictive analyses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, instead of general managers trying to secure the very best wide-receiver overall, they can find the best receiver &lt;em>;for their team,&lt;/em>; based on AI predictions of future injuries and performance. Since players typically have different predicted career lengths and performance outcomes with different coaches, field conditions, or teammates, this creates an arbitrage situation whereby player market value varies depending on which team the player plays for.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Multiple NFL teams are deploying AI technologies from Probility AI and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/03/18/how-the-nfl-is-using-ai-to-evaluate-players/&quot;>;other sources&lt;/a>;, with good reason: failing to do that would put them at a disadvantage against their AI-equipped peers. Of course, such models are also being used in other sports such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2022/12/22/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-competitive-edge-in-sports/&quot;>;soccer and basketball&lt;/a>; to generate value, and across business sectors to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/11/21/the-top-five-ways-ai-is-transforming-business/?sh=139d9da98e7f&quot;>;enhance activities&lt;/a>; including informing decisions, boosting productivity, and serving customers better.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Augmentation, Not Replacement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;So as AI gains predictive capabilities across key dimensions of sports — injuries, trade timing, others — will it replace the front office?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, no. For now, think of AI as &lt;em>;augmenting&lt;/em>; human decision-making. It won&#39;t replace executives but help them make better decisions, especially in areas where human error and bias are more likely, such as basing recruiting largely on intuition and doing “what worked before.” Where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/02/moneyball-is-dead-long-live-moneyball/&quot;>;Moneyball movement&lt;/a>; of the last 20 years has been about using player statistics in a much more rigorous, systematic way, AI uses deeper learning to make even better predictions about performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With accurate player-availability predictions for all active players, decision-making is dramatically improved around three dimensions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Risk management: &lt;/strong>;If a productive wide-receiver is likely to get hurt, for example, a team might invest more in talented backups, to minimize drop-off in team performance during injury.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Training and targeted interventions: &lt;/strong>;If AI suggests a player is injury-prone, teams can target that player with customized training, nutrition, or other regimens to reduce the likelihood of injury. Alternatively, a team might choose to reduce a player&#39;s workload, also reducing risk.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Personnel decisions:&lt;/strong>; By identifying factors that predict injury or other unavailability, teams can draft, trade for, or otherwise acquire players that they believe are more likely to be available season-long. Additionally, teams may choose to trade players for whom injury seems likely.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Savvy executives will also integrate injury prediction into financial decision-making. That is, AI not only generates predictions on player availability, but can input those predictions in a financial decision-making engine, enabling team leaders to create granular metrics on expected productivity per dollar spent. For instance, a running back who is predicted to play in only 50% of games in a given year becomes, functionally, twice as expensive as a similar-cost one who could play every game. By considering price paid per outcome (yards gained, tackles made, points scored, others), teams can allocate their dollars in a maximally efficient manner, optimizing on productivity for each dollar spent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the technology by itself isn&#39;t enough. While software can analyze player engine and resource allocation, sports executives&#39; judgment and risk tolerance must eventually choose among inevitable tradeoffs and dictate the decisions made. We share more on this in the last section.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Still, AI is an absolute game-changer in professional sports and is replacing informal or even statistics-based decision-making as the engine of a comprehensive system fueled by big data and unprecedented predictive power.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s easy to see how better predictions — generated by AI — would have massive impact on any business. A close analogy here would be predicting when worker performance in labor-intensive industries like construction may suffer, or when large equipment like that powering manufacturing plants or refineries would malfunction or fail and taking preventative steps before a costly incident. The approach would apply to any business with aging resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More broadly, predicting demand for anything from clothing to corn would enable business leaders to make better decisions about production, including as related to supply chain and other areas. Other AI-based algorithms could make predictions about competition. The list goes on, and AI already has been applied in these and other ways across sectors, helping to explain why AI startups received &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/artificial-intelligence-trends-2023-business-healthcare-2023-1&quot;>;nearly $1.4 billion in funding&lt;/a>; in 2022.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t Go Out of Bounds&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Of course there are limitations to using predictive AI, further reinforcing the idea of augmentation versus replacement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With regard to predicting NFL injuries, for example, while new technology can guide decisions about recruiting, trades, and how much to pay a given player, the coaching team has to think strategically about the whole-team dynamic. The AI may tell you it&#39;s time to replace an injury-prone running-back with a player with a given profile, but an executive will have to think about how best to integrate the new recruit into the team. Total risk, after all, is spread out across all the players and their interactions. Here, too, AI is getting better at understanding the big picture of teams and its implications, starting with sports with smaller starting-team sizes, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/artificial-intelligence-makes-it-faster-easier-analyze&quot;>;hockey&lt;/a>;, which puts no more than six players on the ice at a given time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, it&#39;s important to understand that AI-based offerings aren&#39;t providing a definitive “answer” but making a prediction with a confidence interval around it. That interval will shrink as the technology improves, but there will always be some looseness related to prediction and that&#39;s, again, where human judgment is critical.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, AI is definitely a game-changer for sports, giving front offices and coaches unprecedented predictive power to make an increasing range of decisions with large implications for performance and returns, giving players insights to extend their careers, and keeping more player playing, which is thrilling the fans. But it&#39;s still a story of augmentation, one where leaders, using new technologies to inform their experience-based intuition, must make strategic calls the best they can and maintain accountability for what happens on the field and the balance sheet.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 16 Jun 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Scale Local Innovations in Big Companies]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-scale-local-innovations-in-big-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_16_1157569960.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Magnetic-Mcc/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;All too often innovations &amp;#8212; including new products, new HR policies to attract and retain talent, and new production processes &amp;#8212;developed in one part of a business stay there. Other groups that could benefit from them don&amp;#8217;t know they exist. This leads to lost revenues and higher costs, since teams around the world often end up duplicating (or triplicating, or quadruplicating) investments in solving common problems. This article identifies three common obstacles to scaling innovations and describes a way to overcome them.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-scale-local-innovations-in-big-companies?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-scale-local-innovations-in-big-companies?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The business advantages of scale and scope are widely recognized, but large, global enterprises often fail to fully realize them when it comes to innovation. Innovations that are developed in one geographic region or business unit — new products to delight customers, new HR policies to attract and retain talent, new production processes that drive efficiency gains — too often stay within them instead of being disseminated across the enterprise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider the experience of a global consumer packaged goods company, and three of its regional business units. (Innosight was an advisor to the company). Region 1 had developed a new brand targeted at younger consumers, who were increasingly seeking healthier products. Region 2 had changed its production processes in ways that increased profitability. And Region 3 had developed new sustainability focused business models. For reasons we&#39;ve seen time and again, regions that could have imported these innovations dismissed them, or worse, were simply unaware of them, as they innovated in silos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not everything needs to scale globally. Local innovations for local markets matter. But there are meaningful downsides of not scaling the great many innovations that are born locally but do have significant global potential. These include lost revenues, since a new product originating in one region could be sold to customers in others, and higher costs, since teams around the world often end up duplicating (or triplicating, or quadruplicating) investments in solving common problems. The CEO of McDonald&#39;s, Chris Kempczinski, highlighted this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/mcdonalds-shutters-us-offices-ahead-of-layoffs-report/448927&quot;>;a recent memo&lt;/a>;, in which he noted that insufficient collaboration across regions meant that “we are trying to solve the same problems multiple times, aren&#39;t always sharing ideas, and can be slow to innovate.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other disadvantages arising from insufficient global scaling are less obvious but also really matter. When regional businesses that started out with similar product portfolios don&#39;t share innovations and instead evolve in isolation of one another, those portfolios become more divergent over time. This leads to a proliferation of product lines, which makes it more difficult for the corporate center to optimally allocate resources, and for shareholders to value the company and understand its growth prospects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three common obstacles to scaling innovations from one to many markets. To illustrate both the obstacles and the solutions for overcoming them we&#39;ll use the case of a global retail bank, which Innosight advised.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Fallacies about Local Uniqueness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Though every region is different, local leaders tend to overestimate the singularity of their markets, their customers, and the conditions under which they operate. But often, new products and other innovations — and the capabilities and learnings that come from their development — are much more transferable than they assume, in particular when they are aligned with innovation priorities that are shared across regions. An innovation priority, or “strategic focus area,” is essentially a broad hunting ground for innovation. At the consumer goods company, for example, one innovation priority was packaging, which led to specific innovations in materials and size and format.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s turn to the bank. One of its regional units had made significant investments in developing a digital mortgage-application platform that further automated its mortgage-application process to make it faster and more consumer friendly. Though mortgages were an important product line across regions, most were reluctant to consider adopting this innovation, contending that the distinct ways that mortgages were regulated within their individual markets made it unfeasible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regulatory frameworks do vary from country to country, of course, but not in ways that precluded this innovation from being widely adopted, since the implementation of the platform could be adapted to address differences in regulatory requirements in each market, much in the same way that existing mortgage-application processes were customized to local markets. What&#39;s more, the platform was consistent with innovation priorities shared across regions, including digitizing and improving customer experiences across existing product journeys and increasing the profitability of mortgage lending.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To overcome this obstacle, the bank&#39;s central corporate strategy team facilitated a process to identify common innovation priorities across regions. First, regions were asked to define their individual innovation priorities in a standard way (for example, “new ecommerce payment and financing solutions”), identify the associated target customer segment, the customer problems to be addressed, and the broad types of technologies and capabilities required. Each of the bank&#39;s four regions defined between five and 10 innovation priorities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corporate strategy team then facilitated a series of discussions among senior leaders of each region to compare and identify commonalities in their innovation priorities. This surfaced multiple priorities that were shared across all four regions. In addition to those related to the mortgage-application platform, they included the development of new mobile-only products for millennial and Generation Z consumers and reduction of call center use and wait times.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Innovations aligned with those priorities could then be identified as sharable, no matter where they originated. Awareness of common innovation priorities among teams across regions also led &lt;a href=&quot;/2000/01/communities-of-practice-the-organizational-frontier&quot;>;communities of practice&lt;/a>; among designers and product developers to emerge organically. These convened regularly to exchange ideas, disseminate learnings, and co-create new innovations consistent with those shared priorities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Misaligned Incentives and Culture&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Various formal and informal disincentives are another obstacle to scaling innovations. For example, regional leaders&#39; bonuses are typically based on their own unit&#39;s P&amp;amp;L performance, which can make them reluctant to spend time, energy, and resources on exporting an innovation that will benefit another region. Conversely, a “not invented here” mindset can make managers reluctant to import externally generated ideas.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bank&#39;s bonus plans significantly penalized local leaders who missed ambitious profitability targets. This made them reluctant to dedicate resources to exporting innovations. In addition, a “not invented here” mindset was widespread — from regional leaders who wanted to prove their ability to innovate independently to developers who preferred to write their own code rather than use the software developed by peers in other regions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To address these issues, the bank offered P&amp;amp;L relief to regions on a case-by-case basis, allowing them to deviate from profitability targets without risking their bonuses so that they could invest their own resources into scaling innovations for the benefit of other regions. It also established a central fund and team to support global scaling efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regions that were developing innovations that could address shared priorities were invited to submit short “global scaling resource requests” that summarized the additional investments required to scale them to other regions beyond just their own. The request could be to cover the cost of building a product in a way that made it operable across global technology environments, for example, or the team hours required to train and support users in other regions and the potential in-year P&amp;amp;L tradeoffs or broader operational challenges that would result.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A global scaling committee, comprised of corporate C-suite leaders and central strategy and finance executives, decided which requests to approve. Most resource requests submitted to scale innovations that addressed shared priorities were approved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bank&#39;s corporate leaders also tried to change attitudes by publicly celebrating both managers who shared their region&#39;s innovations and those who adopted those created by others. They spotlighted global scaling initiatives in all-day quarterly business-review sessions attended by top regional executives, where exporting and importing regions jointly discussed the innovations and the process of scaling them. The bank&#39;s leaders also highlighted such innovations and the teams involved in these efforts in company newsletters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the bank&#39;s leaders encouraged and frequently reminded regional managers to ask themselves a series of questions before dismissing potential innovations developed by other regions. They included:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Could we better serve the customers we have or seek by adopting this innovation?&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;If the innovation isn&#39;t specific to one or more of our local circumstances — for example, if it has been developed in the context of a different technological, regulatory, or competitive environment, or requires a means of production or distribution that we lack — could it be adapted?&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;And might we be guilty of having a “not invented here” mindset if our first instinct is to dismiss this innovation?&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Lack of Transparency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As we mentioned, one major reason that business units don&#39;t share innovations and instead often duplicate efforts is a lack of awareness of what one another has developed or is undertaking. One way to address this is by creating a central mechanism that makes it easy for regions to share knowledge of their innovation pursuits from their earliest stages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider one innovation priority shared by all the bank&#39;s regions that we mentioned: developing mobile-only products for millennials. Innovations consistent with this priority across regions included distinct payment, savings, and investment products; new product features like roundup savings and cashback and rewards; innovations to streamline customer journeys within mobile-only apps, and integration with budgeting and bill-splitting tools that appealed to the millennial audience. But regions lacked awareness of each other&#39;s efforts and were in some instances even duplicating spend on development of the same things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bank addressed this issue in two ways: by establishing the process for identifying common innovation priorities across regions that we previously described and by instituting an innovation-portfolio-management system to profile and track innovations. Regions were required to enter into the IT system a description of each innovation project, including the associated innovation priority, the target customer segment, its revenue potential, and anticipated investment requirements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond supporting global scaling, the system helped each region better understand and manage its own innovation pipeline. When it surfaced instances of regions unknowingly duplicating each other&#39;s efforts, they were able to collaborate and pool their insights, development capabilities, and data assets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Too many global enterprises don&#39;t make the most of local innovations. By systematically overcoming the obstacles to scaling them, they can spread them much faster and more effectively and generate a much higher return on their innovation investments.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 16 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Women in Leadership Face Ageism at Every Age]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/women-in-leadership-face-ageism-at-every-age]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/June23_14_1415442562.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/aldomurillo/Imagehit/Hero Images/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Originally, ageism was understood to be prejudice, stereotypes, and discriminatory behavior targeted at older employees.

Since she began the vice president role at age 37, board members routinely criticized her age, calling her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90569439/we-need-to-talk-about-using-pet-names-for-women-at-work&quot;>;diminishing pet names&lt;/a>;, like “kiddo” and “young lady.” But being older wouldn&#39;t necessarily have made a difference, as another woman explained: “I am at the age when I should be getting the higher-level jobs; people in my profession now want to give the jobs to the 30- and younger 40-year-olds with the &#39;fresh, new ideas&#39; as opposed to going with the person with experience.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, ageism was understood to be prejudice, stereotypes, and discriminatory behavior &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00062.x&quot;>;targeted at older employees&lt;/a>;.

With an increasingly diverse and multigenerational workforce, age bias now occurs &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0432.2004.00222.x&quot;>;across the career life cycle&lt;/a>;. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001064&quot;>;Youngism&lt;/a>;” refers to ageism toward younger adults and is fueled by the conflation of age with maturity and the misperception that tenure is required for competency.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, research has only just begun to investigate how age is used to justify bias and discrimination specifically against women. Gendered ageism sits at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2021/09/20/gendered-ageism-affects-womens-job-security-and-financial-viability/&quot;>;intersection of age and gender bias&lt;/a>; and is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/fighting-the-double-whammy-of-ageism-sexism.aspx&quot;>;double whammy&lt;/a>; where there is “no right age” for professional women.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our recent open-ended survey research of 913 women leaders from four United States industries (higher education, faith-based nonprofits, law, and health care), we discovered that many women suffered from this “never-right” age bias. Conceptions of young, middle, and old age are often based on perceptions and vary between workplaces and contexts. When interpreting our results, we consider “young” to be under 40, middle age to be between 40 and 60, and older women to be over 60.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Gendered “Oldism”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As women age, they are often not seen as valuable or relevant in the way that male counterparts are. Older women in our research expressed that they were deemed unworthy of advancement. “While men become wells of wisdom as they age, older women are seen as outdated, harpy, strident,” one physician noted. “Our voices are discounted.” For example, a 61-year-old deputy chief information officer (CIO) was not considered in CIO succession planning. Instead, the current CIO was grooming a male colleague for the role. Another retirement-aged woman added, “I am largely ignored.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of these women felt discouraged, burnt out, and resigned to not advancing any further. As a 66-year-old faith-based leader said, “At my age and with the mentality of our organization that they need men at the top, there is not a next professional step.” Another woman in the same industry noted that once she turned 60, she was no longer “worth investing in with training or mentoring.” Others felt compelled to find opportunities outside of their organization: “I am tired of proving myself to others and may as well do it in the interests of my own company,” a 60-year-old lawyer indicated.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Gendered “Youngism”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Younger women — and those who looked young — were called pet names or even patted on the head, as one 39-year-old woman reported. Young women also experienced &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/when-people-assume-youre-not-in-charge-because-youre-a-woman&quot;>;role incredulity&lt;/a>;. They reported being mistaken for students, interns, trainees, support staff, secretaries, paralegals, and court reporters. Such inaccurate assumptions were especially prevalent for non-White women, such as an Asian higher-education executive who appeared young and was presumed to be in a junior position.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many younger women also experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538170960/Glass-Walls-Shattering-the-Six-Gender-Bias-Barriers-Still-Holding-Women-Back-at-Work&quot;>;credibility deficit&lt;/a>;, which occurs when women&#39;s statements and expertise are not believed. “I am often told that I don&#39;t have the experience so I can&#39;t know what to do,” one 34-year-old woman explained. In the face of such bias, women (and especially women of color) must expend extra effort to prove themselves. One young-looking Black university chief financial officer noted that she is often “pressed to provide a synopsis of her resume to establish credibility.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other younger women had their appearance scrutinized. One physician noted that between ages 20 and 40, men focused on her looks. After she gave a scientific presentation that she was very proud of, a male colleague told her that she “looked like a Barbie doll up there!”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Gendered “Middle-ageism”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Unlike previous notions of a middle-aged “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/sheilacallaham/2022/02/25/workplace-age-bias-hurts-earlyand-late-career-workers/?sh=35faa75b61e7&quot;>;sweet spot&lt;/a>;,” women between ages 40 and 60 in our study fared no better than their younger or older counterparts. One college leader described how some search committees chose not to hire women in their late forties because of “too much family responsibility and impending menopause.” Other search committees declined to hire women in their fifties because they have “menopause-related issues and could be challenging to manage.” And still other committees said that “women in their fifties and sixties may not have &#39;aged well&#39; and do not &#39;look vital.&#39;” Yet the jobs were given to similarly aged men.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lawyer summed up the never-right age bias problem in her field:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, we are too young to be responsible or to supervise. This lasts into our mid- to late-thirties but does not for men. (Perhaps they are waiting to make sure we don&#39;t have kids). Then in an instant, we are too old to be hired for anything or anywhere new. Once again, men are still “young enough” at the same age…. Women are young or old, we get no prime time even if we aren&#39;t out for childbearing or rearing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our research we found no age was the right age to be a woman leader. There was always an age-based excuse to not take women seriously, to discount their opinions, or to not hire or promote them. Each individual woman may believe she&#39;s just at the wrong age, but the data make the larger pattern clear. Any age can be stigmatized by supervisors and colleagues to claim that the woman is not valued or is not a fit for a leadership role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Age diversity in the workplace yields better &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/apl0000497&quot;>;organizational performance&lt;/a>; while perceived age discrimination creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/josi.12161&quot;>;lower job satisfaction and engagement&lt;/a>;. Similarly, gender diversity also matters. Organizations with diverse leadership teams &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296320303490?via%3Dihub&quot;>;perform better&lt;/a>;, especially in times of crisis; &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2729348&quot;>;earn more&lt;/a>;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1748-8583.12079&quot;>;have lower turnover.&lt;/a>; The business case is clear — if organizational leaders pay attention.

Whereas sexism and racism are the focus of most workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, ageism has been largely neglected.

Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-news/pages/avoiding-age-discrimination-.aspx&quot;>;interactive case studies&lt;/a>; that include “gray areas” in age-related assumptions and address false stereotypes that older age reduces an individual&#39;s commitment, agility, and ability to learn. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/global-campaign-to-combat-ageism-toolkit&quot;>;Company social media can also be leveraged to get the word out&lt;/a>; about ageism using messaging that taps into both emotions and facts.

Middle-aged women may be thought of as difficult to manage or having too many family responsibilities. Women who are older are often constrained by perceptions that they are no longer invested in the organization, are less productive, or cannot be promoted. These falsehoods perpetuate the problem. Rather than focusing on age when hiring, making promotion decisions, or bringing on new team members for a growth opportunity, leaders should focus on each woman&#39;s skills, not their tenure or external demands.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Cultivate creative collaborations.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Develop intergenerational, mixed-gender teams and professional relationships to encourage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2018/11/13/what-older-workers-and-younger-workers-can-learn-from-each-other/?sh=5c7f9a9e2117&quot;>;learning from each other and collaborating on solutions&lt;/a>;.

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springtideresearch.org/research/work-life&quot;>;recent study&lt;/a>; of Generation Z&#39;s expectations at work showed that one of their highest desires was for mentoring relationships; they long for connection with older workers who take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/generation-z-seeks-guidance-in-the-workplace.aspx&quot;>;an interest in them&lt;/a>;.

Research suggests that cross-selling products during the return process is an effective strategy to reduce this revenue loss. Across a number of experiments, researchers found that consumers treat refunds as money already lost, so it&amp;#8217;s less painful to spend these funds on another purchase, so long as cross-selling occurs before the money is reissued to the customers&amp;#8217; original payment method and consumers initially expected to keep the goods they were planning to buy. The researchers also found that this &amp;#8220;refund effect&amp;#8221; applies across categories. Creating return policies and practices informed by the refund effect can reduce revenue loss from product returns in a way that benefits both consumers and retailers.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-retailers-can-capitalize-on-the-refund-effect?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-retailers-can-capitalize-on-the-refund-effect?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Product returns pose a major challenge for retailers. In 2022, US consumers returned &lt;a href=&quot;https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/2022-retail-returns-rate-remains-flat-816-billion#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20Consumers%20are%20expected%20to,Retail%20Federation%20and%20Appriss%20Retail.&quot;>;16.5%&lt;/a>; of merchandise purchases, costing retailers an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/2022-retail-returns-rate-remains-flat-816-billion#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20Consumers%20are%20expected%20to,Retail%20Federation%20and%20Appriss%20Retail.&quot;>;$816&lt;/a>; billion in lost revenue. Typical strategies to reduce revenue lost to product returns include reducing the likelihood of returns by providing more information about products (eg, reviews and FAQs) and increasing the financial and transaction costs to consumers who do return products (eg, shipping costs and limited return windows). But the former strategy is costly to retailers, and the latter is costly to consumers. Our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcpy.1354&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; identifies an effective strategy for reducing this loss of revenue that benefits everyone: cross-selling products during the product-return process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In six experiments we found that consumers treat refunds as money already lost, so spending these funds on another purchase feels less painful. Research participants were more likely to spend money from a product refund than from a bonus, and even more likely to spend refunded money than unexpected income, like lottery winnings and tax refunds. We call this “the refund effect.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In one laboratory experiment, for instance, we gave all participants $4. Some of the participants were asked to use the money to buy a stress ball that they later learned they could return, which most did. Others in a control group made no initial purchase. We then offered everyone the opportunity to keep their $4 or use it to buy a $5 Starbucks gift card at a discount. Only 48% of the control group used their $4 to buy the gift card, whereas 78% of participants who received the refund bought the gift card. We replicated this study with an online sample where the returned product was a gift card from a big-box retailer (ie, Best Buy or Kohls). In this experiment, only 10% of the control group chose to purchase the Starbucks gift card, whereas 25% of participants with refunded money used it to buy the Starbucks gift card.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retailers who understand the dynamics of the refund effect — when, why, and how it works — stand to mitigate one of the perennial headaches of the industry. Here are three findings retailers should keep in mind to make the most of the refund effect:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Cross-selling opportunities occur during the returns process — before money is reissued to the customers&#39; original payment method.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The refund effect is far less likely to boost sales after money has been refunded to a credit card or checking account.为什么？ The refund effect depends on creating and maintaining an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earmarking.asp&quot;>;earmark&lt;/a>;” that reminds consumers the money has been lost. Our research found that if refunded money is pooled with money from other sources the earmark is removed and consumers spend it no differently than money from other sources. For example, research participants were more likely to use a refund from a pair of sneakers to buy a shirt if they had yet to receive their money back. If the money had already been deposited in their checking account, they were no more likely to buy the shirt than participants who simply saw the shirt online.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some retailers already effectively use this cross-selling strategy. By default, Amazon asks customers if they&#39;d like to use their return to buy a gift card. Customers who decline this cross-sell then receive their refund. Clothier Todd Snyder lets customers use their refund to immediately buy other products before they mail their return. The remainder of their refund is issued when the return is received. These cross-selling strategies are likely to work because customers shop out of the refund before getting money back from their returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The refund effect only works when consumers expect to lose money.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Our research showed that consumers have to initially expect to keep the goods and services they buy to create the earmark that makes the refund effect work. “Try before you buy” strategies, where consumers do not expect to pay for returned goods, are unlikely to create a refund effect if those goods are returned.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, research participants who imagined buying two pairs of shoes to try on with the expectation that they would return one pair were no more likely to spend their refund on a jacket than controls who simply imagined seeing the jacket and paying out of pocket. By contrast, participants who did not expect to return a pair of shoes when they bought them were more likely to use the refund from the shoes to buy the jacket&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The refund effect applies across categories.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Because refunded money feels as if it has already been lost, the refund effect applies both to cross-sold products in the same category and products in other categories.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, research participants in a fifth experiment were more likely to spend a refund from a returned bottle of wine on either a gift card from a grocer or from an athleisure brand than buy either kind of gift card with money out of their pocket. This is good news for retailers who offer a range of product categories.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sale strategies like upselling and exchanges during the product return process should similarly benefit from the refund effect, and they may be better for customer relationship management than increasing the cost of product returns. New companies have stepped into this market. For example, Loop Returns helps 1,500 Shopify merchants, such as Allbirds and Brooklinen, cross-sell, upsell, and exchange products during the product return process, saving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loopreturns.com/the-ecommerce-returns-benchmark-report/&quot;>;28% of revenue&lt;/a>; that would otherwise be lost.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lesson for retailers? Instead of resorting to practices whose harsh transaction costs can &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0008125617741125&quot;>;alienate customers&lt;/a>;, sometimes permanently, creating return policies and practices informed by the refund effect can be an effective way to reduce the revenue loss incurred by product returns in a way that benefits both consumers and retailers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Ways Companies Are Addressing Skills Gaps in Their Workforce]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/5-ways-companies-are-addressing-skills-gaps-in-their-workforce]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_15_TylerComrie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Tyler Comrie&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;We&amp;#8217;re in an unusual economic situation, one where recession fears are high but the job market is tight.

There are more than 580,000 active apprentices working in the US right now — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apprenticeship.gov/data-and-statistics&quot;>;up 103% in the past 10 years&lt;/a>;, according to Department of Labor figures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For companies that consistently struggle to fill important roles, apprenticeships may be an effective solution. While apprenticeships have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/04/tanners-tailors-and-candlestick-makers-a-history-of-apprenticeships&quot;>;historically&lt;/a>; been associated with blue-collar jobs, they&#39;re increasingly becoming a way to fill white-collar jobs in the digital and tech sectors. Apprenticeships in the IT and telecommunications sector grew by more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211027040416/https:/www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-industries/telecommunications#:~:text=In%202020%20there%20were%203%2C654%20registered%20apprentices%20in%20telecommunications%20occupations%2C%20increasing%20over%20300%25%20in%20the%20last%20nine%20years.%20%5B2%5D&quot;>;300%&lt;/a>; between 2011 and 2020, while cybersecurity apprenticeships grew by &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211027023746/https:/www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-industries/cybersecurity#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20there%20were%202%2C716%20registered%20apprentices%20in%20cybersecurity%20occupations%2C%20increasing%20over%20600%25%20in%20the%20last%20nine%20years%20%5B2%5D.&quot;>;600%&lt;/a>; during the same period, according to the Department of Labor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend is powered by a growing number of companies, many of which are focused on fast-growing fields like software engineering and data science, that recruit, support, and train apprentices on behalf of large employers. One UK-based provider, Multiverse, was recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://tcrn.ch/3H0ebPR&quot;>;valued&lt;/a>; at $1.7bn and claims to have served &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multiverse.io/en-US/blog/multiverse-community-reaches-10-000-apprentices-and-alumni&quot;>;10,000 apprentices&lt;/a>;. “We&#39;ve long been believers in the apprenticeship model, and we&#39;ve found it particularly effective for tech and digital jobs,” said Rashitha Jayasekara, chief of digital manufacturing at Rolls-Royce, which works with Multiverse to&amp;nbsp;upskill existing employees. “The experiential learning that apprentices get through hackathons and project work allows them to combine theory and practice in a way standard training doesn&#39;t, and to continuously develop skills we need within the company.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Verizon, another Multiverse customer, uses the apprenticeship model to fill software engineering jobs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multiverse.io/en-US/blog/creating-software-engineering-jobs-verizon&quot;>;reports&lt;/a>; that 95% of an initial cohort accepted full-time offers at the company after completing an apprenticeship program. The Verizon program was designed to “lower barriers to entry to software jobs while training truly great software developers that we fundamentally believe can propel our business through digital innovation,” said Shankar Arumugavelu, Verizon&#39;s chief information officer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apprenticeships aren&#39;t right for all training needs. For one thing, they require a significant investment of time — in the US, formal apprenticeships are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/article/apprenticeships_occupations-and-outlook.htm#:~:text=Formal%20apprenticeship%20programs%20usually%20last,Department%20of%20Labor%20(DOL).&quot;>;usually four years long&lt;/a>;. In some markets they can also come with restrictive regulation. In the UK, for instance, the government&#39;s apprenticeship funding program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/365530295/Government-urged-to-address-broken-apprenticeship-levy-system&quot;>;has been criticized&lt;/a>; for being too rigid and not in line with employers&#39; needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Fresh Approach to Tuition Reimbursement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;How a historically elite benefit is becoming accessible for all&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Large companies have long offered to pay for their employees&#39; continuing education. However, these benefits have historically been reserved for a small number of white-collar employees, for example, those pursuing an executive MBA. Or employees were asked to pay for their courses out of pocket and get reimbursed afterwards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the labor market has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/how-to-better-support-and-retain-frontline-workers&quot;>;changed&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/02/companies-offer-tuition-assistance-so-workers-can-go-back-to-college.html&quot;>;more companies&lt;/a>; are offering tuition benefits as a way to retain their frontline employees — store clerks, baristas, drivers, and hourly workers. In response, a new class of companies has emerged to smooth and synchronize the relationship between training providers, employers, employees, and (in some cases) the government. Employees receive coaching, advice, and support to help them find the training program that&#39;s right for them, and the training programs are paid for by the employer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in 2021, Target announced a tuition-assistance program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.target.com/article/2022/09/dream-to-be-anniversary#:~:text=Our%20%24200%20million%20investment%20in,skills%20and%20build%20their%20careers.&quot;>;“Dream to Be&lt;/a>;” in partnership with Guild, one of the leading players in this growing space. According to Chief Diversity and Inclusion officer Kiera Fernandez, “Target has offered a traditional tuition reimbursement program for more than two decades. Now, through our partnership with Guild to offer Dream to Be, team members can attend classes at more than 40 schools, colleges, and universities … with no out-of-pocket tuition costs.” Fernandez said that as of April 2023, more than 25,000 employees have been approved for the program.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If designed effectively, the benefits of tuition assistance programs for employers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/human-resources/articles/tuition-reimbursement/&quot;>;clear&lt;/a>;. For example, Jack Hartung, chief financial officer of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/04/09/chipotle-cfo-says-debt-free-degree-is-a-way-to-invest-in-employees.html&quot;>;told CNBC&lt;/a>; that “employees who take advantage of the company&#39;s free degrees are three and a half times more likely to stay with the company and seven times more likely to move up into management.” However, research suggests that while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180108006550/en/New-Study-Shows-Lasting-Impact-Tuition-Assistance#:~:text=84%25%20say%20access%20to%20a%20tuition%20assistance%20program%20was%20important%20in%20their%20decision%20to%20join%20the%20company&quot;>;84%&lt;/a>; of employees value tuition reimbursement benefits highly, on average, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/nulr/vol117/iss6/5/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20despite%20their%20increasing%20availability%2C%20only%202%25%20of%20employees%2C%20as%20a%20percentage%20of%20those%20interested%20in%20pursuing%20further%20education%2C%20are%20utilizing%20these%20reimbursement%20programs&quot;>;only 2%&lt;/a>; of eligible employees use this benefit. This implies employers must do more to take advantage of this powerful tool.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Shift to Learning Experience Platforms&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;How employees know what to learn next&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Organizing and tracking what employees are learning can be a cumbersome task. For years, this work has been done by software known as “learning management systems” (LMS), which are relatively simple tools that store learning material, typically in the form of presentations, videos, and text. Most large companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://trainingmag.com/2021-training-industry-report/#:~:text=Some%2098%20percent%20of%20large%20companies%20and%2096%20percent%20of%20midsize%20ones%20currently%20use%20LMSs%20vs.%2080%20percent%20of%20small%20companies.&quot;>;have one&lt;/a>;, but few employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2021/04/27/usage-of-degreed-is-double-that-of-traditional-learning-platforms/?sh=58ba9a1a2d3d#:~:text=most%20LMS%20and%20online%20content%20companies%20only%20see%205%25%20to%2015%25%20of%20licensed%20seats%20used%20in%20any%20given%20month.&quot;>;spend much time&lt;/a>; on them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last few years, a new wave of tools has transformed the LMS into “Learning Experience Platforms” (LXP), with features like skills assessments, Netflix-style recommendations about what to learn next, and internal social networking. LXPs “make learning relevant for individuals, not just managing training programs,” according Todd Tauber senior vice president of strategy at Degreed, one of the leading providers in this space. Industry analyst Josh Bersin estimates the market for LXPs is &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2022/06/corporate-learning-bombshell-degreed-acquires-learnin-david-blake-returns/&quot;>;$500m,&lt;/a>; up from &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2018/07/edcast-expands-the-lxp-market-with-focus-on-global-upskilling/&quot;>;$200m&lt;/a>; in 2018.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers report that the model is working. Chris Harry is the chief learning officer of TEK Systems, a staffing firm that&#39;s been using Degreed. “Since moving our various employee development programs onto Degreed, we&#39;ve seen our highest-ever engagement and satisfaction rates,” he said. According to Harry, 96% of TEK employees have created an account in Degreed, and the company consistently sees 40 to 50% of them actively using the platform each month, which he says is “far higher than anything we&#39;ve seen before.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Results like these require real investment beyond simply buying the technology. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.degreed.com/hubfs/Client%20Case%20Studies/Ericsson/Ericsson+Degreed%20Case%20Study_Q2-22_EN-US.pdf?utm_campaign=Ericsson%20Case%20Study%20May%20%2722&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=214005662&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_8Z515BnP5WAJI5xGCg8ZF2Zi2ftiYmmfHEKikOYkDheoBPQzXBzi5mM6FOcyAZGppjQgdYXltDyoeVeVVC1bEnUM8xfnubGHUldzPilsSLH3Yk90&amp;amp;utm_content=214005662&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_automation&quot;>;example&lt;/a>;, another Degreed customer, Ericsson, said it hired internal champions and developed an extensive internal marketing campaign to roll out its program.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Democratization of Coaching&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;How all of us can have a Sherpa for our careers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Professional coaching is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-12395-008&quot;>;well-understood&lt;/a>; way to boost workers&#39; learning, confidence, and effectiveness. However, it has typically been an &lt;a href=&quot;/2009/01/what-can-coaches-do-for-you#:~:text=they%E2%80%99re%20usually%20called%20executive%20coaches%2C%20and%20they%20can%20earn%20up%20to%20%243%2C500%20an%20hour.&quot;>;expensive&lt;/a>; tool, reserved only for senior executives. Moreover, even for those who can afford it, finding a coach can be a challenge.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;New platforms have emerged that use technology to make it easier to find, match, and work with coaches. New companies provide tools to assess what each employee needs from their coach, match them with a coach who has the right experience and expertise, and even conduct coaching sessions via a digital platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The space is growing. According to the International Coaching Federation, there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://coachfederation.org/app/uploads/2020/09/FINAL_ICF_GCS2020_ExecutiveSummary.pdf&quot;>;71,000&lt;/a>; practicing coaches in 2021, up 33% from 2016. Investors expect growth to continue: The leading digital coaching startup, BetterUp, raised $300m in 2021 at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterup&quot;>;$5bn valuation&lt;/a>; as part of a wave of &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshbersin.com/2022/01/online-coaching-is-so-hot-its-now-disrupting-leadership-development/&quot;>;investment&lt;/a>; into coaching startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Much of this growth is powered by large companies offering coaching services more broadly to their employees. Danone, the France-based food products company, has been working with one provider, CoachHub, to offer this benefit to 250 employees. According to Maxime Hollande, who leads diversity and inclusion for Danone in the Netherlands, “these coaching sessions have been of big added value for employees… One of the metrics we watch closely is the extent to which each employee has progressed toward the personal goals each of them define with their coach. The average score on this metric is 4.9 out of 5.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chevron, the American global energy company, has made coaching sessions available to 7,000 of its managers around the world via BetterUp. “Prior to BetterUp, we utilized an assortment of internal coaching resources and multiple external coaching vendors,” explained Rhonda Morris, Chevron&#39;s chief human resources officer. “BetterUp&#39;s virtual coaching model … has matured our coaching culture making it more accessible for all who want it.&amp;nbsp; Coaches no longer have to travel to meet our employees. Our employees have been very vocal about their positive experiences with BetterUp.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because coaching sessions are inherently private experiences, it can be hard for employers to ensure a focus on the topics that are most important to them. At Chevron, they measure the success each quarter by asking employees to rate the effectiveness of leaders who&#39;ve received coaching. “Leadership Effectiveness is consistently one of our highest scoring categories across our organization,” Morris said. “This shows that our BetterUp offerings are having a positive impact on our workforce and culture.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Rise of Cohort-Based Courses &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;How to build real skills online&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When it comes to online learning, most participants &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7958&quot;>;don&#39;t finish&lt;/a>; the courses they start, mainly because the learning experience is asynchronous. Individuals must be disciplined and diligent enough to complete large amounts of the learning material on their own. This is particularly difficult in today&#39;s workplace, where the number of meetings and distractions has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/great-expectations-making-hybrid-work-work&quot;>;ballooned&lt;/a>; in recent years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, a new delivery format called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://future.com/cohort-based-courses/&quot;>;cohort-based courses&lt;/a>;” has emerged as a way to improve completion rates. Groups of participants together take a course with defined start and end dates, regular homework assignments, and an instructor to run periodic live online discussion sessions. Within this more structured format, participants still access much of the learning material on their own time, making it easier for them to complete the course and have the chance to apply what they learn over its duration. One of the pioneers of this space, altMBA, says its learners have achieved a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/behavior-design/how-to-design-an-online-course-with-a-96-completion-rate-180678117a85&quot;>;96% completion rate&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is one leading employer that has embraced cohort-based courses, working in partnership with Emeritus (where I work). Lidia Juszko, BCG&#39;s executive director of global learning and teaming, describes how the format works particularly well for a professional services firm like hers. “We&#39;ve found that cohort-based courses offer a level of structure and support that makes them more engaging than standard online learning,” she said. “Our colleagues report that the combination and cadence of &#39;office hours&#39; with instructors, live discussion sessions with the rest of the cohort, and short videos and exercises to be completed each week are a more accessible way for them to learn. Learning and development opportunities like this allow us to continue to attract and retain the best talent.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HSBC, the global banking organization, recently began piloting cohort-based online courses as well, and the early results are promising. According to David Morris, global head of people capability, “One of our challenges has been to deliver in-depth learning in an online format, given the range and complexity of our markets. Our early results show that the online cohort-based format is achieving significant improvement across key indicators like completion, confidence, and capability.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The downside of this format is that the live learning elements that make it effective come at a substantial cost. A single license to an open library of standard online courses costs about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/comparing-subscription-pricing-2023.png&quot;>;$30 to $60&lt;/a>; per month for access to thousands of courses (most providers also offer significant volume discounts). Meanwhile, cohort-based courses can cost between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2021/12/17/how-cohort-based-learning-is-transforming-online-education/#:~:text=Another%20notable%20difference%20is%20the%20price%3B%20cohort%20based%20courses%20can%20range%20anywhere%20from%20%24500%20up%20to%20more%20than%20%245%2C000.&quot;>;$500 and $5,000&lt;/a>; per course&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>; This means cohort-based learning is unlikely to be an option for all employees, and employers must carefully decide who can benefit the most.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2022/12/02/many-indicators-imply-a-2023-recession-the-jobs-market-disagrees/&quot;>;unusual&lt;/a>; economic situation, one where recession fears are up but the job market is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/b1b710a1-6d12-43e5-8508-ae4584a7289a&quot;>;still tight&lt;/a>;.

PACE, a comprehensive, integrated, community-based care approach that lets older adults continue to live at home as long as possible, can serve as a model for improving the needs of this population. This article examines PACE Southeast Michigan, an outstanding PACE program.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-more-humane-model-for-eldercare-in-the-us?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-more-humane-model-for-eldercare-in-the-us?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The US health care system is not set up to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable, chronically ill, elderly people, especially those who are poor. Older poor people often face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016701/&quot;>;loneliness, depression,&lt;/a>; a lost sense of purpose, and an inability to live independently in their homes. They also encounter many health service hurdles, including inadequate care coordination, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/how-to-pay-for-health-care&quot;>;fee-for-service reimbursement&lt;/a>; that often reflexively encourages medical treatment over other forms of care, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2759755&quot;>;dysfunctional&lt;/a>; nursing home industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help improve services for these patients, we analyzed the design and implementation of a national program called PACE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/Medicare-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare-and-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare-Medicaid-Coordination-Office/PACE/PACE&quot;>;Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly&lt;/a>;. We focused on this program because all PACE participants are vulnerable: They require nursing home–level care, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npaonline.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/Issue%20Brief_Medicaid%20Rate%20Setting%20for%20PACE%202.21.pdf&quot;>;90%&lt;/a>; are eligible for &lt;em>;both&lt;/em>; Medicare and Medicaid. Few integrated-care programs serve this dual-eligible population, which now numbers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/a-profile-of-medicare-medicaid-enrollees-dual-eligibles/#:~:text=The%2012.5%20million%20people%20who,from%20their%20state%20Medicaid%20program.&quot;>;12.5 million&lt;/a>; Americans.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In-depth interviews with PACE staff and program participants conducted by two of us (Len Berry and Sunjay Letchuman); collaborations with PACE leaders, including two coauthors of this article (Mary Kummer Naber and Peter Fitzgerald); and our collective analysis of the features and daily operations of a PACE model in southeastern Michigan (led by Mary) reveal how PACE successfully delivers individualized, home-centered care to poor older adults while lowering overall costs. Given that PACE currently serves only about 60,000 of these patients, expanding the program has useful management and cost implications for health care systems nationally. Although nursing home and other institutionalized elder care clearly demand improvement, the United States also must invest in reimagining what elder care can be. PACE provides a roadmap.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;More Comprehensive, Less Costly Care&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The PACE program, first developed in San Francisco in 1973, is a comprehensive, integrated, community-based care model that lets older adults continue to live at home as long as possible. There are now 150 PACE programs in 32 states. The basic philosophy is that care should include what matters most to older poor people: all-inclusive care comprising nutrition, social interaction, transportation, and home upkeep, in addition to medical and related services. The goal is to treat patients with dignity as they safely live at home, rather than in an institution, and receive every needed service from one entity — all while lowering costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All Medicare beneficiaries needing nursing home–level care but wishing to live at home are eligible for PACE. However, Medicare beneficiaries who do not meet their state&#39;s Medicaid income requirement are required to pay an amount equivalent to the monthly Medicaid payment, limiting access to millions of seniors who could benefit from the program.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The program offers patients (called “participants”) all their Medicare- and Medicaid-covered benefits, including primary care, adult day care, rehabilitative care, and meals at a local PACE center. PACE provides transportation and various in-home services and is the payer for medical care that it cannot offer internally, such as emergency room visits and hospital stays. PACE organizations are paid on a monthly, risk-adjusted, capitated basis by Medicare and Medicaid, meaning they are paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-education/american-indian-alaska-native/aian/ltss-ta-center/info/pace#:~:text=The%20program%20receives%20capitated%20reimbursements,each%20patient%20the%20program%20serves.&quot;>;a set amount per month&lt;/a>; based, in part, on participants&#39; medical complexity. PACE programs bear full financial risk for all care, and participants do not pay anything out of pocket.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Available &lt;a href=&quot;https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.12637&quot;>;evidence&lt;/a>; shows that PACE reduces health care utilization and costs. Compared with similar populations, PACE participants have substantially lower rates of hospitalization (539 vs. 962 admissions per 1,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430746/&quot;>;person-years&lt;/a>;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/68/1/47/549686?login=true&quot;>;South Carolina&lt;/a>;, for example, annually saves nearly $9,000 per PACE participant compared with residents in alternative long-term care settings such as nursing homes; &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.wyo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SFY-2020-Wyoming-Medicaid-Annual-Report.pdf&quot;>;Wyoming&lt;/a>; saves over $12,000 per PACE participant. However, PACE is about far more than saving money — it is about restoring dignity and joy to people&#39;s lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;An Exemplary Model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;One outstanding PACE program is PACE Southeast Michigan (PACE SEMI), which the National PACE Association identified as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npaonline.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/2018%20AC%20PowerPoint.pdf&quot;>;“bright spot”&lt;/a>; for its growth and quality metrics. PACE SEMI is organized as a tax-exempt nonprofit and is owned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henryford.com/&quot;>;Henry Ford Health&lt;/a>; (55%) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pvm.org/&quot;>;Presbyterian Villages of Michigan&lt;/a>; (45%). With seven centers serving 1,600 participants and employing 700 people, PACE SEMI increases its net enrollment by an average of 30 participants each month, compared with two participants each month in PACE centers nationally. Approximately 15% of PACE SEMI participants visit an emergency room each year for any reason, compared with &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/9739cab65ad0221a66ebe45463d10d37/dual-eligible-beneficiaries-integrated-care.pdf&quot;>;25%&lt;/a>; of PACE participants nationally and 31% of Medicare Advantage enrollees. PACE SEMI participants also use inpatient hospital services less frequently: In 2019, PACE SEMI participants had 302 fewer &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service-type-reports/cms-program-statistics-medicare-advantage-inpatient-hospital&quot;>;hospitalizations per 1,000 persons&lt;/a>; compared to Medicare Advantage enrollees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The PACE model is built on interdisciplinary teamwork. All PACE SEMI staff members are expected to see themselves as physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual “healers.” They include the primary care doctor who emphasizes preventing illness and injury as much as ordering treatments, the nurse and social worker who coordinate care, the onsite pharmacist who stays alert for prescribed drugs that may do more harm than good for specific patients, the kitchen chef who customizes meals to participants&#39; tastes and allergies, the participant-care associate who gives supportive care for daily activities (including showers), and the drivers who transport participants to and from PACE centers and other important destinations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike some PACE programs, PACE SEMI has behavioral health and spiritual care specialists at each center who get to know each participant they serve. In one case mentioned by a PACE physician, a spiritual care provider asked clinic staff to immediately check on a patient who seemed “off.” It turned out the patient was having a stroke and quickly received life-saving care. In a less-dramatic case, a social worker took it upon herself to persuade a local Trader Joe&#39;s store to donate flowers for participants to take home each week. Team members hold weekly meetings where everyone has equal input about how to prevent avoidable emergency room visits and advance the quality of life for their participants.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Whole-Person Care&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;At its core, the PACE model is relationship-based: Participants and staff members know each other well, which facilitates “whole-person healing” customized to each individual. Indeed, members are called “participants” precisely because of their active role in planning their care, which goes far beyond medical services and addresses head-on the isolation that many older people who live alone endure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A day at a PACE SEMI center includes needed medical and rehabilitative services and is filled with customized activities such as music, painting, games, breakfast and lunch with friends, and regular group sessions where participants share “what I am grateful for,” cultivating a sense of belonging and community. Participants can get their hair shampooed, cut, and styled. They receive instruction on living safely at home and are given iPads (called “GrandPads”), designed for senior use, that let them easily contact family or PACE staff or play games. The kitchen prepares food for participants to take home at the end of the day. Participants can also use the onsite gym staffed with physical and occupational therapists. (“To see a 90-year-old working out is amazing,” one therapist said.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Dancing Kathy” arrived at PACE SEMI in a wheelchair. Aided by the rehabilitation staff, she eventually graduated to a walker and, months later, a cane. In an interview one year after starting at PACE, Kathy said she no longer needed the cane most of the time and could now dance. She then joined several staff members to dance the “Hustle” in front of the cafeteria lunch crowd.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Proactive Investments in Health&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Most of the enormous amount spent on health care in the United States is reactive. Patients get sick, treatment ensues, costs are incurred. PACE shows the potential of investing in health, not just health care, proactively. PACE SEMI and other well-run PACE programs do just about anything to help people continue to live at home safely. For instance, if a participant needs a shower chair at home to prevent a fall, PACE SEMI buys the chair, sets it up, and teaches the participant how to use it. With money generated by community fundraising, PACE SEMI fixes porches and stairs, replaces heaters, improves lighting, and even roots out bedbugs. It partners with an ambulance service whose paramedics often provide in-home care that prevents ER visits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such spending can greatly improve the quality of people&#39;s lives while reducing downstream costs. One of PACE SEMI&#39;s participants, “Mr. B,” had a career as a musician but now lives alone. After leaving the PACE center each week, Mr. B was a frequent visitor to ERs for mental health–related issues and anxiety. After the PACE staff realized Mr. B was missing music in his life, the center bought him a headset and player so he could listen to his favorite music. The ER visits stopped.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Service with a Soul&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PACE SEMI&#39;s secret sauce is its culture. Hiring for caring, not just competence, is as central as intensively training staff to distinguish between nonmedical healing and medical interventions. Some staff members with traditional health care backgrounds must “unlearn” their bias for episodic care. And in working with a vulnerable population, staff must move beyond risk aversion, common in institutional elder care.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keeping people safe does not require stealing their freedom, as Atul Gawande discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Being Mortal&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;: “…our elderly are left with a controlled and supervised institutional existence, a medically designed answer to unfixable problems, a life designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about.” With creativity, compassion, and commitment, a carefully selected, well-trained staff who are themselves treated with dignity can instill dignity, a sense of belonging, and even joy in PACE participants. As Renee, a food service worker at PACE SEMI, puts it, “We add love to the food.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PACE is about investing in people&#39;s well-being, keeping them as well as possible for as long as possible. It offers older adults the chance to live at home with a higher quality of care — and of life. The current model serves primarily low-income seniors; however, the bigger opportunity is to expand it to include all chronically ill older adults. Such models will be useful as Congress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/congress-considers-strategies-improve-medicare-and-medicaid-integration-dual-eligible&quot;>;crafts legislation&lt;/a>; to expand PACE, as health care organizations plan how to launch PACE programs efficiently and effectively, and as program leaders and managers seek to develop the nuts and bolts of care that offers healing to patients and energizes staff.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Your Love for Work May Alienate Your Colleagues]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/research-your-love-for-work-may-alienate-your-colleagues]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_14_1344042166-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;humanmade/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Research shows that employees who are passionate about their work are more productive, innovative, and collaborative.

The research on this topic &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.2434?casa_token=qK7aO_h5mzMAAAAA:00L4l-RKd7-sc3yfdVz-ToizgtmmobloM6Cvvd4-yWz19BX5JUsGmKTIzANA9GpjMzDpoGdT_LYoiw&quot;>;is clear&lt;/a>; — more passionate employees are more productive, innovative, and collaborative, and they demonstrate higher levels of commitment to their organizations. Fostering passion is a winning strategy for organizations that aspire to achieve sustained growth, innovation, and success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the pursuit of nurturing passion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2020.1761?af=R&quot;>;our recent research&lt;/a>; reveals that employers may have overlooked and neglected the needs of employees driven by other sources of motivation, such as financial stability, social status, or familial obligations. These employees &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/06/lets-hear-it-for-b-players&quot;>;play a critical role in the success of their companies&lt;/a>;, but may be subject to an invisible penalty due to their perceived lack of passion for their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Doing What You Love Makes You “Moralize” Loving Your Work&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Our research involving 1,245 full-time employees across several organizations that varied in size and industry revealed a novel phenomenon in the contemporary workplace: The more people love their work, the more they see it as a moral imperative. Employees who were more passionate about their work agreed more strongly with sentences like “Working for personal enjoyment is morally virtuous” and “Being intrinsically motivated is moral.” For these individuals, loving their work had moral significance beyond personal fulfillment, and they were more likely to judge their colleagues&#39; work motivations against their own moral yardstick or ask, “Are my colleagues here for the &lt;em>;right&lt;/em>; reasons?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This emphasis on loving your work as a moral obligation has far-reaching implications. Our research suggests that those who love their work more are also more likely to view working for external rewards less favorably. Those who agreed with sentences like “Being intrinsically motivated is moral” also agreed with sentences like “Those who do their work for money alone are not virtuous employees” and “Employees who are motivated by external rewards tend to be immoral.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Critically, we found consequences to these character judgements. Employees who love their work more also prioritized helping their more passionate colleagues, whom they consider morally superior. In contrast, employees who worked for other reasons received less help from their more passionate colleagues, making it more difficult for them to advance in their organizations and making them more likely to be excluded from important projects. Such treatment can have severe consequences for employee morale, retention, and overall organizational performance. By contrast, employees who worked for external rewards treated their colleagues equally, regardless of why they worked.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Creating an Environment that Values Employees&#39; Diverse Motivations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Managers need to be aware that organizations that valorize passion can create a sense of alienation for some employees. Recognizing and celebrating the unique contributions of all employees, regardless of their underlying motivations, will help create a sense of belonging and purpose among your workforce, leading to increased engagement and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers should also strive to foster an open and inclusive workplace culture where employees feel comfortable discussing their motivations and goals, even when they are misaligned with a passion-driven ethos. This can both encourage dialogue between employees who vary in their motivations for working and provide opportunities for employees to explore and develop their passion both inside and outside the workplace. For example, mentorship, networking relationships, or job crafting (ie, spending more time on tasks that are more meaningful to them) can expose employees to roles they may be more excited about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are an employee who loves their work, keep in mind that this could make you more judgmental about your colleagues and affect how much you help them. Not everyone needs to do the work because they are passionate about it. Some employees may have families to take care of, need benefits as a safety net, or have not yet discovered their true passion for work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, organizations should examine whether their benefits and perks appeal to employees with diverse motivations. While some employees may be attracted to work because they are passionate about it, others may be motivated by flexible work arrangements, or access to professional development opportunities. By offering a range of benefits and perks, leaders can create a workplace that appeals to employees with diverse motivations and help retain top talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the prevalent belief that passion is crucial for success, all employees should be appreciated for who they are and how they contribute — regardless of their motivations for working. Leaders should recognize the diverse motivations that drive their workforce and create an inclusive environment that supports and values all forms of motivation, rather than penalizing those who do not fit the passion-centric mold.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
