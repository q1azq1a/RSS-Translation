&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;摘要。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;自疫情爆发以来，大多数雇主对简历差距更加理解，更少歧视。但你必须准备好清楚、自信、不结巴地解释这些差距。掌握自己的职业轨迹意味着为招聘人员和招聘经理连接所有点。自己围绕任何差距进行叙述将有助于使它们不再成为问题。作者讨论了工作经历差距的五个常见原因以及如何在面试过程中掌握差距。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to- explain-a-gap-in-your-resume?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-explain-a-gap-in-your -resume?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在每个面试过程中，至少有一次你会被问到某种版本的问题，“你能带我浏览一下你的简历吗？”除了您的技能和经验之外，您还需要能够解释您在工作之间的转换，包括差距。这一点至关重要：当您在讨论简历时忽略工作之间的差距时，您就失去了控制有关工作转变或离开商业劳动力的时间的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于我对以下行业就业差距的研究：在我的书《想要→新职业：过渡到新职业或寻找梦想工作的权威手册》中，以下是工作经历差距的五个常见原因，以及如何在新职业生涯中承认差距面试流程：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;在家养育子女&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您从商业劳动力中休假&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/helping-stay-at-home- parents-reenter-the-workforce&quot;>;养育孩子&lt;/a>;，请解释您如何利用这段时间来获得与工作相关的技能、知识或经验。例如，您在孩子的学校做过志愿者吗？组织活动或筹款活动？您是为运动队活动安排旅行的家长吗？所有这些都可以转化为您正在申请的工作。例如，假设您希望继续从事全球筹款事业。你可以告诉面试官，“我花了一些时间来照顾我们的孩子，但我能够在为儿童体育联盟做志愿者、制定筹款目标并帮助团队成功实现筹款配额为儿童提供经济援助的同时，保持自己的技能新鲜。”那些需要它的人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;丧亲或照顾生病的家庭成员&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您抽出时间去照顾父母或家庭成员，请拥有您花这段时间的选择和他们在一起的重要时光。从工作的角度来审视这段经历。例如，如果您想重新担任客户服务角色，您可以专注于与家人的医疗保健提供者联络的角色：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;我请假去护理为了我的父亲。在那段时间里，我能够利用我与多个医疗保健提供者的有效沟通技巧，以及我的组织能力来协调与他的财务规划师、经纪人和法律代表的会议，这让他安心。我想在这份工作中运用同样的解决问题的技能以及在压力下保持冷静的能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;如果您正在申请财务工作，您可以专注于您的角色作为遗嘱执行人：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;在我母亲去世之前，我请了假来陪伴她。我被任命为执行人是因为我高度负责、有组织性并且具有财务头脑。我能够利用我的财务技能以及软技能来协调她的遗产，例如与多个债权人（包括公用事业公司、信用卡公司、医疗机构和银行机构）进行有效沟通。我的技能使我能够快速有效地关闭遗产，现在我希望将我的技能运用到新的挑战中。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h2>;环游世界&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;何时在抽出时间去探索之后回到公司工作环境，专注于你如何利用这段时间来获得新的视角。例如，如果您正在面试一家跨国公司，您可以讨论与来自不同文化的人互动的细微差别，以及体验其他国家的生活如何为您提供许多人在工作场所所没有的视角。如果您正在寻求运营职位，您可以重点关注旅行计划、与损益表相关的预算的效率，以及如何使用批判性思维来确定下一步去哪里。如果您花时间学习第二、第三或第四语言，请解释一下您的会话或流利能力如何使您成为比不会多语言的人表现更好的候选人。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;回到学校&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;也许您回到学校是为了获得 MBA 或博士学位。如果您是全日制学生，请解释您从事的具体项目如何与工作直接相关，以及这些项目以及过去的工作经验将如何让您为该职位带来独特的价值。也许您获得了 MBA 学位并想从事商业运营工作。您为真正的公司做过项目吗？将它们包含在您的简历中，以便您可以在面试时讨论它们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您发展了自己的技能&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/5-ways-to-acquire-new-skills-without -going-back-to school&quot;>;无需返回学校&lt;/a>;获得传统学位 - 例如，通过参加课程或获得认证 - 描述这些技能如何应用于未来的工作，并使你与众不同其他候选人。如果您阅读特定书籍是为了获得对您所在领域的新视角或增强您的领导能力，请谈谈您将如何应用您在工作中学到的原则。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;终止雇佣关系&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/what-to-do-after-being-laid-off&quot;>;受到与绩效无关的大规模裁员的影响&lt;/a>;，向面试官解释业务策略发生了变化，您的部门或团队在最新一波裁员浪潮中被解雇。您甚至可以积极地看待不幸的情况：“但这一直是一件幸事，因为我正在考虑寻找新的挑战。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您因表现而被解雇，显然您的雇主并不认为您是这样你的工作很成功，但也许你有不同的观点，或者觉得这个角色不是你所期望的。在这种情况下，您可以解释说这份工作与您想象的不同，并且没有以最有效的方式利用您的技能和能力。始终解释您从这次经历中学到了什么，以及您如何积极工作以确保您的下一步行动更接近您的期望。例如：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;我刚开始工作不久就知道这份工作并不像描述的那样，但既然我对公司做出了承诺，我想尽我最大的努力。最终，我的 A、B、C 技能没有得到有效利用，为业务带来价值。因此，我们友好地分开了，这使我能够花时间找到合适的工作，根据业务需求，我可以带来最大的价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;如果您处于有毒环境中或决定因任何其他原因辞职，不要将这种消极情绪带入工作面试中。从积极的角度看待你离职的原因，例如，“我需要集中时间来找到一份更符合我价值观的工作，但每周工作 60 小时，我找不到时间去做这件事。”最重要的是，永远不要说任何人的坏话，因为这种行为会让你看起来像一个只责备别人而不承担责任的人——而在新公司也可以这样做。现在是走正路的时候了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;自大流行以来，大多数雇主对简历差距更加理解和更少歧视 - 但你必须准备好清楚、自信、不绊倒地解释这些差距。掌握自己的职业轨迹意味着为招聘人员和招聘经理连接所有点。自己围绕任何差距进行叙述将有助于使它们不再成为问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;人工智能开发的竞争性质给组织带来了困境，因为优先考虑速度可能会导致忽视道德准则、偏见检测和安全措施。与工作场所人工智能相关的已知和新出现的问题包括错误信息的传播、版权和知识产权问题、网络安全、数据隐私，以及快速而模糊的法规。为了减轻这些风险，我们提出了在工作中负责任的人工智能的十三个原则。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/ 13-principles-for-using-ai-responsively?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/13-principles-for-using-ai-responsively?language =pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;无论你喜欢还是讨厌，人工智能的快速扩张不会很快放缓。但人工智能的失误&lt;a href=&quot;https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2022/01/the-reputational-risks-of-ai/&quot;>;可能会迅速损害品牌声誉&lt;/a>;——问问微软的第一个聊天机器人就知道了，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;>;泰&lt;/a>;。在科技竞赛中，所有领导者都担心如果自己放慢速度而其他人却没有放慢速度，就会被甩在后面。这是一个高风险的局面，合作似乎有风险，叛逃也很诱人。这种&lt;a href=&quot;https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/the-prisoners-dilemma/&quot;>;“囚徒困境”&lt;/a>;（博弈论中的说法）给负责任的人工智能实践带来了风险。优先考虑上市速度的领导者正在推动当前的人工智能军备竞赛，主要企业参与者都在竞相推出产品，并可能&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/tech-companies -cut-ai-ethics/&quot;>;短期改变关键考虑因素&lt;/a>;，例如道德准则、偏见检测和安全措施。例如，大型科技公司正在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/tech-companies-cut-ai-ethics/&quot;>;解雇人工智能道德团队&lt;/ a>; 正是在最需要采取负责任行动的时候。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样重要的是要认识到人工智能军备竞赛超出了 OpenAI、Google 和 Meta 等大型语言模型 (LLM) 的开发人员的范围。它包括许多利用法学硕士来支持自己的定制应用程序的公司。例如，在专业服务领域，普华永道 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/pwcs-4000-legal-staffers-get-ai-assistant-law-chatbots-gain- steam-2023-03-15/&quot;>;宣布&lt;/a>;正在为分布在 100 个国家/地区的 4,000 名律师部署人工智能聊天机器人。这些人工智能助理将“帮助律师进行合同分析、监管合规工作、尽职调查以及其他法律咨询和咨询服务。”普华永道的管理层也在考虑将这些人工智能聊天机器人扩展到他们的税务实践中。这家咨询巨头总共计划向“生成人工智能”（一种强大的新技术）投入 10 亿美元。工具能够提供改变游戏规则的绩效提升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样，毕马威推出了自己的人工智能助手，名为&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/companies/ professional-services/custom-chatgpt-tool-to-help-kpmg-s-consultants-win-new-work-20230321-p5cu3m&quot;>;KymChat&lt;/a>;，这将帮助员工快速找到整个组织的内部专家，将它们围绕即将到来的机会，并根据项目要求和可用人才之间的匹配自动生成提案。他们的&lt;a href=&quot;https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/media/press-releases/2023/03/kpmg-unveils-cutting-edge-private-chatgpt-software-march-2023.html&quot; >;人工智能助手&lt;/a>;“将更好地实现跨团队协作，并帮助公司新员工获得更无缝、更高效的人员导航体验。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slack 还将生成式人工智能融入到开发中&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-gpt&quot;>;Slack GPT&lt;/a>; 的一款人工智能助手，旨在帮助员工更聪明地工作，而不是更辛苦地工作。该平台整合了一系列人工智能功能，例如对话摘要和写作辅助，以提高用户的工作效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些示例只是冰山一角。很快，数亿 Microsoft 365 用户将可以访问 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work /&quot;>;商务聊天&lt;/a>;，一个让用户参与工作的代理，努力理解他们的 Microsoft 365 数据。员工可以提示助理做所有事情，从根据会议记录和电子邮件通信制定状态报告摘要，到识别策略中的缺陷并提出解决方案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能代理的快速部署就是&lt;a href= “https://fortune.com/2023/04/20/ibm-ceo-work-ai-artificial-intelligence-careers-tech-arvind-krishna/&quot;>;IBM 首席执行官 Arvind Krishna&lt;/a>; 最近写道“人们与值得信赖的人工智能合作将对我们的经济和社会产生变革性的影响……现在是我们拥抱这种伙伴关系的时候了——让我们的员工为人工智能所提供的一切做好准备。”简而言之，组织在安装人工智能驱动的工具方面正在经历指数级增长，而那些不适应的公司则面临着落后的风险。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;工作中的人工智能风险&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;不幸的是，保持竞争力还给雇员和雇主带来了重大风险。例如，2022 年&lt;a href=&quot;https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380861&quot;>;联合国教科文组织出版物&lt;/a>;关于“人工智能对女性工作生活的影响”报告称，人工智能例如，在招聘过程中，将妇女排除在晋升之外。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6491&quot;>;报告引用的一项研究&lt;/a>;，其中包括 21 项实验，涉及超过 60,000 个有针对性的招聘广告，发现“将用户的性别设置为‘女性’会导致与选择“男性”作为性别的用户相比，与高薪工作相关的广告实例较少。”尽管人工智能在招聘和聘用方面的偏见众所周知，但它不会很快消失。正如联合国教科文组织的报告接着指出的那样，“一项 &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3450077&quot;>;2021 年研究&lt;/a>;的证据表明，招聘广告因性别而存在偏差。即使广告商想要性别平衡的受众，Facebook 也是如此。”这通常是一个有偏见的数据问题，它将继续影响人工智能工具并威胁关键的劳动力因素，例如&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raconteur.net/responsible-business/ais-threat-to-diversity-equity-包容性/&quot;>;多样性、公平性和包容性&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;歧视性就业做法可能只是生成式人工智能使组织面临的一系列法律风险之一。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/openai-hit-with-first-defamation-suit-over-chatgpt-hallucination&quot;>;OpenAI 正面临着第一次因指控 ChatGPT 产生有害的错误信息而提起诽谤诉讼&lt;/a>;。具体来说，该系统生成了一个真实法庭案件的摘要，其中包括对佐治亚州一名电台主持人的挪用公款的捏造指控。这凸显了创建和共享人工智能生成信息对组织的负面影响。它强调了对法学硕士捏造虚假和诽谤性内容的担忧，从而导致声誉受损、信誉丧失、客户信任度下降以及严重的法律后果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了与诽谤相关的担忧之外，还存在与&lt; a href=&quot;/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem&quot;>;侵犯版权和知识产权&lt;/a>;。几个&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/&quot;>;备受瞩目的法律案件&lt; /a>; 已经出现，生成人工智能工具的开发者因涉嫌不当使用许可内容而被起诉。版权和知识产权侵权的存在，加上此类侵权行为的法律影响，给使用生成式人工智能产品的组织带来了重大风险。组织可能会在不知不觉中参与抄袭、未经授权的改编、未经许可的商业使用以及滥用知识共享或开源内容等活动，从而通过生成人工智能不当使用许可内容，从而使自己面临潜在的法律后果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能的大规模部署也放大了网络攻击的风险&lt;/a>;。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Generative-AI-the-next-biggest-cyber-security-threat&quot;>;网络安全专家担心&lt;/a>;可以使用生成式人工智能&lt;a href=&quot;https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_e69b334f-36d8-44b0-9f52-93ea6089aa5a&quot;>;识别和利用业务信息系统中的漏洞&lt;/a>;，给定法学硕士自动编码和错误检测的能力，恶意行为者可以利用它来突破安全障碍。人们还担心员工不小心与第三方人工智能提供商共享敏感数据。一个值得注意的例子是三星员工无意中 &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-generative-ai-tools-like-chatgpt-after-april-internal- data-leak/&quot;>;在使用 LLM 审查源代码时通过 ChatGPT 泄露商业秘密&lt;/a>;。由于他们未能选择退出数据共享，机密信息无意中被提供给了 OpenAI。尽管三星和其他公司正在采取措施&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/19/apple-joins-a-forming-list-of-companies-cracking -down-on-use-of-chatgpt-by-staffers-heres-why/&quot;>;限制在公司自有设备上使用第三方人工智能工具&lt;/a>;，但仍然存在员工可能通过以下途径泄露信息的担忧：在个人设备上使用此类系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了这些风险之外，企业很快将不得不应对新生的、多样化的且有些模糊的法规。例如，任何在纽约市招聘的人都必须确保他们的人工智能招聘和招聘技术不违反纽约市的“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-york- city-s-automated-employment-6844706/&quot;>;自动就业决策工具&lt;/a>;”法。为了遵守新法律，雇主需要采取各种措施，例如对其招聘工具进行第三方偏见审计并公开披露调查结果。随着拜登-哈里斯政府的“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/&quot;>;人工智能权利法案蓝图&lt;/”，人工智能监管也在全国范围内扩大a>;”以及国际上欧盟的&lt;a href=&quot;https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/&quot;>;人工智能法案&lt;/a>;，这将标志着雇主监管的新时代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种增长不断变化的法规和陷阱是模糊的，这就是为什么 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/your-7-biggest-chatgpt-questions-answered&quot;>;Gartner&lt;/a>; 等思想领袖强烈建议企业“继续前进，但不要过度转型”，并“成立一个向首席信息官和首席执行官报告的工作组”，以规划安全人工智能转型的路线图，以减轻各种法律、声誉和劳动力风险。应对这一人工智能困境的领导者需要做出重要决定。一方面，全面拥抱人工智能面临着紧迫的竞争压力。然而，另一方面，人们越来越担心，不负责任的人工智能的实施可能会导致严厉的处罚、严重的声誉损害和重大的运营挫折。令人担忧的是，在寻求保持领先地位的过程中，领导者可能会在不知不觉中将潜在的定时炸弹引入其组织，一旦部署人工智能解决方案且法规生效，这些炸弹就可能会造成重大问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如， &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/08/1180838096/an-eating-disorders-chatbot-offered-dieting-advice-raise-fears-about-ai -in-hea&quot;>;国家饮食失调协会 (NEDA) 最近宣布将解雇热线工作人员，并用新的聊天机器人 Tessa 取而代之。然而，就在进行转变的前几天，NEDA 发现他们的系统正在推广有害的建议，例如鼓励饮食失调的人限制卡路里摄入并每周减掉一到两磅。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/13/1074551/an-algorithm-intend-to-reduce-poverty-in-jordan-disqualizes-people-in-need/&quot;>;世界银行花费 10 亿美元开发和部署一个名为 Takaful 的算法系统，用于分配财政援助，人权观察现在讽刺地表示，这种援助造成了不平等。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-courts-e15023d7e6fdf4f099aa122437dbb59b&quot;>;两名来自纽约的律师&lt;/a>;在使用 ChatGPT 起草法庭文件后面临可能的纪律处分：发现有几处参考了以前不存在的案例。这些实例凸显了数字化转型的核心需要训练有素且得到良好支持的员工。虽然人工智能可以充当有价值的助手，但它不应该占据主导地位。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;工作中负责任的人工智能原则&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;帮助决策者避免为了避免负面结果，同时在人工智能时代保持竞争力，我们为可持续的人工智能驱动的劳动力制定了几项原则。这些原则融合了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/od/recr.jsp&quot;>;国家科学基金会&lt;/a>;等机构的道德框架以及与员工监控相关的法律要求和数据隐私，例如《电子通信隐私法》和&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecpra.org/&quot;>;加州隐私权法案&lt;/a>;。确保工作中负责任的人工智能的步骤包括：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;知情同意。 &lt;/strong>;在向员工提供有关该计划的所有相关信息后，获得员工​​自愿且知情的同意，以参与​​任何人工智能驱动的干预措施。这包括该计划的目的、程序以及潜在的风险和收益。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;利益一致。 &lt;/strong>;雇主和雇员的目标、风险和利益都得到明确阐述和协调。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;选择加入并保持一致。轻松退出。 &lt;/strong>;员工必须选择加入人工智能驱动的计划，而不会感到被迫或胁迫，并且他们可以随时轻松退出该计划，不会产生任何负面后果，也无需解释。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;对话透明度。 &lt;/strong>;当使用基于人工智能的对话代理时，代理应正式揭示系统旨在通过与员工对话实现的任何有说服力的目标。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;去偏见且可解释的人工智能。 &lt;/strong>;明确概述为消除、最小化和缓解人工智能员工干预中的偏见而采取的步骤（尤其是针对弱势群体），并就人工智能系统如何做出决策和采取行动提供透明的解释。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;人工智能培训和开发。 &lt;/strong>;提供持续的员工培训和发展，以确保安全和负责任地使用人工智能驱动的工具。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;健康和福祉。 &lt;/strong>;识别人工智能引起的压力、不适或伤害的类型，并阐明最大限度降低风险的步骤（例如，雇主如何最大限度地降低人工智能对员工行为的持续监控所造成的压力）。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>; &lt;strong>;数据收集。 &lt;/strong>;确定将收集哪些数据，如果数据收集涉及任何侵入性或侵入性程序（例如，在在家工作的情况下使用网络摄像头），以及将采​​取哪些步骤来最大程度地降低风险。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;数据。 &lt;/strong>;披露共享个人数据的任何意图、与谁以及原因。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;隐私和安全。 &lt;/strong>;阐明维护隐私、安全存储员工数据的协议，以及在发生隐私泄露时将采取的措施。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;第三方披露。 &lt;/strong>;披露用于提供和维护人工智能资产的所有第三方、第三方的角色是什么以及第三方将如何确保员工隐私。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;沟通。&lt;/strong>;告知员工了解数据收集、数据管理或数据共享方面的变化，以及人工智能资产或第三方关系的任何变化。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;法律法规。 &lt;/strong>;表示持续承诺遵守与员工数据和人工智能使用相关的所有法律法规。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;我们鼓励领导者在其组织中紧急采用和制定此清单。通过应用这些原则，领导者可以确保快速且负责任的人工智能部署。&lt;/p>;

&lt;li>;PCPs associated leadership roles with major resource constraints, evaporating both time and earnings potential.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;PCPs lamented the loss of camaraderie with other physicians when taking on leadership roles, feeling that the roles interrupted collaboration with peers and generated uncomfortable conflict.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Despite these concerns, PCPs are fundamentally poised to make an impact on the organizations they lead.了解并努力解决这些障碍的医疗保健组织将拥有明显的竞争优势。 They will be able to better engage and recruit PCPs in leadership and thereby reap the benefits of better &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1097/HMR.0000000000000173&quot;>;quality of care, higher patient satisfaction, and decreased provider burnout&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are three ways that health organizations can counteract these disincentives and support PCPs embracing leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Provide the On-Ramp&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs crave system change and personal growth, but often feel disempowered. They see their experience as valuable and want to leverage it to make a positive impact on the health care system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives and health administrators can tap into this motivation by framing leadership as a constructive opportunity to be a change agent. While organizations may not have the ability to alter a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/creative-job-titles-can-energize-workers&quot;>;position&#39;s specific title&lt;/a>;, the job description can be used to reflect openness to an entrepreneurial mindset and an opportunity for improving perceived system deficits.不要起草典型的（通常是枯燥的）行政职位描述，而是强调该职位将如何实现变革或解决医疗保健领域的主要障碍。 Postings should speak to a PCP&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicfootprints.org/7-top-tips-on-recruiting-doctors-to-non-clinical-or-leadership-roles/&quot;>;adaptability based on the breadth of their training and diversity of practice experience&lt;/a>;, and PCPs should be encouraged to apply.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using the frustration PCPs experience with the status quo and their frontline experience, health care organizations can promote vacant or novel leadership roles as opportunities to expand the impact on patients and to garner a broader scope of knowledge and expertise for PCPs identified as having leadership interest or potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Role Design and Definition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs want to grow and develop professionally, but our study showed that they also identified clear disadvantages in taking on leadership roles.简而言之，他们认为领导最不有吸引力的方面是“损失”。他们担心失去自主权、时间、亲密的患者关系以及与同伴的友情。 This can be due, in part, to their exposure to disappointing experiences observed in peers who have assumed leadership roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives and health administrators can help mitigate this with the use of strategic &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/why-managers-design-jobs-to-be-more-boring-than-they-need-to-be&quot;>;job design&lt;/a>;, where organizations create an optimal job role, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2001.4378011&quot;>;job crafting&lt;/a>;, which allows PCPs to define and customize their role themselves. These two complementary pieces of the puzzle yield large gains in employee satisfaction and fulfillment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When organizations realize that fear of loss is a major barrier, they are better positioned to design purposeful and motivating work for PCPs taking on leadership roles.为了解决失去自主权的问题，应有意构建该角色，以允许机构 PCP 根据其专业知识做出决策。对于那些担心浪费时间的人，可以设计该角色，以鼓励在如何实现目标方面采取灵活的方法，包括自由决定如何平衡临床职责与新的领导角色。 In order to address concerns about losing relationships, organizations must provide opportunities for leaders to meet with their colleagues in informal settings and encourage leaders to continue to be actively engaged as a member of their clinical team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empowering PCPs to engage in job crafting allows them to adjust aspects of the job to suit individual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-job-crafting-how-to-do-it-work-satisfaction-2022-6&quot;>;interests, values, and passions&lt;/a>;, making them more likely to be&lt;a href=&quot;https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Job-Crafting-and-Why-Does-it-Matter1.pdf&quot;>; engaged and more likely to thrive&lt;/a>; at work, while being successful in their leadership role. PCPs can independently alter the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/03/what-job-crafting-looks-like&quot;>;type and scope of tasks; relationships and with whom they work; and how to think&lt;/a>;, communicate about, or conceive of the job. When PCPs have some degree of ownership and authority over how the job is defined, they will have the opportunity to include more of their passion points, while also thoughtfully reducing those aspects of the job that are seen as pain points.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Tools, Training, and Mentorship&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;PCPs may want system change and growth, but they also need the tools, training, and mentorship to be successful. In most cases, PCPs &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/most-doctors-have-little-or-no-management-training-and-thats-a-problem&quot;>;aren&#39;t taught finance, accounting, management, or leadership skills&lt;/a>; in medical school, nor is there an emphasis on systems operations, despite the fact that, as physicians enter residency, they immediately begin leading medical teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are stark contrasts, both operationally and culturally, between &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/04/turning-doctors-into-leaders&quot;>;business and medicine&lt;/a>;.高管和卫生管理员应为 PCP 提供与现任管理员进行交叉培训的机会，并获得能够帮助过渡的导师。 Providing resources to support the transition into leadership can help highly qualified and motivated PCPs avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpearl/2016/02/04/five-reasons-why-even-the-best-of-physicians-may-fail-as-leaders/?sh=1c79323bce22&quot;>;common pitfalls than can derail&lt;/a>; their ability to influence others and be successful in their expanded role.

In this article, the author outlines three practices every business leader should embrace to enhance their board presentations: 1) Start with a governing thesis: a big idea or perspective that captures the main point of the discussion. Presentations that start this way leave the audience with a compelling message. 2) Understand that the CEO is not the target audience. A board presentation has to provide some quick refreshers on the operating environment and &amp;#8212; more importantly &amp;#8212; identify the biggest problems that need fixing. 3) Steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback. Instead of concluding remarks that restate key business results, share two or three important ideas that will drive future success and concerns that could benefit from director input. The goal: Get the board&amp;#8217;s validation or critiques of a proposed course of action. The result, invariably, is a mix of candid feedback and intelligent, probing questions that create thoughtful board engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-ways-to-nail-your-presentation-to-the-board?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For most executives, even those at the most senior level, a presentation to the board of directors is the most demanding test of leadership communications. Very few succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conversations with more than 100 public and private boards directors over the last decade reveal that dissatisfaction with presentations is nearly universal. PowerPoint decks are too long, too granular, or simply uninformative, they report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet the feedback most senior executives receive — “Make it crisper,” “Fewer slides,” “Don&#39;t get caught up in operational details,” or even “More details, fewer headlines” — is often generic and unhelpful. Operators are told they are insufficiently strategic; strategic leaders are criticized for having insufficient operational depth. Both directors and presenter leave frustrated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the advice offered by professional speaking coaches is just as likely to lead senior executives astray. “Enhance vocal delivery,” “Use fewer bullet points,” “Tell a story,” or similar well-worn coaching points are rooted in the belief that a board presentation is simply a matter of stagecraft — a variation of a keynote presentation to a customer audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This counsel reveals a misunderstanding about the purpose and value of board meetings. The boardroom is a distinct forum that requires a different type of presentation and preparation. It demands elevated exchanges that leverage both the knowledge of senior leaders and the objectivity of seasoned directors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having coached executives preparing board-level presentations for more than 15 years — including senior leaders auditioning to become the next CEO — I have concluded that the executive&#39;s most important task is to share their thinking about the business they lead. The goal is not just to report the results of the last quarter. (Directors can read that on their own.) Instead, the senior leader should engage the board by discussing the most pressing challenges they face and how they intend to respond.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While each board has unique needs shaped by the company&#39;s operating environment, below I suggest three practices every business leader should embrace to enhance their board presentations — and their own value within the upper levels of the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Bring a compelling message.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The senior executive who arrives in the board room has typically submitted a set of slides well in advance that has been carefully vetted by the CEO and the legal team. In most cases, directors will have already studied the material, or at least flipped through the main points. What, then, is the purpose of the 10 to 30-minute slot that has been allotted to the nervous presenter?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rushing through a slide review might be useful as a quick refresher, but it neither deepens the board&#39;s understanding of the topic nor showcases the leadership skills of the executive. Instead, every presentation should start with a governing thesis: a big idea or perspective that captures the main point of the discussion. Presentations that start this way leave the audience with a compelling message.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anne Mulcahy, who has served on multiple boards, including J&amp;amp;J, Target, LPL Financial, and Williams-Sonoma, has felt frustrated by the executives who want to convey too much data and information with a series of dense slides. “It almost seems like the objective is to demonstrate how much they know about their business, she says. “It has the opposite outcome. Directors don&#39;t know what the point of the presentation is supposed to be.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By contrast, a “thesis mindset” forces the presenter to confront the future rather than just reciting the facts of the past. The thesis-driven board presentation doesn&#39;t need to be an audacious proposal or a request for more funding. But it ought to frame an issue that requires board attention. At a minimum, the governing thesis tells directors: This is where I see my part of the company going. That idea can&#39;t be slipped into slide 19. It has to be stated unambiguously and boldly at the outset. At the very least, it provides insurance against off-topic interruptions or mid-presentation dozing.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Understand that the CEO is not the target audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;By the time they are asked to present to the board, a member of a senior leadership team has had plenty of practice leading discussions with the CEO. They may even be very comfortable updating their boss, in an informal way, with little preparation. Unfortunately, bringing the same mindset and habits to the boardroom is a crucial mistake.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I am always struck by how often business unit leaders come to the boardroom and direct their talk to their boss, rather than the directors assembled around the table,” said Scott Miller, who has been serving on public and private company boards for more than two decades. Miller&#39;s point is not merely a criticism of presentation style, but a recognition that senior officers rarely consider the needs of directors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The board of directors is a unique audience with no comparison to the groups most executives regularly engage. They are not customers who need to be sold. And they are not true business colleagues, where strategy alignment and deep familiarity with the operational details of the business can be assumed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A public company board may be compromised of business leaders, academics, former CEOs, current financial officers, and executives who bring expertise from entirely different industries. As a rule, their range of knowledge about the company and any given topic will vary greatly. Some have been serving on the board for well over a decade; others may be attending their third or fourth meeting. There is also an unspoken (and sometimes unknowable) hierarchy on the board, with its own unstated group of alliances and range of authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ron Sugar, the lead director of Uber who also serves on the boards of Apple, Chevron, and Amgen, advises that the job of the presenter “is to fly at the right altitude” in the boardroom: “Dumb it down too much, and you risk insulting the directors. On the other hand, no board wants to be a working group. They want to understand what issues need to be on their radar screen.” He suggests planning to use half the allotted time so that the main point is reached quickly and discussion can follow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugar&#39;s advice is sound. A board presentation has to provide some quick refreshers on the operating environment and — more importantly — identify the biggest problems that need fixing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These problems will be familiar to the CEO (who should never be taken by surprise in the boardroom). The directors, however, need both a reminder of the core issues in an executive&#39;s portfolio (talent, operations, regulation, or a particular geography) along with looming challenges. Too many executives miss the opportunity to frame problems in the right way — and make their presentations far less engaging than they should be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of presenting challenges is not to frighten the board but to enlighten them and engage them in the operational and strategic questions that preoccupy the person presenting the material.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_us/board-matters/how-to-increase-the-boards-impact-and-value&quot;>;2022 study&lt;/a>;, EY&#39;s Center for Board Matters found that public company directors felt confident they added value to discussions of capital allocation and succession. But very few felt the top value they delivered came in areas such as revenue growth, innovation, or disruption. Ironically, these latter topics are most frequently what executives are asked to address when they invited into the boardroom.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Effective leaders can help rebalance the value that directors ought to derive from a board meeting by setting up genuine discussions that invite reaction and input. Alas, too many board presentations come to an abrupt conclusion followed by a quick call for “any questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following a presentation, many business unit leaders complain they find themselves falling down a rabbit hole of technical details triggered by an unexpected and mostly irrelevant question from a persistent director. In most instances, the blame is entirely on the presenter. They are ones who failed to set up the right conversation and missed the opportunity to steer the presentation toward getting valuable feedback from the board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Randy Foutch, the former CEO of Laredo Petroleum, who has sat on many small and large company boards, believes that many executives “miss the opportunity to solicit feedback from the directors with relevant experience.” He has seen so many executives wary of raising questions with directors that they leave directors silent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet driving a sophisticated conversation that promotes “good questions” is the unspoken mandate of robust board presentations. Instead of concluding remarks that restate key business results, a confident executive should share two or three important ideas that will drive future success and concerns that could benefit from director input. In other words, the presenter must sincerely seek out the board&#39;s point of view by posing questions that remain unresolved or business risks that will persist. The goal: Gt the board&#39;s validation or critiques of a proposed course of action. The result, invariably, is a mix of candid feedback and intelligent, probing questions that create thoughtful board engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During an interview, Frank Blake, the former CEO of The Home Depot, described the typical tone of a meeting between an on-the-ground store team and chief executive who has stopped by for a visit. “What the CEO will always hear is some version of: &#39;You&#39;re doing great. We&#39;re doing great. Now leave.&#39;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same tone of forced cordiality — and unproductive feedback — has become the all-too-common standard for board presentations delivered by senior executives. They represent missed opportunities to elevate a company&#39;s board discussions and ensure that both the top team and the directors are getting the greatest intellectual value and leadership insight from every conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Managers Can Make Time for Their Own Development]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-managers-can-make-time-for-their-own-development]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_29_sb10065848cx-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Diamond Sky Images/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Managers today must balance their day-to-day work with multiple &amp;#8220;ands,&amp;#8221; such as delivering on quarterly objectives &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;thinking strategically. Given these numerous demands, managers tend to deprioritize their own career development. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be that way. The more managers take control of their development, the better able they&amp;#8217;ll be to avoid the common career mistakes that will get in the way of their growth. And the more their team members see the positive impact of investing in their career development, the more likely they are to do the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-managers-can-make-time-for-their-own-development?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-managers-can-make-time-for-their-own-development?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Being a successful manager today is a tough task that requires grappling with multiple “ands”: Supporting team members &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;influencing senior stakeholders; making progress on the day job &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;troubleshooting unexpected problems; delivering on quarterly objectives &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;thinking strategically. In the midst of the “and overload,” it&#39;s not surprising that managers tend to be the least-likely people in an organization to prioritize their own career development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through our global work on “squiggly” and nonlinear careers, we support thousands of managers every year who share a sense of frustration that their career development is stalling but struggle to find the time to invest in their own learning. We&#39;ve observed three common career development mistakes managers make and uncovered a few tried-and-tested solutions to help them balance the demands of the day-to-day with investing in their own development.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. The Say-Do Development Gap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Our clients often tell us that they find coaching and supporting their team members&#39; career development to be a motivating and enjoyable part of their managerial role — and yet they undervalue the importance of modeling this behavior themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When teams don&#39;t see their manager investing in their own development, it creates a “say-do” development gap, which has a negative ripple effect for both managers and their teams: Team members lose confidence that committing time to their career development is the right thing to do and may even question whether their manager really values continual learning. At the same time, managers miss out on important moments to develop skills and capabilities to improve their performance and support their ambitions for the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do differently: Share learning goals&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One simple and effective way for managers to avoid the say-do development gap is to share their learning goals openly with their teams. Sharing development priorities has multiple benefits. First, it prompts managers to identify what development they want to focus on, and sharing their goals increases accountability. Second, involving team members means that managers are surrounding themselves with more people to support their development and removes the idea that learning from others is linked to levels and hierarchy. Finally, when team members see their managers setting and sticking to development goals, it prompts them to do the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a manager who shares a learning goal to increase their internal profile might benefit from a team member spotting an opportunity for them to speak at an event. A manager looking to develop their ability to use data to drive decisions could be supported with feedback from their team members on what they currently do well and what could be better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When approached in this way, development doesn&#39;t need to be another thing that gets added to a manager&#39;s to-do list; it becomes part of their daily work and is accelerated by the people who work for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. The Bubble Barrier&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With so many demands on their workdays, it&#39;s understandable that managers rarely spend time on development outside of their organization. The challenge of finding the time and opportunity to learn in different places and with new people often feels insurmountable and falls into the category of “should do” rather than “will do.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on internal-only development results in managers developing a narrow view of the world and limits their learning. And operating in the bubble of internal knowledge and networks means that managers are reenforcing who and what they already know rather than cultivating their curiosity. Managers need to learn beyond the internal bubble so that it doesn&#39;t become a barrier to their growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do differently: Knowledge-swap sessions&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An efficient way to bring the outside in is to approach peers in a non-competing organization to co-host a team development session, where both teams share their expertise with each other. For example, a team with agile expertise could knowledge-swap with a team that has strong communication capabilities. Or an established team in a large organization might spend time with a team from a smaller startup, exchanging insights on innovation in different operating contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-sidebar data-sidebar-alternate=&quot;sidebar&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Example agenda items for knowledge-swap sessions&lt;/h4>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“What if?” wall:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares an idea or objective they&#39;re working on, and the other organization creates a “what if?” wall of questions to spark new thoughts. For example: What if you were famous for your customer service? What if your product sold twice as much as it does today?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Day in the life:&lt;/strong>; One person from each team describes the reality of a day in their life. This helps create a sense of connection between people, especially when the speaker includes non-work activities. For example: I started my day by taking my five-year-old to the dentist where he decided to scream the place down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mistake moments:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares a mistake moment they&#39;ve had and what they learned. This can help teams preempt potential problems and recover quickly when they happen. For example: We were communicating across too many technology platforms and people were getting overwhelmed and missing important information. The team created a communications policy that helps people feel more in control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pride postcards:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares one thing they&#39;re proud from the past few months and how they came together to achieve it. This inspires the other team with the art of the possible and gives them practical insights on how to make it happen. For example: We introduced a new well-being policy for our organization that got featured in the media as an example of best practice. The three things that helped us most were… &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Surprise stories:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares an example of something about their organization or function that might surprise others who aren&#39;t on “the inside.” This gives teams ideas for what they can do differently. For example: In our organization, everyone gets an extra day of holiday on their birthday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Superpower swaps:&lt;/strong>; Each team shares one of their superpowers and three top tips on how to develop that skill. For example: One of our superpowers is problem-solving, and our three top tips are to use your strengths to solve problems, hold problem-solving hack sessions, and pair people up on problems.&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/article-sidebar>; &lt;p>;These knowledge-swap sessions allow everyone to spend time in a different working world, create new connections, and learn together (which also supports overcoming the say-do gap). The format of a swap session can range from a virtual hour over lunch to a full day in a room. Holding knowledge-swaps gives managers — and their teams — regular opportunities to learn from people outside the organization in a way that&#39;s part of their existing rhythm of work, rather than something extra to squeeze in.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. The Time Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We often hear managers say: “I don&#39;t have time to invest in my development. I&#39;ll get around to it when everything calms down, or when this project has finished, or when I&#39;ve recruited this person, etc.” This way of thinking means keeps many managers stuck in a time trap, which will hold their career back over the long-term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These time traps aren&#39;t a result of managers making excuses — they reflect the reality of the challenges they&#39;re dealing with. The mistake is the hope that one day we&#39;ll magically have more time and fewer things to do. If managers look for the perfect moment to focus on their development, they&#39;re likely to be left waiting and stagnating in their career.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do differently: Manager micro-learning moments&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Many people still associate development with formal learning methods like taking a course. But what managers need are small, easy ways to make development part of their day-to-day. Practicing micro-learning moments is a memorable and simple way for managers to kickstart the habit of continual improvement. Effective micro-learning moments usually take less than 10 minutes, and they&#39;re small but significant in their impact, as managers benefit from a compound effect of continual learning over time. Here are a few examples:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Fast feedback:&lt;/strong>; Ask your team members to answer the same fast feedback question: &lt;em>;What three words would you use to describe me at my best? &lt;/em>;This simple question gives managers instant insight into whether their intent is matching their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;One-minute weekly review:&lt;/strong>; End your week by spending one minute jotting down the answers to these two self-awareness questions: &lt;em>;What has given me the most energy this week? What could have been better this week?&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Strength accelerator: &lt;/strong>;Pick one skill you want to strengthen and identify an action related to either regularity (how could you use that strength more?), range (where else could you use that strength that you don&#39;t today?), or reach (who could you share that strength with?).&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The more managers take control of their development, the better able they&#39;ll be to avoid the career mistakes that will get in the way of their growth. And the more their team members see the positive impact of investing in their career development, the more likely they are to do the same. Helping managers helps everyone succeed in their squiggly careers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Find the Time to Connect with Colleagues When You&rsquo;re Very, Very Busy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/how-to-find-the-time-to-connect-with-colleagues-when-youre-very-very-busy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_28_482824941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HollenderX2/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;A consequence of our often never-ending to-do lists at work is the loss of camaraderie among coworkers. While productivity is important, the balance between task completion and taking the time to connect with your team is essential in avoiding burnout and making work more enjoyable. The common misconception is that there simply isn&amp;#8217;t enough hours (or energy) in the day to get your work done and socialize; the reality is that just a quick slack message, coffee run, or group share in the beginning or ending of a meeting are all simple yet impactful acts that require minimal effort and time and thus make the former argument null and void. Studies show that socializing, despite feeling like a daunting task, can be effective in combating mental fatigue by energizing us. Increased energy improves performance and therefore proves socializing to be even more beneficial than the head down work one might prioritize over fostering those connections with colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-find-the-time-to-connect-with-colleagues-when-youre-very-very-busy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-find-the-time-to-connect-with-colleagues-when-youre-very-very-busy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re feeling behind on tasks and pressed against deadlines, catching up with and connecting with colleagues is about the last thing you feel like doing. You just want to put your head down, check off tasks on your to-do list, and get things done.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are absolutely times when you should put on blinders and focus solely on your tactical objectives. But exclusively interacting in a transactional manner with your coworkers could cause you to lose any sense of personal connection, especially if you work remotely. By taking even a few minutes each day to foster a sense of rapport at work, you could unlock the key to a &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/to-be-happier-at-work-invest-more-in-your-relationships&quot;>;greater sense of purpose and well-being, reduce burnout, and even improve your performance.&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So how do you make time for people without feeling more stressed and overwhelmed? As a time management coach, I&#39;ve seen that with just a little more intention, you can make much more meaningful connections without investing much time.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Chat in One-on-One Meetings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you already have one-on-one meetings scheduled with your team, take a few minutes at the start of the discussion to find out how they&#39;re doing before jumping to the business agenda. You don&#39;t need to spend the whole time on personal updates, but even reserving five minutes to ask about their recent vacation, find out if their mom is out of the hospital, or to see how they&#39;re recovering from surgery can make a difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can use the same strategy for one-on-one meetings with colleagues who you regularly work with on projects. Depending on the length of the meeting and how much you need to cover, you may not have time to catch up each time. But if every few meetings you use a few minutes at the beginning or end to talk about more than the projects at hand, you can strengthen those ties. This could include bonding over your excitement about a particular sports team, talking about your families, or discussing anything else that gives you space to connect beyond a one-dimensional, task-oriented level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If remembering details about people&#39;s lives doesn&#39;t come naturally to you, make a private note in your calendar with memory cues, such as asking them about their new puppy, about their kids&#39; latest extracurriculars, or how their side venture is going.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Encourage Group Sharing During Meetings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In a large team meeting, there won&#39;t be much space for personal catchups. But if you have a smaller team, it may be appropriate to take some time on a weekly or monthly basis for updates. This could be as simple as a quick share at the beginning of a meeting about a recent event, such as attending an industry conference. This can also happen organically if you work in person and have a specific forum designated for it: for example, if you bring in coffee and bagels on Monday mornings and have breakfast together, or if there&#39;s a Friday afternoon happy hour. Even 15 to 20 minutes of unstructured talk can lead to a greater sense of team engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re part of a remote or hybrid team, it may be harder to connect organically. Consider hosting a virtual happy hour or have a few people share during a team meeting. Just keep these updates short so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/irl/highs-lows-weekend-tiktok/&quot;>;the highs and lows don&#39;t turn into a viral meme&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Turn Breaks into Informal Social Time &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Grab a bite to eat with colleagues over your lunch break. Your meeting schedule may not allow a proper lunch break every day, but blocking out at least a couple of days a week where you&#39;re not multi-tasking at your computer can make your lunch more enjoyable and more social. This could be planned out in advance, where you meet up with someone in another department who you don&#39;t get to see often, or it could be more informal with a team member who works right by you. If you&#39;d like to have a relaxed approach, simply ask someone if they want to join you when you&#39;re heading out the door or reheating your leftovers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecloud.adobe.com/discover/article/a-science-backed-guide-to-taking-truly-restful-breaks&quot;>;Social breaks can also effectively combat mental fatigue&lt;/a>; in the mid-afternoon slump and help you feel refreshed for the final work stretch before you&#39;re done for the day. When you notice your eye lids drooping and your head bobbing, stand up and get moving. If you&#39;re in the office, this is an excellent time to walk the halls and connect with a few people or invite someone to grab a cup of coffee. Similar to lunch, you can stop by to chat with members of your own team or drop in on a different department. The movement and conversation will wake you up and serve as a time of connection and potentially internal networking. If you&#39;re working remotely, send a friendly Slack message to a colleague, rather than turning to scroll social media. Even if they&#39;re too busy to respond, they may offer to catch up with you later.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make Calls During Your Commute &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you commute into the office or travel for business, some of your travel times could offer an ideal opportunity to catch up in an informal manner with colleagues. One of my clients who was an executive with a packed meeting schedule used his drive home to reach out and have informal conversations with his leaders. This helped him get a more personal view on their thoughts and concerns, as the company was going through a major transition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re on the road, you can call from airports, Ubers, or hotels or send messages when you&#39;re waiting in lines or on trains. Even a five- to 10-minute conversation can increase your rapport and, most importantly, show that you care.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Take Advantage of Virtual Messaging &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re working exclusively remotely, the options for informal social connection will be limited. In these cases, you can simply send a quick chat message or text asking how someone is doing or share a quick update with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These conversations can end up taking a lot of time if you&#39;re not conscious of how long they go, so you&#39;ll want to limit how frequently you engage in purely social messaging. But reaching out a few times a week can be fun and help you feel connected. Consider pinging people at natural times when you would have said “Hello!” to coworkers in the past, such as when you first get to your desk, around lunch, or when you&#39;re waiting for a meeting to start.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be a challenge to find time to talk with people when you barely feel like you have time for completing tasks and projects. But there are benefits to connecting with your coworkers. Rather than keeping your head down and focusing only on work, find those pockets of time in your schedule where you can thoughtfully connect with colleagues.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 28 Jun 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Steps to Prepare Your Culture for AI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/3-steps-to-prepare-your-culture-for-ai]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;平台向 AI 的转变正在顺利进行。虽然它有望改变工作方式并赋予组织竞争优势，但如果没有拥抱好奇心、失败和学习的文化，就不可能实现这些好处。领导者处于独特的地位，可以在当今的组织内培育这种文化，以便让他们的团队为未来的成功做好准备。当与人工智能的能力相结合时，这种文化将为每个人开启更美好的工作未来。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;作为商业领袖，今天我们发现自己处于一个非常熟悉的地方：陌生。正如我们引导我们的团队转向远程和灵活工作一样，我们现在正处于另一个巨大转变的边缘：人工智能。就像向灵活工作的转变一样，组织接受人工智能首先取决于文化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作的节奏和数量呈指数级增长，我们都在其重压下挣扎。 。领导者和员工都渴望人工智能能够减轻负担。这是我们的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work&quot;>;2023 年工作趋势指数&lt;/a>;的关键要点，该调查对 31 个国家/地区的 31,000 人进行了调查，并分析了 Microsoft 365 中数万亿个聚合生产力信号以及 LinkedIn 上的劳动力市场趋势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接受调查的员工中近三分之二告诉我们他们没有足够的时间或精力来完成他们的工作。我们在报告中将这种消耗的原因确定为数字债务：数据、电子邮件和聊天的涌入已经超出了我们跟上的能力。如今，员工将近 60% 的时间用于沟通，只有 40% 的时间用于创造和创新。在创造力成为新生产力的世界中，数字债务不仅是一种不便，而且是一种负担。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能承诺通过让员工专注于最有意义的工作来解决这种负担。根据我们的研究，提高生产力、简化重复性任务和提高员工福祉是领导者希望从人工智能中获得的三大好处。值得注意的是，由于担心人工智能将取代工作岗位，减少员工数量被排在最后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成为人工智能驱动的组织将需要我们以全新的方式工作。作为领导者，我们今天可以采取三个步骤，让我们的文化为人工智能驱动的未来做好准备：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;选择好奇而不是恐惧&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;人工智能标志着人类与人类之间的新互动模式电脑。到目前为止，我们与计算机交互的方式类似于我们与计算器交互的方式：我们提出问题或给出指示，然后计算机提供答案。但有了人工智能，计算机将更像是副驾驶。我们需要共同发展一种新的化学反应，学习何时以及如何提出问题以及事实核查答复的重要性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;恐惧是对变化的自然反应，因此员工可以理解对人工智能对他们的工作意味着什么感到有些不确定。我们的研究发现，虽然 49% 的员工担心人工智能会取代他们的工作，但人工智能的前景大于威胁：70% 的员工非常愿意委托人工智能来减轻他们的工作量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在恐惧中行动很少能得到好处。通过培养好奇心文化，我们可以让员工了解人工智能的工作原理，包括其功能和缺点。这种理解始于第一手经验。鼓励员工通过（安全可靠地）尝试新的&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/reinventing-productivity/&quot;>;AI 工具&lt;/a>;（例如由 AI 驱动的&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&amp;amp;OCID=MY0291&amp;amp;q=Bing+AI&amp;amp;showconv=1&quot;>;搜索&lt;/a>;、智能写作帮助或智能日历，以仅举几个例子。由于每个角色和职能都有不同的方式来使用人工智能并从中受益，因此要求他们在熟悉这些工具后重新思考人工智能如何改进或转变流程。从那里，员工可以开始解锁新的工作方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;拥抱失败&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;人工智能将改变几乎所有工作，几乎每种工作模式都可以从某种程度的人工智能增强或自动化。作为领导者，现在是鼓励我们的团队将创造力重新构想工作的时候了，采用边测试边学习的策略来寻找人工智能能够最好地帮助满足业务需求的方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能赢了。不可能每次都正确，但即使是错误的，它也是&lt;em>;有用&lt;/em>;的错误。它至少能让你从一张白纸向前迈出一步，这样你就可以直接进入审阅、编辑或增强的批判性思维工作。学习这些新的工作模式并确定哪些流程需要改变以及如何改变需要时间。但是，如果我们创造一种文化，将实验和学习视为进步的先决条件，我们就会更快地实现这一目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为领导者，我们有责任为失败创造合适的环境，以便我们的团队能够成功。人们有权进行实验，以发现人工智能如何融入他们的工作流程。根据我的经验，这包括庆祝胜利以及分享经验教训，以帮助彼此避免浪费时间学习相同的教训两次。无论是正式还是非正式的方式，为人们分享知识创造空间——例如，通过在部门内众包一本快速指南，或者将人工智能技巧作为每月全体员工会议的常设议程项目。敏捷运营将成为人工智能驱动的组织的基本原则。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;成为万事通&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我经常听到这样的担忧：人工智能将成为拐杖，提供捷径和解决方法最终会削弱创新和参与度。在我看来，人工智能的潜力远不止于此，对于那些深思熟虑地使用它的人来说，它将成为一种竞争优势。这些人将成为您最敬业、最具创新精神的员工。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您从人工智能中获得的价值取决于您投入的价值。简单的问题将得到简单的答案。但复杂的、发人深省的问题将带来更复杂的分析和更大的想法。价值将从拥有所有正确答案的员工转移到知道如何提出正确问题的员工。未来的组织将重视能够对人工智能生成的内容进行有效推理的分析思考者和问题解决者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在 Microsoft，我们相信博学多才的心态将使我们走得更远。一位无所不知的人。虽然使用人工智能的学习曲线可能令人望而生畏，但它是一种必须随着时间的推移而增强的肌肉——我们今天就应该开始加强它。当我与领导者谈论如何在公司和团队中实现这一目标时，我告诉他们三件事：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;建立护栏，帮助人们安全、负责任地进行实验。您鼓励员工使用哪些工具，哪些数据适合输入，哪些数据不适合输入。他们在事实核查、审查和编辑方面需要遵循哪些准则？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;学习使用人工智能需要是一个持续的过程，而不是一次性的培训。将学习机会融入您的业务节奏，让员工了解最新资源。例如，一个团队可能会在周五下午安排学习时间，而另一个团队则每月安排“办公时间”进行人工智能问答和故障排除。并超越传统课程或资源进行思考。点对点知识共享（例如午餐和学习或数字热线）如何发挥作用，以便人们可以互相学习？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;拥抱变革管理的需求。有意和有计划对于成功采用人工智能至关重要。确定成功的目标和指标，并选择人工智能冠军或试点项目负责人来帮助实现愿景。在人工智能方面，不同的职能和学科会有不同的需求和挑战，但当我们都转向新的工作方式时，一个共同的需求将是结构和支持。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;平台向人工智能的转变正在顺利进行。虽然它有望改变工作方式并为组织带来竞争优势，但如果没有拥抱好奇心、失败和学习的文化，就不可能实现这些好处。作为领导者，我们拥有独特的优势，可以在当今的组织内培育这种文化，以便让我们的团队为未来的成功做好准备。 When paired with the capabilities of AI, this kind of culture will unlock a better future of work for everyone.&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;作为一名 DEI 策略师，我经常从与我合作的组织中的人员那里听到此类评论。他们并不罕见。这些情绪表明，随着企业参与 LGBTQ+ 事业的不断发展，善意的高管与 LGBTQ+ 员工、消费者和社区之间的脱节日益严重。消费者和员工越来越要求企业遵守&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/06/were-entering-the-age-of-corporate-social-justice&quot;>;更高的标准&lt;/a>;，这使得他们的惠顾取决于品牌的内部表现LGBTQ+ 人群的外部待遇与他们华丽的营销相一致，并呼吁他们进行&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a43713768/rainbow-washing/&quot;>;彩虹清洗&lt;/a>;他们失败了。与此同时，&lt;a href=&quot;https://acleddata.com/2022/11/23/update-fact-sheet-anti-lgbt-mobilization-in-the-united-states/&quot;>;戏剧性峰值&lt;

&lt;p>;这些因素的结合意味着，现在，正如 LGBTQ+ 员工和社区、民权倡导者以及具有社会意识的消费者希望雇主采取行动支持他们之前支持 LGBTQ+ 的承诺一样，一些雇主&lt;a href=&quot; https://nypost.com/2023/05/04/anheuser-busch-ceo-disavows-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-ads/&quot;>;否认他们的 LGBTQ+ 合作伙伴关系&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.npr.org/2023/05/24/1177963864/target-pride-month-lgbtq-products-threats&quot;>;删除骄傲主题商品&lt;/a>;，以及&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/06/23/starbucks-union-workers-are-striking-after-accusing-firm-of-banning-pride-decorations/?sh=371a510a511b&quot;>;禁止骄傲装饰&lt;/ a>;.&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;尽管有这些明显的好处，领导者可能仍然不确定未来如何-证明他们在敌对的社会和政治环境中对 LGBTQ+ 包容的承诺。答案在于将他们的行动植根于组织的宗旨、价值主张和价值观，从而将支持 LGBTQ+ 的支持长期融入到组织的身份中。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.将 LGBTQ+ 包容性与您的客户群、运营和价值观联系起来。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;虽然大多数消费者现在期望品牌在社会和政治问题上采取立场，但这并不像发布一次性社交媒体帖子或公然以利润为动机的营销活动那么容易。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/brands-creating-change/&quot;>;关于社会问题的品牌传播研究&lt;/a>;发现，消费者认为品牌最适合采取当涉及到品牌价值观、影响业务或影响品牌员工或消费者时，您应采取何种立场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面向未来的 LGBTQ+ 包容性需要积极主动地了解 LGBTQ+ 群体的需求，以及您的 LGBTQ+ 群体的需求。非 LGBTQ+ 客户以及客户对 LGBTQ+ 问题的看法。然后，您需要了解您的运营如何影响 LGBTQ+ 社区，以找到独特的重叠部分和采取行动的机会。如果您有 LGBTQ+ 客户，您可能会开发满足他们需求的产品。如果您与 LGBTQ+ 内容创作者或艺术家合作，您可能会利用他们的才能实现互惠互利。如果您有 LGBTQ+ 用户或客户，您可能会征求他们的反馈以开发更具包容性的产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了锁定这些努力，您需要根据组织根深蒂固的使命、目的来重新构建它们和值。如果您的组织坚定地致力于维护尊严，您可以将 LGBTQ+ 包容性作为保护所有客户和员工尊严的重要组成部分。如果您的组织坚定地致力于勇敢，您可以将 LGBTQ+ 包容性定义为承认勇敢反对迫害，并作为一个组织勇敢地发言。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总而言之，这意味着组织能够&lt;a href= &quot;https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/people/social-responsibility/lgbt-inclusion.html&quot;>;明确阐述&lt;/a>; LGBTQ+ 包容性的地位，因为它与其核心目的、价值相关主张和价值观将为他们的努力奠定坚实的基础，当政治风向转变时，这种基础不太可能动摇。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.协作设计有利于 LGBTQ+ 社区的举措。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;尽管品牌的骄傲月活动已经变得无处不在，但仅仅将产品交给 LGBTQ+ 影响者并让他们阅读剧本并不能特别引起 LGBTQ+ 人群的共鸣。如果做得不好，它可能会被认为是一种肤浅的宣传噱头，旨在从 LGBTQ+ 群体中获利，但却没有给他们带来真正的好处。此外，当这些举措似乎与组织的目的或价值主张脱节时，您的非 LGBTQ+ 选民可能会觉得您的社会立场是武断的——这为那些可能对 LGBTQ+ 人群存有偏见的人批评您的立场“打开了大门”。告诉他们应该怎么想。”&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你可以实际解决的问题&lt;em>;不是&lt;/em>;消费者、员工或其他人持有的信念范围而是社会事业、组织目的和选民需求的一致性。当举措或合作伙伴关系同时​​满足这三个方面时（例如，由客户需求驱动并根据客户意见设计的骄傲月举措，旨在解决与企业核心服务相关的未满足需求），即使选民不属于直接以社区为中心的社区，他们可能会支持这一举措，或者在最坏的情况下，对这一举措持中立态度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顾问在 30 分钟的头脑风暴中吐出的机会主义营销策略已经过时了。设计&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2022/10/11/how-to-promote-inclusion--virgin-atlantic-removes-gendered-uniforms/?sh=74cb1f3355dd&quot;在这方面>;成功的举措&lt;/a>;需要与 LGBTQ+ 社区内外的成员进行深入合作，以确保该举措为目标社区创造价值，使其与组织的宗旨和身份保持一致，并测试它是否能够实现以预期的方式登陆观众。越多的三方成员能够推动并告知这一过程（无论是通过顾问委员会、焦点小组还是其他参与方法），这些举措就越有可能成功满足未满足的需求、创造价值并引起共鸣。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;强>;3。采取有目的的立场并捍卫它。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一旦您了解了社区的需求以及您的组织可获得的机会，就可以在您的品牌的全力支持下采取果断且有目的的行动。对于您发起的每一项倡议和活动，请讲述一个故事，说明并加强您所倡导的社会事业、组织的宗旨和选民的需求之间的联系。我们的目标是让任何熟悉您品牌的人都会说：“当然，他们会支持这一事业。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您的支持 LGBTQ+ 的举措遭到批评者的攻击，无论是反对者，该怎么办？通过抵制、社交媒体活动，甚至当面恐吓？执行将包容性举措与组织的宗旨、价值主张、核心价值观和选民需求保持一致的步骤并不是为了防止批评，而是为了为此做好准备。以这种方式准备，为领导者提供了面对批评时坚强站起来并做出回应所需的一切：“我们在与全球客户和员工社区的对话中设计了这一举措，并相信它不仅庆祝骄傲月，而且体现了我们坚定的信念并进一步推进了我们的核心使命。我们很自豪能够产生这种影响，并邀请您详细了解为什么这一举措对我们很重要。虽然如果您觉得我们没有达到目标，我们会提出尊重的不同意见，但我们不会容忍针对我们的团队成员或其他客户的骚扰或暴力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，组织仍然有可能犯错并撤回他们的倡议并道歉。但如果他们这样做了，那是因为他们在与自己的目的、价值主张和价值观保持一致、了解其选民和满足他们的需求的过程中犯了错误，而不是因为他们受到暴力威胁的压力。&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;使用此方法作为试金石。随着社会格局的变化，品牌、组织和领导者面临的期望也会发生变化。今天的“最佳实践”很可能在十年、五年甚至一年后变得无效，甚至适得其反。您的 DEI、ESG 和其他与社会问题相关的举措应该与时俱进，但您的承诺力度不应与时俱进。为了保持和加强员工、客户和其他成员对组织的信任，请使用这种目的和价值驱动的方法作为创建、重新审视和修改您的计划的试金石。在行动中，所需要做的就是回答以下问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;这个问题如何影响我们现有的目标以及我们服务的选民？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;对此的立场如何问题强化了我们现有的目标，并使我们的选民受益？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我们的选民希望我们如何在这个问题上采取行动，以我们的目标为中心并为他们创造价值？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p >;回答这些问题的一个后果是，您的组织最终不会对每个社会问题都采取立场，也不会以相同的程度参与每个事业或当前事件。它甚至可能因其在这些情况下的不作为而受到批评。但当它确实采取立场时，它将与其目的、价值主张、价值观以及员工、客户和其他选民保持密切一致。当它采取行动时，它将充分利用其组织身份和资源，即使面对阻力也不会动摇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最新一波反 LGBTQ+ 敌意浪潮令人震惊，但如果您的组织坚持不懈，坚定不移地践行其宗旨、运营及其服务对象，您将在一年中的每个月都恪守对 LGBTQ+ 包容的承诺。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div >; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

Lower cost of capital could not be the reason for higher P/B ratios for Indian subsidiaries.公司的资本成本受到其国家主权评级的限制。印度的信用评级为BBB-，远低于美国、德国和瑞士的AAA评级。 So, it is unlikely that all else held equal, an Indian subsidiary has a lower cost of capital than its parent located in a G7 country.因此，较高的市净率必定与更好的盈利能力和/或增长前景相关。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6, “335551620”:6、“335559731”:0、“335559739”:160、“335559740”:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;过去五年，联合利华印度公司收入的复合年增长率 (CAGR) 为 9.6%，是联合利华母公司 2.2% 的四倍。请注意，母公司的增长率包括印度子公司的增长率，如果没有印度子公司，其增长率会更低。 Turning to profitability, return on assets for the Indian subsidiary is 11% against 8% of the parent. What is surprising is that the higher profit margin for the Indian subsidiary, of 17%, against 13% of the parent.令人惊讶的是，由于其目标市场的购买力较低，联合利华的产品在印度市场的价格更便宜。更高的利润可能是由于更高的市场集中度和定价能力，但这似乎不太可能，因为来自多个来源的激烈竞争，包括高露洁等其他跨国公司、创新型本地竞争对手如&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Patanjali阿育吠陀&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;，以及针对同一市场的许多更便宜的替代品的可用性，包括来自非正规部门的替代品。因此，较高的利润率很可能是因为印度的生产和分销成本较低，事实确实如此。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot; ;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;同样的故事也发生在其他跨国公司身上。 Nestle India earned a profit margin of 14.2% as against that of its parent of 9.8% and did so while generating sales-to-assets ratio of 196% as against just 69% for its parent.西门子印度公司的利润率为 10.6%，而其母公司为 4.8%，销售资产比为 91%，而其母公司为 51%。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot ; 201341983：0，335551550：6，3355551620＆quot; 3355559731＆quot; 335559731＆quot：;＆quot;＆quot;：0，＆quot; 335559739 /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;这些数字表明几乎在所有方面&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;— &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot; auto&quot;>;即市场增长、资产利用率和盈利能力&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;— &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;印度市场提供了更具吸引力的前景与跨国公司的国内市场相比。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot; ;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;不断增长的印度市场&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;印度拥有快速增长的细分市场城市中产阶级消费产品。 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/india-urbanization-why-the-world-should-watch/&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot; >;世界经济论坛&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;对此进行了很好的总结：“从数量上看，21 世纪最大的城市转型......正在印度发生。” &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/middle-class-nearly-1/3rd-of-indias-population-to-be-2/3rds- by-2047-report/articleshow/95239621.cms&quot;>;印度&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;中产阶级比例&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;从 14 增加2005 年的 % 到 2021 年将增加到 31%，预计到 2047 年将进一步增加到 63%。类似的估计来自 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.frost.com/indias-macroeconomic-opportunities- 2030.html&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;霜冻和霜​​冻沙利文&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;估计，印度贫困人口比例将继续减少，而中产阶级人数在增长，其比例从 28.5% 增加一倍2019 年这一比例将上升至 2030 年的 53.8%。中产阶级的定义是年收入在 6,700 美元至 40,000 美元之间的印度家庭，以 2020 年美元计算，并根据购买力平价进行调整，相当于美国的 22,700 美元至 136,000 美元。由于印度人口基数庞大，即使中产阶级比例变化很小，也意义重大。位于 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/desa/india-overtake-china-world-most-populous-country-april-2023-united-nations-projects#:~ :text=24%20April%202023%20%2D%20China%20will,the%20population%20of%20mainland%20China.&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;14.3亿&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt; span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;，它现在是世界上人口最多的国家，大约是美国和欧盟人口总和的两倍。 (The populations of &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/popclock/&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;US&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; and &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/key-facts-and-figures/life-eu_en&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;EU&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; are 334 million and 447 million, respectively.)

Interesting, in 2030, the total consumption of US middle class is expected to be $4.7 trillion in purchasing power parity terms (in 2011 dollars), about the same as in 2015.

China is expected to become the world&#39;s largest middle class, with a consumption of $14.3 trillion.

In mid-2023 we&amp;#8217;re far from a settled state &amp;#8212; projected GDP growth in western markets is depressingly flat, inflation is proving to be rather stubborn, and those disruptions just keep on coming. It&amp;#8217;s tough to see a significant increase in marketing budgets in the near term. Gartner&amp;#8217;s annual survey of hundreds of CMOs charts the evolution of marketing spending over recent history, offering guidance for how enterprise leaders can deliver results and build the capabilities to fuel growth in a time of less.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/marketing-when-budgets-are-down?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/marketing-when-budgets-are-down?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Marketing&#39;s digital transformation brought with it unprecedented growth, both in the scope of the function and in its spending power. New channels, new technologies, and new capabilities demanded new levels of investment. But the good times couldn&#39;t last forever, and the pandemic ushered in a new, more austere era as budgets flatlined. This placed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing&quot;>;chief marketing officers (CMOs)&lt;/a>; under pressure to reduce spending on previously sacrosanct parts of their portfolio, such as marketing technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/495785/1158365?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBCMOSPENDSURVEY&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;Gartner&#39;s annual survey&lt;/a>; of hundreds of CMOs charts the evolution of marketing spending over recent history, offering guidance for how enterprise leaders can deliver results and build the capabilities to fuel growth in a time of less.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Nobody Got Fired for Spending on More Digital and Tech&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When did you first become &lt;em>;digital&lt;/em>;? I got my first job with the word “digital” in the title 20 years ago, which I guess makes me something of a digital marketing veteran. Back then I spent almost as long building business cases as I did activating campaigns. It&#39;s easy to forget, but making the switch from offline to digital in the mid-2000s was far from a no-brainer. Digital marketing leaders were always hungry for &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; — more budget, more technology, more data, more people, more attention from the leadership team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed this was the start of the period of more. Digitization hit marketing hard, and the possibilities to engage, connect, and transact with consumers and customers created a massive opportunity. It also created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/leadership-vision-chief-marketing-officer?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_CMOVISION2022&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;challenge for CMOs,&lt;/a>; who struggled to balance the budget demands of their plucky digital marketing leaders alongside non-digital leaders. And the former presented a compelling argument: We constantly extolled the virtues of digital as &lt;em>;the&lt;/em>; cost effective, measurable, and optimizable choice. By contrast, anything offline seemed stuffy, old-fashioned, and, well, analogue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Nobody Got Fired for Spending (Even More) on Digital and Tech&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The period of more lasted for quite a long time. Digital is a hungry beast after all, with a seemingly unending array of alluring tools, tech, talent, and channels. I became a marketing analyst back in early 2016 — a time when martech and digital channels accounted for a serious chunk of total marketing budgets. At that time, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/495785/1158365?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBCMOSPENDSURVEY&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey&lt;/a>; reported average enterprise marketing budgets at a whopping 12.1% of company revenue. More than a quarter of the total marketing budget was allocated to technology in 2016, and each of the top three channels ranked by spend were digital.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While 2016 may have represented a high watermark in terms of total marketing budget, it certainly wasn&#39;t an outlier — indeed, technology spend as a proportion of total marketing budgets peaked at almost a third (29.2%) of marketing budgets in 2018. And marketing budgets averaged an impressive 11.2% of company revenue between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Less, But Still More&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When we surveyed CMOs in early 2020, before pandemic lockdowns, CMOs couldn&#39;t have anticipated the full scale of the Covid-19&#39;s impact: demolished marketing budgets and disrupted customer journeys. But the pandemic also presented another boost for digital and technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/digital-iq-index-genius-brands?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_GENIUSBRANDSEBOOK&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;Brands&lt;/a>; that previously lagged their peers now had little choice but to switch to digital channels to engage and transact with locked-down audiences. Brands that had already invested heavily in digital had little choice but to further accelerate investments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, even when there was less, there was more. More e-commerce, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/multichannel-marketing-survey?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_MULTICHANNELMKTG&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;more digital channels&lt;/a>;, and more tech. When we surveyed CMOs in 2020, they reported that they were more likely to protect their investments in tech than other elements of the resource mix, such as paid media or agencies, as they believed tech would be an essential tool to help them grow post-pandemic — when we hit the “new normal.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Long Post-Covid Climb-Back&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Like a carrot dangling on the end of a stick, the “new normal” has been frustratingly out of reach over the last few years. The World Health Organization may have declared the end of the Covid-19 global health emergency, but we&#39;re still pretty far from normal. From the recent failures of major banks to the volatility of various social media platforms, these issues weigh on the minds of the entire C-suite, regardless of their level of exposure to their impact. This seemingly unending set of disruptions result in a number of anchors on growth for the enterprise:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Higher interest rates &lt;/strong>;impacting the ROI potential of new investments. In the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/recession-playbook-marketing-leaders?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_GMLRECESSIONPLAYBOOK&amp;amp;utm_term=ebook&quot;>;macroeconomic environment&lt;/a>;, investors are prioritizing profits and cash flow today rather than holding out for future growth. Higher interest rates are also weakening demand in the economy, dulling growth.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;A stubbornly difficult talent market&lt;/strong>; with higher rates of staff turnover, increasing competition for strategically important roles, reduced employee trust in management, and tensions regarding hybrid and remote working.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Lagging digital transformation&lt;/strong>;, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-19-gartner-says-89-percent-of-board-directors-say-digital-is-embedded-in-all-business-growth-strategies&quot;>;2023 Gartner Board of Directors Survey&lt;/a>; reporting that 81% of boards have not made progress toward or achieved their digital business transformation goals. Furthermore, a 2022 Gartner survey found that 67% of CFOs believe the last three years&#39; digital spending has not met enterprise expectations.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;While it&#39;s convenient to frame recent enterprise history in pre- and post-pandemic terms, another inflection point may also have occurred. Enterprises have pivoted from a period of concentrated investment in the tools and capabilities that support digitally led growth to an era when these investments need to start paying back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When technology investments and digital marketing are no longer cool and different, they&#39;re &lt;em>;mainstream&lt;/em>;. In Gartner speak, such investments have shifted from being the &lt;em>;system of innovation&lt;/em>; — transformative, disruptive, and largely unproven — to being the &lt;em>;system of record&lt;/em>; — where the prevailing strategic force is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/455982/1074604?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGOPERATIONS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;operational efficiency&lt;/a>;, and the enterprise expects predictability, reliability, and stability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;We&#39;re (Not) Going to Need a Bigger Boat&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;That brings us to 2023. Data from Gartner&#39;s annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey published in late May suggests that the era of more has come to an end. Firstly (and most obviously), it reveals that the marketing budgets of the 400+ North American and European CMOs we surveyed have not recovered to their pre-Covid peaks. In fact, gains reported in 2022&#39;s survey have slipped, with average budgets down from 9.5% of company revenue in 2022 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-22-gartner-survey-reveals-71-percent-of-cmos-believe-they-lack-sufficient-budget-to-fully-execute-their-strategy-in-2023&quot;>;9.1% in 2023&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps more worrying than the top-level budget trend is an apparent squeeze on marketing&#39;s spending power. Increasing costs (of talent and digital media) and decreasing yield (of marketing technology utilization rates) has created a marketing cost-of-living crisis akin to that experienced by consumers in many markets over the last 18 months. Simply put, each marketing dollar buys less. So, in very real terms, we&#39;ve switched from the era of more to the era of less.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial and psychological impact of the era of less can be heard loud and clear in the responses to this year&#39;s survey. More than 70% of respondents report that their enterprise lacks sufficient budget or resources to successfully deliver its marketing strategy in 2023. Seventy-five percent of respondents state that their enterprise is asking them to do more with less, and 86% report that they&#39;re under pressure to make significant changes to how marketing works to achieve sustainable results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most surprising findings from this year&#39;s survey relate to the enterprise growing impatient with technology investments. Three-quarters of respondents reported that they&#39;re facing pressure from the enterprise to cut investments in martech — unthinkable just a few years ago. What&#39;s more: The seemingly inexorable rise of digital media has stalled. When we look at the proportion of media spend allocated to digital versus offline channels, it&#39;s fallen one percentage point to 55% in 2023. In 2023 it&#39;s entirely possible to get fired for spending more on digital and tech. To misquote the classic 1975 film &lt;em>;Jaws&lt;/em>;: We&#39;re not going to need a bigger boat; we&#39;re going to need a more efficient one.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Adapting to the Era of Less&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;On the subject of classic &#39;70s cinema, Francis Ford Copolla famously said of his 1979 magnum opus &lt;em>;Apocalypse Now&lt;/em>;, “There were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.” This is not to say that CMOs have experienced the sort of excess Copolla is speaking of, but he does refer to one of the major challenges of more: Sometimes more can actually deliver less. Or, to flip this around, sometimes you can get more from less.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But delivering more with less is one of those terrible clichés — easy to say and significantly harder to achieve. It&#39;s challenging because more is the go-to state for most enterprise leaders. In the thousands of conversations I&#39;ve had with CMOs and marketing leaders over the years, a reasonable chunk entails a variation on the theme of “How can I build a business case to grow my marketing budget?” Another reasonable chunk? “How do I define the stuff I can afford to cut and the stuff I can&#39;t afford to lose?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answers to these fundamental questions cannot be found in shiny new technologies; rather, it&#39;s the strategic version of eating your greens. As a leader you need to have a firm plan that defines the scope of marketing and be painfully clear about how the function&#39;s scope ladders up to enterprise goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, your plan must be grounded in both the near-term actions that will deliver the leads and sales that keep the lights on today, alongside the investments that will contribute toward differentiation and growth tomorrow. This requires a nuanced story setting out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/three-techniques-to-prove-the-value-of-marketing?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_PROVEMKTGVALUE2023&quot;>;marketing&#39;s value &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/three-techniques-to-prove-the-value-of-marketing?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_PROVEMKTGVALUE2023&quot;>;proposition&lt;/a>; to the enterprise — how marketing delivers &lt;em>;return on objectives&lt;/em>; alongside &lt;em>;return on investment&lt;/em>;. And it requires an acceptance that the job of building this value story is not about econometric models or attribution analysis; these are a means to an end, not the end itself. It&#39;s about coming to a mutual understanding with stakeholders of how marketing delivers value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also about embracing and exploring the uncertainty that abounds and using the core strategic tools of scenario planning and sensitivity analysis to understand the prevailing issues that are material to success, enabling your team to develop strategic options that respond appropriately.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By returning to the first principles of sound strategic management, marketers will create a plan that rids them of the extraneous stuff, enabling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487268/1142263?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGSYMTAKEAWAYS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;focus on the right &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487268/1142263?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGSYMTAKEAWAYS&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;&lt;em>;less&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that&#39;s most likely to support the delivery of goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To frame this in a slightly different way, at Gartner we talk about how CMOs can free themselves from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-22-gartner-says-catalytic-marketing-allows-cmos-to-drive-profitable-growth-amid-macroeconomic-pressures&quot;>;tyranny of more&lt;/a>; by focusing on three key leadership traits:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Clarity.&lt;/strong>; Choicefulness matters. CMOs must make clear-eyed decisions on what will — and will not — be supported over the life of the strategy. Equal thought and consideration should be given to the initiatives that don&#39;t make the cut, and to clarity on why that&#39;s the case.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Courage. &lt;/strong>;Leaders must have the courage to ask difficult questions of their team. It identifies spurious assumptions, strategic sentimentality, and harmful cultural norms. For example, CMOs must dispel the sunk-cost bias of “just because we&#39;ve spent $100,000 on a program, it doesn&#39;t mean we should spend $100,000 more.” Similarly, CMOs must battle historic assumptions of value: Just because an investment made sense three years ago, it doesn&#39;t mean that the business case just rolls over year-on-year. All major investments should be able to justify themselves based on measurable contribution to &lt;em>;future &lt;/em>;goals, not those in the past.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Connection.&lt;/strong>; Success is almost always a collaborative endeavor. The start of successful collaboration is communication and understanding. CMOs must collaborate with CFOs, CSOs, CIOs, et al., with a clearly defined and shared understanding of how marketing&#39;s programs deliver against business objectives. Likewise, they must have an understanding of where marketing intersects with other functions in the value-creation process. Ditch the obscure metrics and three-letter acronyms so beloved of marketing. Translate brand speak into business speak to demystify marketing and increase connection.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Wait, But What About AI?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You may be asking “surely AI changes everything?” Perhaps the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/how-should-cmos-respond-to-chatgpt-today?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_YOY_GML_NPP_PR1_RECHATGPT&quot;>;transformative power of AI&lt;/a>; will usher in a new era of digital investment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reality is complicated for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, AI isn&#39;t particularly new to marketing — it&#39;s been there, hiding in your tech stack (and the tech stacks of your partners and agencies) for years. Second, while the promises of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/487667/1143179?utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_WBMKTGGENERATIVEAI&amp;amp;utm_term=wb&quot;>;generative AI&lt;/a>; amp up interest and enthusiasm, this is all happening at a time when utilization rates of technology have plummeted. Gartner&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/marketing-technology-survey-2022?utm_source=press-release&amp;amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GML_GB_2023_GML_NPP_PR1_MARTECHSURVEY22&amp;amp;utm_term=gi&quot;>;2022 Marketing Technology Survey&lt;/a>; reported that the utilization rate of martech is only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-03-gartner-survey-finds-marketers-utilize-just-42-percent-of-their-martech-stack-capabilities&quot;>;42%&lt;/a>;. So, for every dollar you spend on martech, you&#39;re utilizing less than half of the investment. Given marketing technology has consistently accounted for more than a quarter of the total marketing budget, this level of yield is more than a technology risk — it&#39;s a fiscal risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This level of fiscal risk doesn&#39;t prevent CMOs from looking at new technology solutions. But it should make them think really hard before plunging headfirst into new commitments.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Will There Ever be More &lt;em>;More&lt;/em>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The general rule of enterprise finance is that marketing budgets drop like a stone at the first sign of trouble and rise like a feather once the environment is more settled. In mid-2023 we&#39;re far from a settled state — projected GDP growth in western markets is depressingly flat, inflation is proving to be rather stubborn, and those disruptions just keep on coming. It&#39;s tough to see a significant increase in marketing budgets in the near term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the picture is somewhat mixed. Averages mask variances, and budgets differ significantly across industries and geographies. If you&#39;re a CMO marketing consumer goods, the chances are that your budget in 2023 is much healthier than your counterparts in financial services. And if you&#39;re based in Germany, the chances are that your budget is less healthy than your UK–based colleagues&#39;. However, across all industries and markets we surveyed in 2023, budgets lag pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What of 2024? Predicting the future has always been a fool&#39;s errand. Perhaps we will again see another era of more as new technologies, experiences, and channels open up brave new opportunities for marketing. And perhaps we&#39;ll have learned valuable lessons from the era of less that will make marketing lean and efficient, even with increased funding. Perhaps.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Managing Anxiety When There&rsquo;s No Room for Error]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/managing-anxiety-when-theres-no-room-for-error]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jul23_27_57363406.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;fStop Images - Brian Cassie/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When you work in roles where mistakes must be avoided at all costs &amp;#8212; think medical, security, financial, and transportation professions &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s easy to become terrified of making one. But there are ways to constructively reduce the risk of potential mistakes and reduce your anxiety. First, distinguish between critical and not-so-critical potential mistakes and focus on the former. Then adopt systems and habits to mitigate those threats. Get support from others to address your weaknesses, while also finding solutions that play on your strengths. Collaborate with others focused on the same issues. Address any self-sabotaging behaviors, like failing to ask for help. Reduce the distractions caused by small-error worries with small actions that eliminate most of them. And, finally, consider a hobby in which you can make consequence-free mistakes.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/managing-anxiety-when-theres-no-room-for-error?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/managing-anxiety-when-theres-no-room-for-error?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In some arenas, mistakes are par for the course and not very costly. It doesn&#39;t &lt;em>;really&lt;/em>; matter if a designer starts over several times before producing a beautiful cover image, an inventor tries a hundred prototypes before finding the one that works, or an entrepreneur pivots from one idea to another based on customer feedback. In these roles, failures are part of the path to success. In others, the stakes might be limited by one&#39;s lower level of responsibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what about roles in which perfection is expected? No one wants their neurosurgeon to make a mistake or their criminal defense lawyer to have an off day. Accountants can&#39;t file flawed financial statements with the IRS, SEC, or any other regulator. Some security roles are focused on surveilling for potential threats, and success means not missing any, ever. Your job may be in this category. Or maybe the consequences for getting something wrong at work aren&#39;t so dramatic, but you feel they are because of a mean boss, looming layoffs, or deep-seated anxiety.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you cope with the feeling that you simply can&#39;t screw up? My recommendation is to use strategies that reduce your chance of making a critical mistake while simultaneously reducing your worry about doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The basics of anxiety&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start with some basic background on how anxiety works. First, overthinking is not problem-solving. It paralyzes us more than it mobilizes us. Second, people often obsess about one particular type of mistake or threat while ignoring others because fear narrows our attention. Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gretchenrubin_one-of-my-aphorisms-is-action-is-an-antidote-activity-6651614263683137537-w-8Y?trk=posts_directory&quot;>;action is an antidote to anxiety&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jobs in which mistakes are costly or dangerous (like medicine, accounting, engineering, or security) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316156/the-anxiety-toolkit-by-alice-boyes-phd/&quot;>;sometimes attract people who are naturally conscientious&lt;/a>;, diligent, and good at getting things right. But the additional focus on being careful at all times can be hard for someone who already has that personality type. It&#39;s a bit like how a parent&#39;s admonition to “be careful” can make an already cautious or anxious child even more nervous. If your training or institution is focused on eliminating mistakes, that might intensify your perfectionism and anxiety.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s what you can do to lower the tension.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Distinguish between big and small mistakes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you think about every mistake you could possibly make, it will distract you from the ones you should most fear. You&#39;ll lighten your mental load if you regularly take actions that lessen the risk of making the worst mistakes. To figure out which to prioritize, consider ones that easily come to mind as well as those that are often overlooked, such as opportunity costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are several other, somewhat related categories of major risks people fail to see. One is what former Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld called “unknown unknowns”: risks from situations that are so unexpected they would not be considered. Another is “you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know,” which refers to blindspots you&#39;re not aware of having, or &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/05/discover-what-you-need-to-know&quot;>;when you think you understand something fully but you don&#39;t&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Put mechanisms in place to mitigate these risks. For example, schedule a monthly meeting with a colleague to discuss how you are approaching difficult cases as a way of uncovering any potential risks you&#39;re missing. Putting a recurring meeting on your calendar with the expectation you will discuss complex decision-making will ensure this gets done. Consider some examples and ask what similar situations you might face in your own role: Maybe you don&#39;t know that a student may interpret an instruction differently than you&#39;d intended, resulting in a dangerous situation in your lab. You don&#39;t know that a traveling nurse in your operating room will use a procedure they&#39;re familiar with rather than the one you routinely use, resulting in confusion or an important step being missed. You don&#39;t know that a software provider will roll out a buggy update the day before an important deadline and break systems you rely on. What could you do now to ensure those mistakes aren&#39;t made?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cautious people can retrain themselves to look for and ward off the most critical risks. But this requires a mental capacity to see beyond what others typically do and to tolerate uncertainty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Adopt risk-reducing systems and habits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Instead of thinking about reducing mistakes through willpower and by never having a bad day, create systems that don&#39;t rely on that type of unrealistic, robotic perfection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s evidence that basic strategies like &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/2010/01/using-checklists-to-prevent-fa.html&quot;>;checklists, for example, can reduce mistakes&lt;/a>; but are &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/02/draftwhat-sort-of-checklist-sh&quot;>;underutilized in particular fields&lt;/a>;. If you&#39;re looking for inspiration, consider how you adapt actions taken in other industries or roles. For example, medical devices such as heart monitors and ventilators often incorporate redundant sensors and alarms to detect malfunctions and provide timely alerts. How could people in your role get earlier or duplicate warning signals automatically? Industries like aviation have strict reporting requirements for near-misses. Should you do the same if an article nearly goes to print with a significant factual mistake or a project barely meets its deadline and only after staff pulls an all-nighter? What would be most useful and genuinely focused on learning rather than blaming? &lt;a href=&quot;https://toddkashdan.com/the-art-of-insubordination/&quot;>;Educate yourself on the science&lt;/a>; of how to build diverse teams that share opposing views, courageously speak up about concerns, and engage in healthy debate. Create a culture that rewards people for soliciting and positively reinforcing uncommon views. When someone points out something you didn&#39;t know you didn&#39;t know, take special care to encourage them to continue to do this in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Get support to address your weaknesses&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When I was a therapist, my weakest spot was always record keeping. I hated documenting. My mind worked quickly, and it felt like recording kept slowing me down. I preferred to put all my energy into face-to-face interactions with my clients. If I were ever in this role again, I&#39;d stop trying to improve in that area on my own and accept that I needed a support person to keep me on track with documenting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if you&#39;re the only one who knows how to perform critical roles and you&#39;re not good at systematizing your process, you might get help to do that. If you&#39;re not the best communicator but are making a must-win pitch to a client or boss, could you ask a mentor, friend, or even an AI chatbot with more of those skills to help you be more persuasive? Likewise, if conflict management isn&#39;t a strength, but team in-fighting threatens to derail a key project, perhaps you engage a consultant you can call on as needed to give, and maybe even implement, suggestions. Or, if your messy office presents a real risk of losing documentation, have a professional organizer come in and give you a fresh start every few months. Remember that it&#39;s not just your own willpower and diligence that will help you avoid mistakes. You can enlist a village of coworkers — and even friends, family, and technology — to help you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Play on your strengths&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645534/stress-free-productivity-by-alice-boyes-phd/&quot;>;often argue&lt;/a>; for using your strengths to mitigate your weaknesses, and this can extend to how you avoid mistakes. For instance, if you&#39;re visually creative you might create visual reminders, or if humor is a strength, then humorous ones. Just Google “funny airline safety video” for examples of how to make people pay attention to serious safety advice. If you&#39;re gregarious and good with people, how might you use that gift to extract information others might usually keep close to the vest, like telling you why you might not want to partner with a particular individual or group? If, by contrast, you&#39;re more introverted, how might you use your natural inclination to listen and observe more than speak to notice looming problems or make it more likely people will trust you enough to disclose concerns or errors without fearing you&#39;ll tell others? Consider how your top strengths can help you solve your particular problems. One question you can ask yourself to identify your uncommon strengths is: What are you willing to do that 95% of other people aren&#39;t?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Address self-sabotaging behaviors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When we&#39;re very anxious about something, we often self-sabotage in ways that increase the chances of the feared thing happening. For example, you know you&#39;ve got a weakness, but you don&#39;t seek mentors or supervisors who could help you address it because you don&#39;t want to draw attention to it. Or you don&#39;t ask for an accommodation for your depression due to embarrassment and stigma or a belief you should tough it out, but that increases the chances of making a mistake on a bad day. Or you hate wasting money, so you don&#39;t try an option that might solve the problem but isn&#39;t guaranteed. Or you&#39;re a perfectionist so you don&#39;t seek to solve a problem where improvements are possible but perfect seems impossible. Get creative about overcoming your self-sabotage, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/be-kinder-to-yourself&quot;>;talk to yourself compassionately about it&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Collaborate with others focused on the same issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When you think about mistakes, you may mostly do so on a personal or team level. “How can I prevent myself or a colleague from getting this important thing wrong?” But to seek out better solutions — and the camaraderie of a group that shares your fears — consider getting involved in larger efforts to reduce mistakes in your field, like sitting on a committee for complaints and disciplinary actions or one establishing new guidelines for people in your role. Teaching also usually improves our own practice, so consider finding opportunities to teach others about how your work is done in a way that minimizes or eliminates mistakes. Write a talk on this for an industry conference or host a panel.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Reduce small-threat distraction by taking simple actions to mitigate those risks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Though most of your focus should be on the biggest threats, some simple strategies can lessen the risk of small mistakes so they won&#39;t distract you from that focus. You&#39;ll want to take simple actions that help reduce the frequency of minor problems, and then accept that you can&#39;t eliminate all of them. Pick the low-hanging fruit. For example, if a doctor is worried about forgetting names of patients and family members, they might write the names down on the top of each page as they&#39;re taking notes during interactions. Address minor potential mistakes to the extent that they free up your mental capacity to think about and prevent larger ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Consider a hobby that allows you to make mistakes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To add some balance to your life, you might want to take up an activity in which mistakes and false starts aren&#39;t at all costly. For example, I&#39;ve recently taken up vegetable gardening, and it&#39;s refreshing to partake in an interest in which a low rate of success is perfectly acceptable. After all, a packet of a hundred seeds costs only a few dollars. A friend of a friend is an avid surfer, content to miss or bail out on dozens of waves to eventually get few good rides, which is a great antidote to his day job as a startup CFO trying to make sure the company doesn&#39;t run out of money.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When perfection is expected and mistakes are costly, it&#39;s easy to become terrified of making one. You might lose sleep over it or avoid leadership and increased responsibility. But there are ways to constructively reduce the risk of potential mistakes and reduce your anxiety.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
