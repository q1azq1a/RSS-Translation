&lt;span>;&lt;p>;员工资源小组对于培养归属感和提升潜力至关重要，他们需要支持才能继续做到这一点。但考虑到成本削减、缺乏文化意识以及削减 DEI 预算的压力越来越大，“许多身份群体或社会事业面临的挑战可能会被忽视。”在如此充满挑战的情况下，如何ERG 成员能否激励并获得其网络所需的关注以产生影响力？作者根据她与面临类似挑战的人们的合作，提出了几种策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/ how-to-secure-support-for-your-ergs-initiatives?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-to-secure-support-for -your-ergs-initiatives?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;员工资源团体，在英国通常被称为员工网络，是促进包容性和倡导的重要工具对于传统上被低估的具有共同身份和利益的工人群体。不幸的是，许多 ERG 没有获得履行这一承诺所需的资源、预算和关注。以下是我在辅导个人和向 ERG 进行演讲的工作中看到的一些担忧：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;我如何才能获得更多预算分配来支持我基于信仰的 ERG？&lt;/li>; &lt;li >;为什么我的组织没有针对巴基斯坦的洪水或土耳其和叙利亚的地震开展慈善活动？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;我的组织拥有活跃的妇女网络，但缺乏对交叉性的关注。我如何让他们优先考虑这一点？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;鉴于成本削减、缺乏文化意识和不断增加的压力&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en- us/news/politics/mo-house-passes-budget-that-slashes-diversity-initiatives-defunds-libraries/ar-AA19jWvC&quot;>;削减 DEI 预算&lt;/a>;，许多身份群体或社会事业面临的挑战面子可能会从裂缝中溜走。在如此充满挑战的情况下，ERG 成员如何激发并获得其网络所需的关注，以产生影响力？以下是基于我如何支持面临类似挑战的人的一些策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;了解你的原因&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首先，明确你到底想要实现什么以及增加的支持是什么对您和您的 ERG 成员来说都意味着。例如，Nadia* 就如何为&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/how-leaders-can-better-support-muslim-women-at-work&quot;>;穆斯林同事申请一个专门的小巫区&lt;/ a>;，而哈姆扎则想在斋月期间举办一年一度的开斋派对。尽管他们的公司存在信仰网络，但由于他们的组织不愿让“&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/where-religious-identity-fits-into-your-dei-strategy&quot;>;特殊”，两人都面临着障碍宗教安排&lt;/a>;。”与此同时，Akua 是公司女性网络的成员，她希望为有色人种女性组织一次会议，重点关注黑人、亚洲人和多种族背景的女性所面临的挑战。然而，她被告知该组织只会资助支持“所有女性”的妇女网络倡议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管这令人失望，尽管来自各自组织的抵制，但我鼓励这三个人花点时间反思为什么这些举措对他们来说至关重要。我的目标是帮助他们巩固他们的要求并提高他们实现成果的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了让其他人接受你的想法，开始根据你想要发生的事情而不是你想要的来确认你的结果避免。此外，花时间考虑所需的资源、潜在的障碍以及您期望的结果将如何影响整个系统。通过专注于你的目标，你可以在向他人展示你的想法时增强你的主人翁意识并增强你的信念。以下是我请 Nadia、Hamza 和 Akua 回答的一些问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;你为什么想要这个？它的目的和价值是什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您将在什么、地点、时间以及与谁一起实现这一成果？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;实现这一目标需要哪些内部和外部资源？这个结果？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;实现这个结果你会得到什么或失去什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;你的行动计划是什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;你期望的结果会带来什么变化？更大的系统，如果没有达到这个结果会发生什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您将如何监控进展或克服任何挑战？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您将如何衡量这一影响结果？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;回答了这些问题后，就可以开始准备业务案例了。随着优先事项的发展，不断重新审视上述内容可能会有所帮助。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;准备您的业务案例&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;现在您已经确定了原因，是时候准备好提出您的案例了领导力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大多数组织的运营理念都是“这对我有什么好处？” Cherron Inko Tariah MBE，&lt;em>;员工网络的不可思议的力量&lt;/em>;一书的作者，鼓励问自己以下问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;您是否意识到正在发生的事情组织？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您了解工作场所文化和企业面临的问题吗？您的首席执行官收件箱顶部的内容是什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;上次董事会会议讨论了什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;人力资源主管的优先事项是什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;确保任何新举措都符合公司的总体目标和战略非常重要。这正是 Nadia 在介绍 &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/how-leaders-can-better-support-muslim-women-at-work&quot;>;Wudu 水槽&lt;/a>; 的案例时所做的。她能够清楚地展示这一条款将如何支持公司在三年内成为最具包容性雇主之一的目标。通过将她的提案与更大的目标联系起来，她能够获得前进所需的支持并将其变为现实。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;衡量和定期跟踪进度可以显着影响 ERG 及其活动的看法和影响。有价值的。为了打造令人信服的商业案例，ERG 领导者必须衡量其工作的有效性并计算其努力的投资回报。会员数量、参与度、满意度和保留率等指标是很好的利用工具。为了帮助您证实您的计划的需求和兴趣，请使用脉搏调查来捕获情绪并征求会员的反馈。同样重要的是进行必要的调整，以确保您的 ERG 实现其目标并为您的组织增加价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，您还可以通过评估 ERG 活动的全球和跨文化效益来帮助构建您的案例。帮助领导者从宏观角度考虑：该计划将如何影响个人、工作团队、客户和全球组织？例如，萨尔曼是其公司伦敦办事处黑人亚裔多民族网络的成员，他希望发起一项活动，为去年南亚传统月期间巴基斯坦洪水灾民筹集资金。然而，他几乎没有得到同事和经理的支持，因为他们最近向乌克兰战争难民捐款。此外，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/civilized-european-look-like-us-racist-coverage-ukraine&quot;>;人们倾向于支持那些与他们相关的人&lt;/a>; 或支持获得更多国际关注的事业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salman 联系了公司南亚办事处的同事，并利用他们的帮助和经验，通过讲故事吸引了伦敦办事处的兴趣。在了解洪水对巴基斯坦地区工作的员工家庭的影响后，伦敦办事处更倾向于采取行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;收集信息并分享一流公司如何应对的示例也很有价值（包括竞争对手）正在致力于您的事业并鼓励其他人加入联盟。为了帮助获得公司的支持，哈姆扎收集了在各自组织中成功领导斋月活动的类似组织的信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这个阶段，您渴望继续前进是可以理解的，但要让您的巧妙地处理案件至关重要；谦虚地参与对话，同时避免比较和“&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/whataboutism-what-it-is-and-why-its-such-a-popular-tropic-in-arguments- 182911&quot;>;Whataboutism&lt;/a>;”更有可能产生成功的结果。在争取自己被听到或看到的权利时，试图最小化其他群体或发起竞争性叙述会适得其反，并使你失去不同身份群体的支持。当我们进行比较时，我们既不能治愈也不能推动积极的改变。不应该是“这个或那个”，而应该是“这个&lt;em>;和&lt;/em>;那个”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑以这样的方式开始与领导层的对话：“我欣赏组织的关注关于包容性。我非常喜欢成为 XYZ 网络的一部分，并且可以看到它所产生的积极影响。受到这种影响力的鼓舞，我为 XYX 提出了一项倡议。”然后，您可以详细说明为什么您所要求的内容至关重要，包括您收集的数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;收集支持&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;只有在有足够兴趣的情况下，公司才会考虑您的案例，所以一旦你明确了“原因”并且准备好了商业案例，就该争取支持了。当我问 Nadia 是否还有其他她可以信赖的员工时，她肯定有不少。然后，她创建了一份内部 Google 表单调查，并收集了同事的回复，他们分享了为穆斯林和非穆斯林同事提供单独小净水槽的好处。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来，有必要让高级领导参与其中。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capability/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/ effective-employee-resource-groups-are-key-to-inclusion-at-work -heres-how-to-get-them-right&quot;>;麦肯锡研究发现&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;与高管关系密切的 ERG 领导者比关系较弱的人更能获得资源和资金。与您可以信赖的盟友和赞助商交谈并获得支持至关重要。哈姆扎正是这样做的，并能够吸引许多人参加她的开斋庆祝活动——事实上，有些人甚至渴望在参加开斋庆祝活动之前参加斋月挑战。利用牢固的联系和高层可见的支持者可以成为认真对待该倡议的重要支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使您的身份群体中没有足够的人数来支持您的倡议，倡议，您可以寻求其他 ERG 的支持。以下是与 ERG 领导者进行对话的一种可能的方式：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;我喜欢成为你们网络倡议的一部分；我的参与帮助我认识到为什么您的网络很重要，以及为什么让我们的需求被看到和承认是至关重要的。受到您的启发，我已要求管理层将资源分配给 XYZ。当我准备接近他们时，我可以依靠你们网络的支持吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;这样做的好处是双重的：你不仅会得到他们的支持，而且因为 ERG 的情况并不少见。整合资源并共同倡导社会影响计划，如果您未能成功获得所需的东西，他们甚至可能为您组织或运行计划。但请记住，这种互惠互利的联系依赖于互惠——如果您希望他们提供帮助，您也必须成为他们的明显盟友。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;具体并准备转向&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;早些时候的例子是，当萨勒曼想要为巴基斯坦的洪水灾民组织一次慈善活动时，他就负责了这一倡议。他要求提供他需要的具体东西：使用办公室大厅举办烘焙义卖，在公司时事通讯和全公司范围的电子邮件中提及该活动，以及使用办公室厨房存储货物。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;做好准备当你没有得到你所要求的东西时，要转向。准备一个浮动范围的询问，并尝试确保开始对话的最低限度的承诺。如果公司不批准某项活动的预算，也许可以要求他们至少发送一封全公司范围的电子邮件，以表示支持和团结。另外，看看您是否可以与其他网络合作并共享资源或预算。请记住，“不”并不意味着永远“不”——根据情况的变化，在几周或几个月内重新提出请求。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;ERG 对于培养归属感和提升潜力至关重要，他们需要支持才能继续做到这一点。组织需要包容所有身份群体并平等地支持所有社会事业，但期望在没有实质性推动的情况下实现这一点是天真的。系统性不平等和组织偏见渗透到大多数组织中，如果不积极应对，领导者就会沾沾自喜。在一个某些声音经常被轻视或完全被忽视的系统中，导航需要 ERG 领导者和成员足智多谋，并更具战略性地提出他们的要求。等待组织采取这一举措可能会导致漫长的等待——推动并被听到比根本不被听到更好。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;虽然全球 89% 的大公司正在进行数字化和人工智能转型，但他们仅实现了预期收入增长的 31% 和预期收入增长的 25%通过努力节省成本。除非企业领导者确信其价值并对如何获得它充满信心，否则他们不太可能做出提高成功率所需的困难的、亲力亲为的改变。为了了解数字化转型在哪里创造价值，作者使用了麦肯锡的 Finalta 基准，该基准根据一组 50 个标准化指标（例如数字/移动采用率、数字销售）跟踪 2018 年至 2022 年期间每年 80 家全球银行的绩效按银行产品、联络中心人数和分支机构数量划分。他们发现，数字化领先者比落后者创造了更多的股东价值，而且通常通过创造难以复制的价值。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;“给我钱！”小库珀·古丁 (Cuba Gooding Jr.) 在电影《杰瑞·麦奎尔》(Jerry McGuire) 中扮演罗德·蒂德韦尔 (Rod Tidwell)，将这句话作为文化试金石。他不仅仅是表达了对与汤姆·克鲁斯扮演的体育经纪人的承诺的担忧；他还表达了对体育经纪人的担忧。他还质疑 Cruise 的承诺。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在谈到公司的数字化和人工智能转型时，商界领袖、股东和董事会成员越来越多地表达同样的观点，尽管用词不同。虽然全球 89% 的大公司正在进行数字化和人工智能转型，但他们已经capture-a-digital-transformations-full-value&quot;>;仅实现了 31% 的预期收入提升&lt;/a>;和 25% 的预期成本节约。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一记录需要一些艰难的努力问题：所有这些数字化努力值得吗？我真的需要领导我的行业吗？还是快速追随者是更明智的策略？我能否创造数字和人工智能能力，为我带来持久的竞争优势，或者这只是现代开展业务的代价？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到企业领导者确信其价值并对如何获得它充满信心，他们不太可能做出提高成功率所需的困难的、亲力亲为的改变，正如我们在书中所说的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey -on-books/rewired&quot;>;&lt;em>;&lt;i>;Rewired：如何在数字和人工智能时代脱颖而出&lt;/i>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;。但使用专有数据，我们发现了数字化转型如何以及在何处创造价值，以及企业可以采取哪些措施来击败竞争对手。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;确凿的证据，真正的价值&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;确凿的证据表明将数字和人工智能转型与运营 KPI 和财务绩效的改善直接联系起来的情况很少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了解决这个问题，我们求助于银行业，这个行业在数字化转型方面拥有足够的历史，能够产生有意义的发现和结果我们拥有独特的纵向数据集。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，我们使用了麦肯锡的 Finalta 基准，该基准根据一组 50 个标准化指标（例如数字/移动）跟踪 2018 年至 2022 年期间每年 80 家全球银行的绩效采用率、银行产品的数字化销售、联络中心的人数以及分支机构的数量。然后，我们根据两个指标（客户群的移动采用率和源自数字渠道的销售百分比）来分离绩效，以定义 20 个数字化领先者和 20 个数字化落后者。这两个指标在业内被广泛认为是数字零售银行模式的核心指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来，我们将这些数据与麦肯锡的企业绩效分析结合起来，看看银行最终的财务指标表现如何（例如，总销售额）。股东回报、增长、费用）。然后，我们对领先和落后银行的数字和人工智能能力的成熟度进行了盲目评估（即隐藏了银行的身份）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结果令人震惊：数字领导者正在创造很多成果股东价值高于落后者。 2018 年至 2022 年间，数字化领先者的年平均股东总回报率为 8.1%，而落后者为 4.9%。领先者的税前有形资产回报率 (ROTE) 也显着提高，从 2018 年的 15.5% 增长到 2022 年的 19.3%，而落后者的增长则较为温和，从 13.6% 增长到 15.3%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;这种财务优异表现是领导者成功增加收入和更好地控制支出增长的结果。 2018 年至 2022 年间，数字化领先者的活跃客户群每年增长 0.5%，零售收入每年增长 0.8%，而数字化落后者的活跃客户群增长为零，零售收入每年下降 1.4%。同一时期，领先者的运营支出每年增长 1.3%，而落后者的增长率几乎是其两倍（每年 2.3%）。那么，领导者如何能够在竞争中脱颖而出？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;创造难以复制的价值&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;价值从何而来？让我们看看“数字引擎盖”下面的情况。数字领先者和落后者的移动应用采用率都在以相同的速度增长，随着时间的推移，他们之间的差距保持不变，为 14 到 15 个百分点。 （见下图。）这并不奇怪。一旦银行推出新的移动应用程序功能，其他人就会看到并相对较快地效仿。移动应用程序是赌注。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;转向数字销售提供了更有洞察力的答案。在这方面，领先者和落后者之间的差距正在快速拉大，五年期间领先者与落后者的优势几乎翻了一番。事实上，数字化领先者的数字化销售额从 40% 增长到 70%，而数字化落后者则从 8% 增长到 17%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;造成如此巨大差异的原因是，为了推动数字化销售，领先的银行表现出色超越移动应用程序，对难以看到和难以复制的内容进行数字化改造：从发起到履行再到服务的端到端流程。为此，他们必须协调数百个团队，能够日复一日地在所有客户旅程和核心业务流程中开发数字和人工智能创新。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此流程的前端例如，领先的数字银行部署个性化分析和数字营销活动，为（潜在）客户提供相关优惠。在此过程中，他们创建了一种全渠道体验，使分支机构和联络中心专业人员拥有工具和数据，可以在销售旅程的任何阶段为客户提供支持，即使该旅程是在线开始的。借助自动化信用风险决策，这些领先银行还可以实时提供客户审批。在流程的后端，他们通过现代数据架构支持的精心设计的数字工作流程来推动客户自助服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种转型方法的价值也体现在联络中心的人员配置上。过去五年，落后者数量增加了 20%，因为他们无法遏制进入数字渠道的客户的来电。相比之下，数字化领导者能够将联络中心的人员配置减少 11%，因为他们受益于完全在线满足客户需求并提供有效的自助服务能力的能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-desiredby =&quot;caption-attachment-361201&quot;

rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;在 Data &amp;amp; 中查看更多 HBR 图表。视觉效果&lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;知道要做什么很重要，但执行“如何”才是最重要的。我们来看看一家美国银行的担保贷款业务是如何做到的。传统上，银行平均需要大约 45 天才能为客户获得贷款。该流程涉及向客户提出多个文档请求（例如，工资单、W2、解释信），而后端流程（例如，初始文件审查、文件分配、临时报告）是高度手动的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;为了改变这一历程，该银行的领导团队重新设计了整个流程。为了加快预审批速度，他们利用内部和外部数据源开发了一个包含数千万美国家庭的数据库，结合了信用、财产和收入属性。这些数据使他们能够生成个性化的预先批准的优惠，客户只需点击一下即可接受。他们构建了移动优先的客户体验，客户可以根据实时数据个性化他们的报价，并在移动设备上或在银行员工的帮助下完成预填写的申请。他们重新设计了关键流程（例如，专门的贷款“装配线”），自动化关键任务（例如，初始文件清理），并为操作员开发了数字工具来提高生产力（例如，日常工作流程管理）。他们对信贷政策执行进行了现代化改造，以便在承保中更多地使用数据（例如，使用直接存款数据获取收入），同时维持或增强银行的风险控制。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了实现所有这些创新，他们实施了关键技术和数据能力，包括客户数据平台、人工智能/机器学习模型（例如倾向模型）、数据产品（例如收入）、客户数字应用程序和履行中心的工作流程工具，全部部署在云上基于平台即服务的基础设施。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总而言之，这种转变需要整个过程中的十多个用例以及针对代理的大规模变更管理计划（例如培训、重组）在分支机构、联络中心和运营部门。但在首次推出后仅 18 个月，审批流程就从 28 天缩短至 7 天。这一飞跃使该银行成为领先的担保贷款发起机构，并将发起成本提高了 35%，同时将发起成本降低了 20%。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;超越竞争所需的能力&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一家有志于实现这一目标的公司要想超越，就需要像上述银行在数十个客户旅程和核心业务流程中所做的那样进行端到端的改变。只有通过差异化功能进行重新布线才可能实现这一点。我们对 200 多个大规模数字和人工智能转型进行了研究，分离出重新整合的公司开发的六项核心能力：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;制定雄心勃勃且有针对性的转型路线图&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;。这要求企业领导者在对客户重要并产生重大价值的特定领域（例如，旅程或流程）上协调他们的努力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;建立高质量的数字人才库&lt;/b>; &lt;/strong>;。领导者优先考虑创造一个吸引顶尖工程师并让他们蓬勃发展的环境（例如，量身定制的职业道路、自主权）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;运营模式&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;其中数百个由业务、工程和控制职能资源组成的小型跨职能“集群”被调动起来以解决优先解决方案。负责端到端体验的单一旅程（或产品）所有者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;分布式技术环境和现代软件工程实践&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;整个组织（而不仅仅是 IT）开发基于数字和人工智能的解决方案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;数据产品和现代数据架构&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;让一切变得简单供组织的不同部门为自己的应用程序使用数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;b>;变更管理以确保采用数字解决方案并可以通过简化数字解决方案进行扩展&lt;/b>;&lt;/strong>;在整个企业中使用和重用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我们对领先者和落后者的这些能力进行盲目评估时，我们发现领先者在这些能力上全面脱颖而出。没有人能够解释他们的成功。一切都需要。以此为基准，最具差异化的能力是人才和运营模式，而不是技术。随着时间的推移，这些功能将创造不断改善的客户体验并降低单位成本。接下来是经济奖励。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-scribedby=&quot;caption-attachment-361204&quot;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;抓住并保持受众的注意力对于沟通成功至关重要。你要说的很重要，所以给自己最好的机会向观众传达你的信息，首先获得关注，但更重要的是维持它。在这篇文章中，作者概述了三种技术——身体、心理和语言——吸引观众。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-keep-your- Audience-focused-during-a-presentation?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>;

&lt;p>;不幸的是，仅仅吸引耳朵和眼睛是不够的。获得关注只是第一战；保留它完全是另一个挑战。这就是为什么聪明的沟通者不仅积极采用各种方法来吸引注意力，而且还努力维持注意力。持续关注就是我所说的“参与度”。如果您能够吸引观众，他们就会保持专注并且不会分心。另外，您将能够更好地向他们展示您的主题的相关性和重要性。为此，这里有三种吸引观众的方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;吸引观众的三种方法&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;身体参与&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;其中身体走，大脑也会跟着走。任何能让观众用身体做某事的事情都会产生参与感。无论您是进行现场推介或演示，还是进行虚拟会议，请考虑如何在活动中融入实际参与。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，您可以让人们观看视频、阅读文章讲义、点击屏幕上的某些内容、举手或使用虚拟反应。所有这些都要求您的受众成为您沟通的参与者，而不仅仅是观察者。一个简单的邀请“转向你旁边的人并向他们打招呼”或“阅读幻灯片上的内容并分享你的想法”就可以让他们参与进来。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;精神参与&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;通过促进认知参与来对抗观众走神或多任务的倾向。可以通过三种简单的方法来做到这一点： 在整个演示过程中提出问题；纳入挑衅性的陈述、数据和统计数据；并引入巧妙的类比。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当你提出问题时，人们几乎会自动开始考虑他们的答案，从而将他们从被动倾听转变为积极参与。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;挑衅性陈述或&lt;a href =&quot;/2020/02/present-your-data-like-a-pro&quot;>;compelling data&lt;/a>; ignite curiosity and encourage your audience to internally ask their own questions. For example, if you&#39;re trying to justify headcount for your training department, you could say: “30% of our customer service tickets could be eliminated by training users better.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analogies are where we compare what we know to what we don&#39;t know; in other words, we &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/finding-the-right-metaphor-for-your-presentation&quot;>;use the familiar to explain the unfamiliar&lt;/a>;. Invoking analogies invites involvement by making us actively think. One caveat: When you use analogies, make sure they&#39;re ones people can readily relate to. Over-reliance on sports metaphors or on complex comparisons people cannot follow or understand will work against your goal of engagement and greater understanding.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Linguistic Engagement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Linguistic engagement refers to the use of inclusive words, time-traveling language, and references to shared perspectives or experiences. Inclusive wording means inviting people into your communication. For instance, we&#39;re hardwired to perk up when we hear our own name, as well as when we hear the word “you.” Mention participants&#39; names, and use phrases like “As you know…” or “You may be wondering…” or “Today, you will learn…”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time-traveling language takes people from the present into the future or the past. You can use phrases like “Imagine…” or “What if you could…” or “Picture this…” to take people into the future. “Remember when…” or “Think back to when…” will take people into the past. Connect people through shared experiences or beliefs to create common ground. For instance, highlighting your company&#39;s mission and values or referencing a previous shared experience can draw people in, much like when you and your friends or family share old stories and jokes.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Combining Engagement Techniques&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t need to rely on only one engagement technique at a time. Instead, combine them to increase and enhance their effect. For example, polling is a great way to get both brains and bodies involved with a triple-whammy of activity. It works with a poll question as simple as, “By show of hands, which of the following do&lt;em>; you&lt;/em>; believe is the most important element of XYZ?” The synergy of the physical, mental, and linguistic engagement techniques deployed in this one question get attendees out of neutral and in the flow with you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Note that when polling, you must first tell your audience how to respond (eg, “By show of hands…” or “Type into the chat…”). It&#39;s also imperative that you comment on the response you get (eg, “That&#39;s what I expected…about half of you,” or “Wow, that is everyone”). If you fail to comment, your audience might feel tricked into complying, or worse, that you did not care about the answer and were just using the poll as a gimmick.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, these suggestions might not be appropriate for your situation (for example, if you&#39;re polling the three executives in the room), so choose options that fit the occasion and group size.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While engagement techniques can be used any time in a communication situation, they&#39;re especially critical when starting meetings, presentations, or pitches. Think about how an action movie opens. You&#39;re thrown into the midst of action with the actor doing something impressive, interesting, and curiosity provoking right away. Only after your attention is engaged and your interest piqued do the title and credits appear. If you start out with the traditional “Hi, my name is..,” you&#39;ve missed a prime opportunity to&amp;nbsp; engage your audience immediately. Similarly, engaging your audience by asking a question, taking a poll, showing a video, or using an analogy before introducing yourself sets an energetic tone.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;. 。 .&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Grabbing and keeping your audience&#39;s focus is critical to communication success. If you think about any communication and communicator that you find compelling, they&#39;re likely leveraging some of the physical, mental, or linguistic engagement techniques discussed above. What you have to say is important, so give yourself the best chance to convey your message to your audience by first gaining attention, but then, more importantly, sustaining it.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s OK to Fail, but You Have to Do It Right]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/its-ok-to-fail-but-you-have-to-do-it-right]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;div js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot; data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6331954317112&amp;quot;}&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;div>;Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson is probably best known for her work on psychological safety in the workplace. She has authored a number of books, including the forthcoming &lt;em>;Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well&lt;/em>;, and she spoke with HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius about the right&amp;#8211;and wrong&amp;#8211;ways to fail. Experimentation and risk-taking are crucial for an organization&amp;#8217;s success, but failing twice in the same way is probably a mistake.&lt;/div>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/its-ok-to-fail-but-you-have-to-do-it-right?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/its-ok-to-fail-but-you-have-to-do-it-right?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When you or your team try new things — and not all of them succeed — that&#39;s called experimentation. Learning from experiments is essential for your company&#39;s growth. On the other hand, when you deviate from proven practice because of inattention or lack of training, that&#39;s probably a mistake. It&#39;s critical to know the difference, and to create a workspace where individuals feel psychologically safe to take smart risks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson, an expert in psychological safety and author of the upcoming book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Right-Kind-Wrong-Science-Failing/dp/1982195061&quot;>;&lt;em>;Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Productive, intelligent ways to fail&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Dangers of not experimenting enough&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Balancing individual employees&#39; needs with those of the team and organization&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Edmondson says that leaders should do a thorough post-mortem after every failure, whether it was productive or not, to ensure that it does not repeat itself. “A failure, even an intelligent failure, in new territory, new discovery, is no longer intelligent the second time it happens.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review/&quot;>;LinkedIn Live&lt;/a>; — previous interviews included &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/indra-nooyi-former-ceo-of-pepsico-on-nurturing-talent-in-turbulent-times&quot;>;former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi&lt;/a>;.

I was under the impression that we all understood that failure is noble and not shameful, and provides useful learning lessons. But you&#39;re writing a book that seems to be saying that we need to think hard and maybe differently about failure. What are you trying to accomplish with this book?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was with you and then I poked around and realized that the truth is many people were still confused about failure. There is a lot of happy talk about failure out there. There&#39;s the virtual mantra of Silicon Valley to fail fast, fail often, failure&#39;s good, let&#39;s learn from failure, let&#39;s have failure parties, let&#39;s have failure resumes and so forth. And the truth is, the future of work will be riddled with failure. We can&#39;t just wish it away, even if we wanted to, we have to work with it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think no one can really take to heart the happy talk about failure unless they have a coherent framework. You could think of it as two camps: the Silicon Valley fail fast, fail often camp. And then the other camp, which is, “I live in the real world, failure&#39;s not an option.” And they&#39;re both right or they&#39;re both partially right, but neither is terribly helpful nor context specific.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think the happy talk, when it&#39;s not qualified with a coherent way of making distinctions between the good kind of failure and the not-so-good kind, is possibly more destructive than helpful. It drives the honest conversation underground. It&#39;s important to talk about the kinds of failure for which we really should be welcoming it with open arms and the kinds where we maybe shouldn&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot; name=&quot;The New World of Work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;follow-subscribe data-name=&quot;hbpnewworldofwork&quot; data-activity=&quot;newsletter&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div style=&quot;color: #000000&quot;>; &lt;svg>; &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;/resources/css/images/hbr-icons.svg#the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;&lt;/use>; &lt;/svg>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Subscribe to our Weekly Newsletter &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; The New World of Work &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; Candid conversations on talent, tech, and the future of business.

That&#39;s part of the definition of what a digital company is. A digital company experiments frequently and tries and fails, and is able to tolerate failure. I would guess if you talk to most companies, they&#39;d say, “Yeah, we do that. That&#39;s the culture we have. We didn&#39;t used to, but we do that.” So I want to push you a little bit more: the rhetoric, that&#39;s the happy talk, but in reality that&#39;s not really how the world works?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it&#39;s not how most incentives are set up. I&#39;m not saying uniformly that&#39;s the case, but most of the time, failure is not rewarded in organizations, and people would rather do anything but fail.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And you&#39;re right, maybe a better way to talk about this is not as failure, but as experimentation. We have to be very pro-experimentation. But we have to be pro-&lt;em>;smart&lt;/em>;-experiments. And I think smart failures are the result of smart experiments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Smart experiments are ones that happen in new territory — honestly, if you can look up the answer, find the recipe, find the blueprint, please do, no need to experiment — new territory in pursuit of a goal that&#39;s consistent with the value proposition of the organization, with a hypothesis you&#39;ve done your homework on and importantly, as small as possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those are the kinds of both experiments and failures we must welcome with open arms. They are discoveries and they allow us to figure out quickly what to try next. But a portion of the book is devoted to best practices for failure-proofing that which can be failure-proofed. The activities, the operations in your company that are in known territory, are ones that should be well set up to make failure extremely rare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are there industries that do not tolerate failure? Airline pilots? You don&#39;t really want them to fail. This isn&#39;t a rhetorical question. Are there industries that really don&#39;t tolerate failure? And can you look at them and say, “You actually can get interesting results if you have that kind of policy?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start with airlines because clearly none of us want them to be comfortable with failure. Yet I think the reason why airlines have an extraordinary record of success and safety is because they&#39;re willing and able to talk about failure. The failures that they do tolerate happen in the simulator. There&#39;s training, there&#39;s a lot of emphasis on speaking up early to prevent something worse from happening. So their safety record does not come from being intolerant of failure, but rather being intolerant of major accidents.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we have to be very tolerant of the reality of human error so that we can catch and correct, we can train, we can allow people to take the kinds of risks and experiments we were just talking about in safe settings like the simulator, not in the execution of the real duties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to describe industries in the way your question implies. I think there&#39;s variation across companies. Pick an industry like fast-moving consumer goods. It&#39;s going to be not that hard to find differences in cultural failure tolerance within those industries across companies. So a more sensible way to put that is that some companies are doing better than others in having a healthy tolerance of intelligent failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What does a productive failure look like? You did mention that there are good and bad failures. What&#39;s the difference and how does one try to make sure their failures are the good kind?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In known territory where we have a process or a formula for getting the result we want, it&#39;s best practice to use that process, use that formula and get the result we want. So when a Citibank employee a number of years ago accidentally made a small human error and accidentally wired $800 million to a client that he shouldn&#39;t have, that was a basic unproductive failure. Turns out they were not even able to get the money back. So, not celebrating that kind of failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A productive failure is one where we get new and useful knowledge, new knowledge that helps us go forward in creating the kind of value we&#39;re trying to create in our market, for our customers. So we discovered something that we could not have discovered without trying it, without the experiment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Would you recommend that there be an elaborate postmortem? I think the military is very focused on doing detailed postmortems: what happened, what went wrong, why? Presumably to learn from that and not have it happen again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not the case that a postmortem has to take inordinate amounts of time, but it should be thorough. It should be analytical, and look carefully at the different facets of the failure, to understand accurately what happened and why, for the express purpose of preventing that exact failure from happening ever again. So a failure, even an intelligent failure, in new territory, new discovery, is no longer intelligent the second time it happens.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to shift gears a little bit to talk more generally about the workplace. The question really is: Are we OK? &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low&quot;>;You wrote a recent piece in Harvard Business Review&lt;/a>; that suggested maybe things are not so great, with relatively low levels of engagement and productivity, high rates of burnout. We can speculate as to why that&#39;s true, but is that accurate? It&#39;s hard to generalize, but you know, are we suffering? And if so, how do we respond to that as managers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, I don&#39;t have a kind of systematic worldwide dataset from which I can make solid inferences about how people are doing. My impression comes from informal conversations, qualitative research, reading HBR and so many other outlets, to see how people are doing. So really, in a way, I&#39;m commenting on the conversation in HBR and so many other business media contexts, maybe LinkedIn and elsewhere.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing I think I can say for sure is that the anxiety is real, and people are worried about the future. They&#39;re worried about it on so many fronts. They&#39;re worried about climate change. They&#39;re worried about AI. They&#39;re worried about burnout, as you mentioned. I&#39;ll come back to burnout.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But that anxiety tends to push us toward a retreat to our individual corner, and people start to think, “Am I going to be OK?” They become more focused on their own wellbeing than on the health of the team or health of the organization. And that gives rise to a real potential for erosion, even vicious cycles, where organizations find themselves in the trap of responding to requests and issues in isolation, one by one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We need a more holistic way of thinking about it. And I see limited evidence of companies being at least described as pausing to think about the larger picture, their value proposition, what it implies for how they must be structured and led, to get the necessary work done, and how to organize that work, with all its variety and variable needs, in a thoughtful way, and how to inspire and motivate people to do it well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let me just briefly go to the burnout issue, because there actually has been some recent data, some studies that have caught my eye, showing that burnout is systematically higher when psychological safety is lower, right? For instance, it seems to me that some portion of the burnout is associated with loneliness and isolation. I think it&#39;s fair to say that we can endure many challenges when we feel genuinely that we&#39;re in it together, that we&#39;re connected and engaged with our colleagues in trying to sort of navigate these challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One can&#39;t help but think, “Okay, is some of this related to the pandemic?” Which for many of us, broke up teams, created new work environments with work from home, that in many ways is fantastic for people who are balancing their work and life. It must take a toll on maybe the teaming imperative that you&#39;ve written about. Is that your hunch?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I do think the pandemic took a toll on us, on all of us. It created such an obvious uncertainty. It was such an obvious disruption. It wasn&#39;t the gradual shifts that we&#39;re normally used to. It was a very abrupt shift, and it gave rise to wonderful—and I think productive—experiments on different work arrangements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now it&#39;s time for a very systematic assessment of what&#39;s working and what isn&#39;t? And it can&#39;t be incremental, right? And it also can&#39;t be based on what people say they want. Because oftentimes, what we say we want is not actually what we need or truly want in the longer term, bigger picture, to get where we need and want to go.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You talked a second ago about trying to have a comprehensive policy and approach that, if I heard you right, is not dealing with people always individually, but that&#39;s sort of the nature of management now. Suddenly, managers are expected to be, in addition to everything else, almost like psychiatrists, that there&#39;s an openness for people to share their personal situations, challenges, problems, and that it&#39;s the role of the manager, increasingly, to engage with that in an intelligent way. So you end up where management becomes hyper-personalized, but I think maybe you&#39;re already on to the risks in that, which is losing the sense of the teaming and the collective effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s almost as if we&#39;ve lost sight of tensions and trade-offs. There will always be a tension between me and we, right? There will always be a tension between my desires in the moment and my aspirations over the long term. If you ask me what I want: pay me infinitely and don&#39;t ask me to do anything, and let me eat ice cream all day, right? But that&#39;s not going to get me where I really, really need to go, and want to go. I want to make a difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think we&#39;re in a moment of not helping people value the collective. As human beings, we&#39;re social creatures. That&#39;s part of it, but it&#39;s also that we want to matter. We want to matter to others. We want to matter in some way that&#39;s larger than ourselves and our hedonistic desires.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can think of an old-fashioned management theory of the firm, right? If markets worked by themselves, we would just have only contractors doing tasks, and it would be efficient, it would be sensible, it would be logical. But it doesn&#39;t work, because a lot of the work we have to do is inherently collaborative, and dynamically so. And it isn&#39;t easily parceled out, dividing-and-conquering style. It requires us to really work together in meaningful ways. The good news is, that can be a very engaging, rewarding, exciting experience. The bad news is, it&#39;s not easy to manage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think we can go down that rabbit hole of each person has to be managed differently, each person, you&#39;re almost a psychiatrist to that person, versus let&#39;s step back and rethink, how do we design our activities, our operations, so that we create the most value for those we serve?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, I love that, and I have to say that I don&#39;t think companies have figured that out yet. The disruption of Covid opened our eyes to some flexibility. But I think the things you&#39;re putting your finger on, we&#39;re trying to solve for that, and I think a lot of us haven&#39;t yet and need to keep experimenting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So we&#39;re in this age of anxiety, where there&#39;s burnout. And then, you throw on top of that generative AI, and a fear—possibly irrational, possibly not—that generative AI will be able to do all of our jobs at almost no cost. I assume you haven&#39;t done quantitative research. But qualitatively, what&#39;s your advice for people as generative AI enters the workplace at every level and the possibilities become clearer and clearer?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you indicated, it&#39;s a little outside my wheelhouse, except for the effects on people and culture. I speak from the perspective of someone listening at the margins to the many conversations in work and social gatherings alike, and I think you&#39;re right. I think fear is the dominant emotion, that certainly some are excited, some are super optimistic about the amazing changes to come, but I think casually I hear more fear than optimism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The truth is we need both. We need some positive, thoughtful, design-oriented approaches to experiment and figure out what&#39;s going to work. But I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be simple solutions to the dramatic shakeup of what&#39;s possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Omar from Monterrey, Mexico. What kind of metrics can be used to measure smart failures?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My first response is that it&#39;s a good idea to have metrics. One of the things that I&#39;ve spent the most time studying is how many failures just don&#39;t even get the chance to be measured, because people don&#39;t speak up about them. This was how I got into this topic in the first place: the discovery of dramatic differences across groups, even within the same organization, and their willingness to speak up about things that go wrong rather than just things that go right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the challenge more broadly than just people not necessarily speaking up: the category of intelligent failure covers vast territory. I think the metrics have to be tailored to the context — and let me illustrate vast territory. A well-run clinical trial on a new cancer drug is an intelligent failure when it turns out it doesn&#39;t have the efficacy that we hoped. It was in new territory. There was no other way to find out but to do a clinical trial. It&#39;s the right size, it&#39;s no bigger than it has to be. It&#39;s hypothesis-driven in pursuit of a goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But so is a really bad blind date. That&#39;s intelligent failure. Maybe your friend thought you&#39;d like each other. You are willing to go out and have a coffee. Smallest possible new territory in pursuit of a goal, all the rest. So a bad blind date and a failed clinical trial are clearly apples and oranges, yet they both qualify under the category.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the best way to answer the measurement question is, let&#39;s make sure the criteria are adhered to. And then, let&#39;s think about what the right frequency is, given the work we&#39;re trying to do, of intelligent failures?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another way to say that is: What&#39;s the right frequency of experimentation? How often should we be trying new things to push the envelope, to discover new possibilities, even to discover efficiencies? And are we doing that often enough? The answer is usually no, because most of us would rather succeed than fail, and most of us would rather keep doing what we&#39;re doing because we&#39;re kind of good at it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So here&#39;s another question along those lines from Mohammed in Pakistan. Employees may be hesitant to offer feedback that could be perceived as negative, which can impede professional development, hinder organizational progress. How does one tackle this situation?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a good question because it&#39;s true. We are very reluctant to do things, to speak up with negative or difficult information, because frankly it will always be easier not to. It will always be easier to hold back than to speak up candidly and forthrightly about something that you hope could be made better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The way to make this very difficult thing easier is to set the stage by pointing out how valuable it is. Periodically, I would say even frequently, refer to the fact that “We need to do this hard thing. We need to do it well if we want to be as good as we can as a team.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even individuals who have the ambition to grow and develop in their roles and in their careers have to train themselves to be willing to do this and receive it because of its value. So we&#39;ve got to call attention to its value. We&#39;ve got to call attention to the fact that it&#39;s hard and then do it anyway and support each other.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This question is from Don from Calgary in Canada. If it&#39;s true that we learn acutely from mistakes, what are some ways to encourage permission from our leaders who may be risk averse?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re all risk averse, and maybe leaders even more than others, maybe not. But first of all, I make a distinction between mistakes and failures. I&#39;m not anti-mistake because I&#39;m a human being, and I make them, we all do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But a mistake is not the same thing as a failure. A failure is something that went wrong that we wish were otherwise. A mistake is a deviation from a known practice. Now, that could happen because of inattention, because of lack of training, because of exhaustion, you name it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think it&#39;s helpful for leaders, and others for that matter, to talk about the reality that we will make mistakes because we&#39;re human. The very best practice is not to never make a mistake. It&#39;s to catch and correct them quickly, and then also to make that distinction between smart experiments in new territory that we also want to see more of because it&#39;s the secret to future value creation. And we welcome those, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthering that, here&#39;s a question from Benny from California. What&#39;s the best way to speak to subordinates after a failure to boost morale and communicate that, “This was a good failure. It&#39;s OK”?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m going to say “honestly.” You can be honest about, “Wow, this was disappointing for all of us, and let&#39;s get everything we can out of it. Let&#39;s learn as much as possible.” And in fact, given that something substantial that goes wrong nearly always has multifaceted aspects to it, it&#39;s helpful to have a thoughtful and data-driven conversation about what happened. Not “Who did it?”, but, “What happened?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We may go around the team and ask, “What did you see?” And we&#39;re really looking for what happened, what contributed to that, and that&#39;s both commission and omission, things that you did that may have contributed, things that you didn&#39;t do that may have helped. It&#39;s a thoughtful, deliberately learning-oriented conversation designed to help us be better next time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you reenergize your team these days? How do we reenergize our team particularly now, in 2023, where it feels like there&#39;s a lot of stuff swirling around?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It starts with personally taking the time to reconnect with your own sense of purpose for doing the job, the role that you are currently doing. And consider why it matters to you and why what you are doing or leading matters to the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having done that, share it. Share it often and then just as quickly invite others in to help navigate the necessarily stormy waters that lie ahead. I think it starts with you and then it&#39;s an honest sharing of why you care, why it&#39;s challenging, why you very much need and are interdependent with others. Because all of us want to be needed. We want to be needed. We want to matter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last few years, with the pandemic, I&#39;d say certainly in the US, there&#39;s been increased attention to social issues, which on the one hand I think felt right to people in the workplace. On the other, it brought more challenges into the workplace. One imagines there&#39;s a pendulum, and it might swing between leadership needing to be very empathetic to, I don&#39;t know, the backlash if that&#39;s the right word. Leaders need to achieve productivity. That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. Do you believe in that pendulum or are we in a different place? And if you do, where are we right now on that swing?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe in the pendulum. I believe that the pendulum happens and I believe there may be a better way. It&#39;s often thought of as empathy versus productivity. And I looked this up actually: Productivity is defined as the effectiveness of productive effort as measured in terms of the rate of output per unit of input.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first problem is that not all work is easily measured for productivity. The second problem is, often it&#39;s not the right way to measure excellence. Productivity is often a short-term measure, and it has limited predictive value for the future performance of the firm. For example, one way to be really productive is to just push people to their limits. But that has time constraints. Eventually they will burn out, leave, etc. It&#39;s like Buckminster Fuller used to say that it was foolish to burn down the house to keep warm on a cold winter&#39;s night. The excessive pressure can be the equivalent of that error.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And also innovation work in particular, we have case study after case study where the work actually suffers when productivity metrics are brought to bear.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a way, I wish the pendulum were more about excellence than productivity, because I think productivity is really tricky and variable to measure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I see the pendulum existing, but maybe it&#39;s a false dichotomy. Maybe it&#39;s not empathy versus productivity. Maybe we need smart, caring leaders who understand the importance of both. And given that that&#39;s very challenging, they&#39;re open about it being challenging. They&#39;re asking for help. They&#39;re sharing the burden of caring and excellence with their teams and considering, again, the fundamentals of what it is the organization must do well to stay alive in its market, to perform in its market. And talk about it honestly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sometimes think we don&#39;t talk often enough about the fact that work is work. It&#39;s supposed to be a little bit of work, but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be fun, energizing, collaborative, and full of empathy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I love that. Well, that&#39;s a good point to end on. Amy Edmondson, thank you for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AMY EDMONDSON:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks for having me.

Toxic cultures share five attributes: they&amp;#8217;re disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and abusive. Undeniably negative as these attributes are, there is no absolute, uniformly accepted scale against which we can measure any of them. Making matters more complicated, a hybrid environment by definition means that employees are experiencing their work in very different contexts &amp;#8212; some face-to-face, others remote &amp;#8212; and those may vary by the day. As a result, hybrid workspaces aren&amp;#8217;t uniform; some people may experience a hybrid environment as toxic while others do not. The author presents four mechanisms through which hybridity can lead to toxic behaviors, as well as four strategies for preventing and addressing toxic behavior in a hybrid environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/why-hybrid-work-can-become-toxic?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/why-hybrid-work-can-become-toxic?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Toxicity at work — no matter where or how we do our jobs — is caused by a range of factors. It is important to recognize that some aspects of hybrid and remote work make toxicity more likely to occur.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, though, let&#39;s quickly outline what “toxic” actually means. It doesn&#39;t refer to the misunderstandings, tensions, and conflicts that are a natural (and needed) part of any healthy organization. Nor does it refer to a one-off incident or a coworker who is a jerk every now and again. These kinds of irritations, for the most part, are best thought of as normal parts of (working) life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what actually is considered toxic? A study by Donald Sull and his colleagues identified &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture/&quot;>;five attributes of a toxic culture&lt;/a>;: disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and abusive. In a recent discussion I had with two colleagues who are experts on the subject, Amy Edmondson of Harvard Business School and Constance Hadley of the Questrom School of Business, we agreed that toxicity also implies the behavior in question is both pervasive and ongoing. And that, we believe, is what makes bad behavior rise — or perhaps fall — to the level of toxic. Toxicity carries a sense of inescapability, which is part of what makes it so painful to experience at work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Undeniably negative as these attributes are, there is no absolute, uniformly accepted scale against which we can measure any of them — all five are subjective, anchored in each person&#39;s experience. Making matters more complicated, a hybrid environment by definition means that employees are experiencing their work in very different contexts — some face-to-face, others remote — and those may vary by the day. As a result, hybrid workspaces aren&#39;t uniform; some people may experience a hybrid environment as toxic while others do not. That does not make a toxic hybrid environment any less painful or damaging to those who experience it as such. However, it does mean that some behaviors may be toxic even as a result of well-meaning — or at least not ill-meaning — actions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking with executives about toxicity, I encourage them to think like social scientists, to understand the mechanisms through which hybrid working can lead to increased toxicity. Here&#39;s what they should know.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How Hybrid Work Can Lead to Toxicity&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;My research and consulting experience has led me to think in terms of four mechanisms through which hybridity can lead to toxic behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Remoteness changes dynamics&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Working hybrid means that, compared with full-time in-office work, more communication will take place via technologies like email, text, phone, or video. One of the early findings in research on the effects of technology-mediated communication was that people become more disinhibited and exhibit less self-monitoring and self-control &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227445694_Reducing_Social_Context_Cues_Electronic_Mail_in_Organizational_Communication&quot;>;when communicating through technology&lt;/a>;. In other words, when we talk to one another electronically, we are more likely to blurt out things that might be hurtful. Think about heated exchanges you&#39;ve had with colleagues both in person and electronically — chances are, you were much more tempted to try to slip in a sharp quip in an email than face-to-face.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dynamic is not (necessarily) about being a nasty person. We all have moments of anger, frustration, or passion, and if handled badly, those feelings have the potential to turn toxic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In face-to-face interactions, though, the human on the other side of the conversation is far more salient to us, leading most of us to recognize the potential costs of a less-careful word and bite our tongues. The point isn&#39;t that we shouldn&#39;t speak our minds (if we feel that we can&#39;t, that&#39;s bad for psychological safety), but that we should choose our words well. While the reduced self-monitoring and self-control that come with remote interactions do not necessarily cause toxicity, they certainly make it more likely for &lt;em>;disrespectful&lt;/em>; or &lt;em>;abusive&lt;/em>; (two of Sull&#39;s toxicity characteristics) comments to come out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Hybridity is fundamentally imbalanced&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid also means different people are working in different contexts. Some may be at home, while others are in the office — and those locations have undeniable differences. People in the office have greater access to resources and higher visibility, often leading to more credit and quicker promotion as a result. Remote workers, meanwhile, often feel left out and shunned. Negative as these effects may be, they are not strictly toxic if everyone is equally disadvantaged at some point. The problem is when some people (likely remote/hybrid workers) feel &lt;em>;consistently&lt;/em>; excluded — as was the experience of one manager I recently worked with.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Company policy was to allow all employees to work remotely two days a week, and the manager had allowed her team members to choose those days. She quickly discovered her team had effectively split on the basis of different (but consistent) patterns of which days people chose to come into the office. Compounding the issue, team members&#39; remote-work choices were heavily driven by commutes and children&#39;s school schedules, which aligned them with demographic differences in the team. Problems arose when some team members felt they were being excluded from the discussions and meetings that occurred on the in-office days of the other group. The split led to interpersonal tensions and conflict, people feeling &lt;em>;excluded&lt;/em>; and &lt;em>;disrespected&lt;/em>; (two toxicity characteristics), and it ultimately resulted in turnover.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Hybridity can reduce cohesion and trust&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/a-study-of-1100-employees-found-that-remote-workers-feel-shunned-and-left-out&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; that lack of close contact reduces connection and trust, which are key elements of a healthy culture. During the pandemic, I spoke to many employees who had started new jobs remotely, and I consistently heard that they hadn&#39;t gotten to know their colleagues and felt disconnected. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work&quot;>;Research from Microsoft&lt;/a>; found remote working leads employees to have smaller, less-well-developed networks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remote (and by extension hybrid) working does not necessarily mean organizations will have a weak or inconsistent culture. Take Linux as an example. Its open-source software development from day one has been carried out by a loosely structured community of developers who have never met in person, yet extensive research on the group has found it has strong social norms governing behavior. However, it is hard to deny that the group&#39;s structure (or lack thereof) removes or impedes many of the mechanisms we traditionally use to establish, transmit, and maintain culture. Note that Linux &lt;em>;started &lt;/em>;with a remote, dispersed culture. While many companies have embraced remote and hybrid since the pandemic started, their cultures were already established and then adjusted to handle the crisis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Culture is so important because it is the compass organizations use to eschew &lt;em>;cutthroat&lt;/em>; and, in more extreme cases, &lt;em>;unethical&lt;/em>; behavior. To be clear, hybridity does not inherently lead people to be more cutthroat or unethical (though one might argue the sense of distance between people makes them less aware of the negative ramifications of their actions). However, in every social system we find a range of behaviors, and culture typically helps us rein in the negative ones. On top of that, while people are less likely to exhibit toxic behaviors toward those they feel close and connected to, the distance that a remote/hybrid environment brings makes us more likely to view some of our colleagues not as “us” but as “them” — and it&#39;s much easier to act poorly toward “them.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Hybridity makes it hard to resolve issues&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s one more key challenge in remote and hybrid work: We have fewer face-to-face interactions with colleagues, and research shows that it is harder to resolve disputes (like those around toxic behaviors) virtually. Think about trying to address a sensitive topic over Zoom with someone and worrying about everything from where they&#39;re looking to how fast they reply. &lt;em>;Are they giving me their full attention? Am I sure my sincerity is coming through over video? Was their slow response because they disagreed or are just lagging?&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we&#39;re face-to-face, we have more interpersonal tools at our disposal. We have better data, as we can more easily read facial expressions and can see off-camera behaviors. We also have better tools, as face-to-face interactions allow us to synchronously work together to resolve differences. And the propinquity effect (essentially, we like people we have more exposure to) means all of this happens from a starting point of a closer relationship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One other issue it&#39;s important to mention is microaggressions, which some people have argued happen less often in remote settings because we&#39;re around one another less. However, I would caution leaders and employees alike to stay vigilant for signs of microaggressions (often reflected in toxic behaviors like &lt;em>;noninclusion&lt;/em>;) in hybrid settings. While these settings may have fewer touchpoints where microaggressions can occur, they do not remove the underpinnings of why microaggressions happen — nor do they prevent them from coming out in other outlets, such as Slack, messaging apps, or videoconferencing. In effect, hybrid work can obscure the problem without resolving it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Leaders Can Do&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I advise leaders to approach toxic behaviors in hybrid work in four ways: educate, lay a foundation, have ongoing conversations, and intervene quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Educate employees&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The first step toward avoiding toxic behavior in hybrid teams is to help people learn how it can arise. You may think, “Of course they know not to be disrespectful, abusive, or noninclusive,” but that&#39;s not the issue. Sit down with your employees and have a conversation about how these outcomes can happen as unintended consequences of hybrid work arrangements and decisions. Remind them that toxicity is about behavior — and that what matters isn&#39;t what your intention was but how others perceive your actions. A good starting point is to ask employees to reflect on hybrid work behaviors they may have experienced as toxic (for example, feeling routinely excluded from a social group or reading comments on Slack that they found abusive or disrespectful). The goal of this step is not to identify particular issues or point fingers but rather to increase employees&#39; self-awareness and the number of eyes out there looking for toxic behaviors or their antecedents.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Lay a foundation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As Benjamin Franklin famously said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” One of the most effective tools you can put in place is a culture with built-in antibodies against toxic behaviors. In particular, focus on promoting empathy and psychological safety. A culture with a core of empathy encourages employees to consider the impact of their actions on their colleagues, increasing the likelihood that employees catch themselves before behaving in a way another might find troubling. In turn, a culture that includes psychological safety is critical for those cases that empathy doesn&#39;t prevent. We don&#39;t always recognize the impact of our actions, and building psychological safety ensures that employees can speak up about the behaviors they perceive as toxic. Research has provided excellent practical advice for promoting both &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/empathy-rules&quot;>;empathy&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety&quot;>;psychological safety&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Have ongoing conversations&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Because the experience of hybrid work is different among employees and dynamic over time (someone may be in the office today, surrounded by colleagues, and at home alone tomorrow), toxicity is a moving target. The only truly effective way to manage such dynamism is with an ongoing process — and the cornerstone is repeated, ongoing conversations. I encourage hybrid teams and organizations to have periodic check-ins where everyone is encouraged to raise concerns or flag toxic experiences. There is no hard-and-fast rule for frequency, as it depends on how dynamic the organization&#39;s hybrid environment is: The more and faster it changes, the more frequent those conversations should be. As a starting point, aim for a monthly check-in and adjust as needed. Make sure the psychological safety foundation is in place if you want people to share honestly, and treat these conversations as more than a superficial box-ticking exercise.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Intervene quickly&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Even with a good understanding of the issues, a positive cultural foundation in place, and ongoing discussions, hybrid working may still lead to behaviors that your employees find toxic. A big problem with toxic environments is that they tend to get worse: Toxic behaviors either feed on themselves, breeding more toxicity, or cause disgruntled employees to disengage, creating new tensions due to workloads needing to be redistributed. To break the cycle, you need to not only keep an eye out for toxic behaviors but also be ready to move fast when you see them, help all parties engage in a dialogue, and work to reach a mutually acceptable solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s say you notice a situation like that of the manager whose team was split over their WFH days. In a case like that, call a team meeting and share your concerns of how the situation might feel exclusionary. It may turn out your concerns aren&#39;t shared — but you&#39;re still creating buy-in and ownership of the issue, making it easier to address later if it does become a problem. If, however, you&#39;ve recognized a budding concern for some of your team members, you have a forum to discuss and collectively resolve it before it gets too far along.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Toxicity can be an unfortunate reality of some work environments. While hybrid work does not necessarily cause toxicity any more than in-person work does, it is important to recognize that hybrid introduces some different mechanisms through which toxicity may arise. Keeping these in mind can help leaders recognize, guard against, and eliminate toxicity when it occurs — or ideally before.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Why Employees Accept Lower Pay at Mission-Oriented Companies]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/research-why-employees-accept-lower-pay-at-mission-oriented-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_27_AnChen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by An Chen&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Today&amp;#8217;s companies are likely to tout how their work benefits human welfare or &amp;#8220;makes the world a better place.&amp;#8221; Recent research suggests that this may come with a potential financial drawback for workers, as it can inhibit them from negotiating for higher pay. Over five studies, job candidates consistently reported that they worried asking for higher pay from these companies would be seen as greedy or inappropriate. This suggests they are aware of a common bias, known as motivation purity bias, where managers believe employees interested in material rewards of work (such as pay) are less motivated than those motivated by intrinsic rewards, such as the nature of the work. In reality, research has shown that extrinsic and intrinsic motivations operate jointly to predict high performance. Job candidates should invest in building their negotiation skills so they are less thrown off when companies use social impact framing. And organizations should train managers to be aware of the motivation purity bias.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/research-why-employees-accept-lower-pay-at-mission-oriented-companies?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/research-why-employees-accept-lower-pay-at-mission-oriented-companies?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In an amusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso&quot;>;episode&lt;/a>; of the HBO sitcom &lt;em>;Silicon Valley&lt;/em>;, one awkward startup founder after the other pitches their company by proclaiming that it “makes the world a better place.” The satirical comedy highlights how common it has become for companies to tout how their work benefits human welfare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend — which academics call &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1172?&quot;>;social impact framing&lt;/a>; — appears to be on the rise.

It can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00266-008&quot;>;motivate&lt;/a>; employees by instilling a greater sense of self-worth and meaningfulness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, in our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.1675&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; published in &lt;em>;Organization Science&lt;/em>;, we uncover that organizations&#39; use of social impact framing can come with a potential financial drawback for workers, as it can inhibit them from negotiating for higher pay.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Perceived Norm Violation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We explored this effect over five experimental studies. Consistently, job candidates in the social impact framing condition reported that asking for higher pay would likely be viewed as greedy and inappropriate by the hiring organization. As a result, they refrained from negotiating.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our first study, we recruited 392 participants from an online research platform to examine workers&#39; attitudes in response to different types of organizational messaging. Approximately half of the participants read about a company that emphasizes social impact, while the others read a more generic company description. We asked participants to write open-ended responses about whether or not they would negotiate a job offer to work for the company, and why. We found that those who received the company descriptions that included social impact framing condition were 32% less likely to negotiate. The most common reason for this reticence was participants&#39; belief that negotiating would be seen as selfish and counter-normative, and put them at risk of being passed up for the job.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our second study involved 438 undergraduate students responding to an on-campus job opportunity in which they would be recruiting fellow students to work for a startup in the educational industry. The students watched an introductory video where the purported company founder and CEO — played by a trained actor — described his hiring organization. Approximately half of participants watched a video in which the founder emphasized social impact, while the other half watched a video in which the founder described a more generic organization focused on high-quality work and success. After viewing the video, participants were given the opportunity to ask for a higher wage for the job versus accept the initially offered wage. Consistent with our first study, students in the social impact condition were 43% less likely to negotiate. Again, this effect was driven by the perception that showing interest in higher pay would violate the organization&#39;s norms for employee motivation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We replicated these results in three other studies. We found that the effects held true in a workplace simulation and across a range of industries, including education, health care, manufacturing, and finance. We also found that social impact framing largely affects job candidate requests for monetary job rewards, such as salary and bonuses. It does not seem to deter them from asking for non-monetary rewards like vacation time and health care benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Assumptions About Money and Doing Good&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;What explains the effects on monetary job rewards?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer lies in widespread and longstanding beliefs that money taints love of the work itself and attempts to do good.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers, for instance, have been shown to hold a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2017.0617&quot;>;motivation purity bias&lt;/a>;,” where they believe that employees interested in the material rewards of work (extrinsic rewards) are less motivated by the nature of the job itself (intrinsic rewards), and are thus less worthy of being hired.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This belief is based on a false premise. Research has shown that extrinsic and intrinsic motivations operate &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035661&quot;>;&lt;em>;jointly&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; to predict high work performance. Furthermore, more of one type of motivation doesn&#39;t mean less of the other.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nonetheless, in our research, job candidates seem to act as if they are aware of this managerial bias against workers&#39; interests in material rewards. Consequently, in social impact contexts — where workers are especially expected to be driven by loftier motivations such as a sense of higher purpose — job candidates self-censor on any indications that they might also care about the money.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Takeaways for Job Candidates and Hiring Managers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;From a Marxist perspective, social impact framing might be viewed as yet another cultural trend that inadvertently operates in favor of the owners of capital and at the expense of workers. Yet, given that social impact framing is often rooted in organizations&#39; genuine efforts to contribute to society and can benefit employees as well, it would be overly simplistic to suggest that organizations stop communicating their emphasis on the greater good. We thus offer several suggestions to help minimize the financial downside for workers of exposure to such messaging.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of workers, job candidates can invest in &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/how-to-evaluate-accept-reject-or-negotiate-a-job-offer&quot;>;building their negotiation skills&lt;/a>;, so that they can avoid being easily thrown off in their approach when organizations use social impact framing. They can also investigate how organizations that claim to care about human welfare &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/how-to-tell-if-a-potential-employer-has-a-burnout-culture&quot;>;treat their own employees&lt;/a>;. It would be ironic if a company that emphasizes social impact neglects its own workers&#39; well-being, financial or otherwise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations might also consider training managers about their biases against employee extrinsic motivation which, as described above, can be unfounded. Indeed, the desire to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2014.0898&quot;>;provide&lt;/a>; for one&#39;s family, for instance, has been found to be a robust predictor of work performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By romanticizing intrinsic motivation and reflexively dismissing job candidates who express any interest in extrinsic job rewards, organizations might be turning away perfectly good candidates who are also passionate about the work and might well have been high performers. Not least, organizations that strive to take an ethical approach to business can avoid deploying social impact framing in a Machiavellian manner, as a tool to intentionally suppress pay.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Companies Can &mdash; and Should &mdash; Recommit to DEI in the Wake of the SCOTUS Decision]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/why-companies-can-and-should-recommit-to-dei-in-the-wake-of-the-scotus-decision]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_28_1401985.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Ruth Black/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In the wake of the US Supreme Court ban on affirmative action at colleges and universities, state legislation attaching diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts on campus, and more general attacks on DEI, companies are considering whether they need to change their DEI strategies. The short answer is they don&amp;#8217;t. But it is a good time to review corporate values, personnel policies, and engage with employees on these issues. The first step should be to remember the moral and business cases for DEI. They remain strong.&amp;#160; Second, you might reconsider using DEI labels, as some have suggested. But given employee support for such initiatives, proceed cautiously. Next, review HR practices like recruiting (including casting a wider net for candidates since the college pipeline will now be less diverse); onboarding (since some students will have less exposure to DEI than others); and performance reviews, pay, and promotion (to ensure there is no racial bias).&amp;#160; Finally, communicate carefully with what is sure to be a polarized workforce. Present credible research, solicit opinions, work to bridge divides. Ultimately, you want your organization to move forward in a way that is aligned with your organizational values.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/why-companies-can-and-should-recommit-to-dei-in-the-wake-of-the-scotus-decision?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/why-companies-can-and-should-recommit-to-dei-in-the-wake-of-the-scotus-decision?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The recent US Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action, specifically race-conscious admissions in colleges and universities, may not directly impact US workplaces, but there&#39;s no question that corporate America needs to consider the effect this — and potential future judicial rulings and state legislation — will have on their DEI practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a minimum, any changes we see in student body composition at institutions of higher education will also affect hiring pipelines. For example, when the University of California&#39;s system eliminated affirmative action in 1995, Black student representation at UCLA dropped from 7% (compared with 13.6% for the US population and 6.5% for the state&#39;s) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/politics/affirmative-action-ban-states.html&quot;>;to 3.9% in just three years&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/blog/the-supreme-courts-ban-on-affirmative-action-means-colleges-will-struggle-to-meet-goals-of-diversity-and-equal-opportunity/&quot;>;to less than 2% by 2006&lt;/a>;. Likewise, when affirmative action was banned at the University of Michigan, Black undergraduate enrollment declined from 7% in 2006 (compared with 13.6% for the state population) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/politics/affirmative-action-ban-states.html&quot;>;to 4% in 2021&lt;/a>;. These case studies suggest that when universities eliminate affirmative action, they produce a less diverse candidate pool for employers to tap, and this is now likely to happen across the country.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Exacerbating the situation, there are also now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/anti-dei-legislation-tracker/&quot;>;more than 30 state or local bills&lt;/a>; targeting DEI funding, practices, and promotion at schools. For example, Texas has a ban beginning January 1, 2024, on all DEI offices, diversity training and “ideological oaths and statements” at public institutions, which could mean that companies recruiting on campus need to review their messaging.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is much more at stake than diversity recruitment, however. As management thought leaders and expert scholars on race in the workplace, we anticipate many additional ripple effects. The ruling has already been interpreted as an invitation for DEI critics to challenge the validity, legality, and necessity of such efforts. For example, Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers&#39; Research, a right-wing advocacy group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-business-diversity/&quot;>;has already gone on record&lt;/a>; to say that the SCOTUS decision on affirmative action “will put the wind in the sails of groups like ours, who want to get the woke, racially based hiring and promotion schemes out of corporate America.” The attorneys general of 13 Republican-led states have also sent&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/attorneygeneral/documents/pr/2023/pr23-27-letter.pdf&quot;>; a letter&lt;/a>; to the CEOs of Fortune 100 companies warning that labels of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” are now “unlawful and wrong, per SCOTUS.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, college admissions are governed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/TitleVI&quot;>;Title VI&lt;/a>; of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Private employment falls under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964&quot;>;Title VII&lt;/a>; and is enforced by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), currently led by Charlotte A. Burrows, who has emphasized that the SCOTUS decision has no bearing on its work. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/statement-eeoc-chair-charlotte-burrows-supreme-court-ruling-college-affirmative-action&quot;>;a statement&lt;/a>;, she said, “It does not address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background. It remains lawful for employers to implement diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs that seek to ensure workers of all backgrounds are afforded equal opportunity in the workplace.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That means most corporate DEI efforts are formally safe for now. However, it&#39;s important for organizations to pay attention to the changing landscape.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Taking a Step Back &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;First, let&#39;s consider whether we still believe race should be considered when making organizational decisions. That depends in part on whether we believe racism still affects our society. If we do, it seems plausible and just to recommend interventions that consider race. If we don&#39;t (or if we are okay with racism), it would seem implausible and unjust to recommend interventions that consider race. So, we ask you, does racism still affect our society? And do we care?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider the systematic oppression of Black Americans, who have long been erroneously held up as the face of affirmative action in the United States (while research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-who-benefits-white-women/70371219007/&quot;>;white women&lt;/a>; are instead the biggest beneficiaries of such policies). Even after the abolishment of slavery in 1865, the United States continued to codify the oppression of Black people in legal, political, and social systems. From the post-war &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/southern-black-codes.html&quot;>;Black Codes&lt;/a>; to the 1896 &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/plessy-v-ferguson&quot;>;Plessy v. Ferguson&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>; SCOTUS decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/a-brief-history-of-jim-crow&quot;>;Jim Crow laws&lt;/a>; in the US South, white power structures denied Black people full citizenship and equal protection under the law. Counter measures, including Congressional actions such as the landmark 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, the Supreme Court&#39;s 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which finally banned racial discrimination from public places, schools and workplaces, represented progress.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, having been denied the ability to advance professionally and create wealth for more than a century post-slavery, Black people remain disproportionately underrepresented in professional workplaces and leadership roles. As fellow researchers Tony Mayo and Laura Morgan Roberts have &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/toward-a-racially-just-workplace&quot;>;described&lt;/a>;, they are less likely than their white peers to be hired, developed, and promoted. Other racioethnic populations — Latino, Native American, Pacific Islanders — have faced different types of discrimination and are also underrepresented in higher-earning roles and occupations, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2020/home.htm&quot;>;data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://extramural-diversity.nih.gov/diversity-matters/underrepresented-groups&quot;>;industry groups&lt;/a>;. This suggests that racism does still affect our society. The United States is not living up to its founding ideals of allowing all citizens to pursue life, liberty, and happiness in equal measure. We should care — and keep working toward those goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A next question to ask is whether we believe diverse teams benefit organizational performance. Ample research shows that they make &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;smarter decisions&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/the-other-diversity-dividend&quot;>;better investments&lt;/a>;, are &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-investing-in-dei-helps-companies-become-more-adaptable&quot;>;more adaptable&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance&quot;>;drive innovation&lt;/a>; when the corporate culture in which they operate is a supportive, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/research-to-excel-diverse-teams-need-psychological-safety&quot;>;psychologically safe&lt;/a>; one. Diverse and well-trained workforces and leadership teams are also better suited to interact with diverse employees, customers and vendors. Thus, there is still both a moral and a business case for supporting DEI efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some corporate leaders still might be wondering whether they should rethink their whole DEI strategy in light of recent attacks on affirmative action.最简洁的答案是不。 Now is not the time to reverse the commitments they made to racial equity in the aftermath of George Floyd&#39;s 2020 murder. Instead, it&#39;s time to clarify organizational values around DEI, clearly communicate them, and ensure that people management processes are aligned with them. Here, we explain how to go about this at this critical moment in US history.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Rethinking L&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;abels&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Given the SCOTUS ruling, other pending state legislation, and the warning from those 13 attorneys general, some legal scholars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-business-diversity/&quot;>;have suggested&lt;/a>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;that companies preemptively protect themselves by moving away from DEI labels to ones clearly protected by law. For example, instead of a chief diversity officer, you would have a Title VII compliance officer. Another option is to use words like “inclusion,” “belonging,” and “engagement” to emphasize that the goal is improving organizational culture not necessarily racial diversity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We urge caution on this front because DEI remains important to employees. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.bfldr.com/ZZ11QL2O/at/6bpw94vrt588vtc8gr3fgw5/C001_Benevity_TheStateofWorkplaceDEI_Final.pdf?hsCtaTracking=e0c17c58-a6ca-4e73-978b-87718706789f%7C57928514-8a0c-4227-bf1f-498f3e23c304&quot;>;a 2023 Benevity survey&lt;/a>; found that 95% of people weigh a prospective employer&#39;s DEI efforts when choosing between job offers with similar salary and benefits and that 78% would &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; consider working for a company that fails to commit significant resources to DEI initiatives. Employees from historically marginalized backgrounds will almost certainly feel disregarded and devalued if their organizations shy away from DEI labels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, any good DEI strategy requires regular evaluation to ensure it is performing against goals set and having the intended impact on employees. And when faced with a big organizational change or new rules and regulations, leaders should have a system in place to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ellavatesolutions.com/the-ellavate-approach&quot;>;tune-up existing DEI&lt;/a>; strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Reviewing Processes &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Recruitment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As highlighted earlier, we can expect a smaller percentage of racially marginalized individuals to be admitted to predominantly white institutions (PWI), so companies still seeking diversity in their candidate pool will need to look elsewhere to find as much of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One solution is to increase recruiting at institutions such as historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), and tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). Another is to consider non-traditional pathways such as community colleges and building partnerships with community organizations that focus on racially diverse pipelines, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://oneten.org/about/mission/&quot;>;OneTen&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recommend a shift to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/skills-based-hiring-is-on-the-rise&quot;>;skills-based hiring&lt;/a>;, a well-established DEI best practice that focuses on matching skills between job candidates and roles instead of focusing on only education and experience. Consider partnering with organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://opportunityatwork.org/stars/&quot;>;STARS&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mlt.org/&quot;>;MLT&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reachingoutmba.org/&quot;>;ROMBA&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://toigofoundation.org/&quot;>;Toigo Foundation&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fortefoundation.org/site/PageServer&quot;>;Forte Foundation&lt;/a>; (full disclosure: the latter two are clients of Tina) that help identify talent employers need.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Onboarding&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Many companies now include DEI education as part of their onboarding programs. But they can no longer make assumptions about employee readiness for these conversations. For example, a student educated at a public institution in Florida is now expressly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2023/05/23/what-the-desantis-agenda-means-for-higher-education-in-florida&quot;>;prohibited&lt;/a>; from taking a course that “teaches identity politics, or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers might therefore need to implement surveys to understand how much new hires know about DEI and take greater care in explaining to new team members why those principles matter to the organization, not just how they&#39;re implemented.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Performance reviews, pay, promotions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As DEI efforts become more highly scrutinized, there is even more reason to make sure your people processes are equitable. Performance evaluations and pay and promotion decisions should be based on standard and objective data — yet a multitude of research indicates that they remain riddled with bias, especially for members of historically marginalized racioethnic groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/how-one-company-worked-to-root-out-bias-from-performance-reviews&quot;>;one study&lt;/a>; found that 90% of people of color but only 72% of white people received notes about their personalities in their reviews. Now is a good time to &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/how-one-company-worked-to-root-out-bias-from-performance-reviews&quot;>;audit these processes&lt;/a>; so no one can argue that you are favoring people of one race over another.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Communicating Carefully &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/06/08/more-americans-disapprove-than-approve-of-colleges-considering-race-ethnicity-in-admissions-decisions/&quot;>;public polling&lt;/a>; is any indication employee reaction to the affirmative action ruling will depend on their race and ethnicity, political affiliation, and how they have seen affirmative action framed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adept managers should be able to surface and address different opinions, show empathy, create employee feedback and support systems, and regularly communicate about these issues. Tools to use include one-on-one meetings (if a few employees are highly concerned); town halls (if many people are worried); emails (if many people have low-intensity interest); or simply monitoring the situation for now (if awareness remains low among most people.) &amp;nbsp;Conversations might be difficult, but it is important for teams to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/dig-bridge-collectively-act&quot;>;dig into sometimes polarizing topics, bridge divides, and agree on collective action&lt;/a>; where possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cornerstone of successful communication is to include research from credible outlets but, in these polarized times, it can be challenging to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/01/24/us-media-polarization-and-the-2020-election-a-nation-divided/&quot;>;sources&lt;/a>; trusted by all employees. We recommend identifying multiple ones and explaining the vetting process to employees. Organizations will also benefit from conducting surveys to learn about differing views and identifying and seeking input on informal leaders on all sides.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With both facts and opinions in hand, leaders will be better equipped to communicate effective messages about their DEI plans. They might, for example, acknowledge that some employees disagree with race-conscious recruiting, or think DEI efforts should be dropped for legal or cost-saving reasons, but explain that the organization prioritizes the increased innovation that comes from having a more diverse team or simply having a workforce that represents the broader society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is important that everyone engages on this issue. While some organizations relegate DEI to HR and HR alone, this is a mistake. Messaging on — and commitment to — DEI should be understood and communicated by everyone from frontline managers to the CEO, especially now when racial tensions remain high and policies like affirmative action are being questioned.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Moving Forward&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now that the media furor over &lt;em>;Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard University and the University of North Carolina&lt;/em>; has slightly abated, organizations have a moment to strategically reflect on how their DEI efforts may be affected. We believe corporate leaders should resist the urge or pressure to backpedal on DEI commitments. Instead, they should enhance DEI in a manner that complies with the law, aligns with their organizational values, and benefits their businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Be a Purpose-Driven Leader Without Burning Out]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-to-be-a-purpose-driven-leader-without-burning-out]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_26_1298982699.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Daniel Grizelj/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The idea of servant leadership &amp;#8212; putting your team&amp;#8217;s needs ahead of your own &amp;#8212; brought us to a more compassionate, human-centered work environment.

Instead, the authors suggest a more impact-driven philosophy called &amp;#8220;noble-purpose leadership,&amp;#8221; that ties leaders and teammates to the pursuit of a shared goal that positively impacts constituents. In servant leadership, the message is: You&amp;#8217;re in your role to serve others, making it tempting to focus on pleasing others and difficult to say no. In noble-purpose leadership, the message is: You&amp;#8217;re in your role to make an impact. This requires more strategic thinking in terms of where to place your efforts.

Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead,” Greenleaf wrote. “That person is sharply different from one who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well-documented research tells us that organizations and individuals &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/how-humble-leadership-really-works&quot;>;perform better&lt;/a>; when leaders focus on the team rather than themselves. On an individual level, servant leadership &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regent.edu/journal/emerging-leadership-journeys/impact-of-servant-leadership/&quot;>;increases&lt;/a>; followers&#39; trust, loyalty, and satisfaction with the leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet, much has changed in the 50 years since Greenleaf&#39;s original essay, particularly in the last three years. The narrative behind servant leadership is increasingly falling flat, for good reason:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Rampant burnout.&lt;/strong>; In today&#39;s environment, when leaders are tired, overworked, and stressed, serving can feel like pouring from an empty cup. We tell managers, “You&#39;re here to serve your team.” We tell customer-facing teams, “You&#39;re here to serve customers&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>;” The sum of it is exhausting.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;People are busier&lt;/strong>;. When Greenleaf originally introduced servant leadership, a typical manager likely supervised a small functional team. They didn&#39;t have their own deliverables, they weren&#39;t on multiple cross-functional initiatives, and they didn&#39;t start their day answering an onslaught of overnight emails. &amp;nbsp;Today, as middle management continues to thin out, leaders typically have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/how-to-identify-the-right-spans-of-control-for-your-organization&quot;>;between 11 to 15 direct reports&lt;/a>; and their own high stakes deliverables. These exhausted managers often feel they don&#39;t have the time to devote to servitude.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Workplaces have become less hierarchical&lt;/strong>;. Today&#39;s org charts often resemble a jungle gym more than they do a &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/08/stop-offering-career-ladders-start-offering-career-portfolios&quot;>;ladder&lt;/a>;. Leading without formal authority is on the rise and begs the question: Who is the servant and who is served?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Servant leadership was a crucial stepping-stone into a more humane world of work. But the next evolution is upon us. &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/to-retain-employees-give-them-a-sense-of-purpose-and-community&quot;>;The workplace data&lt;/a>; (and our own experiences) tells us that we&#39;re at an inflection point. We&#39;re standing in a moment in time where leaders, both formal and informal, must move forward towards a more purposeful leadership style that focuses on the impact that the organization&#39;s work has on real live human beings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We refer to this impact-driven philosophy as “noble-purpose leadership.” It&#39;s when leaders and teammates alike are in shared pursuit of a cause bigger than themselves (their team, their customers, their community) and their goal is to positively impact their constituents (versus serving them).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a nuanced, yet distinct shift. In servant-driven leadership, the crux of the message is: &lt;em>;You&#39;re in your role to serve others&lt;/em>;. This makes it very hard to say no, and there&#39;s a temptation for leaders (and their teams) to be reactive, trying to please everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In noble-purpose leadership, the core message is: &lt;em>;You&#39;re in your role to make an impact&lt;/em>;. This requires more strategic thinking in terms of where to place your efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When your North Star is a shared purpose, leaders have more choice in the matter; you don&#39;t feel as required to please everyone. In our consulting practice, we&#39;ve seen first-hand evidence that noble-purpose leadership can be an effective evolution toward driving better performance while staying true to a culture of service.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are three areas where managers can shift their lens towards noble-purpose leadership:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Employee Interactions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Managers are often taught to ask their people questions like: What can I do to help you be successful? What kind of support do you need from me? While these are excellent questions (and will certainly get better results than barking orders) well-intended leaders find themselves leaving these interactions with an exhausting list of action items. After a few experiences like that, overworked managers often find it easier not to even ask their team what kind of help they need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rather than giving up on the idea of being supportive, managers can create a subtle, yet powerful shift by calibrating to a higher purpose, and asking questions like: What do &lt;em>;you &lt;/em>;need to be successful in accomplishing our goal? What help will &lt;em>;you&lt;/em>; need to get? This small language change reframes the emotional dynamic. Instead of the leader having to be solely responsible for supporting the employee, asking the employee what they need to be successful creates a shared sense of responsibility. The leader is purposefully positioning themselves to have a positive impact on the employee&#39;s results, yet they&#39;re not taking on sole responsibility for supporting them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a before and after of how this worked for a client of ours, a vice president who was stretched thin with 12 direct reports and an endless list of their own deliverables. Being a servant leader felt exhausting and impossible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The VP started asking their project managers, “Given our purpose to positively impact our customers, what kind of support will you need to get this done well, and on time?” The project managers quickly determined they needed resources and support from another department to meet the deadline.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Had the VP stuck with the traditional, “What do you need from me?” both parties would have suffered. The VP would have had more on their plate than they could manage, and the project managers wouldn&#39;t have engaged with the other department. With a sightline to the shared purpose (successfully completing a project that improves life for customers), both the leader and their team members become more empowered and effective.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Decision Making &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When your primary focus is to serve, the temptation is to focus on pleasing people&lt;em>; — &lt;/em>;an endless and often fruitless, endeavor. &amp;nbsp;Many elements of work, like tight deadlines and challenging feedback, are inherently displeasing, no matter what the leader does.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a leader frames their decisions solely through a lens of trying to be as helpful and supportive to their constituents as possible, it&#39;s a recipe for burnout. At worst, it breeds entitlement, where employees think the leader&#39;s job is to do nothing but make them happy. The sum of this emotional turmoil can keep leaders from making tough (but correct) decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, leaders can frame their decisions around purpose. For example, in meetings, rather than asking: How do you feel about this? Does this work for you? Leaders can ask: What impact will this have? How will this affect our people or our customers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Katherine, the head of customer success for a medical device company, used this model to shift her team from complaining to action. Part of the team&#39;s function was to keep customers abreast of delivery times. This included making personal calls to customers when their orders were delayed. After a particularly frustrating day, her team came to Katherine with a request: They no longer want to make these calls. Her team lamented &lt;em>;“Some customers don&#39;t even notice if their order was delayed!”&lt;/em>; Others piled on, &lt;em>;“We can&#39;t speed up the delivery truck! What&#39;s the point of calling? If they&#39;re worried, they call us.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A leader simply trying to please the team would have been tempted to let the team stop making the calls or they might have taken on the calls themselves. &amp;nbsp;Instead, Katherine used questions to recalibrate the team to a higher purpose. She asked: “How will it affect our customers if they are caught off guard, and don&#39;t know the order would be late? How would it impact our reputation if we stop being proactive and are only reactive?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seemingly simple shift of the lens prompted the team to think about how their work impacts the overarching purpose of the organization. It changed their thought process: Rather than focusing on their own reaction, they began &amp;nbsp;considering the impact on the team and seeing themselves as part of the larger whole. The team decided to keep making the calls, but rotate the responsibility, so everyone wasn&#39;t having to make them every day. Recalibrating the team towards a higher purpose, reduces the pressure on the leader and increases buy-in from the team.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Coaching&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A primary function of any leader is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;coaching their team&lt;/a>;. However, when coaching is added on top of deliverables, leaders may struggle to invest time in the development of their people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, during a coaching program we ran for a group of sales managers in the hospitality industry, participants opened up about feeling overwhelmed. The organization has an exceptional culture and managers generally want to do a good job leading their teams. Yet, as travel began to boom, and they added more salespeople, managers found themselves stretched thin.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We asked the managers, “Who do you coach?” Their answer was almost unanimous: the people who are performing the worst. Yet, the sales managers lamented that despite their sizeable coaching investments, the poor performers were showing marginal improvement at best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We then shifted the lens from servant leadership to noble-purpose leadership. Instead of asking who needs coaching the most, we suggested managers ask themselves: Where will my coaching time have the biggest impact?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The managers started to look at their team through a different lens: Who is the most coachable? Who learns quickly? Who has the most at stake with their customers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the program ended, these managers began to invest more of their time in their high and mid-performers. They personally coached the high performers on their highest-value opportunities. They gave their mid-performers more attention with group coaching circles and peer-to-peer role plays. They didn&#39;t abandon coaching the bottom tier, but instead of spending hours of their coaching time, they directed lower performers to own more of their learning, via on-demand courses, self-study, etc.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results followed quickly: High performers got even better, and mid-performers improved too. What&#39;s also interesting is that low performers did one of three things:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Worked their way to become middle performers&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Stayed the course, making the same marginal improvements as they did when they were taking nearly all of their manager&#39;s coaching time&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Or, when faced with the challenge of taking some ownership in their development, they self-selected out — a process that happened faster and with less frustration than a manager spending hours of time trying to coach a player who doesn&#39;t want to improve.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Overall, the team drove record revenue, and they were more fulfilled doing it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Servant leadership brought us to a more compassionate, human-centered work environment. It&#39;s time for us to make the next leap. In today&#39;s environment, burned-out leaders endlessly trying to serve will struggle to drive the innovation, resilience, and sense of meaning required for future growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Elevating the lens to noble-purpose leadership has the power to unite employees and managers in the pursuit of making a difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Overcoming Your Fear of Giving Tough Feedback]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_26_1379555.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Juan Moyano/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;A lack of constructive feedback is detrimental to your team, depriving them of mentorship and growth opportunities. And workplaces marked by poor communication and unclear expectations are breeding grounds for low trust and disengagement. Giving feedback is essential to being an effective leader. In this article, the author offers five ways to overcome your fear of giving feedback.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“I felt like I was going to throw up,” Filip confessed to me during our coaching session. “Giving feedback is something a leader should be able to do every day without breaking a sweat,” he said. “But for me, it feels like the end of the world.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Filip was the director of project management at a company that offered translation services for streaming content providers across the globe. Hard working (sometimes to a fault), Filip was an expert at juggling multiple priorities, coordinating translators, quality control experts, and client liaisons across time zones, languages, and cultures. He had a knack for thriving in ambiguity, keeping his eye on strategic goals without getting lost in minutiae.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Filip also prided himself on always having his team&#39;s back, even if it involved taking the heat from an irate executive. But when it came to delivering feedback to his direct reports, Filip&#39;s resilient exterior crumbled. He would be overcome with worries of damaging the relationships he had worked so hard to build. He&#39;d overthink what to say for hours &lt;/span>;— &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;sometimes days. The mere thought of uttering the words, “I have some feedback for you,” made him nauseous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;When a high-stakes project spearheaded by Angelique, one of Filip&#39;s brightest team members, failed, it brought his fear of giving feedback into sharp focus. For two weeks Filip had sensed something was amiss. The team&#39;s low spirits and sluggish performance concerned him, but he told himself Angelique would pull everything together in the end. He never voiced his concerns, and the cost was devastating. Their biggest account would now be going to a different provider who could provide better service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“I could have prevented this. I should have spoken up.” Filip told me. His story echoes a struggle I hear from many of my executive coaching clients: How do I overcome the fear of giving feedback?&lt;/span>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Whether you worry about causing tension, demotivating your people, or handling others&#39; emotional reactions, conflict aversion is a common trait, and managers aren&#39;t immune to it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;You&#39;re not doing anyone a favor by avoiding conflict. When problems go unaddressed or are swept under the rug, everyone suffers, including you. A lack of constructive feedback is also detrimental to your team, depriving them of mentorship and growth opportunities. Workplaces marked by poor communication and unclear expectations are breeding grounds for low trust and disengagement.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Here&#39;s how to navigate the sense of discomfort and apprehension that comes with difficult conversations, so you can say what needs to be said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Challenge binary thinking.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Many leaders who avoid confrontation carry assumptions like, “no one likes a micromanager,” or “bringing up this issue will ruin our working relationship.” While these beliefs may stem from past experiences with rejection and failure, they reflect inaccurate, binary thinking. In actuality, it&#39;s possible to be both assertive and direct without damaging relationships or earning a reputation as the “difficult manager.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Instead, focus on what you could gain by speaking up and the potential rewards of clear communication. Not only will voicing your thoughts help you feel more confident, but:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Your input may be exactly what&#39;s needed to drive a challenging assignment to completion&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;That candid comment you make to a coworker about their disruptive behavior could result in a more peaceful, productive work environment.&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Your constructive criticism could help a team member develop and grow in their role, opening up new career opportunities&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;When you look more closely, you&#39;ll see that expressing your thoughts, feelings, and opinions is far more beneficial than stuffing them down and suffering the consequences.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;See feedback as a tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Despite what you may believe, your team craves meaningful, candid feedback. While 72% of employees &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-people-crave-feedback-and-why-were-afraid-to-give-it&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;rated&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; “managers providing critical feedback” as important for them in career development, only 5% believe managers provide such feedback. Likewise, when team members don&#39;t think their boss is great at giving honest feedback, their engagement scores &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/overcoming-feedback-phobia-take-the-first-step&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;typically&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; take a nosedive. But on the flip side, leaders who rank in the top 10% at giving honest feedback create teams that rank in the top 23% of engagement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;It&#39;s not fair to deprive your team of information they need to grow. When you reframe conflict as a healthy, normative part of leadership, it loosens the anticipatory anxiety you may feel broaching difficult topics with others. Next time you have to give feedback, take a deep breath and remember, you&#39;re not causing a conflict, you&#39;re guiding your people toward growth. You&#39;re not criticizing; you&#39;re nurturing. And you&#39;re certainly not being a villain; you&#39;re being the leader they need.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Anticipate eventualities.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Fear of the unknown or wondering how the recipient will react can hold many leaders back from ever speaking up. What if your direct report becomes defensive and lashes out at you? What if they start crying?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;You can calm your anxiety and handle uncertainty using the worst case/best case/most likely tool. Consider the worst that could happen. If your employee cries, for example, how would you handle it? Perhaps you&#39;d take a time out. Then consider the best that could possibly happen to foster more optimism. Finally, consider what is most likely, which is usually somewhere between the two extremes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Start strong.&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;You can also ease your whirlwind of thoughts by planning your opening. Being in control from the get-go can provide a confidence boost and allows you to set a respectful tone for the conversation. Once Filip realized he needed to tackle the situation with Angelique head on, he approached her and said: “I appreciate your dedication and creativity. Something I wanted to talk about is a pattern of low morale, and I want to understand if there are any obstacles that we can address together.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Using “I” statements whenever possible helps ensure you communicate directly without vacillating or minimizing your concerns simply because you&#39;re scared. Being specific is also important. Rather than saying, “You dropped the ball again,” try saying, “I&#39;m concerned that I didn&#39;t get the documents in time for the client meeting today.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Make feedback part of the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Feedback should be a regular ritual, not an occasional blast. Making feedback a habit ensures the tiny annoyances and frustrations you harbor don&#39;t blow up into major conflicts. Plus, gradually exposing yourself to fearful situations is the best way to overcome them. The more you practice giving feedback in lower-stakes, everyday scenarios as part of your role, the better at it you&#39;ll become.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;A great way to systematize feedback is through regular &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/28-questions-to-ask-your-boss-in-your-one-on-ones&quot;>;one-on-ones&lt;/a>; with your team. You can also schedule project debriefs where team members can reflect, or pre-mortems where people can discuss in advance any risks, potential problems, and flesh out how they&#39;ll work with one another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Creating a positive feedback culture will give you opportunities to flex your newfound assertiveness skills while also strengthening rapport and trust with your team. And that, as a leader, is one of the best things you can hope for.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways Our Brains Undermine Our Ability to Be a Good Leader]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/3-ways-our-brains-undermine-our-ability-to-be-a-good-leader]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_25_1464364780.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Orla/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;To be successful, researchers at the Neuroleadership Institute have found we must excel across three core domains of great leadership: being future-focused, being good with people, and being able to drive results.

But her first few months on the job have been tougher than expected: Her colleagues don&#39;t joke around with her anymore, she&#39;s pulled in different directions, and she&#39;s constantly putting out fires. When one of her top performers suddenly leaves for another opportunity, Robin realizes her team is under-resourced. The pressure takes its toll, and Robin begins to dread Monday mornings. Maybe she just wasn&#39;t cut out to be a leader?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Robin&#39;s story is a familiar one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90452760/first-time-leaders-need-to-stick-to-these-4-truths-to-succeed&quot;>;Sixty percent&lt;/a>; of new managers fail within the first 24 months.

This is at odds with how our brains evolved to value the immediate and short-term future. Indeed, in one study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://legacy.iftf.org/americanfuturegap/&quot;>;27%&lt;/a>; of Americans say they rarely or never think about what might happen five years into the future. That&#39;s a concern because anticipating things like industry trends, future skills requirements, and customer needs is central to a leader&#39;s success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to management consultant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strategy-business.com/article/10938&quot;>;Elliott Jaques&lt;/a>;, the higher you go in an organization, the further out you need to think. While a line manager might have to maintain a plan for a quarter, a CEO needs to think about where the business will be in 10 years. Jacques called this concept “time span.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The challenge, of course, is that thinking about the future is difficult in the best of times. The more people have to think about, the harder it is to notice the quiet signals that can provide insights about possible futures. Our brains also have to battle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00345&quot;>;distance bias&lt;/a>;, which causes us to prioritize ideas and decisions closer in time over things further in the future. What&#39;s more, only 16% of the executive leadership programs we studied have outcomes dedicated to thinking about the future, and the numbers are even lower for mid-level and first-time leader programs, at 4% and 6%, respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, research suggests the habit of thinking about and predicting the future is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xap-0000040.pdf&quot;>;learnable &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xap-0000040.pdf&quot;>;skill&lt;/a>;, and it&#39;s one of many cognitive skills leaders can and should learn as part of leadership training. One way to get started is to block off time each month and map out a “future state” for where you&#39;d like your team to be in three to six months. Using that vision, then work backwards to determine what you&#39;d need to do to get your team to that destination in the next six months.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Your People Are Everything&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Leaders are jugglers — and the things they juggle are often at odds. Take, for example, leaders&#39; overall responsibility: To deliver a business strategy that creates successful outcomes. And yet, they must also be good at connecting with and motivating their people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two tasks are often at odds because people often get promoted to leadership positions &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/transform-your-technical-expertise-into-leadership&quot;>;because of technical competence&lt;/a>;, not personability. Social neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/should-leaders-focus-on-results-or-on-people&quot;>;points out&lt;/a>; that a leader who is both technically competent and highly personable is somewhat of a unicorn. He references one study in which a leader who was seen as focusing on results — which combines strong analytical skills with an intense motivation to move forward and solve problems — only had a 14% chance of being seen as a great leader. If a leader was strong only with social skills — attributes like communication and empathy — they were seen as a great leader even less, only 12%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for leaders who were strong in both results &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; social skills, the likelihood of being seen as a great leader skyrocketed to 72%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So how many of these unicorns are out there? One of us (David), along with Tricia Naddaff, CEO of Management Research Group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-at-work/201310/find-out-how-many-leaders-are-both-goal-and-people-focused&quot;>;analyzed&lt;/a>; data from thousands of employees in which people rated their bosses on goal focus and people focus. Less than 1% of leaders were rated high on both.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out there&#39;s a neurological reason for this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://membership.neuroleadership.com/material/how-power-affects-behavior-and-decision-making/&quot;>;Neuroimaging studies&lt;/a>; have shown a seesaw effect exists for the separate brain centers responsible for goal focus and people focus: When one dials up, the other dials down. What&#39;s more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167207301011&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that as an individual&#39;s power increases, the brain&#39;s goal-focus network becomes dominant. This process is adaptive because to make effective decisions as a leader, one must often detach from the needs of every individual and view them more as chess pieces than human beings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting the right balance between goal and people focus is the key. But according to our research, only 58% of executive leadership programs focus on people outcomes, with 64% and 51% for mid-level and first-time leaders, respectively. Knowing this, leaders can cultivate the right balance by being more intentional about sending the signals to employees that they&#39;re cared for.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Drive Realistic Results &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;One of the biggest conundrums of leadership is the way our brains perceive power. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.324&quot;>;individuals perceive themselves&lt;/a>; to be more powerful, they tend to become more optimistic. This often leads to unrealistic targets and inflated expectations, which can cause a disconnect between leaders and their direct reports who are doing the heavy lifting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is that leaders become more “&lt;a href=&quot;https://membership.neuroleadership.com/material/how-power-affects-behavior-and-decision-making/&quot;>;vision-focused&lt;/a>;” and less concerned with detail. Having a sense of power triggers our brain positively and makes us feel good in the same way winning money or getting a reward does. As soon as the brain is triggered this way, it seeks to activate more of those rewards by directing our behavior to power-rewarding activities, like thinking big picture or pursuing goals rather than focusing on details.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good news is that by understanding the brain&#39;s tendency to become less detail-oriented and more visionary, you can counteract the urges by seeking other perspectives to stay realistic about the present and set more &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroleadership.com/your-brain-at-work/putting-people-first&quot;>;people-focused goals&lt;/a>; that are tied to the welfare of others. For example, if you&#39;re embarking on a new project and think it should take three weeks to complete, ask for the perspectives of others who will execute the day-to-day tasks to ensure alignment on how much time it takes to deliver a quality product – and then be open to shifting your timeline, if possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luckily for Robin, her company invested in a well-designed leadership program that balances all three challenging capabilities. Over the next six months, she gained insights that allowed her to better understand what makes her team tick while learning how to think ahead and balance various aspects of leadership with the tactical demands of the everyday. Although the brain might not be naturally built for leadership, with the right science-based training and habit formation, leaders at all levels can power through that tough Monday — and beyond.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Digital Skills Provide a Development Path for Sub-Saharan Africa]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/digital-skills-provide-a-development-path-for-sub-saharan-africa]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_25_996888296.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;wilpunt/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing with massive rural-urban migration. But unlike the urbanization of the Western world, Sub-Saharan Africa is missing a critical component: industrialized urban cities. Because of this, these urban areas have become overcrowded with substandard housing and severely inadequate infrastructure to cope with unplanned population growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, a new development playbook to solve this problem is already evolving, and it is anchored on the young people equipped with advanced digital skills in Sub-Saharan Africa.

But to scale this and make it a success, changes must be taken into consideration at both the policy level and in implementation in the areas of quality digital education, tax treaties and harmonization, and outsourcing-focused startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/digital-skills-provide-a-development-path-for-sub-saharan-africa?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/digital-skills-provide-a-development-path-for-sub-saharan-africa?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing with massive rural-urban migration. But unlike the urbanization of the Western world decades and centuries ago, Sub-Saharan Africa is missing a critical component: industrialized urban cities. In other words, unlike in the Western world where industrialization preceded urbanization, Sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/africas-urbanisation-dynamics-2022-economic-power-africas-cities&quot;>;urban cities&lt;/a>; are growing with marginal manufacturing output and industrial capacities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The implication is huge, as these urban areas have become overcrowded with substandard housing and severely inadequate infrastructure to cope with unplanned population growth. With limited taxes, urbanizing Sub-Saharan African cities are underfunded and could face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org/wca/press-releases/unicef-who%E2%80%AFcall-end-historic-underfunding-mental-health-services-africa&quot;>;severe challenges on healthcare delivery&lt;/a>; and overall social welfare. And with climate change affecting major cities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c97je2gzdlwo&quot;>;Lagos&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.africanews.com/2023/05/07/kenya-residents-on-a-mission-to-reduce-flooding-damage/&quot;>;Nairobi&lt;/a>;, the continent needs urgent solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Statista, on average, the Sub-Saharan African urbanization rate stood at approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/805657/urbanization-in-sub-saharan-africa/&quot;>;41.83%&lt;/a>; in 2021, even when the continent accounts for just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2016/11/23/figures-of-the-week-africa-industrialization-day/#:~:text=The%20average%20share%20of%20manufacturing,at%20just%20under%202%20percent.&quot;>;2% of the global manufacturing output&lt;/a>;. The implication is that those moving to the urban areas in search of economic opportunity aren&#39;t finding it, and that has resulted in high unemployment rates, especially among young people. The Brookings Institution estimates the youth unemployment rate in Africa to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/12/08/the-case-for-job-creation-hubs-to-reduce-youth-unemployment-in-africa/&quot;>;about 60%&lt;/a>;, while the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) puts the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unctad.org/press-material/facts-and-figures-7&quot;>;poverty rate at above 50%&lt;/a>; in most of the countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The challenges posed by this rapid “urbanization before industrialization” have been exacerbated by many factors, including an industrialization policy which has looked more backward than forward. For years, Sub-Saharan African leaders have been architecting a strategy to mimic what worked for China, which relies on an expectation that the Western world would outsource low-level factory jobs to Sub-Saharan Africa to stimulate a dynamic manufacturing sector once wages become relatively more expensive in China.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/why-africas-industrialization-wont-look-like-chinas&quot;>;as I&#39;ve noted before&lt;/a>;, it would be a huge mistake if Africa tries to pursue China&#39;s strategy. What worked for China is already expiring with advances in AI and robotics, making it nearly impossible for Western Europe and the United States to ship some of these low-level jobs outside their shores; robots will do the jobs at home. Instead, Sub-Saharan African policymakers must develop a new developmental playbook that takes into account the realities of the present state of the area.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, that new development playbook is already evolving, and it is anchored on the teeming young people in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last few years, in the process of running Tekedia Capital, an early-stage venture fund, and Tekedia Institute, a business school with thousands of students, I have collected enormous data on sectors, core economic indicators, freelancing, offshore jobs, and other factors. Based on the datasets, the path I see for the development of the continent goes through young people equipped with advanced digital skills. The young people in sub-Saharan Africa are digitally savvy, creative, and can lead a massive transformation if they&#39;re equipped and supported to unlock their potential, not just regionally but globally. These young people can export digital skills to Western Europe, United States, and Asia through the unbounded and unconstrained opportunities the internet has provided. In other words, while the West outsourced factory jobs to China, soon, they will outsource “&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/12/the-most-and-least-digital-jobs-and-how-well-they-pay&quot;>;digital jobs&lt;/a>;” in multifaceted ways to Sub-Saharan Africa. These digital jobs are diverse, from music to software development to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/the-hottest-job-in-tech-right-now-is-in-prompt-engineering/&quot;>;prompt engineering&lt;/a>;. For nations like Japan and South Korea where birth rates have remained low, Sub-Saharan Africa provides a readily available talent base, to remotely support their economies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some enabling infrastructures are in existence as the Sub-Saharan African region is experiencing deeper broadband penetration. Alongside a growing terrestrial broadband expansion, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/elon-musks-spacex-starlink-arrives-nigeria-meets-ncc-for-permit/&quot;>;arrival&lt;/a>; of SpaceX Starlink satellite broadband brings many promises on connectivity in both urban and rural areas. And with renewal energy startups, which use solar to provide energy services, young techies are overcoming infrastructure challenges, making it easier for them to participate in the global digital economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These shifts allow young Sub-Saharan workers to earn income where they are, and once that income is imported, they have the capacities to contribute and transform their local economies at scale. Indeed, some digital experts, after they have made money working for international organizations, decide to start their own companies and, in the process, nurture other young talent. The continent has at &lt;a href=&quot;https://guardian.ng/technology/nigeria-produces-five-of-seven-unicorns-in-africa/&quot;>;least seven unicorns&lt;/a>; — startups valued at least $1 billion — and as they become listed in the public stock exchanges, acquired by large multinational firms, or grow to have abilities to pay good dividends, the wealth created would be used to accelerate development. More so, because of the digital nature of their jobs, there is no requirement to remain in even the urban areas; Andela, a digital skill outsourcing startup, for example, hires workers from anywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, provided they have good internet service.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to scale this and make it a success, the following must be taken into consideration at both the policy level and in implementation:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Quality digital education: &lt;/strong>;The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that many Sub-Saharan African countries are still very low on digital readiness. While many universities in China, the US, and Europe were able to transition to remote learning, many Sub-Saharan African universities could not. Building infrastructures to support the future knowledge economy will be essential for Sub-Saharan Africa to unlock the huge potential of the youth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Tax treaties and harmonization:&lt;/strong>; In leading Sub-Saharan African economies like Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya, most young people work for some of the leading companies in Europe, US, and Canada. Sub-Saharan African policy makers must ensure these workers are compensated fairly, and that they pay local taxes as required by law. A clear policy that makes it easier for global companies to hire and develop these talents should be part of the region&#39;s development priorities. Also important is making sure that burdensome taxation does not dim the young workers&#39; motivations. That calls for effective implementation and harmonization of tax treaties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Outsourcing-focused startups&lt;/strong>;: Regional and national policies should be developed to deepen the capacities of outsourcing-focused digital companies. These companies, like Andela, valued at excess of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekedia.com/andela-becomes-a-unicorn-raises-200-million-at-1-5-billion-valuation/&quot;>;$1.5 billion&lt;/a>;, train young people and then export their digital skills to the world, while they remain in the continent. African embassies and missions in Europe, Asia, and North America could support them to connect with major clients, providing pipelines to hire the services of African youth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sub-Saharan Africa has young people to fuel the knowledge economy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/ohrlls/news/young-people%E2%80%99s-potential-key-africa%E2%80%99s-sustainable-development&quot;>;According&lt;/a>; to the United Nations, “Africa has the youngest population in the world, with 70% of sub-Saharan Africa under the age of 30.” If the continent educates and trains them in the higher-level digital skills, Sub-Saharan Africa will develop within decades, and will experience its unique version of industrialization.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
