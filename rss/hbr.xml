&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div >; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/is-india-the-worlds-next-great-economic-power?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot; /2023/09/is-india-the-worlds-next-great-economic-power? language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;2002年，印度政府推出了无处不在的国际旅游业这场运动被称为“不可思议的印度”。如果今天发起类似的活动，不妨称之为“不可避免的印度”。不仅是印度国内的狂热分子，还有全球分析师齐声宣称印度是下一个经济大国：高盛预测印度将成为&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages /how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy.html&quot;>;到 2075 年成为世界第二大经济体，&lt;/a>; 以及&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft .com/content/c9de715e-2e29-4a7f-880b-1509c04bf11b&quot;>;《金融时报》的 Martin Wolf 表示&lt;/a>;，到 2050 年，其购买力将比美国高 30%&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们有以前也经历过类似的印度乐观主义浪潮。但即使是最热心的印度拥护者，实际的现实仍然让他们感到沮丧。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/28/india-revolutions-economy-growth-future/&quot;>;大胆预测&lt;/a>;它将超越中国（一个经济体）仍比印度大五倍），麦肯锡 2007 年&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/asia-pacific/the-bird-of-gold&quot;>;“金鸟”&lt;/印度消费者的承诺从未完全兑现，到放松管制、随之而来的政策逆转和与印度做生意的信心危机，再到大流行的毁灭性时期，该国承诺的不可避免的崛起仍然难以捉摸。现在有什么不同？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;印度商业生态系统的不同方面汇聚了一些积极的趋势：需求、供应和全系统的促进因素；结合起来，它们可以超越经济周期、宏观冲击和政策逆转。有些是新的，而较旧的已经达到临界质量，它们最终可以相互加强，创建一个&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html&quot;>;增长飞轮&lt;/一个>;。但与所有飞轮一样，重要的是要对嘎嘎声和燃烧气味保持警惕，而在印度，这些声音大量存在。企业和政府领导人都必须在飞轮损坏之前予以关注并采取行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;需求&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;三股力量正在需求侧汇聚，为印度的经济增长提供动力。&lt;/p>; >; &lt;h3>;消费繁荣&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;任何有关印度承诺的讨论的出发点始终是印度消费者的承诺。印度拥有 14 亿人口和无数未满足的需求，其增长速度&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy .html&quot;>;主要由国内消费和投资驱动&lt;/a>;。实际工资预计将增长 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/apac-salary-asia-leads-2023-real-wage-growth-jumps-in-india-china .html&quot;>;4.6%&lt;/a>;，而可支配收入将继续增长超过&lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/india/disposable-personal-venue&quot;>;15%&lt;/a>; 。在西方成熟的行业在印度正在快速增长：例如，私人健康保险几乎统计数据/&quot;>;2015 年至 2021 年期间增长了两倍&lt;/a>;，而耐用消费品预计将在 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crisil.com/en/home/newsroom/press-releases/2022/09 之间增长/volume-vault-to-lift-consumer-durables-revenue-15-18-percent.html&quot;>;今年分别为 15% 和 18%&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;适合具体情况的创新&lt;/h3 >; &lt;p>;国际公司一直在努力了解印度“中产阶级”的构成并制定适当的价值主张。而&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/middle-class-nearly-1/3rd-of-indias-population-to-be-2/3rds-by-2047- report/articleshow/95239621.cms&quot;>;一些分析师&lt;/a>;认为，三分之一的印度人是“中产阶级”，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021 /03/18/in-the-pandemic-indias-middle-class-shrink-and-poverty-spreads-while-china-sees-smaller-changes/&quot;>;6600万&lt;/a>;是真正的“中等收入”全球标准，而巨大的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/18/in-the-pandemic-indias-middle-class-shrinks-and-poverty-spreads -而-china-sees-smaller-changes/&quot;>;11.6亿&lt;/a>;属于低收入。然而，第二类人中的许多人构成了一个巨大的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/be53790c-ea16-4e5c-9410-bac189fb2636&quot;>;有抱负的消费阶层&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这有很多含义。一方面，在印度竞争意味着以低得多的价格销售，这反过来又需要以竞争对手难以模仿的方式重新配置活动、生产和供应链。印度最畅销的汽车是 Wagon R，售价 7,000 美元，由日本铃木公司制造，该公司&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/31/business/corporate- business/suzuki-india-market-share/&quot;>;印度 41% 的市场份额&lt;/a>;在全球汽车行业中属于异常值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.firstpost.com/entertainment/explained-why-netflix-is-failing-big-time-in-india-10580421.html&quot;>;Netflix 通过在该国的挫折而发现&lt;/a>;，它需要的不仅仅是低价格在印度取胜。本地化内容、使用多种印度语言以及利用印度消费者想要的产品之间的协同效应（就像亚马逊或迪士尼所做的那样）至关重要。在一个截然不同的领域，麦当劳整合了素食选择、印度小吃和多代家庭菜单，构建了切合实际的价值主张。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那些能够破解印度消费者密码的人将获得丰厚的回报：许多麦当劳在印度的特许经营商都是亿万富翁。家用电器制造商 Havells 推出了一系列“适合印度”的产品，例如净水器和无压缩机空气冷却器，这些产品既满足印度消费者的需求，又满足印度消费者的承受能力。自上市30年来，&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/havells-india-ltd/stocks/companyid-10507.cms&quot;>;Havells&lt;/a>;利润增长了826倍，市值暴涨5800倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;绿色转型&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;印度对绿色转型的迫切需求，成为新兴的需求增长源。其经济潜力的规模意味着其能源需求将是巨大的。作为第三大能源消费国，它已经&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investindia.gov.in/sector/renewable-energy#:~:text=印度的%20installed%20renewable%20energy%20capacity ，增加%20of%209.83%25%20in%202022。&quot;>;可再生能源装机容量世界第四&lt;/a>;。该国制定了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/commentaries/india-s-clean-energy-transition-is-rapidly-underway-benefiting-the-entire-world&quot;>;雄心勃勃的目标&lt;/ a>;：到 2030 年，安装 500 吉瓦的可再生能源产能，每年生产 500 万吨绿色氢，减少 45% 的排放，同时减少 10 亿吨二氧化碳。 weforum.org/docs/WEF_Mission_2070_A_Green_New_Deal_for_a_Net_Zero_India_2021.pdf&quot;>;世界经济论坛 2021 年报告&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;预计到 2070 年，印度将新增 5000 万个“绿色经济”就业岗位（这意味着更多的消费者），并带来 15 万亿美元的经济机会，到 2030 年将达到 1 万亿美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;供应&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;供应方面也汇聚了多种积极力量。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;人口统计股息&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;供给方故事的一部分是旧闻：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_in/india-at-100/reaping-the-demographic-dividend &quot;>;到 2030 年&lt;/a>;，印度的劳动年龄人口预计将达到 10.4 亿，抚养比将达到历史最低的 31.2%，占全球劳动力增量的不到四分之一。劳动年龄人口激增预计将持续到 2055 年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“亚洲奇迹”就是在利用这一趋势的基础上建立起来的：日本于 1964 年进入这一最佳点，韩国于 1967 年，中国于 1994 年进入这一最佳点。印度还拥有世界上最多的说英语的 STEM 毕业生。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;获得金融服务&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;印度的金融市场状况比以往任何时候都好。随着中国机遇的降温，投资者需要替代方案，而印度是最接近的。相比之下，MSCI 印度指数今年上涨了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/india-investing-china-stocks-growth-exports-demgraphics-31252a80&quot;>;12%&lt;/a>; MSCI 新兴市场指数为 2%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;银行资产负债表为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-stronger-balance-sheets- indias-banking-sector-at-an-inflection-point/articleshow/96702845.cms&quot;>;走强&lt;/a>;，信贷市场运转良好。很明显，许多印度银行&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.in/finance/banks/news/indian-banks-better-placed-than-their-us-peers-due-to-attractive- valuations-and-stickier-deposits/articleshow/98859627.cms&quot;>;估值高于&lt;/a>;美国同行。 HDFC 银行与其母公司抵押贷款机构 HDFC 合并，市值达 1,710 亿美元，成为美国第四大金融公司。世界。甚至在合并之前，这家 29 岁的新贵就比 154 年历史的高盛更有价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种变化甚至在传统上资金不足的非正规部门也能看到，该部门占非正规部门的 86% 以上。印度的劳动力。印度领先的投资银行 Avendus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avendus.com/crypted_pdf_path/msme-lending-report-formattedvf-img-642a719b97ccc-.pdf&quot;>;计算&lt;/a>;，印度小中型企业部门的债务总需求为1.5万亿美元。其中，有 7,250 亿美元因缺乏抵押品而无法解决，而正规信贷只能提供约 2,890 亿美元。这激励贷方深化其产品。小企业贷款机构的新信贷客户比例从 2017 年的 9% 上升了 34%。小企业贷款机构的贷款在过去两年中每年猛增 43%。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;基础设施升级，无论是物理和数字&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;任何访问过印度的人都会印象深刻的一个关键障碍是其落后的基础设施。从历史上看，&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9483756.stm&quot;>;投资施舍&lt;/a>;在政治上可能更为有利，但现任政府的受欢迎程度赋予它&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/modi-should-focus-on-people-not-just-big-projects/2023/02/06/ceb85dc4-a66b-11ed- b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html&quot;>;基础设施投资有更大的余地&lt;/a>;。资本支出占政府总支出的百分比已从 2010 年的 11% 增加到今年预计的 22%。今年的基础设施支出将增长 33%，达到 1,220 亿美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结果是惊人的。印度已新增 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade&quot;>;10,000 公里的高速公路每年。自 2014 年以来，印度机场数量&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade&quot; >;翻倍&lt;/a>;并且升级后的火车系统将有&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-运输升级&quot;>;连接印度经济中心的新高效“货运走廊&lt;/a>;”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，最显着的变化之一是数字基础设施。与 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/indias-internet-subscribers-increased-to-88125-million-as-of-march-end-trai-report/article67219636.ece&quot;印度拥有超过 8.8125 亿互联网用户&lt;/a>;，拥有世界第二多的互联网用户，仅次于中国&lt;a href=&quot;http://english.scio.gov.cn/m/pressroom/2022-11/ 07/content_78506468.htm&quot;>;10.5亿&lt;/a>;。依靠这种访问，有一个&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/the-case-for-investing-in-digital-public-infrastruct&quot;>;数字公共基础设施&lt;/a>;——其他国家正在研究的一个模型— 结合了人口规模的独特身份系统、实现数字支付无缝的支付接口以及数据管理系统，公民可以通过该系统在线访问重要文件，例如税务文件、疫苗接种证书等。所有这些都有助于公开更广泛的人口更容易获得服务和信贷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为由此产生的变化的指标，印度有 &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/ india-tops-world-ranking-in-digital- payments-beats-china-by-huge-margin-report/articleshow/100944643.cms&quot;>;在数字支付方面以巨大优势击败中国，位居榜首&lt;/a>;。有趣的是，印度的支付量超过了紧随其后的四个主要国家的数字支付总和。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;促进者&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;除了这些正在发挥作用的力量之外，还有几个全系统的促进者&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;国内政策改革&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;许多&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/india/1734728/india-may-soon-achieve-modis-ease- of-doing-business-goal&quot;>;监管和政策改革&lt;/a>;已经到位，从实施 2016 年破产法到废除 39,000 多项法规以促进营商便利化。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;许多其他改革，例如建筑许可和电力连接，是州政府的职责范围，并且这些层面上也有变革的动力。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/11/how-indias-states-compete-for-investment&quot;>;各州政府正在通过帮助加快进程来参与竞争&lt;/a>;设立企业，提供投资激励，甚至吸引竞争企业集群，从而在全国更多地区创造更加有利于营商的环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;地缘政治最佳点&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;另一次转型对于印度来说，这是一种更加独特的地缘政治定位，最重要的是，它是由中国与西方经济体，特别是美国之间日益扩大的裂痕引发的。这正在为印度转化为新的商机，最明显的是——&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65784719&quot;>;苹果智能手机的制造&lt;/a>;。以每年生产 2000 万部 iPhone 的目标，仅一个这样的项目就将创造 50,000 个新就业岗位。此外，在用于航天发射的军用级技术方面，印度作为东道主的信心比中国更大，并且已经有了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07 /04/business/india-space-startups.html&quot;>;蓬勃发展的生态系统&lt;/a>;到位。自 2020 年以来，印度已举办&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_satellites_launched_by_India&quot;>;111 次国际太空发射&lt;/a>;，并成功&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes .com/interactive/2023/science/india-moon-landing-photos.html&quot;>;八月下旬，月球车登陆月球&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑另一个突出的例子，芯片制造商美光科技技术，&lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-new-semiconductor-assemble-and-test-facility&quot;>;宣布&lt;/a>;计划建设新的组装和测试设施，作为中国以外地区多元化举措的一部分。事实上，世界银行新任行长表示，印度实现&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-should-cash-china-plus- one-strategy-world-bank-chief-2023-07-19/#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20many%20companies,World%20Bank%20chief%20last%20month.&quot;>;“兑现” &lt;/a>; 公司寻求供应链和制造多元化，摆脱对中国的严重依赖，背后的增长趋势。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;侨民股息&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，两位首席执行官美光科技公司的总裁和世界银行行长都是印度出生的，这让我们想到了第三个关键推动者：印度侨民，他们现在是世界上规模最大、影响力前所未有的群体。仅在商业世界就说明了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2023/06/12/indias-diaspora-is-bigger-and-more-influenceial-than-any- in-history&quot;>;标准普尔 500 强公司中有 25 位首席执行官出生于印度。除此之外，许多公司的高级管理层都是印度人。这是&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.economictimes.com/tech/startups/indians-are-driven-the-us-startup-story-nfap-study/india-is-the-leading-country-of -origin-for-immigrant-Founders-of-us-unicorns/slideshow/93165270.cms&quot;>;美国独角兽移民创始人的主要原籍国&lt;/a>;。这些联系有助于建立与印度企业的全球联系，并促进印度融入全球价值链。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;障碍&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;虽然这些因素相辅相成，但许多障碍仍然存在 — — 它们可能会导致乘数效应达到失速的效果。考虑一下道路上的三个主要障碍以及所需采取的行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;增长不平衡&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;尽管国家层面的增长数字令人印象深刻，但经济效益却非常不平等。印度前 10% 的人拥有 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfam.org/en/india-extreme-inequality-numbers&quot;>;77%&lt;/a>; 的国民财富。仅因为医疗保健费用，几乎&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfam.org/en/india-extreme-inequality-numbers&quot;>;每秒就有 2 人&lt;/a>;陷入贫困。印度的人口密度是世界上最高的之一，加剧了资源分配和环境压力的零和性质。区域失衡——印度南部和西部的增长速度比印度北部和东部快 12%——随着时间的推移将会加剧。在这种语言断层之上，新的地区间紧张局势可能会浮现出来。处理这些问题需要对政治经济进行灵活的管理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于政治分歧，其他失衡现象也在加剧。一种日益自信的形式&lt;a href=&quot;https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-this-side-ganesh-devy-putting-the-useless-to-use-the-divisive-politics-of- the-word-hindutva/article67045226.ece&quot;>;印度教意识形态&lt;/a>;掩盖了创造就业、提高生产力和共享经济利益等核心问题。这个问题的根本原因是，社会上大部分人都相信，在新独立的印度，最初作为平权行动项目的项目应该有日落条款，导致对政治领导人绥靖少数群体的不满。现在钟摆已经转向另一个方向，带来了排斥和身份政治的新挑战。对于许多印度观察家来说，印度在&lt;a href=&quot;https://rsf.org/en/index&quot;>;世界新闻自由指数&lt;/a>;中的排名下降并没有带来什么帮助。因此，大部分不满情绪和少数群体中压抑的情绪可能会爆发，引发螺旋式下降。这种发展可能会破坏共同繁荣的目标。对于国际投资者和贸易伙伴来说，这可能会增加印度这样一个宗教、语言和社会文化多样性的国家的多数主义风险溢价。更重要的是，这些发展耗尽了政治资本，而这些资本本来可以用于社会和经济转型。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应对这些挑战至少有两种解决方案。一是政党从身份政治转向包容性增长和创造就业机会，以此作为赢得该国最广泛人口的最可靠手段。第二，印度不断举行州级选举，这扭曲了公众对话，偏离了以长期经济增长为导向的观点。简化和集中选举将为公众话语提供喘息空间，并推动政治领导层和选民走向更长远的视野。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;未实现的人口潜力&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .reuters.com/world/india/despite-world-beating-growth-indias-lack-jobs-threatens-its-young-2023-05-30/&quot;>;不到一半&lt;/a>;的城市工人拥有充分的时间工作，而印度的大部分就业机会都在生产力低下的非正规部门。教育、技能建设和医疗保健严重不足。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://do3n1uzkew47z.cloudfront.net/siteassets/pdf/ISR_Report_2023.pdf&quot;>;2023 年印度技能报告&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;发现只有一半的年轻印度人有工作能力。即使是“皇冠上的明珠”科技服务业也很脆弱；外包需求是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/ai-why-india-risks-falling-behind-in-the-tech-race/d8236bc2-16bb -11ee-9de3-ba1fa29e9bec_story.html&quot;>;下降&lt;/a>;和劳动力成本套利模式将因编码和日常功能向云计算和人工智能的长期转变而受到破坏。令人担忧的是，印度女性劳动力参与率一直在&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?locations=IN&quot;>;稳步下降&lt;/a>;，从 2005 年的 32% 下降到 2021 年的 19%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;效仿 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rmresults.com/a-spotlight-on-vietnams-transformation-in -education&quot;>;越南&lt;/a>;，必须优先考虑对技能提升的公共和私人投资，这可能会增加&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/india-youth-lack-skills/a- 56879385&quot;>;为印度经济带来 5700 亿美元&lt;/a>;。一个主要障碍是制造业——在可比经济体中创造就业机会的关键——其已稳定在 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/india-must-abandon-protectionism&quot; >;GDP 的 13.3%&lt;/a>;。当前的基础设施推动、政策改革、地缘政治驱动力和资本流入可能有助于释放印度制造业的潜力，但这里讨论的障碍必须消除。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新兴领域，人工智能潜力的激增可能是印度制造业的机遇。鉴于该国&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/50-global-hubs-for-top-ai-talent&quot;>;新兴人工智能人才中心&lt;/a>;，印度将在尖端领域发挥领导作用与印度积累的&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/which-countries-are-leading-the-data-economy&quot;>;海量数据池&lt;/a>;相结合，可以大规模扩展。需要进行文化和组织变革，为女性进入职场创造机会并留住她们。此类项目的酝酿期较长，因此需要有一个重点突出、纪律严明的长期计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;未实现的商业便利性和创新潜力&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在印度开展业务有所改善，但仍然存在许多挑战。征地可能会阻碍建设项目，而法院则是行动缓慢的机构。土地记录可能不存在或已经过时，环境许可也造成了额外的障碍。除此之外，合同执行仍然具有挑战性。根据《经济学人》创建的指数，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/02/the-2023-crony-capitalism-index&quot;>;印度排名第十&lt;/a>;尽管过去三十年进行了大规模的自由化，但裙带资本主义依然盛行。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/india-must-abandon-protectionism&quot;>;保护主义&lt;/a>;的遗留问题仍然存在。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;印度的国家能力需要改变。与普遍的看法相反，印度政府并不庞大且笨拙，而是软弱且衰落。从监管机构到公民机构再到司法机构，各种机构经常兼顾相互冲突的需求，并努力追赶市场和社会现实。许多重要决策都是以危机为参照系做出的，印度的胜利故事往往是制度失败中的个人英雄主义。让印度的国家机器走在前沿很可能是印度的关键项目。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 &lt;/h3>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;全球化并未消亡，但正在发生变化。美国和中国正在创建两个独立的技术领域，而人工智能处于这场新的“数字冷战”的前线。如果民主国家想在这个“重新全球化”的新时代取得成功，就必须这样做。他们需要在政府之间以及私营和公共部门之间进行协调。无论我们喜欢与否，人工智能即将到来。我们正处在一个岔路口，社会各阶层都需要参与构建人工智能系统，为人类繁荣发展的公正和民主的未来做出贡献。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt; a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;我们正在进入一个新的世界秩序，其特点是民族主义抬头和地缘政治竞争加剧。虽然各国不会撤销过去三十年在美国单极统治下形成的所有全球经济体系，但某些关键部门将在我们之前称为的过程中脱钩&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/地缘政治正在改变风险资本必须太“重新全球化。”&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最重要的是，技术生态系统将主要分为两个领域，由世界两个国家决定经济强国美国和中国。其他国家需要决定自己想参与哪个领域，从而向美国和中国施加压力，要求它们超越对方并确立技术主导地位。展现在我们面前的是一种更加激烈的经济竞争形式，我们将其理解为“数字冷战”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数字冷战将是一场经济战争，技术创新日益决定地缘政治实力。人工智能（AI）具有快速、彻底改变社会的能力，将成为这一领域最具决定性的技术。人工智能以信息为基础，其最强大的用例将通过其在公共和私营部门的应用而出现。为了让民主世界取得进步，公司和国家需要采取一种新的方法，将合作和转型置于竞争和破坏之上。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;民主协调的新时代&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们无处不在看到&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/dealbook/globalization-fink-marks.html&quot;>;声称&lt;/a>;“全球化已死”。这种声明从根本上来说是误导性的。我们正在走向的系统比全球互联的恢复更为复杂。在许多情况下，贸易只是被改变路线而不是被关闭。大多数商业行业将保持开放和全球化，但某些关键部门将转向国内，转向本地化供应链。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一趋势不是始于美国及其政策，而是始于习近平和他的 &lt;a href =&quot;http://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latest_releases/2015/05/19/content_281475110703534.htm&quot;>;2015年中国制造计划&lt;/a>;，明确表明中国政府已开始优先考虑国家对市场效率的弹性。习近平制定了一项计划，旨在在经济主导领域（尤其是高科技领域）击败美国和其他全球大国。事实上，中国继续朝着到 2025 年关键技术自给自足 70% 的目标迈进。此后，美国也采取了一系列雄心勃勃的措施来保持技术霸主地位。这一现实引导我们进入一个两极的高科技未来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当谈到人工智能（可以说是这场全球竞争中最具决定性的技术）时，我们正在走向两个密封的生态系统：一个支持开放系统，但也与民主、隐私和个人权利相关，而不是支持国家控制、信息流限制和政治上对开放性施加的限制。尽管我们可能希望中国的政治模式能够发展，其技术能够受到民主反馈，但我们不应该天真：这不是它所走的轨道。为了实现崇尚开放和个人权利的未来，民主国家需要成为人工智能市场的领导者。确保这一点的唯一方法是促进国际合作，特别是民主国家与其他基于规则的秩序捍卫者之间的合作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在以前的时代，美国可以在技术上进行创新，而其他国家只需简单地进行技术创新即可。采用它。 When American technology leaders made groundbreaking advancements with personal computers and the internet, they operated under the assumption that American companies could work in isolation and spread their technologies across the world in a top-down fashion. The cloud revolution amplified this further, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google owning 65% of the global market for cloud computing. This strategy may have worked when technologies were intended for pure disruption. AI, however, is geared for societal transformation. This requires a new kind of collaboration across stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along with computing capabilities, the power of AI is based on the amount of aggregated data that is fed to it. This means that the United States, or any country, working in isolation with restricted data flows will fail to maximize the potential of its technology — and yet data localization policies &lt;a href=&quot;https://itif.org/publications/2021/07/19/how-barriers-cross-border-data-flows-are-spreading-globally-what-they-cost/&quot;>;doubled worldwide&lt;/a>; from 2017 to 2021, further obstructing cross-border collaboration. The summation of human knowledge and capabilities is not siloed in any one country or culture. Even Wikipedia&#39;s knowledge base is only 11% in the English language. For AI to thrive in its ability to help us solve our hardest problems, we have to unlock the world&#39;s capacity — from French nuclear scientists to Korean philosophers, from Indian researchers to Kenyan artists, and indeed to Chinese researchers who choose to leave China and work and live in the West.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus, the capital requirements for investments in the sector are so large at present that very few national markets are big enough to succeed with AI on their own. For example, consider investment in semiconductors — a key input into AI progress. The UK&#39;s recently announced 100 million GBP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/initial-100-million-for-expert-taskforce-to-help-uk-build-and-adopt-next-generation-of-safe-ai&quot;>;AI plan&lt;/a>; and 1 billion GBP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-1-billion-strategy-for-uks-semiconductor-sector&quot;>;semiconductor investment&lt;/a>; pale in comparison to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-approves-280-billion-bill-to-boost-us-science-chip-production-11658942295&quot;>;US&#39;s&lt;/a>; $280 billion and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/eu-enacts-43-billion-chips-act-in-bid-to-boost-production&quot;>;EU&#39;s&lt;/a>; 43 billion EUR chips packages — and even these packages are constrained compared to the scale of the investment required to fully develop these technologies. Certainly, few investors globally can support fundraising rounds for startups like the one-year-old Inflection AI&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/inflection-ai-raises-13-bln-funding-microsoft-others-2023-06-29/&quot;>;$1.3 billion round&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the center of this all, a disjointed approach with various patchworks of regulatory frameworks across the West will harm any ability to compete and win against Chinese AI systems. It is not just a function of population, but a function of data points. Chinese society,&amp;nbsp;with a population more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-population-of-china-compared-with-the-rest-of-the-world/&quot;>;four times larger&lt;/a>; than the US&#39;s, &amp;nbsp;has become so digitized with data freely shared between its government and domestic technology champions. Soon their models, based largely on American and foreign research, can leapfrog the capabilities of those in the West.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With its size, centralized government, and inroads in other countries, China has the potential to develop one comprehensive AI model that outcompetes the multiplicity of models coming out of democratic nations if there is no international coordination. While the United States is still the AI leader — with the companies that are doing the most cutting-edge research — and while AI seems to have a bias toward open systems with unfettered access to information, the United States risks losing its edge if it fails to coalesce around a uniform strategy with other democratic nations. If this were to happen, Chinese companies could bring their technology to Western markets, influencing democratic politics and signaling to the world China&#39;s economic dominance — and its broader colonization of digital infrastructure around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI is becoming an increasingly critical part of this global infrastructure, and the West must act swiftly and in a unified fashion to ensure the technology remains open and democratically controlled. To develop the most powerful AI models across sectors, the United States will need to collaborate with other allied countries — to name a few, India, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and European nations — by adopting data-sharing policies and encouraging the co-creation of technological innovations. Much can be gleaned from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.european-data-governance-act.com/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20European%20Data,of%20EU%20citizens%20and%20businesses.&quot;>;European Data Governance Act&lt;/a>; approved by the EU in 2022, which facilitates data-sharing across member countries to maximize benefits for its citizens and businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Failure to course correct will severely limit the impact of AI. For models tackling climate change, siloed data is an immediate death sentence. Medical and healthcare data and innovations are not limited to any one country, nor any one research institution. Industrial AI powering global supply chains cannot be effective without the constant flow of interconnected data. In consumer applications, varying copyright frameworks would stymie cultural relevance and influence, favoring those with free access to data over others. Moreover, piecemeal data regulation and sovereignty requirements raise compliance costs and complexity, harming the innovation economy&#39;s ability to succeed.&amp;nbsp;This is not to suggest that governments should abstain from regulating AI, but rather that they should work together to establish uniform standards and practices across countries. Coordination among democratic nations will empower each country to individually feel resilient when it comes to AI, but also elevate the West as a bloc to be the leader in AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Responsible Innovation for AI Transformation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In addition to collaborating across states, if Western companies want to become true market leaders, they will also need to collaborate within states, namely with governmental institutions and civil society. While most of the current discourse surrounding AI focuses on large language models and other generative capabilities, AI&#39;s most significant long-term impacts will come from the ways in which it transforms industries and society as a whole. And genuine transformation cannot come about if private actors are disconnected from the wider society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Already we are seeing AI&#39;s transformative potential beginning to take shape. AI has the capacity to massively level the playing field for who has access to information and insights. In the classroom, AI can give&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/30/tech/ai-industry-statement-extinction-risk-warning/index.html&quot;>;recent attention&lt;/a>; has fixated on the existential threat AI could pose to humanity in the somewhat distant future. But AI is also destabilizing democratic systems in the here and now, providing new avenues for mis- and dis-information through sophisticated bots and realistic deep-fakes. AI will also throw into question the value of democracy itself. What happens when authoritarian systems, augmented by AI, can outperform their democratic counterparts, for instance by massively reducing crime with expanded surveillance? Or by providing vastly better healthcare because of access to centralized information with no restrictions for privacy? Undemocratic alternatives will only become more tempting as AI develops, and these possibilities are not too far off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are at a fork in the road when it comes to AI. We can go down the path that leads to automation and destruction, replacing human work and meaning, or we can go down the path that leads to copiloting and enablement, making us more productive, helping us live more balanced lives, and becoming greater masters of our craft. Unlike the social media revolution, which, if regulators really wanted to, they could have slowed or redirected, the AI revolution can only charge forward. Unlike previous &lt;em>;platform&lt;/em>; revolutions, this is a &lt;em>;technological&lt;/em>; revolution, and its mantle has already been picked up by stakeholders across society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most successful companies will be those that embrace this forward-looking vision and build to endure, by centering a core set of values that align with society and abide by self-regulatory mechanisms. Taking the further step of partnering with the public sector and incumbent ecosystems is also crucial. We cannot risk AI going awry and putting democracies off track in this competitive race. Since the impacts of AI will be felt across every sector of society, accounting for broad stakeholder interests is both a moral responsibility and the only way to bring about sustainable transformation. In the age of AI, companies will need to pursue an agenda of responsible innovation, working outside of the usual technological silos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To win the Digital Cold War, the United States and its allies must be the market leaders in AI. And to build the best AI companies, they need to prioritize international collaboration and engender a new mindset — one that aims to innovate responsibly and unleash human potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Challenges of Networking as an Executive]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_02_200428479-007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Martin Barraud/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Networking is critical for senior executives who are making job and career transitions, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to find advice on how best to manage the process. In this article, the authors &amp;#8212; who have decades of experience working with executives during periods of transition &amp;#8212; identify six networking hurdles that executives often encounter, and they provide guidance on how to get over them.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-challenges-of-networking-as-an-executive?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Look online at any of the thousands of articles available on the challenges of networking for a job, and you&#39;ll find that 100% of them give advice on how relatively junior professionals can network “up.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But surprisingly little advice is available for senior executives, who experience a different but equally challenging set of networking hurdles. That&#39;s a problem, because knowing how to reap networking&#39;s full benefits is crucial for people at the top of the pyramid, especially a time when CEO turnover is at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/04/27/ceo-turnover-high-pandemic/&quot;>;record high&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have decades of experience working with and studying senior executives who are making career changes. In this article, we&#39;ll identify six common hurdles that that they often struggle with when it comes to career networking, and we&#39;ll provide some guidance on how to get over them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1) Reluctance to ask for help&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Networking for a next role means asking for help. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597897927461&quot;>;Research in social psychology&lt;/a>; shows that people with high status are more apt to feel pressure to maintain an image of strength and competence and to value self-reliance, all of which can make them reluctant to seek assistance. They fear rejection and worry that asking for help might expose perceived weaknesses, potentially undermining their status, position, or reputation. This is ego-driven reluctance, and we see it frequently. As one of Herminia&#39;s students put it, “I give help — I don&#39;t ask for it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way around this tendency, which is a natural one, is to start your networking process by reaching out to lower-risk (and lower-yield) contacts — ideally, executives who you know well, who have done their own networking, and who can share not only how they approached others for help but also what they got out of asking for it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can probably do this with more people than you realize: As the Stanford social psychologist Xuan Zhao has found, people regularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976221097615?journalCode=pssa&quot;>;underestimate&lt;/a>; others&#39; willingness to help, because they don&#39;t realize how happy it makes those others to do so. Low-risk warm-ups and rehearsal practice — what Spish calls “hearing the dreaded words come out of your mouth” — will help you fine-tune your message, defuse your emotions, and experience success. And having a few positive experiences under your belt will make your later, more-challenging calls and emails easier.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2) &amp;nbsp;Prioritizing secrecy &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The more senior an executive, the more likely they are to want secrecy, especially if they&#39;ve been laid off. One of Spish&#39;s clients, for example, asked: “How do I go out into the market without letting the market know that I&#39;m looking? I&#39;d like to reach out to people, but I don&#39;t want them to know that I&#39;m interested in looking.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such worries limit your exposure to others, which is a problem in its own right. But they also force you to be secretive as you work on networking and career change — a process, according to Herminia&#39;s research, that often takes far longer than people expect. That burden of secrecy, carried for a long time, can exact a significant psychological toll.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Limiting your exposure to others can be especially pernicious when it keeps you from stepping back and exploring broadly what you would really like to do next. And try as you might, you won&#39;t fool people by obfuscating. At senior levels, it&#39;s a small world: The people you talk to can figure out what you&#39;re up to, perhaps by making a call to a source in their own network, or perhaps just by doing a search online. If you do succeed in concealing your story, it&#39;s likely to tax your nerves and cost you a lot of energy to get the same result that just speaking honestly and directly would have gotten you. With rare exceptions, honesty is the best policy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3) &amp;nbsp;Unrealistic expectations &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Because they&#39;re reluctant to ask for help and don&#39;t want word to get out that they are in the market for a new role, senior executives typically want to get their networking done fast. Or they simply assume that because they&#39;re senior, the process won&#39;t take very long. Unfortunately, the more senior you are, the more time you&#39;re likely to need to find and align on the right fit. In Spish&#39;s experience, the shortest possible search is about three months, and the longer ones can take as much as 18 months.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only does effective networking take a long time, it also involves a great deal of work, stamina, efficiency, and patience. There are three primary reasons for this.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, as both of us have found, only a small percentage of people looking for their next role know exactly which handful of companies they&#39;d like to work for. Because they don&#39;t know enough about the market or what they really want to be able to come up with a targeted search, they have to start with research and very general exploratory networking. That all takes time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, what you want and are best suited for may not actually be available to you. Both of us have seen highly qualified and experienced people take an excruciatingly long time to find their next role. &lt;span>;O&lt;/span>;ne executive that Herminia recently observed thought, given his past experience, that he&#39;d be an ideal candidate for the audit committee of a big corporate board, but as the selection criteria shifted to include a greater diversity of professional profiles, he found himself waiting to get a nod.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, most companies today have elaborate, time-consuming, and unpredictable vetting processes, which can often add months at the tail end of the hiring process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the senior-executive job market, it helps to recognize that in the messy meeting of supply and demand you have surprisingly little control. A great proactive tactic that can help you compensate for that as you do your networking is to fill your calendar with stimulating, parallel activities (community work, pro-bono consulting, short-term advising, adjunct teaching) in which you can have a more immediate impact and receive a more gratifying response. This compensates for the tedium, if not burden, of asking and waiting for help. It also provides battered egos with positive, if provisional, identities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4) Not wanting to put in the work &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Executives who are used to having things done for them often balk at devoting time to tedious work that they can&#39;t delegate. But to network successfully, you need to treat the task as fully worth your time and energy — and you need to be methodical and organized about it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help with that, Spish has developed a networking process that consists of identifying and then contacting three kinds of contacts: information givers, door openers, and decision makers. Information givers are people who can tell you about the market, companies, and hiring trends; they can help you get smart and get over your fear of networking. Door openers are typically people you&#39;ve worked with in the past. They&#39;re responsive, and because they know you and your work style, they&#39;re willing to vouch for you and can introduce you to the decision makers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;d like to use this process, the best way to start is by first making a list of all your employers, clients, and customers, and then by writing down the names of the people you met in those roles. You might find you easily come up with 100 names.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what approach you use to organizing, targeting, and segmenting your search, you&#39;ll always need to start by generating a long list of people you&#39;ve worked with and then methodically following a system for reaching out to them. Because it&#39;s a learning process, you can&#39;t plan it all out in advance; you&#39;re better off adopting a “snowball” approach” in which you ask each contact who else you should meet. This is especially true if you&#39;re looking in markets that are unfamiliar to you. In that case, you&#39;ll need to network in what Spish calls “the valleys below the clouds.” There are lots of opportunities in these valleys, but they unfamiliar and require exploration. If you don&#39;t explore them, you limit your options and can hurt your career growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a high-cost, high-yield game, but it pays off. Spish has found that once you&#39;ve reached out to 50 or more contacts on your list, the network will start to reach out to you, at which point you can let the process carry you forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5) Overly focusing on “the narrative” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve made a contact, there is the important matter of what to say. All too often, executives spend the bulk of a networking conversation in small talk about shared contacts or experiences without getting to the point (that they need a new job) until the very end of the conversation. This is especially common when they feel they need to conceal the reality of what&#39;s going on — that they don&#39;t get along with their boss, say, or that they&#39;ve been fired. When that happens, they often enter into the conversation already on the defensive, they speak evasively, and they devote their energy to protecting their public image instead of learning all they can. The end result is that they waste a lot of their — and their contacts&#39; — time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another unproductive tack is to spend 80% of your time trying to explain why you&#39;re unhappy, or leaving, or got fired — a negative approach that anchors your conversation in the past when it should be positive and focused on the future. You&#39;re much better off spending 20% of your allotted time explaining your situation and focusing the remaining 80% on what you&#39;re looking for instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best practice in networking conversations is to be direct, succinct, and positive. People want to know why you&#39;re calling them and what you want from them, and the more senior they are, the more likely they&#39;ll be to expect a brief, executive summary of this sort: “This is why I&#39;m calling you. This is what I want from you. I hope that there&#39;s enough in these two points for us to have a 10-minute conversation.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6) &amp;nbsp;Failing to tailor your story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Executives looking to make a transition often spend inordinate amounts of time perfecting a single script — the fabled “elevator pitch” about their “core skills and abilities.” They do this assuming that this script will make them universally relevant, but almost invariably what they end up with just isn&#39;t satisfactorily tailored to the needs of the receiver.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve seen a lot of executives try to approach networking the way they would work with head-hunters: They write a generic email, just changing the name and one or two sentences, attach their resume, and send it out to a bunch of people. Likewise, many walk into a meeting and robotically state their one-minute pitch even if it doesn&#39;t fit the unique circumstances and requirements of the person who&#39;s listening.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That just doesn&#39;t work. Yes, figuring out your core storyline (Who am I, and why am I here?) is important. But you can&#39;t assume that you&#39;re going to be saying the same thing about yourself to every person you meet. Nor can you assume that every listener is capable of translating your pitch into their own business context.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, here&#39;s what you need to remember: It&#39;s not about you. If you hope to clinch a role for which you&#39;re truly well suited, you need to figure out how to make the switch from talking about yourself to talking knowledgeably about the company and its problems — and then to articulating how well equipped you are to solve those problems. As Spish has found, that&#39;s how you create opportunities for yourself: A large percentage of the most senior executives he&#39;s coached have ended up moving into roles that didn&#39;t even exist before they had their conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;* * *&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re a senior executive, networking is a delicate, complex, and time-consuming task. Ego and impatience, left unchecked, will sabotage your success. The best approach is to think of networking as an opportunity not just to scout out your next role but also to strengthen or deepen relationships you already have — and, even better, to add new relationships that will help you be a better professional in your new job and the others that come after it.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When Your Vacation Wasn&rsquo;t Exactly Relaxing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/when-your-vacation-wasnt-exactly-relaxing]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_05_82836891.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Williams+Hirakawa/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Time off doesn&amp;#8217;t always go as planned.

The author recommends five strategies: 1) Take inventory of your health and energy; 2) Ease back into work; 3) Reflect on the positives; reframe and learn from the negatives; 4) Use the fresh start effect to set up new routines; and 5) Clarify what you need for future time off.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/when-your-vacation-wasnt-exactly-relaxing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/when-your-vacation-wasnt-exactly-relaxing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Vacations are meant to be rejuvenating. Time off can not only help you &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-taking-a-vacation-improves-your-well-being&quot;>;restore your mind, body, and soul&lt;/a>;, it also has a positive impact on your work life: One study found that employees who take 11 or more vacation days &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/the-data-driven-case-for-vacation&quot;>;are more likely to receive a raise or bonus&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/02/when-a-vacation-reduces-stress-and-when-it-doesnt&quot;>;not all vacations are as restorative&lt;/a>; or energizing as we hope they&#39;ll be. Chronic work stress can interfere with our plans. The phenomenon of getting sick as soon as you start to relax even has a name: &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.thriveglobal.com/the-five-key-steps-to-take-to-avoid-leisure-sickness/&quot;>;leisure sickness&lt;/a>;&lt;u>;.&lt;/u>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when pacing yourself, your time off doesn&#39;t always go as planned. The &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/going-on-vacation-doesnt-have-to-stress-you-out-at-work&quot;>;vacation itself can be a source of stress&lt;/a>; for a variety of reasons, from strained relationships, pre-vacation stress of getting everything done, unexpected travel delays, or the weight of &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/how-to-minimize-stress-before-during-and-after-your-vacation&quot;>;impending deadlines and workload when you return&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what can you do when you come back to work more exhausted than when you left — especially when everyone assumes you&#39;re well rested and raring to go but you feel just as depleted (or more) than before? Here are five steps you can take to refresh on your return.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Take inventory of your health and energy.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Unless you&#39;ve been on a rejuvenating health retreat, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;ve veered away from your healthy routines, maybe skipping out on physical activity or finding yourself caught up in a full schedule and indulging a bit too much.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On your return, assess and acknowledge your energy levels, taking inventory of how you&#39;re feeling to determine what you need. Research has found that optimizing your energy along the following domains can help boost wellbeing and performance: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/insights/focus/behavioral-economics/sleep-benefits-impact-employee-performance.html&quot;>;sleep&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/to-improve-your-work-performance-get-some-exercise&quot;>;movement&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201208/connect-thrive&quot;>;connection&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/why-you-should-tell-your-team-to-take-a-break-and-go-outside&quot;>;time outdoors&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/to-cope-with-stress-try-learning-something-new&quot;>;relaxation&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/05/how-relational-energy-impacts-employee-engagement/?sh=7a3861a047c2&quot;>;meaningful &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/05/how-relational-energy-impacts-employee-engagement/?sh=7a3861a047c2&quot;>;engagement&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Start by rating yourself on a scale of 1-10 in terms of your current energy levels in each of the above areas. Then identify where you would like to be in each domain and one action you can take to reinforce or improve each of these elements of your wellbeing. Reassess daily for a week, tracking how your energy shifts as you re-engage in healthier habits.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Ease back into work.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/what-to-do-on-your-first-day-back-from-vacation&quot;>;Coming back from a vacation&lt;/a>; can be a challenging experience when you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed about catching up with emails and conversations that were piling up while you were supposed to be relaxing and enjoying time off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resist the temptation to dive into work headfirst by building in a day of transition and recovery before returning to normal. You might even consider drafting an auto-response or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/ease-the-pain-of-returning-to-work-after-time-off#:~:text=Block%20off%20significant%20chunks%20of,something%20to%20look%20forward%20to.&amp;amp;text=Stay%20in%20stealth%20mode.&quot;>;extending your OOO&lt;/a>; for an extra day or two.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before you enter into a full day&#39;s work, set some guard rails for your time so that you can get off to a good start.&amp;nbsp; Begin with essential and time-sensitive tasks and give yourself a buffer to catch up on emails and updates that can come later. Block time out on your calendar also for activities that energize you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Reflect on the positives; reframe, and learn from the negatives.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s easy to get overwhelmed or disappointed by things that may not have gone as well as you had hoped — but there are likely some positive memories to hold onto. Take some time to reflect and savor those experiences, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/the-mental-benefits-of-vacationing-somewhere-new&quot;>;lessons and insights gained&lt;/a>;. Capture them on paper, so you can share them with your team members, and reinforce the benefits of your time away. If the trip left you feeling in a rut, maybe you can find solace in the fact that you&#39;re home again getting back to normal.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Use the fresh start effect to set new habits and routines&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fresh start effect is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/research-explores-how-fresh-starts-affect-our-motivation-at-work&quot;>;the phenomenon of increased success in behavioral change&lt;/a>; associated with new beginnings, such as birthdays, the new year, and other milestones. You can harness this effect by using your return to work as an opportunity to reset.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coming back from a vacation is a good time to establish new practices that further enhance your energy and productivity, like &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/to-improve-your-work-performance-get-some-exercise&quot;>;exercising&lt;/a>;, shutting off notifications, blocking distractions, or writing in a journal each night. Seek out habits and routines that feel replenishing in your day-to-day life. You can leverage practices such as &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive&quot;>;timeboxing&lt;/a>; to optimize your energy for the things that matter to you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be tempting to try to overcompensate but don&#39;t let remorse drive your actions. Rather think about the routines that will work within the context of your daily life so that your habits can be sustainable.&amp;nbsp; Determine what you need to do today to &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/09/is-your-motivation-still-on-vacation&quot;>;get back on track&lt;/a>;, leave remorse out of the equation and do what you need to create forward momentum.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Clarify what you need for future time off.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Use this experience as a learning opportunity to set the ground for a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-taking-a-vacation-improves-your-well-being&quot;>;more replenishing vacation in the future&lt;/a>;. Decide how much structure was energizing versus draining on your energy. Who do you want to spend time with and how far do you want to travel? How much &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/set-these-5-boundaries-before-you-go-on-vacation&quot;>;communication with your team&lt;/a>; do you need for your own wellbeing and connection needs?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even a good vacation can sometimes be exhausting. If you don&#39;t properly manage your time and energy when returning, your exhaustion can have a cumulative impact on your wellbeing, work, relationships, and performance. If you didn&#39;t get what you needed from this vacation, use it as motivation to ensure that you build sustainable, energy-preserving practices into your daily life.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Avoid These Pitfalls When Measuring Your Strategy&rsquo;s Performance]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/avoid-these-pitfalls-when-measuring-your-strategys-performance]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sept23_01_1391375157.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Luis Alvarez/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;This article explores three common traps that managers fall into when measuring their strategy&amp;#8217;s performance and explains how to avoid them. The first trap is when the strategic framework and measurement system don&amp;#8217;t align. To fix it, you must organize both around key stakeholders. The second trap is when companies measure what they do rather than what they achieve. To fix this, focus on stakeholder outcomes. The third trap is a lack of focus. To fix it, cascade rather than amalgamate your metrics.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/avoid-these-pitfalls-when-measuring-your-strategys-performance?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/avoid-these-pitfalls-when-measuring-your-strategys-performance?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Measuring the performance of a business goes hand in glove with its business strategy. Or it should. But surprisingly, as I&#39;ve witnessed firsthand over an extended period, organizations in all sectors struggle to match their strategy design with their performance measurement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is hugely important because it&#39;s almost impossible to track the success of a business strategy if there are no reliable key performance indicators (KPIs). Conversely, poor performance measurement can encourage misdirected strategic targets. Both can lead to repeat performances of the same failed decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here I explore three common traps that managers fall into when measuring their strategy&#39;s performance and explain how to avoid them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. Non-matching frameworks&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Roger is the CEO of a state government&#39;s main roads department. When he was appointed, he installed his favored strategy framework based on “areas.” These came with their own acronym – KRAs, key result areas. So, he organized the main roads strategic plan under items such as energy reduction, governance, and material sourcing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trouble was that it didn&#39;t match main roads&#39; existing performance measurement framework, which was organized around programs such as road safety, road efficiency, and road maintenance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The disconnect was hugely dysfunctional with much executive time and energy expended trying to make things work. As one executive wryly observed, “it was like trying to put parts of a Ford into a Mercedes Benz. They just wouldn&#39;t fit.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How to fix it: Organize around key stakeholders.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Marjorie heads up a not-for-profit entity which looks after people with autism. When she joined the organization as CEO, she was faced with what she describes as “a disconnect between our strategic planning framework and how our KPIs were assembled.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The organization&#39;s strategic plan was structured around “key issues” like budget overruns, obtaining grants, and hiring staff. The KPIs were a hotchpotch of metrics drawn from a variety of sources including HR, accounting and finance, and operations including operating expenses and the number of staff training courses run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her solution was to refocus both strategy and the KPIs around the &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;organization&#39;s key stakeholders.&lt;/a>; These were people with autism and their families, government, donors and supporters, and staff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the case of the stakeholder staff, Marjorie&#39;s organization wanted to ratchet up innovation around the services they provided for people with autism and their families. This required attracting first-rate clinicians by boosting the organization&#39;s position on employment conditions. One indicator of success was an increase in the number of job applications from suitably qualified psychologists. “At last,” she says, “our organization&#39;s strategic plan and scorecard can speak to each other.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Measuring activity&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s how I illustrate this problem to groups of managers at my workshops. I say to them: “I propose to measure my performance today by measuring the number of slides I use. And if I&#39;m really tired at the end of the day I&#39;ll know I&#39;ve done a good job. Would you be happy with those as measures of my performance?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My audience always says no. “为什么？” I ask. “Because they&#39;re measures of activity, not of results,” they say. “And who decides on those results ?” I inquire. “We do,” comes the universal response. In that moment my audience “gets it.” I can see it in their faces.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How to fix it: Focus on outcomes.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Angelo heads up the national office of a well-known brand of construction tools. When it came to measuring the performance of his business, he explained: “We would get together and focus on what we do. The KPIs we produced were invariably about processes.” They broke this fixation by focusing on the outcomes his organization produced for its key stakeholders – customers, suppliers, employees, and the parent company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Measuring this performance involves a two-way street with outcomes going both ways – for the business and for stakeholders. Angelo and his team avoided making assumptions about what the outcomes would be for their stakeholders. Instead, they interviewed key stakeholders to learn if the outcomes important to them had been identified. The interviews also revealed new KPIs that Angelo and his team would never have thought of.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. Lack of focus&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sebastian is CEO of a suburban council. He wanted to develop a scorecard of the council&#39;s performance linked to the council&#39;s strategic plan. So, he collected measures from departments below him, such as community development, environment and planning, and corporate services, and he created a composite list. This list was long and left him dissatisfied. Many of the measures didn&#39;t seem at all related to the council&#39;s objectives.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How to fix it: Cascade rather than amalgamate your metrics.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Helen is a newly installed principal of a large, prestigious, and very expensive private girls&#39; school. To develop a scorecard for the school, she gathered measures from academic departments such as science, English and mathematics. But, as with Sebastian, the composite set of KPIs didn&#39;t work as measures of the school&#39;s performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She fixed this by starting again. This time, rather than amalgamating measures from bottom to top, she developed KPIs in the reverse order — from top to bottom. The process she says, “allowed me to kill two birds with the one stone. It uncovered gaps in the KPI set for the school and provided a fit between the school&#39;s strategic plan around students, parents, teachers and staff, government, [and] the community… [It also] provided an effective scorecard based on the results for these same groups.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Helen had learned a fundamental concept in performance measurement – level of analysis. Measures that apply at one level, eg, profit at the corporate level, don&#39;t apply at another level, eg, an internal department like HR. Similarly, measures that are apt at a department level are not appropriate at the corporate level.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s easy for gaps to develop between your strategic plan and your KPIs if you don&#39;t apply a framework consistently across both – and you&#39;re certainly not alone if this has happened to you.&amp;nbsp; As you close the gaps, however, remember above all that measuring performance is fundamentally about measuring your relationships with your &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/five-questions-to-identify-key-stakeholders&quot;>;organization&#39;s key stakeholders.&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp; Your KPIs, therefore, need to be shaped by what those stakeholders expect from you and not by what you think you should be doing.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Harvard&rsquo;s Arthur C.

You find that happiness started to go into a little bit of a malaise, a bit of a decline, in the late &#39;80s, early &#39;90s, but then it took a real big dip when social media came along.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media was catastrophic for happiness. Part of the reason is we distract ourselves when we&#39;re lonely with something that&#39;s the equivalent of burgers and fries for a social life. They give you lots of calories and not very much nutrition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a lot of neuroscience behind this, but everybody knows that when you&#39;re bored or you&#39;re lonely and you start looking at your devices and at your phone, you actually get more bored and you get more lonely. This is a huge problem, especially for young adults.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the coronavirus came along, and this was the most catastrophic event for public happiness that we&#39;ve seen in a long time worldwide. Ordinarily, about 30% of people would say they&#39;re very happy about their lives, and 15% would say they&#39;re not happy. The rest are in the middle. Those are flipped. Now it&#39;s about 30% who are not happy and 15% who are very happy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those trends have not actually turned around. We know that it has everything to do with social life. It has everything to do with our love relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We know the habits that bring the happiest life—your philosophical or your faith life, your family life, your real friendships, and work that serves others in person—these have been in decline. When those things go in decline, there&#39;s no tech that&#39;s going to solve the problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You do have your finger on it. I want to focus on the world of work. I think this is drawing from stats in the book, I think you say just 16% of employees self-report that they&#39;re very satisfied with their work. I want to ask about that because we&#39;re spending half our waking hours in the office, and yet we&#39;re not getting the kind of fulfillment and satisfaction that we deserve. So what&#39;s happening here and how can we think about moving the needle?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been studying what brings work satisfaction for the longest time, and when I first started off, I was a fresh PhD. I thought, well, let&#39;s see if for-profit versus nonprofit versus government work: which brings the most happiness? Turns out, that&#39;s insignificant. So I said, well, high salaries versus low salaries. Above a certain level of subsistence, it&#39;s a wash. College educated, not college educated, white collar, blue collar, none of it matters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two things show up on the happiest workers, the people who have the greatest happiness from work. They feel like they&#39;re earning their success, which is to say that they&#39;re creating value with their lives and with their work lives, that their accomplishments are moving the needle and they&#39;re being recognized for those accomplishments. And number two, they feel like they&#39;re serving people so that they&#39;re needed. These are the two big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of people are watching us right now who are employers, and I&#39;ve been a CEO too. The number one thing that you can do for recruitment, for retention, the ultimate rewards that go far beyond money are making sure that you have a system where people are earning their success through their merit and personal accomplishment. They know it, they see it, and so do their friends. And they actually feel like they&#39;re serving other people and they can see the faces of the people for whom they&#39;re creating value. These are the big things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One more thing to keep in mind, those things are easiest to do when we&#39;re in person. That&#39;s just it. You said we spend half of our lives with our coworkers at work. Well, I don&#39;t know, man, not anymore. A lot of people are spending half of their lives in front of a Zoom screen where it&#39;s hard to earn your success, it&#39;s hard to feel like you&#39;re serving other people, and you don&#39;t even get to see your work buddies. That&#39;s tough stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re right, then there must be some self-deception here. If you ask people, they like hybrid. They like working from home. They talk about it giving them a better work-life balance, all of that we think would translate into fulfillment and happiness. But do you think we&#39;re fooling ourselves?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, there&#39;s a set of biases that are at play here. For example, one of the things we find is that when you&#39;re really lonely, it impairs the executive centers of your brain. We know this. This is the reason that when you&#39;re really sad and lonely, you cocoon on the couch with a comfortable blanket streaming Netflix and eating Haagen-Dazs. What you should do is get up and go outside and get some vitamin D and ride your bike and call your friends, but you&#39;re impaired at that particular moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the pandemic people started to become more isolated. They made the best of that isolation by creating lives that were very, very convenient, I have to say.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, some people do have a way better work-life balance because they want to spend all that time with their families. The problem is all of the people that are separated from their family and their friends and actually not seeing people at work, that&#39;s really catastrophic when it comes to happiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book in many ways is about agency: happiness and fulfillment are not based on external variables or things that happen to us, but all very much within our control. The problem is it&#39;s very hard to take dramatic actions to reorder one&#39;s life. How do you get people who understand they should be doing this, but who don&#39;t? How do you make that leap?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the problem is that a lot of people notice that they can manage their money and they can manage their company, but they can&#39;t manage their feelings. Or they can manage their home and they can manage their family life, but they can&#39;t manage their emotions. The reason is that emotional life is a different species of problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stuff around us in our work, these are complicated problems, meaning they&#39;re hard to figure out. But once you do, you can master them and repeat the solutions over and over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life and your emotions, the affairs of the heart and the feelings that you&#39;re getting, positive and negative, they&#39;re not complicated at all. They&#39;re what mathematicians would call a complex problem. That&#39;s a problem that&#39;s very easy to understand and that no amount of computational horsepower can solve it for you. You can only get in it and experience it and work with it in real time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cat is a complex problem. A toaster is a complicated problem. Your job is more like a toaster and your relationships are more like a cat. Your feelings are highly complex. The result is that I can master all these highly complicated things, but I can&#39;t get my mind around my feelings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution starts with understanding the science of human emotion. This is what I&#39;m doing in a lot of my work. This is when my HBS students come to me, these phenomenally talented and successful MBA students, really at the best business school in the world. And they&#39;ll say, “My biggest problem is I can&#39;t manage how I feel, and I feel like I&#39;m really out of control.” So the number one skill that we get is to treat your emotional system, the limbic system of your brain, like anything else that you would be managing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about it as a complex system that you&#39;re participating in, and using the techniques that we talk about in the class, which start with basically this idea of learning how to experience your emotions, not as they&#39;re delivered to you, but in the prefrontal cortex of your brain so that you can decide how to react, substitute emotions, and even disregard the emotions, but on purpose. That&#39;s a specific set of techniques called metacognition that I walk through based on cutting-edge neuroscience. Anybody can do it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is, we don&#39;t teach kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach school kids to do this. We don&#39;t teach business people to do this. If I had my way, every business school and every high school would have this class, and when you came to work for a big company, they would have a class in metacognition and emotional self-management that you have to go through for the first week in orientation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I assume these business students are, as you said, incredibly successful by any measure. There&#39;s probably a split, but do you find they crave what you&#39;re teaching or that they come in skeptical of what you&#39;re teaching?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They really crave it. I mean, the most skeptical ones are probably not taking the class. It&#39;s an elective, after all. The ones who are really skeptical are across the hall in supply chain management or something. But the truth is that they really crave it and it&#39;s because they want it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My approach is basically this: you can be happier, but you have to understand the science. You need to use the science to change your habits and your lifestyle, and then you need to teach it to other people to make it permanent in your life. The class is called “Leadership and Happiness” because I want every leader to become a happiness teacher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m doing 175 talks a year outside of Harvard, talking to business audiences primarily. And I say, “Look, I&#39;m going to show you a bunch of PowerPoints on the science of happiness, and what I want you to do is to take these slides, take my name off, put your name on, and I want you to teach it to somebody so that you permanently understand this technology and you don&#39;t forget it in your own life.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s the way to get it done. That&#39;s the way that we teach it at Harvard, and it really, really works. I&#39;m telling you, Adi, I am my own first patient in this work, quite frankly. Because I wanted to be happier. As a social scientist, I applied my own toolkit to myself. I wanted to be a happier person. And since I&#39;ve been writing about the science of happiness, guinea-pigging it on myself, everything that I suggest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in &lt;em>;The Atlantic&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; and to my students, I do myself first to make sure that I actually believe it works. I&#39;m not just reading academic journal articles and then teaching it to other people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My happiness has risen by 60% in the last four years. In just four years. To be sure it started at kind of a low baseline, but 60% is a lot based on the best measurement techniques for happiness. So I know it works, and I see the results of this every day among my students as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s keep you on the couch a bit more. You come across as a positive, presumably happy person. I know first impressions can be off, but even the sentence, “My happiness is up 60%,” I can&#39;t imagine really what you&#39;re measuring to come up with such a specific figure. What are some measurements? Why have your numbers changed and how?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are some general wellbeing surveys people can take. They&#39;re all over the Internet. And if they&#39;re psychometrically robust, they can do a good job. What I like to look at, however, is I pull apart the negative and positive intensity levels in affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affect means mood. What we find is that if you have a little bit of a malaise, if you&#39;re kind of a melancholic person, either your happiness levels are too low or your unhappiness levels are too high.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, it seems like I&#39;m splitting hairs here, but I&#39;m not. A lot of people think happiness and unhappiness are opposites: that if you&#39;re unhappy, it means you have a lack of happiness. That&#39;s completely wrong. Happiness and unhappiness, or positive and negative emotion, they largely exist in different hemispheres of the brain. They&#39;re produced for different reasons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The negative emotions of fear and anger and disgust and sadness, these are evolved to keep you alive. You should be very, very grateful for your negative emotions. But if they&#39;re too intense, they can hurt your quality of life. Your positive emotions of joy and love and interest in things, again, these are evolved and they&#39;re really good things to have.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that some people, their happiness levels are too low. Other people, their unhappiness levels are too high. I have a test that I administer to my students. I didn&#39;t develop it. It was developed by psychometricians about 20 years ago. But it&#39;s called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psytests.org/emo/panasen.html&quot;>;PANAS test&lt;/a>;, the positive affect negative affect series, and it separates out the intensity of your positive and negative emotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happens is effectively that you have four different characteristics. You can be high positive and high negative. You can be low positive and low negative. You can be high positive and low negative, and of course you could be high negative and low positive. These are a quarter of the population each.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High, high, this is a high affect person, it&#39;s called the mad scientist. That&#39;s me. My problem with wellbeing is not that I&#39;m unhappy or that I&#39;m not happy enough. On the contrary, it just means that I need to manage my high levels of negative affect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other people have different issues. Everybody wants to be high positive and low negative. That&#39;s called the cheerleader. It turns out cheerleaders have problems, too. If two cheerleaders meet each other and marry, for example, they won&#39;t be able to bear any threat or listen to any bad news or think that anything bad might happen in the future. They&#39;ll spend all the money and go bankrupt. Cheerleaders, they tend to be pretty rocky CEOs because they will not listen to bad news, and they tend to get wiped out by threats.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High negative, low positive, these are poets. They tend to be extremely creative, but they suffer a lot from sadness and these negative emotions. They have to manage that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last, low, low, these people are not horribly unhappy or low quality of life. They have low intensity affect. These are judges. These are people who are sober. They make great surgeons, they make great litigators and judges. They make great parents of teenagers, high stress professions, etc. But they tend to look a little unenthusiastic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I give these tests to my students so they can know who to marry, how to manage themselves, how to build a management team around them that complements them. It&#39;s really, really instructive, and this is one of the ways that I measure my own happiness and the management techniques that I need, using the neuroscience for my life, and that I can apply to the lives of others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To what extent do we need to be happy at work? I mean, one approach to work could be I do it, I am hopefully making decent money to be able to sustain myself, and I&#39;m focusing on my personal development, on my happiness outside of work. Obviously in an ideal world, we&#39;re happy and contented everywhere, but do we need to be happy at work? How critical is that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s an empirical question about whether or not people that have a high quality of life tend to be happy at work or it doesn&#39;t matter. And the truth is, if you&#39;re unhappy at work, you&#39;re probably unhappy in life. It&#39;s simple. I mean, it&#39;s like nobody works an hour a day. Maybe you&#39;re one of these lucky people that can be on the four-hour work week. My friend Tim Ferriss wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357&quot;>;that famous book&lt;/a>;, and the truth is, a lot of people could get their work done in a lot less time than they do. But most of us don&#39;t have that luxury.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve been working 80-hour weeks my whole career, and part of it is a pathology. I&#39;m not going to kid you, I talk a lot in my research about self-objectification, workaholism, which is all based on success addiction, and fears of failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And everybody out there watching, you know I&#39;m talking about you too. So take care of these pathologies because these are addictions like anything else, and there&#39;s a lot of brain chemistry in that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is, you&#39;re going to spend a ton of time doing that. And if it&#39;s drudgery, that&#39;s bad. You don&#39;t want drudgery. At very least it should be something that&#39;s pleasant and making it pleasant sometimes it&#39;s completely out of our grasp. If you have a job that you truly hate and a boss who&#39;s just the worst, well, that&#39;s no good. But a lot of it is in our hands, and this is a lot of what I&#39;m working on and what I&#39;m trying to help people understand they can actually manage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You just mentioned workaholism. I think many of us suspect we suffer from it, but maybe aren&#39;t willing to look too closely at whether that&#39;s true. But the workaholism is a high, we get a sense of who we are, a sense of accomplishment, etc. But surely it&#39;s not fully a good thing. What is your advice to workaholics who may not realize that that is what they are?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To begin with, workaholism is actually horrible for your quality of life. The problem is that when you&#39;re a workaholic, people congratulate you. Nobody says, “Man, you are so good at drinking gin.” Nobody ever says, “Dude, you&#39;re unbelievable at how much methamphetamine you can consume.” These are not compliments. People feel sorry for you when you&#39;re addicted to other substances or gambling or pornography or anything else that&#39;s deleterious, dangerous, and addictive, that captures your brain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But workaholism, man, you work all night, you work 100-hour weeks, people are like, “Dude, you&#39;re killing it.” And you&#39;re like, “Yeah, I feel so good about myself, but how come I can&#39;t maintain a proper relationship?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The truth of the matter is that there are really a portfolio of four things that go into having a truly happy life, and they need to be in both in abundance and in balance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Number one is faith and philosophy, whether it&#39;s religious or not religious, it has to be something that zooms you out on the majesty of life and makes you small so that you have yourself in perspective. You&#39;re going to have peace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, you&#39;ve got to be paying serious attention to your family relationship. No joke, family relationships are the most mystical kind of love, and you can&#39;t substitute anything for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your friendships, now, this is a really bad one for workaholics. Workaholics have a lot of deal friends, but not very many real friends. Everybody watching us knows the difference between real and deal. And if you don&#39;t, take the fellow workaholics, take the 10 people that you see most and spend most of your time with and write real or deal after each one, and see for yourself that you need to tune this up. Deal friends are useful, real friends are beautifully useless to you. Do you have enough useless people? That&#39;s the question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least is work. The two parts of work that really matter are not title, not money, not admiration, not power, [but] earned success and serving other people. Workaholism militates against these sources of fulfillment in our lives. It impoverishes. It makes us poorer so that we actually can&#39;t pursue these other pillars. The result is we just don&#39;t have a balanced portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look, if everything you do for your happiness is work, that&#39;s like putting your entire pension into Greek bonds. It might work out, but I&#39;m an economist. I don&#39;t recommend it. That&#39;s not a diversified strategy. You&#39;re most likely not going to retire the way you want to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Saudi Arabia, it&#39;s a simple, intriguing question. Is happiness contagious?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, happiness is absolutely contagious because social contagion is a real thing. There&#39;s a really great study, Adi, more or less in our neighborhood, they&#39;re called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/&quot;>;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a>; from Framingham, Massachusetts. It looks over 50 years. It was set up to look at people&#39;s lives, at how different social aspects of life are contagious for physical stuff, whether obesity is socially contagious, etc. But they started to look at other things like happiness, and they found that just being in the vicinity of a happy person makes you happier. Having your spouse get happier makes you happier. Having your best friend get happier makes you a lot happier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even more contagious is misery. That&#39;s the reason you don&#39;t want your teenage kids to hang out with a kid who wears all black and looks bummed all the time. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s like, “Oh, that sucks. Everything sucks.” You don&#39;t want that because that&#39;s so socially contagious that your kid is going to become unbelievably negative and become sad. And nobody wants this for their children because they have a sense of the social contagion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number one issue that I see in family dynamics is a social contagion of negativity. That&#39;s what each one of us has to turn around, is to try to inject the happiness virus into our family and to basically do it on purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a question from Nepal that picks up on your themes. You&#39;ve talked about people taking agency in their own life and their own fulfillment and sense of happiness. But how should we deal with people in leadership who don&#39;t believe in any of this stuff, who don&#39;t believe in work-life balance? You can work on yourself, but as you said, misery and all this stuff is contagious. How can you move the needle on leadership that doesn&#39;t appreciate any of this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to leadership, leader lead thyself. Your number one employee is you. Don&#39;t be the pace-setting leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember when Daniel Goleman wrote that famous book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Results-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/1633692620&quot;>;&lt;em>;Leadership That Gets Results&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;? It was about the six types of leaders, and the number one leadership characteristic that everybody thinks is great—but is actually horrible—is workaholic pace-setting leaders that are in the office all the time and saying, “Look, if I&#39;m going to ask people to work hard, I have to work even harder.” It&#39;s incredibly dispiriting for other people. It lowers their quality of life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a CEO, I&#39;m telling you, somebody on my executive team says, “Arthur, you got to stop sending email at 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM because people are going to stay up wondering if they&#39;re going to have to answer your email.” I said, “I don&#39;t expect anybody to…” That&#39;s not the point. So I put timers on my email to do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even better was when my wife started clamping down and saying, “You need to sleep more. You need to go to the gym more. You need to have more of a life.” So number one, if you&#39;re a leader, you need to get a hold on this problem because you&#39;re going to be hurting yourself, wrecking your relationships, and disheartening all the people around you. This is a big problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, don&#39;t work for a workaholic. Don&#39;t work for them if you can. And again, not everybody&#39;s got all these degrees of freedom, but most of us have a few choices in what we can do for work. And by the way, if it turns out that your boss is abusing you and hopelessly addicted to drugs, you got to change circumstances. That&#39;s an abusive relationship. I recommend steering clear of workaholics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, what&#39;s behind workaholism, fellow workaholics? It&#39;s the success addiction. Workaholism is a secondary addiction to the addiction of success, and a lot of that&#39;s based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/10/howto-arthurbrooks-happiness-identity-drshefali-mindfulness-meaning-2021/620282/&quot;>;objectification of yourself&lt;/a>;, which is a bad thing to do, and a deep, deep set of fear of failure. Those are the things to actually start working on. You can&#39;t just say, “Work less, what&#39;s the problem?” It&#39;s self-objectification and fear of failure, almost always.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you think of new entries to the workforce, and some of them are your HBS students who are working for investment banks, who are working for law firms, and there is this expectation of exploitation where, yes, I&#39;m working around the clock. It is killing me, but it is getting me to where I will be rich, fulfilled, happy. How can people who are ambitious in those fields do otherwise?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that I tell my students is you&#39;ve got to have a balanced happiness portfolio, and killing all of your relationships to spend 110 hours in an investment bank is the worst, most unbalanced happiness portfolio you can possibly get. Plus, you&#39;re losing your best years to establish the relationships that you&#39;re going to want to cultivate for the rest of your life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People say, “Okay, I&#39;m 28. I&#39;m going to go get an investment bank job, they&#39;re going to expect me to work a hundred hours a week. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll look for a spouse when I&#39;m 35.”可能不会。 I got the data, and the data don&#39;t lie. You&#39;re more and more likely to actually not have the thing that&#39;s going to give you the most happiness in your life, which is your marriage. We actually have to think in a balanced-portfolio approach to the happiness that we&#39;re trying to get, and making those sacrifices are really bad sacrifices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, guys like you and me, our age, in our fifties, you notice that we don&#39;t make those sacrifices anymore. And the reason is because our time parameters are shorter. But also we&#39;ve had bitter experience with these types of things. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s like I&#39;m a grandfather now and my grandson was born and suddenly I was a lot less interested in working. But part of it was the bitter experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ll tell you a story actually that will motivate this. When I was interviewing this woman for my last book, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Finding-Success-Happiness-Purpose-ebook/dp/B08WCKY8MB&quot;>;&lt;em>;From Strength to Strength&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, about how to get happier as you get older, a titan of Wall Street. This woman was just famous and rich, a billionaire, and she was horribly unhappy. She was my age, late fifties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What&#39;s wrong?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “Well, my husband and I were roommates. I&#39;m kind of cordial with my adult kids, but it&#39;s not close. I&#39;m getting bad reports from the doctor. I think I drink too much. I need to go to the gym. My employees are starting to doubt the wisdom of my decision-making. And I don&#39;t know, what do I do?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And I said, “What do you mean? You don&#39;t need a Harvard professor to tell you what to do. You&#39;re prescribing to yourself, stepping back, going away with your husband. You&#39;re already rich. Why don&#39;t you do that?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said, “It&#39;s true, but I guess I&#39;ve always chosen to be special rather than happy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boom, man. It was like a knife to my heart, Adi. All these years when I was running a company and the 14th hour at the office before the first hour with my kids, well, news flash man, they grew up. They grew up and I missed a lot of it. And I really, really regret that. Now I&#39;m not going to miss it with my grandkids, I get a do-over. I&#39;m not going to screw that up twice. That&#39;s a really important thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I could have had a little bit more perspective, I would not have been less successful. The data don&#39;t lie on this either. The 14th hour is not productive. It&#39;s just compulsive. Just like any other addiction, the 14th drink doesn&#39;t give you more joy. Stop at two, is the bottom line, because you need the balance in this part of your life as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At HBR we try to be super practical, so before you go, can you leave the audience shortcuts to happiness, or just things that viewers can think about or do today that can be a meaningful step in that direction?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/how-build-life/&quot;>;my column in the Atlantic&lt;/a>;, every Thursday morning, I have a big topic and I do talk about the science, but then I always give three ways to live this thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just in general, since we&#39;re on the meta topic of happiness, the way to think about happiness is that it&#39;s not a feeling. If happiness were a feeling, that would be very disappointing. It would depend on how you slept last night and what you ate for breakfast and no good. If your spouse yelled at you this morning, no good. Don&#39;t chase the feeling. Feelings are evidence of happiness, like the smell of the turkey is evidence of your Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Happiness is three things that we need to be thinking about and managing in our lives. Enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose. Those are the three big things that we need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enjoyment is not pleasure, pleasure is an animal thing. Enjoyment is the pleasure you get plus the people that you enjoy it with and the memories that you&#39;re making. That&#39;s why beer commercials don&#39;t have a guy alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack. They have people enjoying a few beers together because it&#39;s pleasure plus people plus memory. Don&#39;t do the stuff that makes you feel good alone. That&#39;s the rule of thumb.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second is satisfaction. Satisfaction is the joy you get when you struggle for something and you get that. Now fellow strivers, the striver&#39;s curse is you get on something called the hedonic treadmill where you struggle and struggle and achieve it, but then it doesn&#39;t give you very much satisfaction for very long and so you keep trying and trying and trying again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution to that is not to have more, it&#39;s to want less. Your satisfaction is your haves divided by your wants. Manage your denominator with a wants-management strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And last but not least, it&#39;s meaning, it&#39;s purpose in your life. The way to figure out if you have a purpose crisis is asking yourself two simple questions. There&#39;s no right answers, but you have to have answers. “Why am I alive, and for what am I willing to die today?” And if you don&#39;t have answers, go looking for the answers with introspection. When you see somebody that finds those answers, it&#39;s like an actual miracle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the three things practically to think about. “Do I have enjoyment or just pleasure? Am I managing my wants or my haves, so I can have satisfaction? And do I have enough meaning in my life by answering those two questions?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s great. I hope people took notes, I hope people try to act on that. Arthur, I want to thank you for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ARTHUR C. BROOKS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you, Adi. And thanks to everybody watching.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Incorporating DEI into Decision-Making]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_01_aJTiW00qqtI_5989933_B3UFXwcVbc4_3neSwyntbQ8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Most people believe in promoting DEI in the workplace. But implicit and unconscious biases &amp;#8212; not to mention the constant juggling of priorities required at work &amp;#8212; can lead to inequitable decision-making. In this article, drawing on recent research, the authors suggest that this problem can be addressed by making DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, to managers immediately before they need to make consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation. The authors discuss three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/incorporating-dei-into-decision-making?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Most people don&#39;t think of themselves as biased or prejudiced, and people often explicitly endorse diversity as something companies should strive for. But many organizations struggle with DEI. Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implicit or unconscious biases can lead to inequitable decision-making. More mundanely, people are just busy. They have lots of competing priorities and lots to occupy their brains. Even if they care about DEI, they might not have it top of mind as they go about their work. As a result, they might not see how their decisions are relevant for DEI and so might inadvertently make inequitable decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fix this, managers and organizations should make DEI more immediately obvious, or &lt;em>;salient&lt;/em>;, when it matters most — that is, when consequential decisions about such matters as hiring, promotions, and performance evaluation are being made. Our academic research and experiences partnering with companies suggest that to make real progress on DEI, managers and organizations need to make DEI salient in those moments of consequential decision-making. We&#39;ve identified three particularly effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Ask managers to hire for more than one job at a time. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many hiring decisions are made in isolation, with only one person being hired at a time. When this is the case, diversity simply just isn&#39;t that salient to decision-makers, who are often thinking not about diversity but instead about technical skills, cultural fit, or how quickly a candidate can start. This shouldn&#39;t be surprising, because diversity is a property of groups, not individuals. You can describe a group of people as “diverse” or “homogeneous,” after all, but not an individual person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, when people make collective hiring decisions — when they hire multiple people at a time — our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3533&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that people select more diversity. They start thinking about the candidates they&#39;re selecting as a group, which makes diversity more salient and leads to hiring decisions that improve it. For example, rather than hiring one person every month, a company might benefit from grouping these decisions together and hiring three people very quarter. The total number of people hired will be the same, but making collective decisions every quarter should lead to more diversity. Relatedly, it might also be beneficial to give one person oversight over hiring decisions across teams or departments, enabling that person to make collective hiring decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Ask managers to make diversity more salient in the promotion process. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This recommendation comes from work that we&#39;ve done at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morethannow.co.uk/single-post/2022/8/22/the-inclusion-lab&quot;>;Inclusion Lab at MoreThanNow&lt;/a>;, a collaboration of academics and consultants focused on generating empirical evidence about what actually works at improving DEI in the workplace. Specifically, it grows out of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/why-you-should-start-ab-testing-your-dei-initiatives&quot;>;field experiment&lt;/a>; we conducted with a global management, engineering, and development consultancy that wanted to know if we could help it increase equity in its promotions process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this company, promotions are made by a group of high-level senior managers in a bi-annual promotions process, during which managers can nominate their employees for promotion. Managers justify their nominations in a statement of 50 words or less in an online form. In our experiment, 116 of these senior managers were randomly assigned to receive one of two messages in advance of submitting their nominations. The control group was asked to consider promoting people who had displayed excellent performance and competence beyond their current grade. The treatment group was asked to consider the same criteria — but also to consider the diversity of their nominees as a whole, and whether their choices would help to close representation gaps. In other words, we made DEI more salient for this group of managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened when we did this? Although the sample for this experiment was small (which means some caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings), we found that making diversity salient increased the number of employees promoted from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. The effects seem to be driven by male senior managers, who at baseline may have been less likely to think spontaneously about diversity. We did not find any statistically significant positive or negative treatment effects on the promotion rates of female employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Ask managers to view a short diversity training video right before formal people decisions. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This suggestion uses salience to help organizations dramatically rethink how they implement diversity training. Prior research suggests that training is &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/does-diversity-training-work-the-way-its-supposed-to&quot;>;largely ineffective at actually changing behavior&lt;/a>;. However, we think this may be because it doesn&#39;t make DEI salient in the moment of consequential decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In most organizations, people are given diversity training when they get onboarded, or perhaps on an annual basis. That&#39;s often months or years before they actually make consequential hiring, promotion, or performance-evaluation decisions for the company, which means they&#39;re extremely unlikely to have the messages of the training in mind when they make those decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine instead if an organization had managers take a short training immediately prior to making a consequential HR decision. Because the training happens just before the decision, it has a much higher likelihood of ensuring that DEI remains salient and encourage managers to make more equitable choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have evidence of exactly this finding from a field experiment that we at the Inclusion Lab have been conducting with Ericsson, a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Sweden. We delivered an automated 5-minute DEI training to some managers before they screened resumes and found that the managers who got this training were significantly more likely to hire people from underrepresented groups at Ericsson.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experiment suggests that the significant amount of time and cost we invest into DEI training can indeed pay off — but only when organizations choose the right moment for it. One-off “blanket” training may well not be the way forward. Instead, organizations may want to consider how to use repeated smaller training modules in advance of key decision points to make DEI salient and therefore effective. We see this as fertile ground for further experimentation in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most people really do want to do the right thing when it comes to DEI, but they often just need a nudge or prompt to keep DEI top of mind at the right time. Our research strongly suggests that managers and organizations can do this by making DEI more salient at moments of consequential decision-making.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are Collaboration Tools Overwhelming Your Team?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/are-collaboration-tools-overwhelming-your-team]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1494319608-2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;master1305/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Today&amp;#8217;s workers feel numbed by a fragmented, unpredictable, and overwhelming collection of collaboration tools &amp;#8212; the very things advertised to boost their productivity.

They know they&#39;re overloaded and feel exhausted but believe there is little or nothing they can do to slow the onslaught of communication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We explored how collaboration technology bloat impacts employees and tried to help people take control over their work. We called our intervention the “collaboration cleanse.” Here we&#39;ll explore our findings (spoiler: there&#39;s good news and bad) and outline what leaders should do to simplify employees&#39; collaboration tool use.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Collaboration Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This “cleanse” was implemented by Asana&#39;s Work Innovation Lab, in concert with Amazon Web Services. We randomly assigned each of our 58 volunteers, which included both Asana and Amazon employees, into one of two groups. We asked all participants to report the collaboration technologies they use at least once a week for interacting with colleagues (for example, Slack, Figma, and Zoom). We also asked them to evaluate how well each tool helps them achieve their current work goals, as well as how much effort it takes to use each one. Finally, we asked them to choose specific technologies to refrain from using for two weeks. We asked people in the first group to stop using half of their collaboration tools for the two weeks. People in the second group could choose which and how many collaboration tools they eliminated. All participants told us which technologies they planned to set aside and kept daily diaries, recording any occasions when they strayed from their “approved” list.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This cleanse was inspired by research on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/the-friction-project/&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>;, including our prior interventions at the Work Innovation Lab that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/meeting-overload-is-a-fixable-problem&quot;>;helped people eliminate and redesign bad meetings&lt;/a>;. This research shows that people are prone to solving problems by heaping &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; complexity and burdens on themselves and others — even when subtraction is a more effective strategy. But prompting them to slow down and think about what they can and should remove from their work helps them overcome the instinct to add instead of &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/when-subtraction-adds-value&quot;>;subtract&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Good News: Participants Became More Aware of Their Digital Burdens&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As they embarked on this cleanse, participants in both groups became more aware of the digital clutter pervading their lives — clutter that they didn&#39;t think about much or at all and hadn&#39;t ever tried to reduce or remove. Forty-one percent reported (without prompting) that they became more mindful of the impact of using too many collaboration tools on their focus and productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research scientist put it to us this way: “[The cleanse] made me much more aware of the different tools I was using and the impact that was having on my productivity and sense of focus. There is a subtle cost with switching tools, and that additional friction hurts my focus and productivity.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to reflecting more deeply on how they used their tools, participants also made small strides toward using fewer collaboration tools overall. More than half (53%) of participants told us they would use at least one tool less frequently as a result of their cleanse. They expected this conscious culling of their tech stack to free up their time and cognitive bandwidth for more focused work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A customer insights analyst told us the cleanse taught her to be more deliberate about when she uses some particularly distracting collaboration technologies (eg, messaging platforms) to cut down on interruptions. One change she made was to plan intervals where she would use collaboration technologies intensely for 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes after lunch, and 10 minutes at the end of the day, and otherwise wouldn&#39;t use them at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Bad News: Participants Felt More Helpless and Exhausted After the Cleanse&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The intervention also appeared to have some negative consequences that surprised us. After we prompted participants to become more mindful of their tool use, they reported that their feelings of helplessness increased. When they paused to identify digital tools to subtract, many realized doing so would be a time-consuming ordeal, or downright impossible. That&#39;s because so many other people inside and outside their teams expected (or required) them to use particular collaboration tools, so the decision to get rid of these shared tools wasn&#39;t theirs alone (or at all). The awareness triggered by the collaboration cleanse made them want to fight back and overhaul their tools. But many felt stymied by inescapable rules, traditions, and power dynamics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One project risk manager, for example, said she would try to minimize the use of collaboration tools but didn&#39;t think she would succeed. With different teams using different tools because of their own preferences or company requirements, she and her colleagues were often confused about which messaging tool they should use to communicate with people in different business units.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in both groups reported a sense of helplessness and the resulting exhaustion, yet it appeared to be more severe in the first group, where we asked participants to abstain from using half of their tools for two weeks — a task that proved to be not just formidable, but often impossible. Many participants realized they were helpless to cut their tool use like they wanted to, which frustrated and exhausted them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants in the second group, who were given the flexibility to trim their list of collaboration tools as much as they deemed necessary, also reported feelings of futility and digital exhaustion, though they seemed less vehement in their distress. The task of subtracting tools, we found, is complex and daunting, and becoming mindful about the struggle to achieve it can inadvertently exacerbate feelings of helplessness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This aligns with the findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMPROC.2023.11120abstract&quot;>;related study&lt;/a>; where we interviewed 63 knowledge workers from a variety of industries. We found that feelings of digital exhaustion depended on whether or not employees felt like they had autonomy to decide which tools they would use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our takeaway? When people realize they can&#39;t do much or anything to reduce the number of collaboration tools they use (or when and how often they use them), they&#39;re left feeling even more helpless and exhausted. As one software engineer put it, “This is something that&#39;s really hard to change on an individual level.” He went on to explain that, if he decided not to use a tool that other colleagues used, it would be harder for him and his collaborators to do their jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Change Needs to Come from the Top&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many studies show that effective and long-lasting change in organizations bubbles up from the bottom and that strong dictums from management &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;can create impediments for employees&lt;/a>;. We&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250284426/thefrictionproject&quot;>;cited&lt;/a>; much of that research &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/the-digital-mindset-what-it-really-takes-to-thrive-in-the-age-of-data-algorithms-and-ai/10413&quot;>;in our own work&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/youre-going-digital-now-what/&quot;>;even produced a fair amount of it&lt;/a>;, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when it comes to technology overload and digital exhaustion, the best and sometimes only way to reduce the problem is with strong, persistent, and even downright inflexible top-down intervention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results of our collaboration cleanse show that the interactive and interdependent nature of collaboration technologies makes it near impossible for individual employees to meaningfully reduce their tool use in the workplace on their own. And as participants in our study made clear, attempting and failing to change how and when they use their digital tools may be worse than never trying at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees at lower levels often have the best information about which tools to keep and which to eliminate. But those at the top of the pecking order are in the best position to use their authority to make change throughout the organization and help employees stay afloat amid the digital deluge. Here&#39;s how leaders can help employees get a better handle on their collaboration tools:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Provide purposeful constraints.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Set clear guidelines for when employees should use specific technologies. This will help prevent them from spending time and energy second-guessing what type of work to do with which technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Establish non-negotiables. For example, leaders in one organization we worked with specified that Slack should be used for communication that&#39;s time sensitive and requires a quick response — and not for less-pressing matters. Leaders in other organizations have banned email completely, or made the decision to use only one project management tool. They key here is to be specific and exacting: Don&#39;t let too many tools clutter people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Tackle the root cause and ripple effects.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As a leader, it&#39;s crucial to confront both the visible symptoms and underlying causes of tech overload. Initiate a top-down pruning of your organization&#39;s tool stack, eliminating redundant and inefficient technologies. One data scientist who participated in the cleanse described how his company&#39;s leaders cancelled employee licenses for a redundant file-sharing platform, which helped him and others stick to a single platform when working on documents, rather than being forced to keep switching between different platforms that each required different steps and commands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also your responsibility to help your team mitigate the ripple effects of tool overload. Encourage employees to use features like “do not disturb” and turn off unnecessary notifications to regain some control over their attention. But if you don&#39;t model this behavior, it&#39;s unlikely your employees will do it either.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Fix friction head-on.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Encourage, enable, and even require employees to regularly evaluate their tech habits. Our cleanse suggests this conscious reflection can make your employees more aware of the toll of tech overload. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250249869/subtract&quot;>;subtraction mindset&lt;/a>; can be a powerful catalyst for change, prompting employees to pause and critically evaluate the impacts of their technologies on their productivity and well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet our intervention also revealed that this increased awareness can lead to heightened feelings of digital exhaustion if employees feel powerless to make changes. As a leader, your job is not only to promote this conscious reflection but also to provide support and resources so employees can change their tech use. This could involve facilitating discussions about tech habits within teams, providing training on how to use collaboration tools more effectively, or using your authority to revamp the organization&#39;s tech stack based on employee feedback. Be prepared to follow through and hold yourself accountable to ensure that increased awareness of tool overload leads to positive change rather than increased despair.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Beware the credit card approach.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s become common for managers to buy subscriptions to digital platforms for their teams — without alerting the IT department — by simply charging the small monthly fee to their company credit cards. Many tech companies design their pricing strategies so managers can make these purchases without going through a lengthy corporate approval process. Although many managers adopt this approach because they think it helps their teams adopt the best technologies quickly, the lack of friction contributes to bloat in each member&#39;s own tech stack and can lead to more feelings of digital exhaustion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers need to be more conscious about how many tools they introduce to their employees and of how difficult it is for them to stop using tools once they start. In one midsize company we worked with, the CTO instructed the accounting team to flag all purchases made to software vendors on the corporate card. Each subscription that was not authorized by IT was cancelled. If the manager wanted to reinstate it, they had to make a formal request to the CTO in writing. Sure, this was a tough top-down approach. But after a year of asking managers not to overwhelm their teams with tools, the CTO finally forced people to tackle the problem rather than just make hollow promises. Six months after the big cancellation, the company was using nearly 30 fewer tools.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Collaboration technology overload can drown employees in choices, leaving them feeling helpless. The irony is that by constraining those choices, adding frustrating obstacles to adopting yet another collaboration technology, and taking control away from individuals, employees can feel more in control of their work.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Prepare for a GenAI Future You Can&rsquo;t Predict]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-to-prepare-for-a-genai-future-you-cant-predict]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_31_1500235907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Given the staggering pace of generative AI development, it&amp;#8217;s no wonder that so many executives are tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations.

We initially worked through scenarios to improve fraud detection and customer service, but with the ongoing spate of recent announcements, it was clear he had grander ambitions in mind. Like many industries, banking has a workforce problem: There is a discrepancy between the demand for skilled personnel and the supply of workers who are willing to return to an office and play by pre-Covid rules.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI, he thought, might be a silver bullet of sorts. It could create cost savings and efficiencies through automation, but might these new tools also solve the talent shortage issue? To put it plainly: How soon could AI replace human workers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our conversation echoed many I&#39;ve had since last November with executives across an array of businesses, including insurance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and even executives leading Hollywood studios, whose writers and actors are currently on strike. They all want to know how their companies can create more value using fewer human resources. That&#39;s because last fall, ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by OpenAI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt&quot;>;suddenly went viral&lt;/a>;, demonstrating the power of AI to generate its own emails, essays, recipes, financial reports, articles, and ideas. Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html&quot;>;estimates&lt;/a>; that within the decade, 300 million jobs will either be eliminated or largely diminished by generative AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re already starting to see turbulence. Job postings for “prompt engineers” — humans who ask systems like ChatGPT to generate content — are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3&quot;>;offering annual salaries of $300,000 or more&lt;/a>;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389233&quot;>;OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 passed the Uniform Bar Exam&lt;/a>; and hinted that in the near future, we may not need lawyers for transactional work. Indeed, Walmart is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005148/en/Pactum%E2%80%99s-Autonomous-Negotiation-Technology-on-Display-at-the-National-Retail-Federation%E2%80%99s-2023-Retail-Big-Show&quot;>;prototyping&lt;/a>; a generative AI system (unrelated to OpenAI) to negotiate some of its vendor contracts; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2023/walmart-finds-75-percent-vendors-prefer-negotiating-with-chatbot/&quot;>;75% of contract lawyers and procurement officers&lt;/a>; on the other side say they now prefer negotiating with an AI over their flesh-and-blood counterparts. Google&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/sharing-google-med-palm-2-medical-large-language-model&quot;>;Med-PaLM 2&lt;/a>;, which is a specialized model trained on medical knowledge, now answers medical exam problems at the expert level of a doctor. This summer, partners will start testing applications that can look at an X-ray and automatically write a mammography report — without a human doctor in the loop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the staggering pace of development, it&#39;s no wonder that so many executives are coming to the same conclusion: Within just a few years, powerful AI systems will perform cognitive work at the same level (or even above) their human workforce. Tempted by the possibilities of AI, concerned about finding and retaining qualified workers, and humbled by recent market corrections or missed analyst expectations, business leaders envision a future of work without nearly as many people as today. From my perspective, this is a huge miscalculation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it&#39;s too early to predict the exact future of AI — especially given that generative AI is just one tiny area of a field with many interdependencies, each in various stages of development. Exactly which jobs AI will eliminate, and when, is guesswork. It isn&#39;t enough for an AI system to perform a task; the output has to be proven trustworthy, integrated into existing workstreams, and managed for compliance, risk, and regulatory issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, in a period of rapid disruption brought by technology, leaders are focused too narrowly on immediate gains, rather than how their value network will transform in the future. As AI evolves, it will require entire segments of business to be reimagined — in real time, but before we have a full sense of what the future will look like. Remember the earliest days of the public internet and web browsers, which were viewed as entertainment? No one planned for the fundamental transformation both would ignite. It would have been impossible then to foretell how it would someday influence presidential elections or create the world&#39;s first trillion-dollar companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be sure, executives today must make decisions in the most complex operating environment I&#39;ve seen since those early internet days. Leaders, understandably concerned about missing out on the next wave of technology, are unwittingly making risky bets on their companies&#39; futures. Here are steps every leader should take to prepare for an uncertain world where generative AI and human workforces coexist but will evolve in ways that are unknowable.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Preparing for a Future You Can&#39;t Predict&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the paradox: We need to think of the workforce as evolving with — rather than being supplanted by — generative AI. The workforce will need to evolve, and workers will have to learn new skills, iteratively and over a period of years. Leaders must adopt a new approach to maximize the potential of AI in their organizations, which requires tracking key developments in AI differently, using an iterative process to cultivate a ready workforce, and most importantly, creating evidence-backed future scenarios that challenge conventional thinking within the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What can leaders do now to navigate this period?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;First, temper expectations about what generative AI can and will do for your business.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Historically, AI cycles through phases that involve breakthroughs, surges of funding and fleeting moments of mainstream interest, followed by missed expectations and funding clawbacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1970, Marvin Minsky, an influential computer scientist and one of the founding parents of AI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiws.net/the-history-of-ai/this-week-in-the-history-of-ai-at-aiws-net-marvin-minsky-was-quoted-in-life-magazine-in-from-three-to-eight-years-we-will-have-a-machine-with-the-general-intelligence-of-an-average-human-b/&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; Life magazine that artificial general intelligence — an AI with cognitive abilities indistinguishable from a person — was just three years away. Bear in mind that in the 1970s, the computing power required for such an AI didn&#39;t yet exist. Supercomputers were mostly theoretical. So were personal computers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://r5.ieee.org/houston/ieee-stepping-stone-award-datapoint-2200-the-first-personal-computer/&quot;>;Datapoint 2200&lt;/a>; and its processor eventually became the foundational architecture for what we came to know as PCs. The grand ambitions promised by Minsky and his colleagues never materialized, so funding and interest dried up. This happened again in 1987, when again, computer scientists and businesses made bold promises on a timeline for AI that was just never feasible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While powerful, today&#39;s mainstream generative AI tools — ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL-E 2 — aren&#39;t finished products. Sometime soon, people will sour on their novelty and realize that while AI can create content, it&#39;s not good enough to actually use. Likewise, it&#39;s still very early days when it comes to domain-specific AI tools for medicine, climate, and life sciences. For generative AI to perform the miracles we&#39;ve been promised — at scale, and cost effectively — a lot more work needs to be done. Remember, these tools were mostly theoretical until very recently.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Executives need to get clear on the practical functions generative AI will perform in their organizations today. They should also be pragmatic about the opportunities — and risks — generative AI will eventually unlock. AI is not a monolith, and we are just at the beginning of a very long trajectory. This may sound intuitive, but in my observation, few leaders are developing a realistic strategy that links today&#39;s operations to tomorrow&#39;s vision, socializing it within their management teams, and revising their performance indicators accordingly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I met with the executive leadership of a multinational consumer packaged goods (CPG) company eager to partner with a generative AI company. I walked them through a high-probability scenario in which customers using a chat tool answered a few questions about their preferences and goals, and had an online shopping cart automatically filled with the items they would need for the week. But none of the CPG&#39;s brands showed up in the cart — or if they did, they weren&#39;t first on the list. Just as search engines like Google and Amazon invented new mechanisms and rules for search engine optimization, in the future, generative AI integrations across platforms like retailers and shopping cart apps would create new challenges for CPG companies, which might find themselves further down the value chain where critical decisions are made.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Second, evaluate what data your company is generating and how it would today, and in the future, be used by generative AI.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Business data is invaluable because once a model has been trained, it can be costly and technically cumbersome to port those data over to another system. At the moment emerging AI platforms are not easily interoperable, and that&#39;s by design. Generative AI platforms are evolving into walled gardens, where the companies creating the technology control all sides of their ecosystems. The biggest AI companies are competing for market share — and for the enormous amounts of data they need to make their models most competitive. By marketing their platforms to companies, they want to lock them (and their data) in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s AI systems are being created using a technique known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf&quot;>;&lt;em>;reinforcement learning with human feedback&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, or RHLF. Essentially, AI systems need constant human feedback, or they run the risk of learning and remembering the wrong information. The more data that&#39;s ingested, the more annotating, labeling, and training that&#39;s required. Today, this work is automated to gig workers in emerging economies like Kenya and Pakistan. As AI matures, specialists with expert-level knowledge will be needed. Many of the business leaders I&#39;ve met with aren&#39;t planning for a future that includes an internal RHLF unit tasked with continuously monitoring, auditing, and tweaking AI systems and tools. (The last thing any leader should want is an unsupervised AI system making decisions about how to improve itself.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even with trained humans in the loop, businesses must continuously craft scenarios that surface risks of working alongside generative AI systems, especially those operated by third parties. That&#39;s because AI systems aren&#39;t static; they are improving incrementally over time. With each new development, new potential risks and opportunities arise. It would be impossible to game out all of the potential negative outcomes in advance without those predictions quickly becoming outdated. (For now, there is no way to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Monte-Carlo-simulation&quot;>;Monte Carlo simulation&lt;/a>; that would be fully accurate in predicting the future.) Instead, a dedicated team should be charged with monitoring generative AI systems as they are learning, as well as related cybersecurity challenges, and they should develop short “what if” scenarios imagining ways in which things could go wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Likewise, as AI evolves, so too will opportunities to unlock new growth. Which means that businesses should also have a dedicated, internal business development team to develop near- and long-term scenarios for the myriad ways in which emerging tools will improve productivity and efficiency, lead to product development, spur innovation, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Third, when it comes to AI, leaders must shift their focus from the bottom line to top line.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This will seem counterintuitive, as many view generative AI as a means to reduce operational costs. Today&#39;s smart chatbots will soon give way to multimodal systems, which are AIs capable of solving different problems and accomplishing different goals at once. Imagine a property and casualty insurance company where every underwriter is teamed up with an AI. Initially, the underwriter might ask the AI to assess the risk associated with insuring a property; after a preliminary analysis of the text, she might ask it to refine results using the images from inspection reports or audio interviews with the prospective policyholder. She might go back and forth a few times, using different data sources, until an optimal quote is received for both the insurance company and the customer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to making productive use of multimodal AIs is understanding how and what to delegate to a machine, so that both the human and the AI can accomplish more through collaboration than by working independently. However delegation is something professionals routinely struggle with: They either assign too much, or not enough, or not the right tasks. Working alongside a multimodal AI will require workers to master the art of delegation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once a workforce understands how to delegate correctly, it will act as a force multiplier within organizations. Individual teams could be more ambitious in growing the company&#39;s top line through ideating and simulating new revenue streams, finding and acquiring new customers, and seeking out various improvements to the company&#39;s overall operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This portends a future that demands a different approach to upskilling. Most workers won&#39;t need to learn how to code, or how to write basic prompts, as we often hear at conferences. Rather, they&#39;ll need to learn how to leverage multimodal AI to do more, and better, work. Just look at Excel, which is &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/10-excel-functions-everyone-should-know&quot;>;used&lt;/a>; by 750 million knowledge workers every day. The software includes more than 500 functions — but the vast majority of people only use a few dozen, because they don&#39;t fully understand how to match the enormous number of features Excel offers to their daily cognitive tasks. Now, imagine a future in which AI — a far more complicated, more convoluted software — is ubiquitous. How much utility will be left on the table simply because business leaders approached upskilling too narrowly?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Framework for Navigating the Evolving AI Workforce&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Workforce change is an inevitable side effect of technological evolution, and leaders need a systemized way of seeing what the future of their organizations will look like in the wake of generative AI&#39;s developments. To that end, this simple framework will help leaders in any organization anticipate how — and when — their workforce will need to change in order to leverage AI. The goal isn&#39;t to make long-range predictions, or even to be ready for everything — it&#39;s to position organizations to be ready for anything as AI continues to improve.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363183&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_WEBB_IDEA_FRAMEWORK_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;The IDEA Framework.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;620&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This framework should be used to develop scenarios for the future of a business. It is designed to help you see risk and opportunity early enough for action. Used regularly, this framework enables leaders to see the landscape more clearly, evaluate gaps within their organizations, and link emerging technology to existing strategy, positioning them to make decisions with confidence. Importantly, it asks leaders to think exponentially about AI, but to act incrementally in response to new developments. While it won&#39;t predict a singular future for your company —&amp;nbsp;no scenario can do that — it will prepare leaders to make decisions well ahead of their competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The single best thing organizations can do right now — during this period of what feels like a soul-crushing amount of change and uncertainty — is to methodically plan for the future. That requires knowing generative AI&#39;s limitations as well as its strengths and adopting a culture of continual evaluation and improvement. It also means getting past clever product demos to much more mundane, pragmatic conversations about the trajectory of development, how data are being used, and the practical ways in which companies can use emerging tools. Resist the temptation to reduce your workforce — and instead use strategic foresight to create a future where AI is leveraged by a highly skilled workforce, and where human–AI teams are more productive, creative, and efficient working together than apart.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Global Companies Can Create a Consistent Customer Experience]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_30_3850269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Yaroslav Danylchenko/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Building a global company is easier, but also more nuanced and complex, than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run. To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving a GLOBE mindset, one that&amp;#8217;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/how-global-companies-can-create-a-consistent-customer-experience?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;On the surface, international business expansion seems easier than ever. Today, any company can reach multiple markets in a matter of seconds: Publish a blog post, launch a mobile app, buy digital ads, and target customers in as many countries as you wish. The rise of online global marketplaces has made it even easier for companies to launch into multiple countries simultaneously, often from their earliest days. This has given rise to a wave of “global native” companies that have an international presence from day one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ian Harkin founded Lottie, a toy company based in Donegal, Ireland that manufactures Barbie doll alternatives with a child&#39;s dimensions instead of an adult&#39;s, he began with international markets in mind from the very start. “In the toy industry, with very high up-front development costs, it&#39;s difficult to justify the expense to launch in just one country,” he explains. Harkin, the company&#39;s CEO, integrated their storefront into Amazon, and immediately reached customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Sweden, and Poland. Nearly 100% of the company&#39;s revenue today comes from outside of Ireland. Harkin points out, “For us, going global early helped our product and brand reach more potential customers, much faster, than if we would have expanded one country at a time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This growing phenomenon of going global as early as possible in the life of a business isn&#39;t only happening with physical products that can launch via global platforms like Amazon or Etsy. Partners at Andreessen Horowitz have written about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2022/07/20/the-company-of-the-future-is-default-global/&quot;>;new wave of “default global” companies&lt;/a>;, which radically compress the timeframe it takes to go global. They contrast these with “default local” firms, which often take five years before operating in just a few foreign markets. The default global companies are often in double the number of markets as default local companies are by year three. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/newsroom/stories/global-natives&quot;>;research from Stripe&lt;/a>; shows that 89% of successful tech companies had expanded internationally prior to achieving “unicorn” status, a valuation of $1 billion or higher.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But building a global company is also more nuanced and complex than ever before. In the past, companies could limit expansion in a more controlled fashion to just one market at a time. In the digital age, global growth is far more continuous and incremental in nature. But with this new approach comes risk: If your customers in one market receive less value than those in another, they perceive your offering differently. This is not only unfair to them, but it can also hurt your business in the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, even if you&#39;re already having success as a global company, it&#39;s time to raise the bar. To sustain your success for the long term, you&#39;ll need to build not just a company that has customers or revenue streams from many different countries, but one that operates as a globally equitable organization (GEO for shorthand).&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Rise of the Globally Equitable Organization &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When I ran international expansion efforts for HubSpot, a large public tech company, over the space of nearly eight years, I noticed this pronounced shift toward continuous expansion happening before my eyes. But I also observed another important trend at play in the broader market. In the past, companies that sought to expand internationally measured their success strictly using qualitative measures, usually in the form of revenue or customer count from new markets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, with global becoming the new default, the goal is no longer as simple as just increasing revenue share from between different parts of the world. Instead, the new measure is more customer-oriented in nature. Companies have realized that it&#39;s not enough to initially acquire new customers in other geographies — retaining them is critical, as this ensures that revenue can be sustained. The best global companies ask themselves: How successful can our local customers be with our business in each market, without geography getting in the way?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Teamwork, a project management software company headquartered in Cork, Ireland. “You can sell software from anywhere in the world from the get-go. There are no boundaries,” explains Peter Coppinger, Teamwork CEO and co-founder. “One of the biggest lessons we learned with Teamwork&#39;s international expansion is that once you reach a certain scale, you need to get more deliberate about targeting the regions with the most potential.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the company deepened its presence in specific markets, Coppinger and team found that they needed to ramp up sales and customer talent in order to support customers in new time zones. “There is no substitute for having staff in the same time zone speaking the same language as your target customer,” he points out. When Teamwork recognized some customers were feeling this pain, they were proactive about creating a more equitable experience for all customers. Today, the company has 20,000 customers in 170 countries, and a global workforce of 350 employees in 15 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Make Local Customer Experiences Equitable, Not Identical &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the digital age, it&#39;s easy to go global without adapting the customer experience. But if companies fail to make sufficient adaptations, they miss the chance to build true connections of value with their customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Making local experiences equitable doesn&#39;t mean they have to be identical. In fact, where many companies go wrong is that they try to enforce a cookie-cutter approach onto all markets, in the name of “global leverage.” But in doing so, they miss out on the importance of local adaptations that ensure their customers across markets are equally happy with the value they&#39;re receiving, even if they define and derive that value in different ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a shining example, look no further than Starbucks. At the product level, customers can order many of the same standard menu items in every location globally. But to appeal to local tastes, a customer in Peru, where the Lúcuma fruit grows, can order a Lúcuma Crème Frappuccino from their local barista. Starbucks adapts not only their physical products, but their digital outreach to customers too.

While this is a natural inclination, it actually can have the opposite effect and require investments that are disproportional for each local market. Instead of doing “all things in all markets,” be selective and show a true willingness to adapt. Encourage your employees to flex their creative muscles when thinking about what strategy will work best for a new local market so that they can derive equal value, even if the approaches vary.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Ensure Your Organization Has a Globally Equitable Mindset&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To truly create an equitable experience for your customers, you will need to focus as early as possible on driving what I call a GLOBE mindset, one that&#39;s geography-agnostic, linguistically inclusive, operationalized, balanced, and empathetic. This will ensure that all of your employees — not just those with “international” in their titles — keep the global equity momentum going in perpetuity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re launching a new global initiative at your company, I recommend asking these five questions to ensure your approach is equitable:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Geography-agnostic:&lt;/strong>; Is this project designed around the needs of customers in one market, or is it inclusive of multiple geographies?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Linguistically inclusive:&lt;/strong>; Have we considered the language and literacy needs of customers in the local markets we serve?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Operationalized: &lt;/strong>;Have we accounted for local differences with our plans, so we can prevent friction for local teams when it&#39;s time to execute?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Balanced:&lt;/strong>; Are our resources, especially funding and headcount, aligned to support our priority markets?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Empathetic:&lt;/strong>; Have we talked with customers and/or leaders of our local markets to ensure we are truly taking their needs into consideration?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;If you get into the habit of putting these five simple principles at the center of your leadership team&#39;s mindset, you&#39;ll naturally be driving equitable experiences for your customers around the globe.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, international expansion is more ongoing in nature, with a constant pace of change. The more you focus on driving up value across all markets in an equitable way, the greater the financial success that will follow — but only as a consequence of taking a new approach, one that places value on delivering equitable experiences to your local customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 30 Aug 2023 23:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Customers Leave Platforms &mdash; and How to Retain Them]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/08/why-customers-leave-platforms-and-how-to-retain-them]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Aug23_30_663665217.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies often misunderstand the problem of users leaving their platforms. Disintermediation is a sign that your customers don&amp;#8217;t think you are adding as much value as you think you are. Firms struggling with disintermediation can take simple steps to stop the bleeding before it&amp;#8217;s too late &amp;#8212; if they understand what&amp;#8217;s really taking place. They should consider six factors: urgency, rake, risk, skill, frequency, and modularity. The solution for disintermediation is quite simple: Create more value than you take. Stop playing the role of toll-taking gatekeeper and start playing the role of value-adding partner.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/why-customers-leave-platforms-and-how-to-retain-them?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/why-customers-leave-platforms-and-how-to-retain-them?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Platform firms — businesses that enable transactions between two parties — constantly struggle to prevent those partners from taking their deals off-platform. The technical term for this is “disintermediation,” and examples of it include readers buying online rather than from bookstores, Upwork and ZBJ (China&#39;s Zhu Bajie) programmers contracting directly with clients, and Airbnb struggling not only with guests contracting directly with hosts, but also with some of its biggest professional hosts &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbnb-stock-falls-after-short-report-says-hosts-directly-compete-with-platform-173546532.html&quot;>;reportedly competing against it on new platforms&lt;/a>;. Disintermediation — and the failure to understand and address it — killed once thriving businesses like Borders books, Blockbuster movies, and Tower records. It&#39;s easy to understand why platform companies worry so much about being cut out of the loop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the thing, though: True disintermediation is rare. Most buyers and sellers don&#39;t cut out the middleman entirely, but rather find a new provider that cuts transaction costs or adds more value so that switching is a natural choice. Readers buy from Amazon, not authors directly. Movie watchers and song listeners don&#39;t buy from Hollywood studios or musicians but from Netflix and Spotify. Simply put, these are not atomic markets of many-to-many interactions. New centers of attraction (Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify) have re-intermediated the old ones (Borders, Blockbuster, and Tower).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The issue is that companies often misunderstand the problem: Disintermediation is a sign that your customers don&#39;t think you are adding as much value as you think you are. Just because you enabled the first transaction doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re entitled to take all the value from the second, the third, and subsequent transactions. The good news, however, is that firms that appear to be struggling with disintermediation can take simple steps to stop the bleeding before it&#39;s too late — if they understand what&#39;s really taking place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Predicting disintermediation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;How can a firm know when deals are sticky and when they will go somewhere else? At least six factors contribute to partners taking deals off your platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, &lt;em>;urgency&lt;/em>; reflects the need to solve a problem now, which helps keep the deal. A large platform that can address a need quickly is more valuable when urgency is high, in contrast to a single off-platform source that is high-quality but unavailable. For instance, the delivery app Drizzly provides on-demand alcohol for parties. A trip to the liquor store might cost less, but it requires advance planning or someone stepping out mid-party.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Rake&lt;/em>; is what a platform charges for facilitating a deal. The higher this fee, the more partners want to avoid it. Groupon&#39;s rake of nearly 50% &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/how-users-drive-value-in-twosided-markets(94885ed2-0e38-40e4-9388-35008ffcc834).html&quot;>;contributed to its plunge and plateau in stock value&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Risk&lt;/em>; is the danger that a deal goes badly. If a project is risky, then both buyers and suppliers prefer having the benefit of reputation systems, insurance, and mediation services the platform provides. Uber covers driver costs and holds riders accountable if riders throw up in the car.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Skill&lt;/em>; is the level of expertise required to perform the task. For low-skill jobs, the main issue is usually price, and a large pool of suppliers helps customers secure the best deal. That means platforms offer the best value for both the first and subsequent deals, as with E-Trade for example. But when a job requires high skill, platforms often only add value to the first deal, where the benefits of reputation systems truly matter. After that, buyers can cut out gatekeepers once they find a reliable supplier. For instance, Rocket Lawyer connects people with expert attorneys to help with legal issues. But once someone has found a reliable attorney, they no longer need the platform. And, they don&#39;t want to explain their situation all over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequent deals highlight related factors, &lt;em>;interaction frequency&lt;/em>;, or how often partners must communicate to complete the task, and &lt;em>;project modularity&lt;/em>;, or the degree to which a task can be divided into smaller, independent components. If a task requires repeated communication or it can be broken easily into separate parts, then buyers and sellers have multiple opportunities to &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4150094&quot;>;establish a relationship independent of the platform&lt;/a>;. On Upwork, for example, working through stages of website deployment — specification, design, coding, backend, test, etc. — gives parties a chance to reduce the rake on each stage. Then later stages can happen off-platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363193&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_VAN_ALSTYNE_DISINTERMEDIATION_FACTORS_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Broadly speaking, these six factors tell companies how to reduce the costs of &lt;em>;search&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;negotiation&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;risk&lt;/em>;, or &lt;em>;delivery&lt;/em>; associated with getting the deal to happen as distinct from producing the work itself. In economic terms, these are known as “transaction costs.” The platform&#39;s role is to lower them compared to the next best alternative. Understanding this principle gives executives control over the outcome even if the superficial attributes change. The platform helps orchestrate the deal, but the supplier actually produces the result, and if the buyer and supplier can handle the transaction costs more efficiently without the platform, then they will disintermediate the deal. Interestingly, the Chief Strategy Officer for Alibaba even defined a test for successful platforms as achieving “the nexus of lowest transaction costs.” Understanding disintermediation in this way then gives you the tools to prevent it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Preventing disintermediation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The solution for disintermediation is quite simple: Create more value than you take. Stop playing the role of toll-taking gatekeeper and start playing the role of value-adding partner. Either decrease transaction costs or increase value for buyers or suppliers, or both.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every platform interaction has a producer side and a consumer side. This is true regardless of whether the activity is a ride, a tweet, a stay, a product, a service, or a piece of art. The trick is to design appropriate carrots and sticks for both sides, with a heavy emphasis on carrots. Why are carrots better than sticks? Carrots &lt;em>;add value&lt;/em>; for keeping interactions on-platform, while sticks &lt;em>;add costs&lt;/em>; for taking interactions off-platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363192&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/W230728_VAN_ALSTYNE_DISINTERMEDIATION_CARROTS_STICKS_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Many platforms choose sticks because they are easier to implement or because they feel entitled to a certain level of profit. Sticks, however, do not engender goodwill among customers, service providers, freelancers, or developers. They include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Hiding supplier contact information to prevent direct communication. For years, Angies List (now Angi) hid home service provider contact information, which limited interactions and growth.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Bounties paid to buyers and suppliers who rat on the other side for proposing disintermediation.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Secret shoppers and secret sellers who make such proposals to test partner loyalty. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53948&quot;>;ZBJ&lt;/a>; used both bounties and secret shoppers when freelancers did not want to share large commissions with the platform.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Deplatforming, public shaming, and eventually legal action, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/business/apple-epic-games-appeal.html&quot;>;Apple tried&lt;/a>; when Fortnite tried to use its own system to facilitate payments rather than use Apple&#39;s system with its exorbitant 30% tax.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Carrots are far better because they show a commitment to creating value, which is the only real basis for capturing value. They include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Giving users software tools to enhance the production, delivery, quality, or consumption of the product or service. Instagram and Vimeo offer filters and image editing tools that not only reduce costs for producers but also help them create value for consumers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A variant of this strategy is to offer value-adding services. The freelance platform Upwork will provide project management for large contracts by partitioning it and farming out components to different subcontractors. 99Designs, a design contest platform, helps designers automate their billing, track their progress, and pay their taxes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Frequent buyer or frequent seller rewards. OpenTable gives buyers dining points that they can spend on restaurant meals, while CoachUp gives professional coaches volume discounts. Etsy rewards artists&#39; loyalty by showcasing their work.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Shifting monetization to the point where the platform adds the most value. ZBJ introduced an optional pricing model that shifts from a transaction fee to a subscription fee. Once the fee is paid for the first deal, suppliers&#39; costs for each new deal are zero. When further use of the platform is free, sellers prefer the benefits of automated tracking and billing that happens on-platform.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Insurance, which is one of the most successful benefits to both sellers and buyers. On the seller side, Airbnb insures hosts against fire, theft, and property damage. On the buyer side, Amazon offers free returns and money back guarantees.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Basic safety. Uber introduced a rider emergency help button that most taxis do not offer. When a freelance contract is based on an hourly rate, Upwork has provided monitoring software so that a client knows a programmer is coding and not perusing Facebook.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Introducing buyer and seller rating systems. Almost every major platform now uses some form of review to reduce the adverse selection of finding bad providers and the moral hazard that, having been paid, they might not deliver.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Ironically, these strategies do come with a challenge — a “disintermediation dilemma.” Strategies intended to add value can inadvertently lead to leakage. This occurs when tactics &lt;em>;do&lt;/em>; add value but only to the first interaction and not the second. Consider a five-star rating on a home cleaner or landscaper. Once contact is made and trust established, a platform that adds no further value will be disintermediated. This problem &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/why-some-platforms-thrive-and-others-dont&quot;>;doomed Homejoy&lt;/a>; within a few years of launch. Groupon, likewise, adds value to a first sale by providing group buying discounts for buyers and discovery for merchants. But then deals conclude off-platform at the merchant and its “leaky bucket” adds little value to later deals. Buyers just visit the merchants. By contrast, Meituan, a Chinese successor to Groupon, handles delivery through the platform, generates frequent buyer rewards, and helps merchants design new products and situate new stores. Increased volume increases benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disintermediation is a signal. What it really tells you is that you don&#39;t provide enough value after an initial match. You&#39;re taking more than your fair share. Disintermediation simply means someone else provides more value than you do. Instead, if you create more value than you take, you will attract deals rather than repel them.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 30 Aug 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
