&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;您如何管理业绩不佳且只提供借口的员工？生气并不是正确的解决办法。微观管理只会增加你的工作量，并告诉他们你将承担责任，所以他们不必这样做。那么，当您不信任某人交付成果时，您有什么选择？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一种选择是从信任该人转向信任流程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让我们考虑一下为什么员工可能会失败。这将为我们提供线索，让我们知道在哪些方面可以通过更健全的流程来消除借口。首先，他们可能不知道你对他们的期望是什么，或者做好工作需要什么。这就是一个对齐问题。其次，他们可能缺乏完成任务的知识或技能——能力问题。最后，他们可能缺乏越过界限（或走出大门）的动力。为了取得成功，员工需要了解要做什么、知道如何做并且愿意这样做。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果员工屡次失败，则说明他们缺少一个或多个基本支柱。你的工作是创建一个流程，作为绩效脚手架，以加强他们的一致性、能力和动力。从您分配任务的那一刻到他们交付任务的那一刻，此过程应该为该人员提供支持。它还应该否定他们的标准借口。但是，当然，您在该脚手架中到底需要哪些木板取决于该人的具体缺点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;明确目标&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;员工这样做的原因之一让你失望的是他们不知道出现会是什么样子。管理者常常以速度的名义缩短前期的协调对话。但这种仓促可能会让你付出代价，尤其是对于一个不可靠的员工。预先对一致性的投资可以实现良好的绩效，并且还提供了解决绩效不佳（如果绩效持续不佳）的框架。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先关注工作的目的。确立目标后，就不会为不同的观点、动机或最终目标留下任何借口。如果这个人没有战略眼光，看不到大局，或者他们自私自利，倾向于将自己的成功置于团队的成功之上，那么从目标开始也是有帮助的。你需要清楚地说明你想要实现的目标。这是给谁的？受益人如何定义成功？这项工作与其他举措或承诺有何契合点？回答这些问题可以减少对方声称他们不知道你想要什么的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦你对工作的目的达成一致，你就可以描绘出什么是好的、坏的、和不可接受的结果看起来像。但不幸的是，这是管理者经常跳过的另一个步骤。我将其称为情人节效应；无法清楚地表达出你想要什么，并且当对方没有做到时感到失望。对于你已经心存疑虑的员工来说，未能明确你的期望几乎肯定会让你失望。为了给他们的工作提供一个标准，描述最低标准。你认为什么是本垒打？哪些结果会令人担忧或您认为是失败？回答这些问题可以消除此人将劣质工作假装为“足够好”的可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当你明确目标时，你就消除了一致性借口。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;调整最佳方法&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;员工可能为绩效不佳找借口的第二个主要原因是他们没有技能或知识来完成您要求的工作。如果你的恐惧与这个人的能力差距有关，那么你的过程必须超越他们需要实现的目标，并探索他们如何实现它。根据您的具体问题，有几种方法可以解决这个问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当您怀疑此人可能走捷径或忽略重要组成部分时，请详细了解所需步骤。分享有效的方法并提供以前项目的先例。但不要犯这样的错误：所有的事情都在说。他们的点头不能被理解为理解。相反，请他们分享他们的计划，了解他们如何处理请求。然后，您可以提供任何必要的课程修正，并提出引起他们注意的问题，例如“您将采取哪些措施来确保财务到位？”回答这些问题将消除他们不知道如何处理该项目的借口。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一种可能性是，您担心的不是他们的技术，而是他们的人际交往能力。如果您担心他们会破坏利益相关者的关系，请将人际关系问题与技术问题一样突出。共同努力绘制关键利益相关者、他们在项目中的利益以及您可能知道的任何特质。谁对这个决定有影响力？他们在找什么？是什么影响了他们？除了决策者和影响者之外，鼓励人们考虑其他人，并提出他们需要纳入的有价值的观点。回答这些问题，以避免以支持不足或脾气暴躁的合作伙伴为借口。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您还可以通过考虑他们可能必须做出的决策并预先确定决策标准来缩小能力差距。这样，您就可以更有信心他们会做出您认可的决定。您可以通过多种方式提出该主题，包括询问该人用于评估任何决定或权衡的标准。当没有完美的选择时，他们将如何确定标准的优先顺序？为了避免他们在试图拥有一切的过程中陷入困境，澄清哪些标准应该影响他们如何实施决策而不是影响他们做出的决定是有帮助的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当你同意这个过程时，你就剥夺了许多标准能力借口。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;提高风险&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们已经讨论了一致性和能力问题。他们失败的第三种可能是他们缺乏完成工作的动力。如果你的信心丧失与他们缺乏活力有关，请强调他们的义务，并明确如果他们未能兑现承诺，将会面临什么风险。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你需要增加一点激励，你可以采取胡萝卜加大棒的选择。悬挂胡萝卜会将工作的成功交付与各种积极成果联系起来，例如它将如何影响他们的声誉或未来的机会。另一方面，挥舞大棒意味着如果没有兑现，就会带来负面影响。如果可能的话，通过谈论这个人喜欢这种工作以及他们做好这项工作会得到什么奖励，为这些外在后果添加一些内在奖励。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一个需要准备的动机问题为了;刚开始时充满活力，但一遇到逆境就举手投降的人。在这种情况下，你的流程应该通过提前准备 B 计划来让人们免受挫折。花一些时间预测可能出现的问题并制定行动计划。您预计会出现哪些问题？他们如何处理这些类型的问题？请务必明确说明哪些情况需要该人向您上报，以及您希望他们独立解决哪些情况。解决突发事件和潜在的陷阱将表明您希望此人能够坚持下去。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当您阐明后果时，您就增强了动力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您正在管理一个人他们总是让你失望，并为这不是他们的错找借口，不要浪费你的精力希望他们会奇迹般地变得值得信赖。相反，要制定一个流程，为他们的成功做好准备，并消除流程中的借口。然后，如果员工未能交付成果并求助于“但是，但是，但是……”，那么您就获得了绩效管理对话所需的所有素材。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/p>;分区>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;五角大楼的采购程序长期以来一直使商业软件公司变得复杂。进入国防市场很困难，但作者的观点是：与科技初创公司和国防工业的合作经验使他们相信现在是公司进入市场的好时机。他们建议首先利用商业上的成功来促成小型的一次性国防合同，与现有的国防渠道合作，并建立一支专门的销售团队。这些策略将为公司带来更快的经常性收入和风险投资。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how -software-companies-can-enter-the-us-defense-market?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-software-companies-can- Enter-the-us-defense-market?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;当美国软件公司考虑其主要市场时，许多公司很大程度上避开了国防部门。无论是成熟的科技公司还是处于早期阶段的初创公司，都是如此。原因很明显：五角大楼&lt;a href=&quot;https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10599.pdf&quot;>;采购&lt;/a>;历来主要只关注实物物资的采购和设备，产生不适合软件许可的流程。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/us/politics/start-ups-weapons-pentagon-procurement.html&quot;>;官僚主义挑战&lt;/a>;也会让公司感到沮丧，因为它们领导销售周期长。许多科技员工以文化和道德为由，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html&quot;>;拒绝参与国防项目担忧&lt;/a>;。面对这些挑战，对于在国防市场运营或希望扩展到国防市场的公司来说，很难通过风险投资和其他来源获得资金。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，总有例外，例如亚马逊、微软、和谷歌云服务——或者早期的新兴技术初创公司，比如拥有 50 名员工的初创公司 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pendulum.global/&quot;>;Pendulum&lt;/a>;——不久之后就扩展到了国防市场寻找商业产品与市场的契合度。这些例外证明美国软件公司能够在国防市场取得成功。此外，多种因素使得这些公司更容易获得国防部 8000 亿美元的预算。 （我们在本文中重点关注美国，因为很难将其与其他国家截然不同的初创企业文化和国防市场进行比较。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们与初创企业和国防工业的合作经验使我们相信：现在是扩张软件公司的创始人考虑国防市场的时候了。在本文中，我们将解释原因，并制定向政府出售产品并同时吸引资金的计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;为什么是现在？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;三这些因素使得国防市场成为当今美国软件初创公司更具吸引力的垂直领域。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，五角大楼是一个积极主动的客户，并且已经采取了一些举措来吸引软件供应商。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2567486/artificial-intelligence-key-to-maintaining-military-economic-advantages-leaders/&quot;>;确定&lt;/ a>; 到 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/china-acquiring-new-weapons- Five-times-faster-than-us-warns-top-official&quot;>;保留与中国&lt;u>;的步伐&lt;/a>;，&lt;/u>;它已经提高了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1771387/faster-smarter-speed-is -key-in-acquisition-reform/&quot;>;通过修改一些现有的收购流程来采购和整合新兴技术的速度&lt;/a>;。国防部还建立了商业友好型组织（例如国防创新部门和 AFWERX）和特定于软件的采购流程（例如 &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.cyber.mil/connect/faq-connection -approval/&quot;>;操作权限&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://software.af.mil/team/platformone/&quot;>;平台一&lt;/a>;）。它创建了云软件认证，例如 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedramp.gov/&quot;>;FedRAMP&lt;/a>; 并与 AWS 合作提供&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com /govcloud-us/&quot;>;GovCloud&lt;/a>; 使软件供应商能够更轻松地满足安全要求，从而将其产品提供给政府雇员。这些变化使得向政府传播商业软件成为可能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，在商业市场面临诸多阻力的情况下，国防市场保持稳定。大范围的裁员和硅谷银行的倒闭扰乱了商业市场。对于软件公司来说，市场&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/22/why-a-downturn-can-separate-the-recession-proof-startups-from-the-hacks/&quot; >;经济低迷&lt;/a>;导致销售支出回报&lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastruct/report-in-face-of-recession-67-of-businesses-skip-customer- acquire-turn-to-customer-retention/&quot;>;drop&lt;/a>;，客户&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/surviving-the-saas-tsunami-optimize-renewal -processes-to-reduce-risk-and-free-up-cash-flow/&quot;>;大幅削减&lt;/a>; IT 预算，以及大型企业销售&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog /2022-saas-crash&quot;>;需要更长的时间&lt;/a>;才能关闭。相比之下，国防部是一个稳定的客户。五角大楼保持着稳定且庞大的预算，其软件解决方案的转换成本很高。一旦公司签订了经常性收入合同，年度收入分配就非常可观且风险较低。这使得五角大楼具有类似于最大、最具吸引力的企业级商业客户的品质，同时也使其成为更稳定的客户。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三，私人资本投资者越来越多地支持国防市场的公司。航空航天和国防技术领域的风险投资交易价值在 2021 年和2022 年的产量将超过 2010 年至 2019 年全年的总和。我们认为，这种上升趋势是由于投资者渴望参与一个关键的、但数字化未受干扰的行业。这似乎正在发挥作用：网络安全和人工智能等领域的国防合同使投资者能够获得投资回报。来自联邦政府合同的经常性收入&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense-c3ai&quot;>;显示&lt;/a>;企业&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense-c3ai&quot;>;公司&lt;/a>;成熟度和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense -c3ai&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/enterprise-ai-military-defense-c3ai&quot;>;解决复杂需求的能力&lt;/a>;。例如，对于人工智能数据标签初创公司 Scale AI 来说，扩展到国防领域意味着定义轨迹&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedscoop.com/scale-ai-awarded-250m-ai-contract-by-department- of-defense/&quot;>;E 轮融资一年后签订价值 2.5 亿美元的合同&lt;/a>;。像 &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2022/01/14/building-american-dynamism- 这样的顶级公司2/&quot;>;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://Foundersfund.com/&quot;>;Founders Fund&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles /josh-wolfes-war-the-lux-capital-Founder-blazes-a-controversial-path-in-defense-tech&quot;>;Lux Capital&lt;/a>; 和专注于国防的公司，例如 &lt;a href=&quot;https:// /americasfrontier.org/&quot;>;America&#39;s Frontier Fund&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://shieldcap.com/&quot;>;Shield Capital&lt;/a>; 都在该领域进行投资。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 >;&lt;strong>;如何应对国防市场&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;尽管具有吸引力，但仍有数千家初创公司&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndia.org/policy/publications/vital-signs &quot;>;离开&lt;/a>;国防市场。公司在国防市场失败是因为他们错误地将来自五角大楼的非经常性收入视为成功，然后&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dau.edu/library/defense-atl/blog/Valley-of-Death&quot;>;陷入“死亡之谷”，在构建出值得定期软件订阅的可扩展产品之前就崩溃了。 （虽然大多数软件公司的目标是通过经常性收入模式来获得稳定性和规模，但这对于国防市场的公司来说更为重要，因为新合同带来了更高的前期研发和客户获取成本。）另一方面，公司也因为只专注于通过大额销售产生年度经常性收入而失败，例如&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dau.edu/glossary/Pages/GlossaryContent.aspx?itemid=28274&quot;>;计划记录&lt;/a>;，在追逐&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KTmBoyle/status/1466845125884227587?s=20&amp;amp;t=CX4OlsZJ60ayi8D8delnUA&quot;>;漫长的联邦销售周期&lt;/a>;时耗尽资金。&lt;/或者他们重新设计商业产品以满足个人国防客户的特定需求。这种定制规格限制了产品对其他国防客户的实用性，从而阻碍了规模化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相反，我们观察到在国防市场成功扩大规模的公司采取了以下三种策略：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; >; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;利用商业牵引力确保早期国防收入&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;商业公司只有在实现商业产品与市场的契合度后才应进入国防市场，其中增长努力显然是显而易见的从而产生客户吸引力。这使得该公司能够专注于与其商业客户最密切相关的国防客户，同时防止其过度专业化无法扩大规模的特定国防产品。此外，商业销售帮助这些公司在漫长的联邦销售周期中维持生计。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于这样一家处于早期阶段的公司来说，进入国防市场的第一步必须是确保非经常性收入，即- 时间资助，例如小型企业创新研究 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbir.gov/&quot;>;SBIR&lt;/a>;) 奖项和/或加速创新技术的采购和部署 (&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3098211/dod-announces-first-set-of-projects-to-receive-funding-from-the-pilot-program-t/ ”APFIT&lt;/a>;)。这些机会为公司提供了必要的资金，以避免所谓的“死亡之谷”——在这种情况下，公司永远实现一次性收入合同，但无法提供足够的投资回报来证明成本的合理性——通过识别国防收入潜力和可能的国防产品市场契合度，同时降低初创公司在国防市场面临的成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，关键是不要将非经常性收入误认为是成功，甚至是有意义的业务。相反，非经常性收入构成了早期阶段公司的训练轮，在采取下一步措施确保经常性收入之前，首先找到国防产品市场契合点并建立关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;使用现有渠道更快地获得经常性收入&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;公司可以通过利用现有的销售渠道（已经从事销售业务的大型企业）来缩短从非经常性收入转变为经常性收入所需的时间国防市场。最常见的渠道合作伙伴是洛克希德·马丁公司、波音公司和诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司等主要国防承包商。 “总理”非常熟悉采购流程，并通过五角大楼 220 万人的官僚机构控制提供解决方案的多个渠道。与这些 primes 合作使公司能够快速向政府雇员交付产品，以便他们能够尽快验证产品与市场的契合度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;prime 的销售渠道提供了多种验证产品与市场契合度的机会。例如，Applied Intuition 是一家自主软件公司，最初涉足汽车领域，但发现了国防市场对其产品的需求。作为首次涉足国防领域，他们与主承包商和车辆制造商通用动力公司分包给&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2021/04/omfv-gd-emphasizes-ai-adaptability-for-bradley-replacement /&quot;>;2021 年自动驾驶汽车设计竞标&lt;/a>;。从那时起，他们就赢得了有意义的&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.applied.co/blog-post/department-of-defense-bpa&quot;>;直接国防业务&lt;/a>;。 Prime 还为软件公司提供了将其产品集成到 Prime 硬件平台中的机会，这样公司就不必构建自己的硬件或说服政府买家签署年度软件订阅。例如，Overwatch Imaging 将其成像软件安装在主承包商 L3Harris 直接向政府销售的相机上，从而绕过了政府买家直接订阅 Overwatch Imaging 软件的需要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与合作有一些缺点素数。作为硬件或服务企业，他们微薄的软件转售努力可能会产生初创公司不感兴趣的收入水平；他们还经常&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2023/06/05/the-pentagon-is-to-blame-for-industrial-base-failures/?&quot;>;挤压他们的供应商按付款条件&lt;/a>;。公司也可能陷入作为分包商的困境，只能以中等价格被收购。对于认为与 Prime 合作风险太大的公司来说，还有其他现有渠道可供探索，例如 AWS 和 Snowflake 等大型科技平台。他们的市场往往与软件合作伙伴合作得更好——尽管大型科技平台为国防市场中的初创公司提供的价值低于主要平台。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论如何，公司在与任何这些现有销售渠道合作时发现的价值是节省时间和金钱来了解向国防部销售是否是一项引人注目的商业策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;建立一支专门的团队来扩大国防销售&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;成功的商业-第一批经过验证的国防产品市场契合度的公司可以通过建立专门的联邦销售团队来扩展其产品并实现可持续的经常性收入。正确建立联邦团队可以让公司追逐经常性收入机会并创建稳定的国防软件业务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商业交易关闭&lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/new-insight-into-key-sales -metrics&quot;>;只需几个月&lt;/a>;，较大的交易需要接近一年的时间，而联邦交易通常需要&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2020/9/14/联邦出售的形状&quot;>;一年多了&lt;/a>;。因此，成功进入国防市场的商业公司通过多年配额来补偿其联邦销售团队，并支付续约佣金，以确保深入、长期的产品部署。这些公司通过关注即将到来的管道和客户接触点来衡量联邦销售的成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;联邦销售要求销售人员拥有罕见的联邦客户知识和关系（通常通过公共部门经验），以及性格适合以团队为基础的环境，以完成复杂的联邦交易，相对于商业销售人员而言，商业销售人员往往具有地域性和竞争性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;销售团队的目标是实现年度经常性收入，以完成复杂的联邦交易。发展强大的国防业务。最受欢迎的目标是将公司纳入 &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.defense.gov/Portals/57/Documents/BPII-MPTW17%20slides/Tuesday/Yarmie_Finding%20The%20Right%20Transition%20Path .pdf?ver=2017-09-11-143251-370/#:~:text=A%20Program%20of%20Record%20(POR,response%20to%20an%20approved%20need。&quot;>;记录程序&lt;/ a>;，这意味着他们正在开发一个与国防部年度预算中的项目相关的项目。但是，还有其他选择来获取经常性收入。一种流行的途径是通过分散的&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.dau.edu/acquipedia/pages/ArticleContent.aspx?itemid=339&quot;>;运营与维护 (O&amp;M) 合同&lt;/a>;在整个部门广泛使用。获得这些类型的资金需要与运营部门进行一致协调军事人员，但获得合同可能非常简单（例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsa.gov/buy-through-us/purchasing-programs/gsa-multiple-award-schedule/about -gsa-schedule#:~:text=%20GSA%20Schedule%2C%20also%20已知，合理的%20价格%20到%20%20政府。&quot;>;GSA 时间表&lt;/a>;）。这类似于自下而上、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.productled.org/foundations/what-is-product-led-growth&quot;>;产品主导&lt;/a>;增长，而不是集中的方法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;寻找合适的投资者支持&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;虽然公司可以在上述任何步骤中寻求投资者支持，但公司在找到产品后最有可能筹集资金-国防市场的市场契合度。在国防市场上运营的风险投资 (VC) 公司分为三类：大型公司、国防导向型公司和战略投资者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大型风险投资公司是拥有数十亿美元资金的综合型公司，例如安德森 (Andreessen) Horowitz、General Catalyst 和 Founders Fund。他们资助那些能够成为行业定义独角兽的公司。其原因是风险投资回报是由一些成功的异常值驱动的（通常称为&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/057ced93-4211-444a-9fcc-1714e1d35c79&quot;>;幂律&lt; /a>;)：基金规模越大，单个公司需要规模越大才能返还基金资本。因此，引人注目的风险投资国防投资通常会重点关注像 &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/24/filing-anduril-is-raise-up-to-1-2b-sources-say 这样的公司-at-a-7b-pre-money-valuation-for-its-defense-tech/&quot;>;Anduril&lt;/a>; 只追求国防销售，因为他们有能力挑战现有的主要承包商。但进入国防市场的商业公司在展示了五角大楼大规模规模的潜力后，也可以获得大型风险投资公司的检查。例如，虽然 &lt;a href=&quot;https://scale.com/&quot;>;Scale AI&lt;/a>; 在筹集 3.25 亿美元的 E 轮融资之前仅获得了 75 万美元的非经常性 SBIR，但额外的资金帮助他们获得了 2.5 亿美元的融资一年后签订国防合同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多国防投资也来自专业的中型风险投资公司，这些公司明确帮助公司扩大国防规模。例如，美国的 Frontier Fund 和 Shield Capital 拥有传统的风险投资基金结构，但将其资源和网络用于支持向国防销售的公司。专业风险投资公司不需要类别定义的成功来获得相同的回报，从而使他们能够支持更广泛的向国防销售的公司。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;洛克希德·马丁风险投资公司和波音公司的 Horizo​​nX-AE 工业研究等战略企业投资者正在兴起技术并在赚取回报的基础上提供战略合作伙伴关系。例如，Lockheed Martin Ventures 努力探索 AI/ML 技术&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakheeddefense.com/2020/08/lockheed-martin-ventures-scouts-next-gen-ai-ml-tech/&quot;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;世界各地的员工都面临长期低敬业度和生产力水平的困扰，而压力和倦怠持续上升。再加上经济不确定性和潜在衰退的压力，人工智能使工作和技能自动化并扰乱整个行业的威胁，以及日益渗透到许多人工作经历中的萎靡和孤独感，整体情况相当黯淡。 If you want to compete for talent, and create truly appealing environments in your team and organization, where people thrive and excel, you must help them rediscover the human (and humane) qualities that make work more than just work. This is particularly critical for those who manage people, with meta-analytic studies showing that around 30% to 40% of the variability in team morale, performance, and critical organizational behaviors (both good and bad) can be explained by what managers and leaders do. Simply put: bosses play a key role impacting the well-being and success of teams. This article discusses three potential action areas for managers and leaders who want to enhance their team&amp;#8217;s morale, well-being and performance, particularly during tough or uncertain times.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Although the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Work/dp/152660499X&quot;>;past 100 years&lt;/a>; have seen substantial improvements in working conditions around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0143111388/ref=sr_1_1?crid=RXBN135VBOQ9&amp;amp;keywords=pinker+enlightenment&amp;amp;qid=1675163223&amp;amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC45MiIsInFzcCI6IjAuOTcifQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=pinker+enlightment%2Cstripbooks%2C156&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;>;the world&lt;/a>;, particularly within the knowledge economy, our work is not yet done.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider that even skilled workers — who have recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-02645-011&quot;>;benefited&lt;/a>; from higher levels of freedom and flexibility, not to mention access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90451328/are-you-a-spiritual-workaholic&quot;>;meaningful&lt;/a>; jobs and careers, and employers who express the intent to improve workers&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/well-being-in-the-workplace&quot;>;health and well-being&lt;/a>; — suffer from chronic low &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx&quot;>;engagement&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/c2913c55-b9f5-44fa-b6dc-7cd7a2659925&quot;>;productivity&lt;/a>; levels, while stress and burnout &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Paycheck-Management-Employee-Performance/dp/0062800922&quot;>;continue to rise&lt;/a>;. Add to this the pressures of economic uncertainty and a potential &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bond-investors-brace-recession-fed-expected-slow-pace-tightening-2023-01-31/&quot;>;recession&lt;/a>;, the threat of artificial intelligence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90838307/ai-automation-is-coming-fueled-by-labor-shortages-and-a-recession&quot;>;automating jobs&lt;/a>; and skills and disrupting entire industries, and the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html&quot;>;languishing&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/06/employees-are-lonelier-than-ever-heres-how-employers-can-help&quot;>;loneliness&lt;/a>; that increasingly permeates the work experiences of many, and the overall picture is rather bleak.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our view, there has never been a better time to rehumanize work. That is, in an age when a large proportion of our everyday interactions with others (eg, clients, colleagues, and bosses, and even spouses and kids) are reduced to sterile technological exchanges, while our careers seem to have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2631787719897663&quot;>;optimized for efficiency&lt;/a>;&lt;u>;,&lt;/u>; it&#39;s no surprise that many workers feel deprived of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Human-Automation-Quest-Reclaim-Unique-ebook/dp/B099KQV3ZJ&quot;>;creativity, curiosity, and humanity altogether&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The implication?

There is no shortage of historical examples to illustrate this consistent research finding: from Catherine the Great&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnodo-newtonic.com/catherine-the-great-accomplishments&quot;>;nation building&lt;/a>;, to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/10/fergusons-formula&quot;>;Sir Alex Ferguson&#39;s record-breaking Manchester United&lt;/a>;, to Satya Nadella&#39;s radical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/22/how-satya-nadella-turned-microsoft-around&quot;>;transformation &lt;/a>;of Microsoft, effective collaboration between people is dramatically enhanced with effective leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With that, we see three potential action areas for managers and leaders who want to enhance their team&#39;s morale, well-being and performance, particularly during tough or uncertain times.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Revitalizing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In any organization, the level of energy and output differs as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08959280701332968&quot;>;much &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08959280701332968&quot;>;within&lt;/a>; as between individuals. The same employee may be highly productive one year and unproductive the next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the presence of adverse circumstances (eg, economic crisis, political instability, a global pandemic, etc.) dips in morale and performance are likely in many teams. Thus, managers and people leaders should focus on revitalizing their teams, which is fundamentally about energizing and motivating people again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good way to achieve this is to start with the why, consistent with the notion that a critical aspect of leadership is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002188638201800303?journalCode=jaba&quot;>;“manage meaning&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002188638201800303?journalCode=jaba&quot;>;.&lt;/a>;” Humans crave meaning, and leaders are well positioned to shape meaning, helping us make sense of the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important task is to emphasize — often — why the work a team is doing matters. Even in tough economic conditions, most people have alternative options for their careers, bringing doubt and uncertainty about where to go, what to do next, and how to decide.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When leaders help people to remember and embrace the why&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; they are more likely to believe that they matter to the success of the company&#39;s goals. This is energizing, and can make people feel re-energized. One way to do this is to celebrate past achievements and link them to future objectives and successes. Emphasize social ties among team members and remind team members of their shared history and past challenges, to help them feel connected to each other, and to the team&#39;s mission.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What can you do to revitalize?&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Emphasize and re-emphasize the team&#39;s or organization&#39;s purpose.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Ask people what matters to them, what they really care about/believe in.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Ask people to describe how what they do (their role) affects the team and ultimately the customers (or those served by the organization&#39;s work)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Invite people to say what they get from each other — what they appreciate about working together.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;Repairing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This is about using the power of leadership to heal existing and past wounds, restore wellbeing, and address human rather than business problems. All human relationships are subject to breakdown via misunderstanding, disagreement, conflict, and failures. Smart leaders help their &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/04/strategies-for-learning-from-failure&quot;>;teams learn from failures&lt;/a>; and turn them into valuable lessons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To achieve this, vulnerability goes a long way, enabling &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Edmondson%20Psychological%20safety.pdf&quot;>;psychological safety&lt;/a>; and candor in your team. Be open, transparent, honest, and self-critical, all in the interest of fostering an open dialogue and uniting the team to pursue collaboration and progress. In our view, one of the best ways to assess your leadership talent is by examining the proportion of bad news to good news you receive as a manager or leader: If it&#39;s lower than 2-to-5, you probably have room for improvement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What can you do to repair?&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Suggest to your team that you all take a look at some of their recent struggles/breakdowns. Identify one or two that stand out in importance, or that are simply recent enough to be conducive to an honest conversation.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Next, ask each person to consider what they did, or failed to do, that in some small or larger way may have played a role in the breakdown.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Listen, understand, forgive, recommit.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;Refocusing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Help your team regain focus by aligning team members on key priorities. Remember that less is more, especially when teams are tired and fatigued.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also remember that you can never over-communicate, while under-communicating is easier than you think and a major cause of most team problems. In particular, shying away from difficult conversations and being conflict avoidant are sure-fire ways to ensure worse conflict in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider ending each year (or starting the new year) with a clear strategy session, aligning people on key goals and execution plans. Remember that, as Michael Porter &lt;a href=&quot;/1996/11/what-is-strategy&quot;>;noted&lt;/a>;, strategy is as much about deciding what &lt;em>;not to do&lt;/em>; as what to do. Your key objective should be to ensure everybody understands the what, why, and how, to get them excited about being on the bus, going into an enticing destination, and playing their role to help everybody achieve challenging goals together. In this way, the journey can even be enjoyable.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What can you do to refocus?&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Ask your team the following questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What can we do better?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What can we let go of?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What is truly essential for achieving the work that we really believe matters&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;A final consideration pertains to you … not as a manager, but as a human. Just as on a plane, we are instructed to put on our oxygen masks before we can help others, we must help ourselves first. Your ability to energize your team will depend on whether you can stay sane, calm, and energized yourself. There&#39;s no substitute for working on your own wellness, and managing yourself is a critical pre-condition for managing others. In that sense, the worst leadership mistake you can make is to prioritize your team over yourself, for it is only once you can revitalize, repair, and refocus yourself, that you&#39;ll be able to help your people follow suit.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 14 Jul 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Build a Winning AI Strategy for Your Business]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/build-a-winning-ai-strategy-for-your-business]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_14_1494647585.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Artur Debat/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Artificial intelligence is a kind of catalyst; it&amp;#8217;s the next wave of truly transformative technology with potential we cannot yet fully envision or appreciate. Companies will start by using this new technology to do &amp;#8220;old things&amp;#8221; before discovering the new opportunities it creates. So, how should they go about this process? They should: start by experimenting, deploy for productivity, transform experiences, and then try to build new things. Throughout this process, they should prioritize security and responsible use.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/build-a-winning-ai-strategy-for-your-business?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/build-a-winning-ai-strategy-for-your-business?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Recently, like millions of people, I used a ride-sharing app on my smartphone. It was pretty uneventful and not something I gave much thought. Ride-sharing is simple and convenient, and it&#39;s now an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/02/22/2612873/0/en/Ride-Sharing-Market-Size-worth-USD-242-73-Billion-Globally-by-2028-at-a-CAGR-of-16-3.html&quot;>;$80+ billion&lt;/a>; industry. But it wasn&#39;t that long ago that it didn&#39;t even exist. We had cars, we had riders, and we had drivers; but to work, ride-sharing needed smartphones. When they arrived, so did an enormous variety of conveniences and new experiences — some that became entire industries — that we never could have imagined.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Artificial intelligence is a similar kind of catalyst; it&#39;s the next wave of truly transformative technology with potential we cannot yet fully envision or appreciate. It is the defining technology of our time, changing the way we live and work. In my entire career in tech, I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/2023/05/how-generative-ai-changes-strategy&quot;>;never been more excited&lt;/a>; and optimistic than I am now. I have a colleague at Microsoft who talks about AI like this: You&#39;ve got to use the “new thing” to do old things better. Then, you use the new thing to … do new things. &lt;em>;He&#39;s right.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider an example from health care. &lt;a href=&quot;https://paige.ai/&quot;>;Paige&lt;/a>; is a software company using AI to change the way doctors identify, diagnose, and treat cancers. With properly trained and tuned models, AI can look at thousands of digital pathology images, pixel by pixel, and detect abnormalities faster and with more accuracy. Imagine what these tools can unlock not only for pathologists and doctors, but for patients, too. It means earlier disease detection, healthier lives, and more time with loved ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now every company, no matter the size or industry, should be thinking about AI. AI is moving from its auto-pilot phase, which was all about narrow, purpose-built tools that use machine learning models to make predictions, recommendations, and automate, to its copilot phase, where there&#39;s tremendous opportunity to revolutionize how &lt;em>;just about everything&lt;/em>; gets done. Leaders who embrace AI now and take action to understand it, experiment with it, and envision how it can solve hard problems are going to run companies that thrive in an AI world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But where should they start? Nearly every day, I talk with business leaders who ask important questions about AI&#39;s potential. No matter where you are in your AI journey, it&#39;s incumbent upon every leader to embrace this unique time and take advantage of this powerful technology. If you feel unsure how to start, or how to move forward, you&#39;re not alone. Like any business-planning exercise, think about your AI strategy in phases. Embrace agility and change, and keep a continuous learning mindset, calibrating and adjusting your gameplan as you go.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Start by Experimenting&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The best way to learn about AI is to use it. It&#39;s rare for new and disruptive technology to be immediately accessible. This is. Most of the leaders I talk with have tried popular AI applications like ChatGPT or the new Bing. There are many other options out there, but the point is to get curious.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Try applying it to whatever task is in front of you and see what it&#39;s good at and what it&#39;s not. Use it to generate interview questions, write a memo, research and summarize a topic you want to learn more about, or get thought starters for a document. I used Bing and ChatGPT to help me get ideas for a speech. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve used Microsoft 365 Copilot, the AI integration across Microsoft apps to generate slides, to find and summarize documents that share a topic, and to recap email exchanges with colleagues. By using and experimenting with AI, you&#39;ll be in a better position to imagine how it could be used in your organization — and you likely know better than anyone where opportunities and potential exist.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Deploy for Productivity&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When it comes to productivity, AI copilots — from Microsoft and from others — can be deployed or embedded in applications to assist or simplify certain tasks. Less than two years since its launch, GitHub&#39;s Copilot is already writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/github-copilot-generates-up-to-46-of-all-code-but-you-re-not-out-of-a-job/#:~:text=46%25%20of%20all%20code%20created,61%25%20of%20suggestions%20from%20Copilot.&quot;>;46%&lt;/a>; of the code on its repository and helps developers code up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/github-copilot-generates-up-to-46-of-all-code-but-you-re-not-out-of-a-job/#:~:text=46%25%20of%20all%20code%20created,61%25%20of%20suggestions%20from%20Copilot.&quot;>;55%&lt;/a>; faster. Imagine what developers are doing with that extra time. Three out of four users say it helps them conserve mental energy and focus on more satisfying work. Said another way: Creating new things and solving new problems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider the workflows and process-driven activities in your business: things like payroll, on-boarding, or IT help desk support. These are all repeatable, rules-based processes that can be streamlined with AI. This is the driver behind an entire new category of AI software that can handle manual tasks and reshape scores of business processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s another way to think about AI for productivity: time. If you&#39;re in fraud detection, or you&#39;re a security analyst, time can be your biggest asset or your biggest challenge. If you can shorten the amount of time it takes to comb through lots of data-rich, time-sensitive information, you&#39;re already better and more effective at your job.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Transform Experiences&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Today, AI is already impacting how businesses deliver experiences that are better, faster, more efficient, or entirely new, from predictive text on your phone to chatbots on websites to suggested searches when you open a browser.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-us-makes-billion-investment-in-ai-capabilities.html&quot;>;PwC&lt;/a>; is using Azure OpenAI Service to expand and scale its own AI offerings while also helping clients in industries like insurance or healthcare reimagine their businesses by leveraging the power of generative AI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1501304071775762777-carmax-retailer-azure-openai-service&quot;>;CarMax&lt;/a>; is using it to analyze hundreds of thousands of customer reviews and surface key takeaways for buyers about every make, model, and year of vehicle in its inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in its early stages, AI is making employee experiences better too. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/four-ways-leaders-can-empower-people-for-how-work-gets-done&quot;>;recent Microsoft survey&lt;/a>; found that 89% of employees and business decision makers with access to automation and AI-powered tools feel more fulfilled. They say it&#39;s because they can spend time on work that truly matters. Nine out of 10 said they want the opportunity to apply AI solutions to &lt;em>;even more&lt;/em>; tasks and activities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I see that happening already in some of the organizations I work with. They&#39;re pursuing more advanced AI in use cases like customer support, writing assistance, or data extraction and classification. The common thread in each of these involves using AI to leverage resources or information &lt;em>;you already have &lt;/em>;to transform experiences for people.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Build New Things&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The above steps are versions of using the “new thing” to do old things better, to borrow my colleague&#39;s turn of phrase. But how can you use the new thing to actually do new things? What can you do that&#39;s completely different? How can you delight customers and create new lines of business and, with them, new revenue?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the challenge before business leaders right now; and it&#39;s a hard one. The answer starts with integrating AI into your organization and iterating from there. Because while AI will enable people and organizations to achieve more, we&#39;re at the very beginning of defining what “more” looks like. But to move ahead, we need to put in place the conditions that we help us discover what comes next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the really exciting things about using AI to be more efficient — whether that&#39;s using generative AI to get ideas or &amp;nbsp;to conduct research — is that it allows you to think more deeply about a concept or a problem you&#39;re trying to solve. It&#39;s not a far leap to imagine how this level of concentrated effort is going to enable companies to develop truly new and innovative solutions faster; and then take advantage of the snowball effect of that speed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Throughout: Prioritize Security &amp;amp; Responsible AI&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Alongside all of AI&#39;s promise, one thing is certain. We will not realize AI&#39;s full potential without safeguards. Technology has always been an accelerator and an enabler. AI is no different, but it does present potential risks that have to be managed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For any company, the success of Responsible AI initiatives depends on at least three things. First, it takes committed and involved leadership. (Microsoft&#39;s Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith, and our Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, chair our Responsible AI Council.) Second, companies must build inclusive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1:primaryr6&quot;>;governance models&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai-resources&quot;>;actionable guidelines&lt;/a>;, as we have done. Finally, they must also invest in responsible AI in the form of new engineering systems, incubations that are research-led, and in the people who will ensure that responsible AI principles are put into practice. At Microsoft, we have hundreds of people working on this, and for many of them, it&#39;s their full-time job. Beyond that, we&#39;ve adopted the mindset that using AI responsibly is a responsibility we all share, no matter your role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The AI roadmap will be different for every organization, and it looks different depending on whether you&#39;re a tech company or not. Tech companies are more likely to have already implemented some form of intelligent agent into their software experiences, for example. But for everyone, the potential is massive, and the time to start is now.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like ride-sharing needed smartphones, there are as-yet conceived industries that will need AI to get off the ground. Most of us recognize that AI will be completely game-changing.

But sourcing and financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;amp;A) teams are increasingly embracing cloud-based tools that bring them real-time data analysis to support better business decisions and greater growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teams with access to aggregated data and automation tools can better understand their marketplace than ever before, driving better results in a range of business drivers, including improved headcount management, demand reduction, more streamlined project requests, and tighter inventory control.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Overcoming Barriers to Collaboration&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sourcing and FP&amp;amp;A teams using legacy software often work in silos, which can trap data and insights, giving both teams and their organization an incomplete picture of spend under management. Lack of data impedes management from accurately tracking costs and forecasting expenses, increasing the risks of supply chain shortages or surpluses and the procurement of unnecessary services.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lack of visibility into planned spending initiatives increases the time and cost to improve spend under management, according to a new &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/pdfs/comm/workday/OptimizingTheSupplyChainByAligningThePlanningAndSourcingFunctions.pdf&quot;>;Harvard Business Review Analytic Services &lt;/a>;research report, “Optimizing the Supply Chain by Aligning the Planning and Sourcing Functions.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This disconnect among teams makes it difficult to forecast spending. Supply chain disruptions only add to the budget pressures of organizations already struggling from the effects of the pandemic, geopolitical volatility, and rising inflation. Sixty-four percent of the 536 financial planning and procurement executives surveyed in the HBR report said their organization&#39;s procurement costs for goods and services were over budget in their latest fiscal year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Planning and procurement are usually done by very different people using very different data,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://caplice.mit.edu/#:~:text=Chris%20Caplice%20has%20been%20teaching,first%20MicroMasters%20credential%20ever%20offered.&quot;>;Chris Caplice&lt;/a>;, executive director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Transportation and Logistics. “The planning culture is much more analytical.

Shared data empowers planning teams to formulate accurate budgets and forecasts that reflect changing market conditions. At the same time, access to real-time savings information helps managers reallocate resources among existing projects, begin new projects, or reserve funds for the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Increasing collaboration between sourcing and FP&amp;amp;A teams also allows for proactive budget planning that reflects their shared information. Connected and collaborative sourcing can result in better decision-making by eliminating communication silos, providing real-time access to data, and strengthening cross-functional relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most progressive executives I know are looking at exactly this issue of collaboration between planning and sourcing,” says consultant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/haroldgood&quot;>;Harold Good&lt;/a>;, president and CEO of Procurement Pros Group. “They&#39;re asking how their planning and sourcing functions communicate with each other, and how they can ensure that everyone has&amp;nbsp; ccess to the same relevant data.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strategic sourcing technology gives organizations the ability to combine data with other savings drivers from across the business, enabling the optimization of cost factors such as logistics and inventory. This capability facilitates better decision-making and tighter coordination of materials, capacity, and personnel.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Real-Time Insights, Better Decisions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enterprise investments in technology enable the implementation of strategic sourcing solutions quickly—and with rapid potential returns on investment (ROI).

The updated software and processes saved the company $4.2 million after just six months in service.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“From our day one, we&#39;ve gotten tremendous value in greater engagement with our stakeholders—including suppliers—plus cleaner data and easier, real-time reporting from a single source,” says Ryan Koos, chief supply chain officer at Sharp.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to cloud-native software, organizations interested in the most advanced technology need to take advantage of the power of machine learning (ML).

While there will always be ups and downs, nothing is permanent, even if it might feel that way. Sometimes you&amp;#8217;re on top and things are running smoothly; other times, you struggle to stay afloat.&amp;#160; If you&amp;#8217;re having a hard time believing that the slump will ever end and need to hear it from someone else, contact a friend or mentor who can give your perspective. If you feel like you can&amp;#8217;t catch a win or move ahead on a project, it&amp;#8217;s time to adjust your mindset. Celebrate even the smallest of wins. Remember that the tiniest win can catapult you ahead. Lean on your mentors and colleagues and keep the naysayers at bay. Over time, the cumulative effect of these positive actions will move you forward, and those tiny wins will add up to big wins. Remember that this &lt;em>;will&amp;#160;&lt;/em>;reverse, even if you&amp;#8217;re not sure when.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/keeping-your-spirits-up-when-you-really-need-a-win-at-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/keeping-your-spirits-up-when-you-really-need-a-win-at-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Social media makes it easy to see everyone&#39;s wins. But if you&#39;re in a period where you&#39;re grinding away and it feels like it&#39;s been a while since you had any wins of your own, seeing happy LinkedIn announcements from friends and colleagues can feel painful. Perhaps you&#39;ve had success in the past doing what you&#39;re doing — but now nothing is landing. If you feel like you&#39;re not moving forward with your work, it&#39;s time to recalibrate, check your mindset, and focus on activities that make you happy, rather than on comparing yourself to others. Here are tips for moving forward when you really need a win.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Remember that this is a &lt;em>;season.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;There will always be ups and downs; nothing is permanent, even if it feels that way. Sometimes you&#39;re on top and things are running smoothly; other times, you struggle to stay afloat. There is no one “right” season. Remember that this period is only a bump and won&#39;t last forever. If you&#39;re having a hard time believing that the slump will ever end and need to hear it from someone else, contact a friend or mentor who can give your perspective. Remember that this &lt;em>;will &lt;/em>;reverse, even if you&#39;re not sure when.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One client of mine kept pitching ideas to &lt;em>;her&lt;/em>; client, but never seemed to get traction. Everything she pitched was passed upon. My client felt frustrated because it felt like she would never get an idea approved; yet she kept taking action. My client decided that this was a “grind season”; she learned to detach from the results and just keep moving.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Celebrate a (tiny) win.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve probably heard it before: “celebrate the small wins.” But what if you feel like you don&#39;t have &lt;em>;any&lt;/em>; wins, however small? In their article “&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins&quot;>;The Power of Small Wins&lt;/a>;,” Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer share this: “When we think about progress, we often imagine how good it feels to achieve a long-term goal or experience a major breakthrough.” These big wins are great — but they are relatively rare. If you&#39;re searching for a small win and coming up short, try this: go even smaller. List out every detail that went into a recent work project. Which of those went off without a hitch? Which went better than expected? Recognizing even a tiny victory can change the trajectory of the work and lift your spirits. One former colleague decided to keep track of his micro-wins. Over time, he saw how tiny wins built up. The net result was that he felt more powerful and capable in his role.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Set firm boundaries around whom you allow into your space.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Even colleagues and friends with the best of intentions can cause you to doubt yourself. Consider who among your colleagues makes you feel good? Who takes the wind out of your sails? Set boundaries and be ruthless about avoiding the people who bring you down. In his article “&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/the-emotional-boundaries-you-need-at-work&quot;>;The Emotional Boundaries You Need at Work&lt;/a>;,” Greg McKeown creates a matrix by which people can determine their boundaries. McKeown writes: “To develop meaningful and mature relationships at work or at home we need to develop&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;two&lt;/em>;&amp;nbsp;filters. The first filter protects you from other people. The second filter protects other people from you.” This doesn&#39;t mean you turn into a hermit; rather, it means you only spend time with people who make you feel good (even if it&#39;s just one person). Remember — you don&#39;t have to have such hard boundaries forever. While you&#39;re getting back on your feet, though, ruthlessly avoid people who knock you down a peg. That may also mean staying off social media for a bit.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Forget being grateful; look at your strengths.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Practicing gratitude makes you feel better and expands your view of what&#39;s going right. However, if your spirits are down, “being grateful” may feel like too much of a stretch. Instead of making gratitude lists, try this; at the end of the day, review your actions and appreciate what you did well. This could be something as simple as “I smiled at the barista today”; or, “I shared a valuable insight in the senior leadership meeting.” Write at least three things a day. Over time, seeing your positive actions accumulate will bolster your sense of self-confidence and help to propel you forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Appreciate what&#39;s going right.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re feeling ineffective, you may think you need to &lt;em>;do&lt;/em>; something. Yet often, action isn&#39;t required. If you feel driven to &lt;em>;do&lt;/em>;, check the impulse; instead, try sitting and doing nothing. I coach many clients to block off time on their calendars to do nothing.&amp;nbsp; “Nothing” may mean sitting and reading a fashion magazine to clear their mind. Or it might mean sitting and thinking about a meeting that went well last week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key is to let your mind get quiet and try to notice at least one thing that&#39;s going right. If you&#39;re not looking for the good, you&#39;ll miss it and stay in the negative belief that “nothing is working out for me.” Throughout the day, it&#39;s easy notice the “dings,” or things that don&#39;t seem to be moving in the right direction. Likewise, it&#39;s easy to overlook the quiet hum of everything that&#39;s working as it should. Get in the practice of noticing — and writing down — three things that are going right, every day.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Look at other people&#39;s wins, but never to shame yourself. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sometimes you need to look outside yourself at other people&#39;s wins. You needn&#39;t compare yourself and create a measuring stick for where you want to be; rather, use other people&#39;s wins to catapult yourself ahead. Adopt this mindset: “If that person can do that thing well, then I can, too.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I worked with a client who likes to watch motivational YouTube videos. He watches Tom Brady montages on YouTube when he needs to “win” (ie, close sales). My client uses Tom Brady&#39;s drive, motivation, and hard work to lift himself up and signal to himself: “I can win, too.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Expand your horizons.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re feeling low, you may be inclined to hunker down and do the least amount possible. A better idea is to look for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/annesugar/2022/10/18/embracing-uncertainty-with-nathan-and-susannah-furr/?sh=131b3a4441f7&quot;>;paradigm-shifting&lt;/a>; ways to challenge yourself.

While women comprise only 10% of workers at other large mines globally, South Flank, an iron ore mine in Western Australia operated by BHP, has created a workforce where 40% of the 869 frontline employees are women, and four out of six senior managers are women. The authors, whose research specializes in changing sexist and homophobic behaviors in traditionally male-dominated settings, were initially hired to deliver workshops on the subject at South Flank, but in their six weeks there, studied its workforce via observation and interviews. They identified five key factors that allowed the mine to achieve gender parity and inclusion of women workers: 1) Strong engagement from senior leaders who set strict gender equity targets, 2) strong support from leaders at the head office, 3) major investments in fostering a welcoming and safe mining camp, 4) use of science and data-driven approaches to drive change, and 5) recognition that gender equity is hard to achieve and sustain and requires ongoing work. They also outline potential obstacles to sustaining future progress, such as deeply rooted masculine norms that harm the well-being and retention of women workers and the lack of systems to support parents of all genders who hope to return to mining.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-a-remote-australian-mine-became-a-gender-balanced-workplace?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/how-a-remote-australian-mine-became-a-gender-balanced-workplace?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The pace of progress on gender equality in workplaces has been “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/2022/03/11/gender-equity-work-advances-glacial-pace-new-harvard-survey-shows-1685659.html&quot;>;glacial&lt;/a>;&lt;u>;.&lt;/u>;” The United Nations has found it will take nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2022/09/achieving-full-gender-equality-is-still-centuries-away-warns-the-un-in-new-report/&quot;>;300 years&lt;/a>; for women to achieve full workplace and social equality globally.

A recent mining industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.responsibleminingfoundation.org/app/uploads/EN_Research-Insight_Gender_Feb2022.pdf&quot;>;report&lt;/a>; found executives have focused heavily on increasing the number of women working in their head offices, but there has been little change to the gender balance in their frontline operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2022/09/progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2022&quot;>;UN has found&lt;/a>; a key barrier to progress across industries has been “backlash” from men who feel they are being personally disadvantaged by the need to correct centuries of disadvantage experienced by women. Detractors in mining &lt;a href=&quot;https://ojs2.e-journal.unair.ac.id/IJOSH/article/view/24849/0&quot;>;resist&lt;/a>; change by making claims that women are “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2021.02.002&quot;>;uninterested&lt;/a>;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/getting-serious-about-diversity-enough-already-with-the-business-case&quot;>;unable&lt;/a>;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101962&quot;>;unsuited&lt;/a>;” to do the high-paying, secure, operational jobs such as drilling holes, blasting rocks, driving giant trucks, or maintaining heavy machinery.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, a remote mine in Western Australia has proven these detractors wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhp.com/careers/get-to-know-our-business/south-flank&quot;>;South Flank&lt;/a>;, an iron ore mine operated by the world&#39;s second-largest mining company, BHP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhp.com/news/media-centre/releases/2021/10/bhp-marks-official-opening-of-south-flank&quot;>;40%&lt;/a>; of the 869 frontline employees are women. Even more remarkable, a majority of senior managers — four out of six — are women. For context, the International Labour Organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/sector/Resources/publications/WCMS_821061/lang--en/index.htm&quot;>;found&lt;/a>; an average of just 10% of workers are women at other large mines around the world. South Flank, to the best of our knowledge, is the most gender-balanced large mine in Australia and also, likely, the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we collected the data reported in this article, we had only been commissioned to deliver a series of five workshops to South Flank&#39;s leaders on changing sexist and homophobic behaviors in traditionally male-dominated settings. We were not commissioned to conduct any research. However, while delivering the workshops, we became aware of the unique progress that the mine has made on gender equity. This is why we decided to collect data (with permission) via observations and interviews to understand how this progress was made, so that we could share this information with other organizations (through articles like this). Subsequently, South Flank has engaged our faculty and our university&#39;s behavior science institute to provide additional support with changing harmful and exclusionary behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Why 40% matters&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;International organizations generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_701767/lang--en/index.htm&quot;>;define&lt;/a>; a gender-balanced workplace as having 40-60% women (or men) as well as a workplace where men and women have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/tax/forum-on-tax-administration/publications-and-products/advancing-gender-balance-in-the-workforce-a-collective-responsibility.pdf&quot;>;equal power and influence&lt;/a>;. At 40%, which the International Labour Organization has determined to be the baseline for sustainability, it is likely that there would be at least 3-4 women (or men) on every crew at a mining operation (typically 8-12 people). This is important, because people generally do not want to be the only person of their gender on a crew. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00049530.2021.1883409&quot;>;century&lt;/a>; of evidence that people feel a greater sense of belonging and safety when they are in groups with others from similar backgrounds. Importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/weykd6IKTp8&quot;>;negative behaviors&lt;/a>; such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02678373.2022.2129514&quot;>;bullying&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0261927X12456383&quot;>;discriminatory language&lt;/a>; are less common in gender-balanced work settings, in part because the negative influences of gender norms are weakened. Indeed, BHP&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhp.com/news/prospects/2019/10/the-gender-equation&quot;>;own analyses&lt;/a>; found its gender-balanced teams are more productive, happier, more engaged, and critically, they are safer, with 67% lower recordable injury rates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders of similar types of businesses in urban areas are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/the-continuous-struggle-for-the-existence-of-females-in-the-construction-industry-in-the-21st-century/298290&quot;>;struggling&lt;/a>; to attract women. In the United States, for example, women comprise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nawic.org/statistics&quot;>;just 10.9% of workers in the construction industry&lt;/a>;, and they are overrepresented in traditionally female-dominated office roles (eg, marketing, HR, finance) whereas at South Flank, most people work in frontline roles (eg, mechanics, truck operators, electricians) and there are very few traditionally female-dominated office jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Why can&#39;t this be done at all businesses?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;South Flank is located in one of the hottest places on Earth. Employees often work outside, and temperatures in excess of 113 °F (45 °C) are not uncommon. The mine is also located more than 1300km (800 miles) from the nearest major city (Perth). This means most employees must take a two-hour flight from Perth, and then work 12-hour shifts for eight days before they fly home for a six-day break.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We were curious how this isolated mine has made progress on gender equality while similar workplaces globally have floundered. We spent six weeks in late 2022 at the mine after South Flank&#39;s leaders commissioned us to deliver a series of workshops on the science of changing negative behaviors in traditionally male-dominated settings, a topic we have studied for decades. We flew in and out each week and worked, slept, and ate like any other employee. We were given total and unrestricted access, which is why, with permission, we decided to use the opportunity to collect data through observations, interviews, and surveys. We wanted to understand what makes South Flank unique. (For disclosure, managers at South Flank were given the opportunity to review this article, prior to it being submitted. They were primarily focused on ensuring we did not release confidential information about their operation. They did not make changes to our research findings.) Our research identified five drivers of progress on gender equity at South Flank — but also some emerging threats to the sustainability of this progress and current gender relations there.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Strong engagement from senior leaders who set strict gender equity targets&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The mine&#39;s General Manager (GM), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhp.com/news/articles/2022/04/bhp-finalists-for-the-2022-women-in-resources-awards&quot;>;Steve Campbell&lt;/a>;, and his senior managers have driven progress through deliberate planning, significant investments, hard work, and creativity. This is consistent with a large body of research which has found workplace diversity does not happen “with time” or by &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/how-to-close-the-gender-gap&quot;>;accident&lt;/a>;, or through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674276611&amp;amp;content=reviews&quot;>;mandatory&lt;/a>; online training programs (these can in some cases actually make things &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail&quot;>;worse&lt;/a>;). Progress like theirs also requires more than “support” for diversity from senior leaders; this type of change requires their &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/gender-equality-is-within-our-reach&quot;>;deep engagement&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To drive engagement from leaders at all levels of the operation, South Flank&#39;s GM set gender equity targets for middle managers. These targets are the same as those they habitually set for iron ore production. Targets &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/10/companies-need-to-think-bigger-than-diversity-training&quot;>;work&lt;/a>; to drive action on diversity and, importantly, they are a normal and a highly effective tool used in mining to achieve better business outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Middle managers have then been supported to find ways to achieve their targets. For example, they have been allowed to restructure their departments to recreate entry-level roles, which has increased the pipeline of potential workers. This is important because most men working in mining were hired without skills and were given the opportunity to learn on the job. Problematically, for women, most entry-level roles have been eliminated at modern, technology-heavy mining operations. By recreating entry-level roles, South Flank has been able to hire women with a wide variety of professional backgrounds (eg, farmers, nurses, truck drivers, mechanics, athletes, teachers, hair stylists) who have since become skilled mining employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Strong support from leaders at the head office&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;South Flank&#39;s GM and senior managers have themselves received strong support from BHP&#39;s senior executives. The mine is relatively new, and our conversations with senior leaders at BHP suggest the company understands that it cannot operate a diverse and gender-balanced mine in the same way as it has operated its traditional mines. South Flank is hoping to be the prototype for the mine of the future. BHP is aware of the financial and social importance of achieving a gender balance within the mining industry, however, there is no roadmap for operating a gender-balanced mine. South Flank and another BHP mine in South America, with a 30% gender balance, are helping the global mining industry figure out how to build the road to gender equality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The support from senior BHP leaders has taken many forms, such as allowing South Flank to hire additional trainers to support women who are new to mining. South Flank has also been allowed to pilot a range of successful innovations. For example, investments have been made to modify machines and equipment so they can be used by people of different body types and sizes. A sociologist has also been hired to work directly with managers to help them foster more positive and inclusive teams. Another innovation is a unique three-day onboarding and site familiarization program which was developed to support new hires. It is delivered by a team of specialists, but also by senior leaders, including the mine&#39;s GM. We interviewed and surveyed the recent hires, and they told us they had never been personally welcomed on their first day of a job by the GM or a senior manager. The new hires said this unique onboarding program made them feel welcomed, a sense of belonging, and excited to begin work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3. Major investments in fostering a welcoming and safe mining camp&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Mining employees often live in residential camps when they are at work. Traditionally, the after-work focus has been on socializing over drinks at the on-site, company-run tavern. South Flank&#39;s leaders deliberately offered alternative ways to socialize and to foster a positive, village-like culture attractive to everyone, especially women. They seem to have succeeded. For example, we were struck by the number of people who smiled and opened doors for each other, which is something we have not seen at other mining operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;BHP has invested heavily in recreational facilities at South Flank, including two gyms, soccer fields, an outdoor pool, a library, a music room, an Indigenous education center on a hill overlooking the mountains, walking and fitness circuits, basketball and squash courts, and even an indoor golf simulator. In addition, there are numerous grassy areas for people to socialize away from the tavern. To encourage new hires to interact with other people, a team organizes daily events such as trivia nights, food festivals, aerobic classes, visiting speakers (eg, professional athletes) and nightly cooking classes in a purpose-built “MasterChef” style kitchen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company has also made major investments in safety systems, particularly since a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/Parliament/commit.nsf/(Report+Lookup+by+Com+ID)/EF1DF1A3F5DF74A848258869000E6B32/$file/20220621%20-Report%20No%202.pdf&quot;>;government inquiry&lt;/a>; was held last year to investigate the high rate of sexual assaults and sexual harassment within the mining industry more broadly (the inquiry research found 36% of women and 10% of men have experienced some form of sexual harassment within the last year). At South Flank, over $100M has been spent on new lighting, CCTV, electronic door locks, and security. Additionally, new policies have been introduced, such as strict limits on daily alcohol consumption (four mid-strength alcoholic drinks).&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Use of science and data-driven approaches to drive change&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;These alcohol limits are an example of scientific research being used to identify evidence-based methods to reduce the risk of sexual harassment and sexual assault. The mine is now working with social scientists to identify other &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/using-people-analytics-to-build-an-equitable-workplace&quot;>;data-driven methods&lt;/a>; to stop exclusionary and harmful behaviors.&amp;nbsp;For example, we were hired to deliver a series of workshops to over 100 supervisors and mid-level leaders. They were interested in the latest research on changing behaviors, particularly the sexist and homophobic language (jokes, banter) which remains pervasive and is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.respectatwork.gov.au/individual/understanding-workplace-sexual-harassment/what-causes-workplace-sexual-harassment&quot;>;key risk factor&lt;/a>; for sexual harassment and assault. In addition, we supported the delivery of a new “Active Bystander” training program that was co-developed with researchers from other universities. This program is being rolled out across all BHP operations. Bystander training gives people an opportunity to practice challenging disrespectful behaviors they observe. Surprisingly, multiple trials have been published on the effectiveness of this type of training in schools, but we have found no published trials conducted in workplaces. South Flank is helping to address this research gap. Along with our colleagues at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behaviourworksaustralia.org/&quot;>;BehaviourWorks&lt;/a>;, we are working with South Flank&#39;s leaders to conduct a world-first trial, in mining, to measure the short and long-term benefits of delivering workplace bystander training.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Recognition that gender equality is hard to achieve and sustain and requires ongoing work&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;South Flank&#39;s leaders have come to recognize that achieving gender equality is about more than achieving a number; it is a process of learning and change that requires continued focus and hard work. This ongoing work is illustrated by their recent efforts to stop the normative sexist and homophobic language that can harm employee well-being and retention. Ending this behavior will require changing the mining industry&#39;s deeply entrenched masculine norms and culture. This culture, itself, is a key factor in why the long-term retention of women has proven to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/why-women-are-leaving-the-mining-industry-and-what-mining-companies-can-do-about-it&quot;>;challenge in mining&lt;/a>;, with women leaving because of lack of inclusion and growth opportunities. There is also an urgent need to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.responsibleminingfoundation.org/app/uploads/EN_Research-Insight_Gender_Feb2022.pdf&quot;>;effective systems&lt;/a>; and processes to support parents who want to return to their frontline jobs at remote mines after having a child. Unless resolved, this emerging problem in mining, and similar industries, will pose a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-15/the-battle-to-keep-women-in-mining/10118930&quot;>;major threat&lt;/a>; to the sustainability of progress on gender equity. More broadly, senior executives and board members will need to be ready to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dewr.gov.au/employing-and-supporting-women-your-organisation&quot;>;redesign business models&lt;/a>; that depend on a workforce that is primarily male and which, traditionally, has not borne family and childcare responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;We must stop blaming women for the lack of progress&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;South Flank&#39;s leaders have crushed myths that women do not want high-paying mining jobs driving trucks, blasting rocks, and fixing heavy machinery. If a remote mine in Western Australia can achieve a 40% female workforce, and over 60% in senior leadership, then we believe this can be done by any business. Importantly, both women and men told us they appreciate the efforts to create a gender-balanced workforce. For example, one female dump truck driver in her early twenties said:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;“At my old mine, there was only myself and one other female on the crew, and I&#39;d get snarky comments and people being rude. But here it is a lot more balanced, people are nicer, and I feel really safe here. [At the other mine] you&#39;d really have to fight for your place. Especially moving up, starting as a greenie, you&#39;d really have to fight to get anywhere. Whereas here, all you have to do is obviously show good work ethic and be a good person and get along with everyone well and then you just find that you move your way up.”&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;A male production supervisor in his fifties similarly said, “it&#39;s a nicer, more friendly, and supportive work environment with all the women now working here.” He then added that he is happy that his 23-year-old daughter is now working at South Flank: “It&#39;s a good environment and she&#39;s adapted really well. So I am happy for her to be in mining.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Flank is a case study that once again demonstrates that progress on gender equality in any organization requires &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/why-sexual-harassment-programs-backfire&quot;>;deep engagement&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/how-to-close-the-gender-gap&quot;>;hard work&lt;/a>; from senior leaders. However, our research has also found that sustainable progress will require significant and ongoing &amp;nbsp;investments to develop ways to &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/getting-serious-about-diversity-enough-already-with-the-business-case&quot;>;meaningfully change&lt;/a>; workplace behaviors and cultures which remain exclusionary to women.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Threads Foreshadows a Big &mdash; and Surprising &mdash; Shift in Social Media]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/threads-foreshadows-a-big-and-surprising-shift-in-social-media]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_13_1426548819_1484622203.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Jasmin Merdan/MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Threads, Meta&amp;#8217;s Twitter competitor, has become the fastest downloaded app in history. One of the reasons for this is because it allows users to port over their profiles and follows from the already popular social media platform Instagram, also owned by Meta &amp;#8212; a feature that may soon extend to open social media protocol Activity Hub. In doing so, Threads suggests that an alternative approach to social media, in which user data is portable, interoperable, and not controlled by the platform, may be going mainstream.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/threads-foreshadows-a-big-and-surprising-shift-in-social-media?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/threads-foreshadows-a-big-and-surprising-shift-in-social-media?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;On July 5, Facebook parent company Meta released &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/&quot;>;Threads&lt;/a>;, a Twitter competitor that drew &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/t/CuZsgfWLyiI/&quot;>;70 million users&lt;/a>; in its first few days, dramatically outpacing other would-be Twitter replacements and becoming the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/threads-hit-100-million-users-in-under-a-week-breaking-chatgpts-record/&quot;>;fastest-growing&amp;nbsp;app&lt;/a>; in history.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A big part of the reason so many users joined so quickly was because it was easy: Threads was built as a sibling to Meta&#39;s established social photo sharing app Instagram, which already had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-26/meta-s-instagram-users-reach-2-billion-closing-in-on-facebook&quot;>;2 billion users&lt;/a>;. This meant that users could port over their Instagram profile information — and, more crucially, the set of accounts they follow. Thus anyone joining Threads could, at least to some degree, transfer over their content preferences and social network directly — and anyone who had already built up a following on Instagram could carry that audience over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was only easy, however, for users who wanted to import their life from Instagram. Threads users whose previous social media focus had been Twitter had to re-build their social connections and audience from scratch. Many people (including both authors of this article) had to spend hours tracking down the people they followed on Twitter in the new environment. And everyone, even those who had previously been well-established on Instagram, had to build up a new content base from scratch.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nevertheless, the launch of Threads signals an important shift: It&#39;s the first mainstream glimpse of what social media based on partially or fully open software protocols — shared social media infrastructure that many different applications can leverage at once — could look like. Protocol-based social media allows users to transfer profiles, content, who they follow, and reputation information flexibly across platforms. While this may seem minor, it represents the transition from an era where users are locked into individual social media platforms to one in which they can move freely across them — a multi-application ecosystem powered by shared infrastructure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be clear, Threads isn&#39;t an open ecosystem at present. But Instagram head Adam Mosseri &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/&quot;>;has said&lt;/a>; that Threads aims to eventually enable access to an open social media protocol called &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks/&quot;>;ActivityPub&lt;/a>; (which powers the decentralized social media platform Mastodon), which would allow users to port over their follow graph and social media identity to a range of other apps. Meanwhile, a number of entrepreneurs are already designing social media products as open protocols from the get-go, and encouraging third-party developers to build various applications on top of them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shift to protocol-based social media will have major implications for both users and companies. If this trend continues, users will increasingly have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/decentralized-identity-on-chain-reputation/&quot;>;unified social media identity&lt;/a>; across different applications, and the flexibility to switch platforms without having to start over each time. For companies, a protocol model would catalyze third-party developer ecosystems to innovate on top of social media content and network architecture, contributing to broader innovation in the space.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Problems of Social Media Walled Gardens&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s top social media applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn are designed as “walled gardens” — self-contained ecosystems that lock users&#39; data inside the platform, and tightly control access. Although a user can export the posts, photos, and other content they&#39;ve created, there&#39;s no easy mechanism to migrate it elsewhere (other than re-uploading it manually, piece by piece). Moreover, there&#39;s typically no way to extract reputation information such as “likes” or network information such as the follow-graph, which means that whenever users join a new platform, they have to re-establish their following and reputation. Power users — those with the most curated content feeds, and/or the biggest audiences — are particularly disincentivized from switching.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of this helps social media platforms entrench their market dominance. Because it&#39;s a pain to move to a competitor, users stick around even when their experience degrades. Platforms don&#39;t always make content curation decisions in their users&#39; best interests, and even when they try to, they don&#39;t always do a good job, as with Twitter&#39;s recent, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/2/16/23603155/elon-musk-twitter-worse-degrading-quality-glitches-superbowl-boost-feed&quot;>;widely&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/twitter-for-you-page-has-been-a-mess-under-elon-musk-1850008544&quot;>;criticized&lt;/a>; feed algorithm changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For people who rely on platforms for their livelihoods, this can create even bigger headaches. Content creators can spend years building an audience and then lose it in an instant for a variety of reasons dictated by the people running the platform. Meanwhile, developers who build businesses leveraging social media platform APIs are also at the whim of platform owners. Walled-garden platforms can choose to change their API pricing, or revoke access entirely — as both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/Twitter-Shuts-Down-Free-API-Access/641818/&quot;>;Twitter&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/new-reddit-api-pricing-strategy-could-mean-big-trouble-for-popular-third-party-apps&quot;>;Reddit&lt;/a>; recently did.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are downstream impacts, as well: With walled gardens, people&#39;s digital identities and social networks end up being disconnected and siloed across different platforms. People often have to focus on one or a few social media environments, which means the content they create may not reach the widest audience possible. Many of our colleagues, for example, have active followings for their business and technology posts on Twitter, but have never had time to build up engagement on LinkedIn, even though people there would probably appreciate their posts, too. When people do cultivate audiences on multiple platforms, they either have to split their content across them, or go through the inefficient process of reposting more or less the same content in each place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;From Platforms to Open Protocols&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Social media based on open protocols, however, could address some of these problems. Making data interoperable across platforms would unlock cross-platform content consumption and reputation formation. It would also open up the potential for developers to remix and experiment with alternative feed algorithms and content delivery modes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Protocols are the software that makes up platforms&#39; inner machinery. They determine functionality, such as what information each user account holds and what types of content users can create, alongside the state, ie, the history of user data and interactions. Users interface with this interior machinery through front-end “application” layers called clients. For example, people interact with Twitter&#39;s backend protocol through a number of different applications, including the Twitter web and mobile clients, as well as clients like TweetDeck and HootSuite. But with Twitter, the platform itself controls access to the protocol; and indeed, it has recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-clients-after-cutting-off-prominent-devs/&quot;>;shut down&lt;/a>; a number of clients that compete with its main in-house apps.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An open protocol approach, on the other hand, puts the core software protocols on public computing infrastructure out in the open — often on blockchains — and records data in a standardized format that can be plugged into other apps. That allows users to link a single social account to many different platforms at once, complete with their followers/connections, and perhaps even the specific content they create and the reactions it receives. It&#39;s a bit like “login with Google,” but without the middleman.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, open protocol-based social media identities become unified and portable. A content creator might use a single protocol to syndicate short content to platforms like Threads and Twitter, photos to a platform like Instagram, and longer-form videos to a platform like YouTube or Twitch — with the “views” and “likes” statistics shared across all these platforms at once. A content consumer, meanwhile, could use a unified, protocol-level follow-graph to stay in touch with their favorite creators on all the social media platforms they visit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This use of open software protocols instead of closed platforms for social media is part of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/what-is-web3&quot;>;broader movement&lt;/a>; in Internet technology called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/why-web3-matters/&quot;>;Web3&lt;/a>;,” which centers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://readwriteown.com/&quot;>;giving users direct control&lt;/a>; of their data and other digital assets, and making those digital assets usable flexibly across different platforms. As one of us (Kominers) &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/decentralized-identity-on-chain-reputation/&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; with koodos labs co-founder Jad Esber and describes further in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593545109&quot;>;forthcoming book&lt;/a>; with web3/marketing expert Steve Kaczynski, this model gives users an opportunity and an incentive to invest in building more complete, unified digital identities. Users can retain their identity and reputation as they move across different digital environments, just like they are used to doing in the physical world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Open protocol systems have clear theoretical advantages for users, developers, and businesses. For one, they allow for more competition by changing the relationship between social media users and platforms. If a given platform&#39;s quality declines — or if a new, better platform enters — then users can easily take their data and audiences with them to a competitor. As one of us (Kominers) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/can-web3-bring-back-competition-to-digital-platforms/&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; with Lightspark Co-Founder and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitsloan.mit.edu/centers-initiatives/cryptoeconomics-lab/welcome-mit-cryptoeconomics-lab&quot;>;MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab&lt;/a>; Founder Christian Catalini, this should hopefully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/can-web3-bring-back-competition-to-digital-platforms/&quot;>;enhance market competition&lt;/a>; and, in particular, encourage clients to compete on quality. But this process only works if the protocol creator credibly commits that the system will be open and accessible on an ongoing basis — typically by building the protocol on decentralized infrastructure, such as a blockchain, where it is not fully controlled by any single entity or individual.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blockchain-based social media protocol Farcaster, for example, manages a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farcaster.xyz/protocol/concepts/identity.html&quot;>;Name Registry&lt;/a>;” that gives each user an ID and username that can be used with any client that works with the Farcaster protocol. These are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, and attached to the user&#39;s personal Ethereum account. These accounts are in the user&#39;s locus of control, and so users can take their Farcaster protocol identities with them to any client in the ecosystem. Third-party developers are empowered (and encouraged) to build a diverse array of clients for different content formats and user segments. In fact, there is already a fledgling ecosystem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://farapps.farcase.xyz/&quot;>;third-party applications&lt;/a>; built on the Farcaster protocol. Non-blockchain based decentralized social media projects like Bluesky and Mastodon are building towards similar open ecosystems and benefits for their users, but with different technical backbones&lt;strong>;.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Threading the Needle&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Ironically, the ease of onboarding onto Threads for existing Instagram users gives a hint of the power of protocol-based social media by highlighting how valuable portable social media identity can be. At the same time, the difficulty of rebuilding Twitter followings on Threads illustrates how far we have to go to get there. And moreover, the quick growth of Threads relative to other Twitter competitors that have been around longer highlights the continued dominance of platform giants such as Meta in the social media space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the Threads news is significant, it&#39;s early days yet. At least for now, Threads is still part of a closed ecosystem controlled by Meta. And decentralized social media protocols have just a sliver of the user base seen on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. But if they do gain traction, they have the potential to become more embedded in our lives than even the current wave of social media applications. A unified digital identity makes it easier to connect it to a wider world of applications. Open-protocol social media encourages developers to experiment with new applications and variations on the technology to meet those users&#39; needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest possible shift here, however, is the rules of the game. Right now, platforms hold onto their dominance by making users feel like they&#39;d be losing something if they walked away. But similar to open-source software, in a world of open-protocol social media the dominant market player is not the platform that manages to most effectively ensnare users, but rather the protocol that &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/network-effects-moats-the-business-of-web3-eWugU00I&quot;>;becomes most embedded and useful&lt;/a>; across different applications. That&#39;s an overall more collaborative outcome that could create significant value for consumers, creators, and developers — and could lead to fast growth if/when user adoption does take off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, to gain widespread adoption, these protocols have to overcome significant hurdles. On top of all the ordinary barriers to entry in social media — people needing to re-establish their social graphs and content networks — there&#39;s a user education challenge. Mainstream social media users are used to the existing, platform-based landscape, and are mostly unfamiliar with the benefits of protocol-based approaches (as well as the blockchain technology many current social media protocols are built on).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Threads launch proves that users can and will develop identities in new social media environments if given sufficient cause and opportunity. And there&#39;s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/03/27/americans-complicated-feelings-about-social-media-in-an-era-of-privacy-concerns/&quot;>;growing&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/articles-reports/2023/04/18/what-do-americans-want-social-media-platform&quot;>;demand&lt;/a>; for social media applications where users have more direct control over their data and experience – owing in part to user frustration with centralized social media platform operators.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ironically, if Threads follows through with their promise to allow users to export and transfer their identities and social graphs to other platforms, this could prove to be a major catalyst for adoption of decentralized social media. But like with existing social media platforms, the biggest drivers of adoption will be killer applications. For Facebook, this was full-network social connection; for Twitter, it was real-time news media. With social media protocols, the most valuable applications will likely be those that leverage the protocol&#39;s interoperability — for example, by making it possible to creators to experiment with different content formats, and then syndicate and link related material across different clients.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whatever the case, with multiple clients feeding into the same protocol, the network feedback loop can be fast: Once someone finds their way to a protocol-based social media environment, they quickly build up an identity that can be used throughout the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A social media future powered by open protocols should lead to more portable digital identities, as well as a panoply of competing applications catering to different user segments. The winning apps should be those that the most users freely choose to move to, unencumbered by switching costs. This both raises the bar for applications and creates an environment in which many of them can flourish in parallel — with users maintaining unified identities and reputations across them. This carries the potential of a more open and transparent social media landscape on the Internet — a place where we increasingly spend more of our lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the meantime, you can find us on Twitter, Threads, and Farcaster.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Acknowledgments: The authors thank Cameron Armstrong, Shai Bernstein,&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;Sonal Chokshi, Kerry Herman, Miles Jennings, Steve Kaczynski, Eddy Lazzarin, Das Narayandas, Tim Sullivan, Mary Sun, Scott Walker, and especially Chris Dixon and Sriram Krishnan for helpful conversations and comments.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Disclosures: &lt;/em>;&lt;i&quot;>;Kominers is a Research Partner at &lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;ahttps://a16zcrypto.com/&quot; href=&quot;https://a16zcrypto.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>;&lt;i&quot;>;a16z crypto&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;i&quot;>;, which reviewed a draft of this article for compliance prior to publication.&amp;nbsp;a16z has invested in several decentralized social media platforms, as well as Twitter&amp;nbsp;(see general a16z disclosures&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;ahttps://a16z.com/disclosures/&quot; href=&quot;https://a16z.com/disclosures/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>;&lt;i&quot;>;here&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;i&quot;>;).

You go into the meeting with a plan for what you&amp;#8217;re going to cover based on the allotted time you&amp;#8217;ve been given. And then, the technology doesn&amp;#8217;t work until 15 minutes into the meeting. Or the decision-maker shows up late, and you&amp;#8217;ve waited to start until they arrive. Or someone (and maybe everyone) in the group runs a few minutes over, and by the time it&amp;#8217;s your turn, those few minutes have compounded and you&amp;#8217;re left rushing to finish. Being an excellent public speaker requires planning as well as flexibility and resilience. Just because you don&amp;#8217;t have as much time as you&amp;#8217;d planned doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you can&amp;#8217;t have as much impact as you intended. This article covers three Plan B&amp;#8217;s that every speaker needs in case time gets cut short.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/nail-your-presentation-even-when-your-time-is-cut-short?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/nail-your-presentation-even-when-your-time-is-cut-short?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As a professional speaker for three decades, I&#39;ve had to deal with my fair share of surprises that could have completely derailed my presentation. Like what?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like speaking during two separate blackouts without lights, AV, or functional toilets. Like facilitating a two-day training session where, in the middle of the first day, all participants got an email letting them know that layoffs were imminent. Like presenting in a glass-enclosed conference room inside the Congo exhibit at the Bronx Zoo, where a gorilla pounded the windows every time I advanced a slide. (I turned off the projector pretty quickly and proceeded anyway.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the most common unpleasant surprises that you&#39;ve likely faced as a public speaker is getting your time cut short. You go into the meeting with a plan for what you&#39;re going to cover based on the allotted time you&#39;ve been given. And then, the technology doesn&#39;t work until 15 minutes into the meeting. Or the decision-maker shows up late, and you&#39;ve waited to start until they arrive. Or someone (and maybe everyone) in the group runs a few minutes over, and by the time it&#39;s your turn, those few minutes have compounded and you&#39;re left rushing to finish.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This can be a lose-lose for both the participants and the presenters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the participants are likely to experience an uneven distribution of content if the first speakers in a group get to take their time but later speakers have their messages truncated. Second, participants may miss the opportunity to ask questions, clarify understanding, and participate in a discussion if a presentation is shortened or accelerated. Participants are also less likely to understand what the speaker is saying if they&#39;re speaking quickly to finish before their time is up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Presenters don&#39;t have it much better. They&#39;re likely to feel pressured for time and frustrated with the situation (or their team members), which doesn&#39;t lend itself to an engaging presentation style. They may miss out on delivering &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/the-best-public-speakers-put-the-audience-first&quot;>;information that&#39;s important to the audience&lt;/a>; in favor of sharing what they really would prefer to talk about. And if they haven&#39;t practiced a shorter version of what they&#39;re planning to say, they may sound unprepared, nervous, and disjointed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way to manage this dynamic in advance is to require everyone to practice their section of the presentation with a timer, and cut down their own presentations to meet their allotted time. This can help prevent the inevitable “time creep” in a group setting. A second step in managing this is to make sure that the host or chair doesn&#39;t over-program the meeting. They should ensure that the event has enough slack to allow for questions, comments, tangents, and even a glitch or two. Third, whoever is running the meeting should be skilled in managing questions, comments, and tangents against the time allotted for the meeting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And another way to deal with all of this is to make sure that everyone participating has a Plan B that they are willing and able to adapt to ASAP. Here are three Plan B&#39;s that every speaker needs in case time gets cut short:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. Come prepared with two versions of your presentation.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Come with the full version of the presentation you planned, and a version that&#39;s 50% of what you&#39;ve planned. Make sure that you have practiced delivering both (just having a shorter deck won&#39;t prepare you to deliver an effective, shorter presentation). As soon as you start to realize that you&#39;re not going to have your full allotted time, revert to your shorter version. You might need to make some quick decisions about whether you still need to cut some content. And plan to let your listeners know that you&#39;ll provide additional context or content in writing after the meeting. Take the advice of English writer Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinhouse.com/murder-your-darlings/&quot;>;coined the phrase&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;“murder your darlings”, which means being willing to cut content you care about objectively, and without sentimentality.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Just hit the headlines.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This means that you have to build your presentation headlines instead of headers. What&#39;s the difference between a header and a headline? A header is a neutral catch-all for what you&#39;re going to talk about in the slide whereas a headline provides the story of the slide right up top. It lets both the speaker and the audience know the bottom line first.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compare these:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slide header: “2023 Economic Outlook”&lt;br>; Slide headline: “2023 Economic Outlook Looks Optimistic”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slide header: “Q2 Sales”&lt;br>; Slide headline: “Q2 Sales Bounce Back after Disappointing Q1”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slide header: “Next Steps”&lt;br>; Slide headline: “Next Steps: Hiring, Onboarding, and Training”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you have a limited amount of time to present your findings, you can deliver an effective (albeit brief) narrative by just covering the headlines of your deck even if you don&#39;t get to explain the details of each slide.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. Don&#39;t apologize, don&#39;t throw your colleagues under the bus, and don&#39;t sulk.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Behave as if this is exactly the version you&#39;d always planned to present. (It is highly likely that your audience won&#39;t know unless you tell them.) As much as you might be tempted to say something like, “If only our tech team had been prepared this morning…” or “Since my colleagues went overtime…,” don&#39;t do it. Stay professional and be collaborative. All of those conversations can happen &lt;em>;after&lt;/em>; the meeting — not during.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, do some &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/managing-your-teams-emotional-dynamic&quot;>;emotional management&lt;/a>; so that you don&#39;t come across to your audience as angry, frustrated, resentful, or resigned. Emotions are contagious, and negative emotions are especially so. Unless you want your audience to feel the tension you feel, take a deep breath or two, and lean into your current reality of how it is rather than how you wished it could be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being an excellent public speaker requires planning as well as flexibility and resilience. Just because you don&#39;t have as much time as you&#39;d planned doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have as much impact as you intended.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 12 Jul 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Simple Power of Communicating with Kindness]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/the-simple-power-of-communicating-with-kindness]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_12_1494065747.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Olena Koliesnik/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In today&amp;#8217;s world a host of issues are eating away at our connections with each other: Lack of focus, high-speed interactions, political polarization seeping into professional interactions, lack of trust. It&amp;#8217;s easy to let daily civilities go by the wayside &amp;#8212; or to approach difficult conversations with anger and ferocity &amp;#8212; but, the author tells us, her experience as a corporate communications executive points to the benefits for leaders who double down on kindness instead. She outlines three tactics that work: Breaking down defensiveness with graciousness, giving credit, and making space.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/the-simple-power-of-communicating-with-kindness?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/the-simple-power-of-communicating-with-kindness?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;I believe that in every interpersonal communication, leaders should err on the side of kindness. This pronouncement is seemingly simple but it takes courage to live — especially now.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We live in a world in which a host of issues are eating away at our connections with each other. Take lack of focus: When was the last time you had a conversation without one of the people involved checking their phone or multitasking? Or speed: We run from one thing to the next without reflecting on the human implications of what we just did.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the challenge becomes harder when you consider that people may not &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to be kind. Of those who felt strongly about a particular social or political issue, only 30% of people said they would help someone who held a different point of view on the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edelman.com/trust/2023/trust-barometer&quot;>;Edelman Trust Barometer survey&lt;/a>;. As a result of political polarization, everything is becoming a political statement (think about masking coming out of the pandemic). Perhaps as a result of these factors, common incivility is &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/frontline-work-when-everyone-is-angry&quot;>;rampant&lt;/a>; in the workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From my four decades of working in government, business, and politics — in communications at the highest corporate levels, currently as executive vice president and chief corporate affairs officer at Pfizer — I&#39;ve found that great leadership is all about connecting with people by making them feel seen and heard. That means standing against all of these trends and impulses and instead practicing what I call “gracious communication.”&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;This article is one in a series on “Creative Resilience: Leading in an Age of Discontinuity,” the theme of the 15th annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/&quot;>;Global Peter Drucker Forum.&lt;/a>; See the conference program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/2023/program/&quot;>;here&lt;/a>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This involves small gestures and an overall demeanor that allow for connection. For a senior leader — as well as any aspiring leader — this kind of communication is important in day-to-day interactions as well as in big, difficult conversations. You&#39;ll find yourself enjoying stronger relationships and a respected leadership presence, as well as more creativity, resilience, and, ultimately, stronger leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are three ways to do it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Break down defensiveness with graciousness. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Walking into an acrimonious situation is when I am at my kindest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I go to a tough environment such as a Senate hearing, or if I am being interrogated by a combative attorney, I always start by saying, “Thank you so much for inviting me here today.” I wear a smile when I say this, and I mean it. It shows that I&#39;m here to listen and contribute, not to stonewall anyone. And that&#39;s disarming: It lightens the mood and opens the ears. At the same time, it takes courage and shows your maturity. That allows for more creative, productive problem-solving.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be clear, I&#39;m not saying that there is no place for showing anger to someone. If they hurt you or your family, for example, anger is an appropriate response. But it&#39;s not the most effective tool for opening minds and moving hearts. Anger shuts the other person down; kindness opens them up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And, as a leader, others are always watching your communications, and if you are known to be someone who blows, you will be isolated from important negative news. An angry or volatile organizational culture makes it less likely that people will &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/make-it-safe-for-employees-to-speak-up-especially-in-risky-times&quot;>;speak up&lt;/a>; about important risks or problems. That makes your organization less able to respond quickly to crises.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Give credit where credit is due.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;People like to be seen and appreciated. Recognizing those who deserve it engenders enthusiasm, hard work, trust, and loyalty. I remember the thank-you cards I received from my bosses years later and I&#39;ve made a practice of writing these for my team and giving them moments of recognition ever since.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Practicing gratitude also spurs my creativity: Reflecting on my interaction with someone after the fact often sparks an idea for another opportunity with them, or another way to continue the conversation. It helps me to slow down long enough for those ideas to emerge.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Giving recognition is as powerful for your peers as it is for those you lead. I sit on an executive committee and every time I see someone in the group recognized (a scientist who won a prestigious award, or a manufacturing person achieved a new safety standard), I circulate it to the rest of the group. I do this because I admire the people I work with, and honestly believe what I&#39;m saying. But I also believe that it makes me, the credit-giver, look good too: It communicates that I have the maturity and self-confidence to appreciate someone else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a surprising move because claiming credit is the big thing in the corporate world these days. Think about humblebragging: the trend in which someone bemoans how many horrible nights they stayed up late to finish an important project (the point for the audience being how important the project was and how big their role on it). Or posting on social media about how blessed or humbled they are to have achieved a huge promotion. It&#39;s endless and nauseating, because the need to claim credit for everything is destructive and counterproductive in the end.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The urge to claim recognition can be particularly strong if someone has just taken credit for your idea or your work. But before you step in to correct the record, think twice. People are observant; they can often see who is doing the work. Staying silent in that moment, rather than rushing to say “No, &lt;em>;I&lt;/em>; did it!” shows a lot about how confident you feel about yourself and can keep the door open for a connection with the other person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the pandemic, for example, my boss and I originated an idea with the other big pharmaceutical firms to create a pledge that we would all abide by certain high safety standards and refrain from cutting corners in our race to a vaccine. You can imagine my surprise when, at a conference in 2022, I heard someone from one of the other firms claiming credit. The hairs went up on the back of my neck, my hands clenched, and for a moment I thought about interrupting the conversation and angrily issuing a correction. But didn&#39;t do it. I realized that if I had claimed my due credit I would have purposefully embarrassed someone else in public, and I would have cast doubt on the whole idea of us all being such good collaborators. I would have looked worse, and it cost me nothing to stay silent instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are situations where you should raise your hand and take a bow, such as when you are leading a team that achieved a stretch goal (in which case, say “we”) or when your company reputation is at stake. In the end, giving credit to others can be more powerful for you than taking it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Give the other party space and clarity.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;No matter what conversation you want to have with someone, don&#39;t catch them off their guard or off their game. Whether it&#39;s an innocuous quick question or a serious piece of bad news, always ask if it&#39;s a good time and try to give them a sense of what you want to discuss.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This gives your counterpart an opportunity to prepare themselves for any surprises or tough news that you need to share, and makes it clear that you are interested in listening to their response. It can also calm them down — they go from not knowing what to expect to understanding the lay of the land. It gives them a roadmap for your ramble.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This can be as simple as reaching out to a colleague and saying “Is now a good time to discuss our fall campaign?” (rather than just FaceTiming them at odd hours, which I used to do). It could be giving some emotional context for news that could be perceived in different ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For big issues this can require a little more preparation: I had something important to talk to my boss about the other week. I told him, “I&#39;d really appreciate it if we could find a few minutes during the offsite to talk about this issue I&#39;m having related to my team,” and sent him a few slides so he would know what it was about and knew to find me when he had 15 minutes, not two.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You won&#39;t always have time to prepare, but there are still ways to give the other person space. If the need to push back on something or deliver bad news comes up in the moment in a conversation, you can say “lLet&#39;s stop right there” and be candid. But if it is a group situation, if possible, wait until the meeting is over and then call them back. Let&#39;s say they said something offensive. Give them a call and say, “You may not know how that landed,” and discuss it from there. Shaming people publicly is not a good idea, but trying to educate others in private is a great idea.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whatever tactics you choose, the idea is not to burden the other person in your conversation, and instead to be outward focused — on the other person, not yourself. However hard that is, especially in today&#39;s polarized and fast-paced world, it pays big dividends toward your relationships, your leadership, and your own well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 12 Jul 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What SCOTUS&rsquo;s Affirmative Action Decision Means for Corporate DEI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/07/what-scotuss-affirmative-action-decision-means-for-corporate-dei]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_12_AnjaSusanj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Anja Sušanj&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;While the Supreme Court&amp;#8217;s recent ruling on affirmative action is focused on government actors and universities, it&amp;#8217;s inevitable that some corporate leaders will use it as a reason to abandon diversity, equity, and inclusion programs they already opposed. However the authors argue that the court has left plenty of room to continue advancing DEI in the workplace. Three common practices will endure even if the law continues to evolve in a conservative direction: 1) practices to counteract bias, such as removing stereotypical language from job descriptions or conducting structured interviews with a standardized list of questions; 2) ambient policies that work to advance overall diversity, such as employee resource groups, mentorship programs, or family-friendly policies; and 3) universal policies, such as increasing psychological safety. These strategies are legally safe because they benefit everyone, but it&amp;#8217;s the people at the margins who stand to benefit most, precisely because they feel most excluded from workplaces without such initiatives.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/what-scotuss-affirmative-action-decision-means-for-corporate-dei?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/what-scotuss-affirmative-action-decision-means-for-corporate-dei?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Prior to the Supreme Court&#39;s recent bombshell decision on affirmative action, some predicted that a ruling to ban the practice would “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/05/31/affirmative-action-scotus-case-could-take-down-diversity-industry-too/&quot;>;take down&lt;/a>;” the diversity industry or deliver a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-06-22/supreme-court-affirmative-action-ruling-jeopardizes-corporate-diversity-too&quot;>;concussive&lt;/a>;” blow to workplace diversity and inclusion efforts. After the court effectively abolished race-conscious college admissions, some voices doubled down. The organization America First Legal — founded by former Trump advisor Stephen Miller — &lt;a href=&quot;https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-puts-woke-corporations-law-firms-and-hospitals-on-notice-all-dei-programs-and-workplace-balancing-based-on-race-national-origin-and-sex-violate-the-law/&quot;>;declared&lt;/a>; that “all DEI programs” were now “illegal.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not so fast. We believe the court has left plenty of room to continue advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We don&#39;t mean this in the most obvious sense, which is that the court&#39;s opinion focused on governmental actors and universities rather than on private employers. When the right case reaches the court, the same justices who just endorsed a “colorblind” approach to higher education could also hold that private employers cannot consider race, sex, or other protected characteristics in workplace decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a ruling would indeed imperil the most aggressive pro-diversity policies. Reserving hiring or promotion slots for underrepresented groups, instructing managers to use race or sex as a “tiebreaker” when choosing between candidates, or setting strict demographic targets tied to manager compensation are all vulnerable to a judicial rebuke.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet diversity and inclusion initiatives extend far beyond the policies that travel under the moniker of affirmative action. Even assuming the law continues to evolve in a conservative direction, we believe at least three varieties of diversity and inclusion work will endure. We call these debiasing work, ambient work, and universal work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many common diversity and inclusion practices involve debiasing the workplace. In a canonical example, several decades ago, women composed only 5% of musicians in the top five orchestras in the United States. As of 2016, they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/What-Works-Gender-Equality-Design/dp/0674089030&quot;>;more than 35%&lt;/a>;. Researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674986565&quot;>;attribute&lt;/a>; this dramatic increase in part to a simple design fix: The orchestras obscured the gender of musicians by requiring them to audition behind a screen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While using a physical screen to improve the hiring process is impractical in most workplaces, many employers &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/7-practical-ways-to-reduce-bias-in-your-hiring-process&quot;>;adopt similar initiatives&lt;/a>; to debias their environments, such as purging stereotypical language from job advertisements, conducting structured interviews with consistent questions, and refining promotion processes to make them more transparent and merit-based. Most unconscious bias training — whatever you think of it — seeks to remove barriers to equal opportunity, so it&#39;s consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66058664&quot;>;the “colorblind” philosophy&lt;/a>; laid out by the six conservative justices in the court&#39;s recent ruling.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, while anti-discrimination law regulates discrete employment decisions, such as hiring and promotion, diversity and inclusion programs are often ambient. In our experience, it&#39;s a rare employer that explicitly tells managers to consider race or gender when choosing between job candidates. Instead, they typically adopt a variety of initiatives to advance workforce diversity overall, such as conducting outreach to diverse colleges, establishing employee resource groups, creating mentorship programs, and implementing family-friendly policies like nursing rooms and flexible work options. Even if a future Supreme Court decision declares that employers can no longer use race or gender to balance their workforce, these broader diversity initiatives involve no such thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Importantly, a disgruntled employee cannot challenge an employer&#39;s diversity policies under the main federal statute regulating employment — Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — merely because they feel frustrated or resentful. Rather, in a typical claim, the employee needs to show that they suffered an “adverse employment action” like being denied a job opportunity, refused a promotion, or fired. Then they need to show that the action was taken because of their race or sex. Simply pointing to the existence of the Black employee network or Women&#39;s History Month celebrations as evidence of discrimination won&#39;t cut it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, instead of interventions targeted at specific demographic groups, many organizations we work with are leaning into universal diversity and inclusion frameworks that lift all boats together. For example, the concept of “allyship” has swept corporate America in recent years, in part because the concept applies to everyone: We all have a mix of advantages and disadvantages, so we can all be allies to each other and receive allyship in return.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other universal frameworks focus on creating work cultures that allow for greater authenticity and self-expression, or that increase employees&#39; “&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety&quot;>;psychological safety&lt;/a>;” to speak up without fear of punishment. These strategies are legally safe because they benefit everybody, including members of historically dominant groups. But it&#39;s people at the margins who stand to benefit most, precisely because they are the ones who feel most excluded from workplaces without such initiatives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court&#39;s colorblind turn is, unfortunately, a symptom of a broader cultural backlash that has put advocates of diversity and inclusion increasingly in a defensive crouch. Three years ago, on the heels of a resurgent Black Lives Matter movement, organizations were clamoring to demonstrate their commitment to social justice. Now, under pressure from activists and politicians on the right, many organizations are watering down their diversity initiatives and using economic conditions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/corporate-diversity-pledges-fizzle-amid-layoffs-gop-backlash&quot;>;lay off&lt;/a>; the professionals who work on them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is perhaps inevitable that some corporate leaders will pounce on this Supreme Court ruling as a reason to abandon programs they already opposed. Yet these three varieties of work — debiasing, ambient, and universal — show that the era of diversity and inclusion is far from over. So long as employers do not use protected characteristics like race and sex when making concrete employment decisions, they are free to promote a more inclusive culture and break down barriers preventing women, people of color, and other marginalized groups from thriving in their workplaces. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catalyst.org/research/why-diversity-and-inclusion-matter/&quot;>;benefits&lt;/a>; of a diverse and inclusive workforce for innovation, productivity, and employee engagement, such initiatives are not just an ideal, they&#39;re a necessity for businesses in the 21st century.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time of rapid demographic and social change, it is more urgent than ever to shape institutions so that everyone — regardless of their identity and background — can belong. That work remains essential and, crucially, legal, even under this activist Supreme Court.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 12 Jul 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
