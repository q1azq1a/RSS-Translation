class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;可以看到这个毫无希望的起点，得出的结论是，以色列对加沙的入侵进展顺利，许多以色列人也持这种观点。毕竟，哈马斯的战斗力已经大幅削弱，而以色列的伤亡却微乎其微。一些人质已被释放，谈判仍在继续，试图释放其余人质。一直以来，都没有发生地区性大火，西岸（两个巴勒斯坦领土中人口较多的一个）或巴勒斯坦裔以色列人之间甚至没有发生太大的骚乱。&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205 &quot;>;.css-1g1r205{字体系列:var(--ds-type-system-serif);字体大小:var(--ds-type-scale-1);行高:var(--ds -type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;代价高昂的进展&lt;/h2 >;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot;

class =&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;认为战争已经成功的观点始于对哈马斯造成的损害。以色列官员声称，他们已经杀死了 13,000 名哈马斯战士，大约是该组织战前人数的一半。一些外国间谍暗示死亡人数较低，可能是三分之一。哈马斯自己在 2 月中旬承认至少有 6,000 人伤亡。虽然很难知道哪个数字是准确的，但损失是真实的。哈马斯的大部分旅都遭到重创。它也失去了指挥官。本周有消息称，其军事部门副领导人马尔万·伊萨 (Marwan Issa) 在 3 月初对加沙的空袭中身亡。军事部门的另一位高级领导人萨利赫·阿鲁里 (Saleh al-Arouri) 一月份在贝鲁特被暗杀。与此同时，以色列在地面入侵中损失了约 250 名士兵，这是 20 世纪 80 年代以来所有战争中损失最多的一次，但远低于许多人对激烈城市战的担忧。&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden_​​__o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80 &quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;

class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;与此同时，以色列已设法释放近一半的人质没有向哈马斯做出任何重大让步。这对于大约 130 名仍然下落不明的家庭来说并不能带来安慰（军方估计，其中可能有四分之一已经死亡）。但这是一个比 10 月 7 日之后许多人预期的结果更好的结果。更重要的是，以色列所做的这一切都没有引发其他巴勒斯坦人的严重暴力，无论是在约旦河西岸还是在以色列境内。它还在北部边境保持了平衡。黎巴嫩什叶派激进组织真主党几乎每天都对以色列发动导弹袭击，但它尚未开辟完整的第二条战线。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;在国内，公众搁置了一年的政治尖刻，团结在旗帜周围。预备役军人按要求报到，去年公众抗议有争议的司法改革最激烈时，一些人曾威胁不这样做，但后来被搁置。袭击发生后组建的跨党派战时内阁已经团结了五个月，尽管其成员之间存在深深的敌意。经济遭受了可预见的收缩，但谢克尔已经弥补了最初的损失。到 2025 年，公共债务占 GDP 的比重将从去年的 60% 上升至预计的 67%，但这仍然是可控的，而且央行拥有 2070 亿美元的外汇储备作为健康缓冲。&lt;/p >;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;许多外国人对战争造成的平民伤亡表示愤怒，但以色列人认为这很正常。此外，愤怒还没有转化为行动。大多数西方亲密盟友，包括美国、英国和德国，甚至没有呼吁永久停火，更不用说对以色列采取任何形式的惩罚行动了。尽管民众对以色列的战争行为感到愤怒，但就连与以色列有外交关系的六个阿拉伯国家除了召回大使之外也没有采取太多行动。以色列人仍然可以搭乘每日从特拉维夫飞往迪拜的航班。&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@媒体（最小宽度：37.5rem）{.css-1m7l96h{float：left;margin-right：var（--ds-grid-gutter）;}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top：0.375rem;} }&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;imgloading=&quot;lazy&quot;width=&quot;608&quot;height=&quot;631&quot;decoding=&quot;async&quot;数据-nimg =“1”样式=“颜色：透明”大小=“300px”srcset =“https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16，质量= 80，格式=自动/内容-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 16w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 32w，https ://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 48w，https://www.economist.com/cdn- cgi/image/width=64，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 64w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96，quality=80 ，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 96w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/ 20240323_FBM970.png 128w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 256w，https://www. economics.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 360w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width =384，质量=80，格式=自动/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 384w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480，质量=80，格式=自动/内容资产/图像/20240323_FBM970.png 480w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600，质量=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 600w， https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 834w，https://www.economist.com/cdn -cgi/image/width=960，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 960w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096，quality= 80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 1096w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images /20240323_FBM970.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBM970.png 1424w&quot;

class=&quot;css- 1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;但是这些都没有考虑更长期的情况。从安全开始。在不对称战争中，伤亡人数并不是衡量成功与否的一个糟糕标准。美国在越南吸取了这个教训，然后又在阿富汗和伊拉克吸取了教训。武装组织未来在加沙废墟中招募新兵似乎不太可能遇到困难。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;当战争结束时，加沙将不再适宜居住。数十万人将无家可归。纽约城市大学和俄勒冈州立大学的研究人员估计，加沙至少 55% 的建筑物遭受了结构性损坏（见地图）。经济已被摧毁：工厂遭到轰炸；小企业被消灭；农作物和牲畜被毁。坦克炸毁了道路，空袭摧毁了电网和供水网络。 &lt;small>;联合国&lt;/small>;估计加沙 76% 的学校已被损坏或摧毁。它的医院状况同样严峻。&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;逃跑风险&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;受过教育的人会尝试在国外开始新的生活。卑微的移民也会试图逃离，乘船前往欧洲碰碰运气。然而，大多数加沙人别无选择，只能忍受。他们将在拥挤的避难所和帐篷城市里徘徊数月，甚至数年，几乎没有工作机会，只能靠援助维持生计。这片飞地的居民大部分是来自现在的以色列的难民后裔，将成为一个巨大的流离失所者营地。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;如果哈马斯试图在战斗结束时从隧道中出来并重申其令状，鉴于其实力减弱和受欢迎程度下降，它很可能会失败，更不用说与以色列发生进一步冲突的可能性了。相反，它可能会回到游击队时代，对以色列军队和被视为合作者的巴勒斯坦人进行攻击。&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden_​​__o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id =&quot;econ-2&quot;

>;穆罕默德·穆斯塔法&lt;/a>;，经济学家，担任总理。他希望这能够向持怀疑态度的西方捐助者表明，他对于改革臭名昭著的腐败的&lt;小>;巴勒斯坦权力机构&lt;/小>;是认真的。但对许多人来说，这种平淡无奇的姿态只是证实了&lt;small>;巴勒斯坦权力机构&lt;/small>;已经变得多么无能和无能。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;美国及其阿拉伯国家盟国希望重新启动数千名无所事事的加沙警察，他们在哈马斯接管之前为&lt;小>;巴勒斯坦权力机构&lt;/小>;工作，此后就得到报酬坐在家里。但以色列政府的右翼分子不喜欢这个想法，而且无论如何，它不太可能奏效。 2007 年，加沙警察未能阻止哈马斯控制该飞地，而且在 17 年后，加沙警察的效力可能也没有提高。权力可能会移交给强大的家族，他们已经在试图控制援助的流动。加沙最终可能不会出现一个正常运转的政府，而是出现军阀。但无论残骸中出现什么，都不可能让以色列人感到安全。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;几十年来，以色列的安全理论一直依赖于三大支柱：威慑、预警、决定性胜利。如果前两次失败（偶尔会失败），以色列就会通过短暂而激烈的战争来恢复威慑力。这些冲突对国内的影响有限。 2014年针对哈马斯的上一场战争是迄今为止持续时间最长的一场战争，以色列平民死亡人数仅为六人；对于巴勒斯坦人来说，这一数字约为 1,500。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;所有三大支柱现已崩溃。哈马斯并没有被阻止进行大胆的袭击。以色列自诩的情报部门失败了。一系列旨在监控加沙边境的高科技设备也是如此。接下来的战争既不短暂也不具有决定性。十月，以色列需要美国的支持，美国向该地区派遣了两个航空母舰群，以阻止真主党和其他武装组织开辟第二条战线。虽然真主党尚未对以色列发动全面攻击，但其行动已足以使北部城镇的 8 万以色列人流离失所。当加沙的战斗结束时，他们将不得不决定是否返回北部，因为他们知道装备比哈马斯强大得多的对手就潜伏在边境另一边。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css -1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;无党派智库以色列民主研究所每月都会询问以色列人是否对“国家安全的未来”持乐观态度。 10 月下旬，其首次战时调查发现 46% 的以色列犹太人充满希望。到 3 月份，这一数字已降至 41%。半年的战争让以色列人感到更不安全，而不是更安全。一名军官表示：“整个以色列的自信心发生了巨大变化，再也不会像以前那样了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden_​​__o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;

class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;内塔尼亚胡先生通过迎合他的观点来加深分歧极右翼联盟伙伴，大概是希望避免提前选举。以本月早些时候议会批准的他的战时预算为例。它对文职部门进行了大幅削减，但为宗教权利保留了一些好处。其中 17 亿谢克尔（4.67 亿美元）用于极端正统派学校，这些学校经常忽视国家课程，另外 2 亿谢克尔用于由极右翼定居者领导的就业部。与此同时，来自南北的以色列流离失所者抱怨政府除了支付酒店账单外几乎没有提供任何帮助。&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;完全混乱&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data -component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;甚至战争本身也变得分裂。以色列人对于是继续战斗以追求内塔尼亚胡承诺的“全面胜利”还是停止战斗以促成人质交易存在分歧。只有 42% 的以色列人希望继续前进，而 47% 的人准备停止（见图 1）。在极右翼内阁成员伊塔马尔·本-格维尔（Itamar Ben-Gvir）的监督下，警察向抗议政府的人质家属喷射高压水枪，同时小心翼翼地对付试图阻止向加沙运送援助的极右翼活动分子。 .&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;imgloading=&quot;lazy&quot;width=&quot;608&quot;height=&quot;745&quot;decoding=&quot;async&quot;数据-nimg =“1”样式=“颜色：透明”大小=“300px”srcset =“https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16，质量= 80，格式=自动/内容-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 16w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 32w，https ://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 48w，https://www.economist.com/cdn- cgi/image/width=64，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 64w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96，quality=80 ，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 96w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/ 20240323_FBC880.png 128w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 256w，https://www. economics.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 360w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width =384，质量=80，格式=自动/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 384w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480，质量=80，格式=自动/内容资产/图像/20240323_FBC880.png 480w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600，质量=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 600w， https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 834w，https://www.economist.com/cdn -cgi/image/width=960，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 960w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096，quality= 80，format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 1096w，https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280，quality=80，format=auto/content-assets/images /20240323_FBC880.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FBC880.png 1424w&quot;

&lt;p data-pata-component =“段落” class =“ CSS-1XM1Z6F E1TT35BK0”>;不仅发生了阿拉伯意见。甚至在战争之前，西方的年轻人比以色列的长者更少。一项民意调查的皮尤研究中心（Pew Research Center）在2022年进行的一项调查发现，只有41％的18至29岁的美国人对以色列有利观点，而69％的人占69％。战争扩大了这一海湾。 YouGov在2月份进行的一项民意调查发现，有20％的美国人超过65岁，但在18至29岁的年轻人中有39％认为以色列是种族隔离国家（见图2）。当盖洛普上个月问美国人是否同情以色列人或巴勒斯坦人时，老人以​​40分的优势选择了以色列，而年轻人选择了巴勒斯坦人，45％至37％。整个大西洋的结果相似：52％的年轻英国人认为以色列的战争是不合理的，而65岁以上的战争是不合理的。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p data-component =“ class” class =“ css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0”>; Netanyahu先生保持权力的时间越长，不可思议的开始就越长，不可能的开始越长，就不太可能在秋天之前掌权。在美国政治中变得合理。扣留给以色列的军事援助或对其施加条件，曾经是仅在政治边缘表达的思想。现在它们已经成为主流。即使是中间派民主党参议员和拜登先生的知己克里斯·库恩斯（Chris Coons）之类的人，也公开讨论了这种观念。摊牌可能会来。拜登先生说，以色列入侵拉法，拉法是加沙的唯一城市，它并没有超越，这将是一条“红线”，因为有很多平民伤亡的可能性。内塔尼亚胡先生平坦地说，以色列部队将在某个时候进入拉法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p data-component =“ paragraph” class =“ css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0”>; biden May May May May back down。到目前为止，他还没有表现出与以色列对抗的胃口。如果唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）接替他担任总统，那么发生冲突的机会将会更少。他袭击了拜登先生和其他民主党人，因为不足以支持以色列（以及任何投票赞成民主党人讨厌以色列及其宗教的犹太人）。尽管如此，在以色列的军事援助中，鲁比孔已经跨越了公开辩论。以总统在2月份给国务院提出的指示，以报告外国政府是否正在用美国武器犯下暴行。目前，这是一项挑选盒子的练习，但是未来的政客可能不会那样使用它。美国还对西岸的暴力以色列定居者实施了制裁。这些可以扩展到像本·吉维尔（Ben-Gvir）这样的迷惑政客。同样，联邦法律对犯下战争犯罪的各州进行军事援助。如果国务院牵连以色列，美国将不得不限制其支持。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p data-component =“ paragraph” class =“ css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0”>;战争也正在恢复旧的政治裂痕。在1990年代和2000年代初期，与巴勒斯坦人的冲突是以色列选民的开创性问题。然后和平营地崩溃了，主题逐渐消失了。在过去的15年中，以色列的选举是对内塔尼亚胡先生的持续统治的全民投票。 2015年，主要反对党的竞选口号是“是我们或他”。下一次选举可能是最后一次这样的全民投票。内塔尼亚胡先生的受欢迎程度已经蒸发，他因腐败而受到审判，在战争之后，他将面临10月7日和战争的调查委员会。很难想象即使是这样的幸存者赢得了另一个术语。&lt;/p>; &lt;p data-component =“ class” class =“ css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0”>;，但内塔尼亚胡先生的退出（如果来的话）不会终止政治上的不同意。为领导人的领导人适度的以色列派恩，他将把政治拖回中心。他们希望某人边缘化极端权利，最终对超正统犹太人的豁免，并加强民主规范。但是，门茨先生似乎不太可能候选人。巴勒斯坦人将回到议程上，这一主题倾向于通过激发选民的恐惧来利用这一主题，并以巨大的政治成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p data-component =“段落” class =“ css-1xm1z6f e1ttt35bk0”>;自10月7日以来，批评家提供了一长串以色列本来可以做不同的事情。它本可以为加沙提供更多的人道主义援助，并通过谈论种族清洗来谴责沙文主义政治家。它可能已经等待报复，然后选择有限的特殊攻击，而不是批发空中轰炸。它可以开放与美国和阿拉伯国家讨论战后的安排。其中一些投诉是有效的。加沙的饥饿既是道德上的失败，又是以色列的战略责任。其他人是幻想的。在将部队扔进城市战之前，很少有军队会从上方避开闪电战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p data-component =“ paragraph” class =“ css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0”>;，但这场战争的最大问题不是其行为，而是它的行为，而是它的可能结果是：它将使以色列更加严重地陷入了使社会扭曲并毒害其外交关系数十年的职业中。当然，以色列不仅要归咎于这种可悲的情况。尽管自1948年以来，这才使他们在巴勒斯坦人之间进行了深深的痛苦。实际上，没有人赢。 &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/21/the-war-gaza-may-topple-hamas-without-making-making-israel-safer<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/2fovf1d1ntgvo80govdr0guj0ngefg</guid><pubDate> Thu, 21 Mar 2024 11:40:52 GMT</pubDate><category>以色列</category></item><item><title>美国经济摆脱了硬着陆</title><description>&lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/样式>;

class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Another layer of insulation has come from fixed-rate lending. Home-buyers, for example, often obtain 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. The average interest on the stock of these is now about 4%, less than before the pandemic and well below the 8% rate on new mortgages last year (see chart 2). That has drawbacks: in order to keep their inexpensive mortgages, people who might otherwise have moved are staying put. But it does mean that many Americans do not feel the full force of higher rates.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Fiscal policy has also added to America&#39;s economic momentum. The government is running a gaping deficit. After narrowing to about 4% in 2022 it was back to 7.5% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; last year, a level typically seen only during wars or recessions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet not all deficits are equally stimulative. Unlike the gusher of spending when covid struck in 2020, last year&#39;s deficit stemmed in part from weak revenues (taxes on capital gains took a hit) and technical factors (high rates reduced the Fed&#39;s payments to the Treasury). Scholars at the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, find that the federal government&#39;s fiscal stance only modestly boosted growth last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet in another way fiscal policy has been an economic engine, and may still be revving up. Three big spending packages passed by Congress (on infrastructure, clean tech and semiconductors) are incentivising private firms and state governments to spend lavishly as well. Construction of factories is booming as makers of electric vehicles and semiconductors expand operations in America: altogether, investment in manufacturing added about 0.4 percentage points to &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; growth last year. Investment in infrastructure has been slower to rise but seems to be climbing now, too, with state and local governments piggybacking on federal funding for highways, power grids, airports and more. “These policies are starting to show up in the data.

Were it not for a similar expansion of supply, all of the spending would have simply translated into more upward pressure on prices. That inflation has instead eased markedly is a sign of growth in America&#39;s productive capacity. At its most basic an economy&#39;s ability to supply goods and services is limited by how many of its people are working and how productive they are. Both of these factors have increased strongly in America of late.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Start with the labour force. America now has about 158m workers, nearly 4% more than at the end of 2019. In part that is because a higher share of working-age adults are employed. Yet by far the biggest driver of the expanded workforce has been immigration. The American-born labour force is a bit smaller than it was on the eve of the pandemic. The foreign-born labour force, in contrast, has swollen by more than 4m, or 16%, since the end of 2019. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;While most of those entering via America&#39;s southern border end up in blue-collar jobs, there has also been an increase in immigrants destined for white-collar work. Student visas have rebounded strongly since the pandemic, with the total last year four times higher than in 2020. That has created a big reservoir of young, educated workers for companies to hire. Looking at data that includes asylum-seekers, Tiffany Wilding of &lt;small>;PIMCO&lt;/small>;, an investment firm, estimates that about 3m immigrants arrived in America last year, up from 1m in pre-pandemic years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even so, expansion of the labour force does not in itself account for the economy&#39;s overall growth. Consider the final quarter of last year: &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; rose by 3.2% at an annual rate but total hours worked increased by just 0.6%. This is only possible thanks to a surge in productivity. Workers in non-farm business were about 2.6% more productive than a year ago, according to official estimates. To be clear, no serious economist thinks such productivity growth is sustainable. Since the end of 2019 labour productivity has grown by 1.6% a year, less than a tenth of a percentage point faster than its pace from 2007 to 2019.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Nonetheless the jump in productivity over the past year is notable. The simplest explanation is that pandemic frictions have disappeared as supply chains have returned to normal, and that this has shown up in the data as an improvement in productivity. Some economists, though, are tempted to conclude that fundamentals may also be changing. One possibility is that increased competition in the labour market is engendering a reallocation of workers to higher-paying firms, which are potentially more productive, according to research by David Autor of &lt;small>;MIT&lt;/small>; and Arindrajit Dube and Annie McGrew of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Julia Coronado of MacroPolicy Perspectives, a research firm, notes that the relative scarcity of workers has also prompted firms to invest in labour-saving technology, at a time when businesses software has been getting better. “It&#39;s possible that like the 1990s we&#39;re in the middle of a stronger productivity cycle, but that this time it is more focused on technology for businesses rather than consumers,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;4 blueprint diagrams explaining ways to improve ecocomy&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: Emile Holmewood&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Can the good times roll on? The factors that have led to America&#39;s strong performance over the past couple of years remain in place to varying degrees. Buffers for businesses and households are, by definition, thinner than two years ago, before the Fed jacked up rates. But the cheap loans that consumers and businesses took out before inflation struck will continue to shield them from higher interest rates for some time to come. Economists with Goldman Sachs, a bank, have calculated that the average rate on corporate debt will rise from 4.2% in 2023 to just 4.5% in 2025. “At some point higher rates will start to bite. But my take is that we may still have a little bit more runway,” says Mr Panday of &lt;small>;S&amp;amp;P&lt;/small>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The government&#39;s investment splurge in manufacturing and infrastructure is far from over. Indeed, as procedures for allocating the money are established, the fiscal stimulus may well accelerate. The Department of Commerce has just started approving big grants for chipmakers, such as a $1.5bn award for GlobalFoundries in February. Meanwhile, more &lt;small>;LNG&lt;/small>; export terminals are coming online, which should lift American energy exports yet higher.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On the supply side, immigration may slow as the political climate turns harsher, but many recent arrivals are still joining the labour market. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in February that the current wave of immigration would, even as it slows, add about 0.2 percentage points to annual &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; growth from 2024 to 2034. As far as productivity goes, it is notoriously difficult to observe in real time but optimists think the improvements may soon become more evident. “This is potentially going to give us a stronger foundation for growth than we had in the last economic cycle,” says Ms Coronado.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Debt-rackin&#39; varmints&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is not all roses. The labour market is showing a few cracks. Hiring has trended down since early 2022. Fewer workers are changing jobs (see chart 4). The main reason that unemployment has remained so low is that lay-offs have been modest. Yet that may be a sign not of confidence, but of concern. Companies may be hoarding workers, afraid to fire them after struggling mightily to hire them. What is more, America&#39;s doughty consumers may at last be losing steam. Delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans soared last year, rising above pre-pandemic levels, according to the New York Fed. “It&#39;s concerning to see that even before the unemployment rate increases,” says Ms Wilding.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FBC778.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The finance industry, too, has some obvious vulnerabilities. Commercial property threatens to blow a hole in loan books, a problem that will be particularly acute for smaller lenders. And many banks, big and small, are sitting on hefty paper losses on their bond-holdings because of the rise in interest rates.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even if these problems prove manageable, America&#39;s success has engendered another difficulty: how to unwind the rate rises of the past two years. No one knows with any certainty what the perfect interest rate is for the economy—the neutral level which is neither a spur to economic activity nor a drag on it. But it is clear that the central bank&#39;s current range for short-term rates of 5.25-5.5%, the highest in more than 20 years, will weigh on growth. The question for the Fed is when to begin to cut, and how quickly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In this sense, declarations that America has achieved a soft landing look premature. It is true that growth has been remarkably resilient and that inflation has softened. But the final stretch of squeezing out inflation may prove arduous given that prices are still rising at an annual pace of about 3%, above the Fed&#39;s 2% target. At the same time, the central bank must start acting soon to bring rates back to a more normal level. Until both are achieved, things could yet go awry. Worriers often focus on a possible resurgence in prices. But the bigger danger may be that the Fed overprescribes its tough medicine. It is in this context that rising consumer debts and slowing labour markets look troubling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Jerome Powell, chairman of the Fed, has said that to deliver the ideal glide path for the economy, the central bank should start reducing rates before inflation hits 2%. The Taylor rule, a formula for gauging the appropriate level of interest rates, suggests that the Fed may be waiting too long. Given that the rule implied, correctly, that the Fed was being slow to raise rates as inflation surged in 2022, Mr Powell might want to pay it more heed now.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;“Higher rates are like termites on the economy,” says Mark Zandi of Moody&#39;s Analytics, a research company. “With each passing day, they dig deeper into the foundations, and at some point a wind is going to blow the building over.” America&#39;s post-pandemic economy has been a marvel, especially in comparison to other countries. But it will not be impervious to high interest rates for ever. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/14/americas-economy-has-escaped-a-hard-landing<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/2mfd5g0uitccmoss9gaal2c1eerf8hu3</guid><pubDate> Thu, 14 Mar 2024 10:57:29 GMT</pubDate><category>美国</category></item><item><title>第三方候选人可能对美国大选具有决定性作用</title><description>&lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration of the Democrat donkey and the Republican elephant on top of holes being cut out from the floor.&quot;

He says he would never tell a third-party candidate not to run, but also seems resigned&amp;nbsp;to the fact that one cannot win in 2024. He certainly cannot bring himself to endorse Mr Biden, whom he calls “Genocide Joe” over his support for Israel. Nonetheless, he says, “The singular goal is to stop the Trumpsters and the fascism that they bring with them.” For a repeated and unrepentant third-party candidate, that almost sounds like reluctance to cast a vote that might help return Mr Trump to the White House.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Land of, say, three&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Americans often say they are unhappy with their limited political options and would like a wider choice. This year two-thirds of them are “tired of seeing the same candidates in presidential elections and want someone new”, according to a poll conducted in January by Ipsos. The same survey showed only a quarter of Americans “satisfied” with the two-party system.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet third-party candidates never win American presidential选举。 The Republicans and Democrats have had a lock on the office since the civil war. No third-party candidate has so much as won a state since George Wallace carried five southern ones with a segregationist platform at the height of the civil-rights movement in 1968. Only two third-party candidates have taken more than 5% of the national vote in the past 50 years: John Anderson, a Republican congressman, who won 6.6% in 1980, and Ross Perot, a Texan businessman, who won 19% in 1992 and 8.4% in 1996.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is not that voters are lying to pollsters about their openness to alternatives. The problem is America&#39;s first-past-the-post electoral system, which makes life much more difficult for smaller parties than a proportional system would. Rational voters must consider not only how much they like a candidate&#39;s policies, but also how likely he or she is to win. Although some voters may cast protest votes for third-party candidates, the vast majority opt for someone who has a real chance to govern. In presidential elections, that is always the Democrat or the Republican.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But even if third parties can&#39;t win the presidency, they can still influence the outcome of an election.&amp;nbsp;Their ability to do so depends on two variables in addition to how many votes they receive: whether they draw support disproportionately from one side and how close the race between the two main parties is.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even when third parties do well, they do not necessarily determine the result. For instance, although Mr Perot won a far higher share of the vote in 1992 than Mr Nader did in 2000 (19% v 3%), it is not clear that he swung the election. He ran as a centrist, and seems to have taken votes in roughly equal measure from both the Republican candidate, George Bush senior, and the Democrat, Bill Clinton. By the same token, in 2016, even though votes for two third-party candidates easily exceeded the winning margins in the handful of swing states that decided the election, the interlopers do not seem to have determined the outcome. That is because most of their supporters would probably not have bothered to vote at all if they had not been on the ballot and because the pair largely cancelled one another out, with one on the left and one on the right.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Nader, in contrast, ran squarely to the left of Mr Gore. Although he doubtless attracted some voters who would not have cast a ballot if he had not been running, most of them would have been natural Gore supporters. What is more, the election was extraordinarily close. Only 0.55% of his backers in Florida would have had to have voted for Mr Gore to change the outcome. Had Mr Nader not been on the ballot, Mr Gore would almost certainly have become president.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Through the populous fight&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A similar upset is possible this year, for several reasons. First, polling suggests the election is likely to be close. &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls/&quot;>;poll tracker&lt;/a>; has Mr Trump ahead of Mr Biden by less than two percentage points, well within the margin of error. Second, there are plenty of third-party candidates in the race. The Green and Libertarian parties are both planning to field a candidate. So might No Labels, a well-funded group trying to counter partisanship in American politics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/12/20/cornel-wests-quixotic-presidential-bid-holds-dangers-for-joe-biden&quot;>;Cornel West&lt;/a>;, a left-wing academic, is running, too. And another independent candidate, Robert Kennedy junior, is polling especially highly, at as much as 18% in some recent soundings.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is hard to know whether Mr Biden or Mr Trump should be more nervous. On the one hand, other factors being equal, the greater uncertainty generated by the presence of third parties in the race should help Mr Biden, as the narrow but consistent underdog. On the other hand, only 23% of Democratic primary voters are enthusiastic about Mr Biden&#39;s candidacy whereas 48% of their Republican counterparts are excited about Mr Trump, according to a recent &lt;i>;New York Times&lt;/i>;/Siena College survey. The Democrats&#39; half-heartedness might mean that Mr Biden&#39;s supporters are more likely to defect to a third party.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;What is more, several of the third-party candidates are clearly left-leaning. Jill Stein, the Green candidate in 2012 and 2016 (when she was accused of depriving the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, of victory), is running again. Jason Call, her campaign manager, insists that her goal is to become president, but acknowledges that even winning 5% nationally would “be a big thing for us in terms of gaining more major party status and getting some federal funds to come along with it for the 2028 election”. She is polling around 2%. So is Mr West, a public intellectual and first-time candidate, who has been attacking Mr Biden as too militarist, too soft on Israel and too close to corporate America, among other failings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Both Mr West&#39;s and Ms Stein&#39;s campaigns insist that if Mr Trump wins the election, the fault will not lie with their candidate, but with Mr Biden. Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright of the West campaign fulminates, “You are managing to contemporaneously piss off your entire base in one election cycle. To go and then blame any electoral damage that comes from that on third parties is disingenuous and irresponsible.” In other words, third parties do not hurt mainstream candidates; bad mainstream candidates create an opening for third parties. What is more, both candidates hope to entice lots of new voters to cast ballots. Roughly a third of those eligible did not turn out last time, after all.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Nonetheless, it is hard to escape the conclusion that, to the extent Mr West&#39;s or Ms Stein&#39;s participation in the race hurts either main candidate, Mr Biden is more likely to suffer. The same cannot be said with certainty of Mr Kennedy, whose appeal seems to be much broader. As the son of Robert Kennedy, a former attorney-general and senator who was assassinated in 1968 while vying for the Democratic nomination for president, he is Democratic royalty. He ran initially in the Democratic primary himself, but pulled out in October, complaining that the competition was stacked in Mr Biden&#39;s favour.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Kennedy&#39;s quixotic views seem more Trump-y than Bidenesque, however. He decries forever wars, vaccine mandates and unaffordable housing. BlackRock, the world&#39;s largest asset manager, and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine&#39;s president, are recurring bogeymen in his stump speech. He speaks highly of Joe Rogan, a right-ish podcast host, and&amp;nbsp;can sound like Mr Trump when decrying the media. Although he is an environmental activist, he has attracted attention in recent years mostly for propagating conspiracy theories about vaccines.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In January &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>;&#39;s regular poll with YouGov&amp;nbsp;found that neither Republicans nor Democrats see Mr Kennedy as one of their own. Only 14% of Democrats consider him a liberal while 34% describe him as a conservative. Yet only 10% of Republicans call him a conservative, while about a third think of him as a liberal.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For the moment, however, Mr Kennedy is more popular with Republicans: 61% view him favourably, compared with just a third of Democrats. Last year he even received an invitation to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a big fixture in the Republican calendar.&amp;nbsp;But that may simply be because he had been making Mr Biden&#39;s life difficult by mounting a primary challenge. Some surrogates for Mr Trump have taken to attacking him since he withdrew from the primary.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even harder to gauge than the effect of Mr Kennedy is that of No Labels, which is due to decide on March 8th whether to field a presidential candidate. For months it has been promising “to ensure Americans have the choice to vote for a presidential ticket that features strong, effective and honest leaders”. In practice, that means conjuring up a bipartisan ticket to challenge the main parties&#39; duopoly. The group has published a “commonsense agenda” with 30 ideas meant to appeal to the political centre.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 4nk67h&quot;>;.css-4nk67h{width:100%;display:block;height:auto;}&lt;/style>;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://infographics.economist.com/2024/20240309_WOC940/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;css-4nk67h e14263u30&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But No Labels seems to be having a hard time finding a standard-bearer. Larry Hogan, a former Republican governor of heavily Democratic Maryland, was a contender but chose to run for the Senate instead. Joe Manchin, who is about to retire as a Democratic senator from heavily Republican West Virginia, has decided against joining the ticket. So has Mrs Haley. Chris Christie, a former Republican governor of New Jersey, has expressed interest, but may have difficulties in some states owing to “sore loser” laws, which bar candidates from running for president after losing a primary. The group seems to have plenty of money (since it is not a political party, it does not have to disclose donations), so could conceivably have an impact. But without a candidate, it is impossible to judge what the impact will be.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;One way to test which of the main candidates is harmed by all the also-rans is by comparing surveys that only feature Mr Trump and Mr Biden with those that also include third-party candidates. In our head-to-head average Mr Biden trails Mr Trump by 1.9 percentage points. When named third-party candidates are included in the polling this gap grows to 4.6% points (see chart 1). Should this effect persist, Mr Biden will struggle to win the election.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;This far out from the voting, however, polls are typically poor predictors of the final result—and that is especially true for third-party candidates. Scarlett Maguire of &lt;small>;JL&lt;/small>; Partners, a polling and research firm, expects Mr Kennedy&#39;s support, in particular, to wilt. The intractable arithmetic of the two-party system presumably becomes harder for voters to ignore as the election looms. At any rate, support for third-party candidates tends to dwindle in the polls or to end up lower than the polls predicted or both (see chart 2). In 2016, for instance, 11% of Americans told pollsters that they would vote for third parties. When push came to shove, however, only 6% did.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;So proudly we railed&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;This year this effect may be especially strong. The widespread dissatisfaction with the choice of Mr Biden or Mr Trump may cause voters to consider other candidates, such as Mr Kennedy. Yet when they actually cast their ballots, the sense that the race has especially high stakes may induce them to stick with one of the main candidates after all. In the five&lt;i>; Economist&lt;/i>;/ YouGov&amp;nbsp;polls conducted since the end of January, the average support for a generic third-party candidate was only 5.7%. And unlike 2016, support for such a candidacy is uniformly low across age, race, education and sex. Voters may dislike both Mr Trump and Mr Biden, but most appear to dislike one a lot more than the other—and are willing to vote for whomever they consider the lesser of two evils.&lt;/p>;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://infographics.economist.com/2024/20240309_WOC328/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;css-4nk67h e14263u30&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;America&#39;s electoral system not only saps support from third-party candidates; it also makes it hard for them to get on the ballot. States have a bewildering assortment of deadlines for the necessary paperwork and require different and sometimes dizzying numbers of signatures of local voters to qualify. So far, Mr Kennedy, for instance, has made it onto the ballot only in Utah, Nevada, New Hampshire and Hawaii, according to his campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Derek Muller of the University of Notre Dame reckons that “it&#39;s not difficult” to get on the ballot in 30 states. The next ten are harder, and the final ten are truly daunting.&amp;nbsp;“Ross Perot was able to do it pretty flawlessly in &#39;92,” he says, but some states have increased the number of signatures needed and moved up deadlines in recent years as the bigger parties try to exclude potential spoilers. The requirements in California, Florida, New York and Texas—which together account for some 28% of the votes in the Electoral College that ultimately decides the election—are among the most onerous.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Winning the backing of an established political party makes gaining access to the ballot easier. Ms Stein, as the Green candidate, was on the ballot in 44 states and the District of Columbia in 2016. Gary Johnson, the nominee of the Libertarian party that year, appeared on the ballot in all 50 states, as well as in &lt;small>;DC&lt;/small>;. Doubtless for that reason, Mr Kennedy is flirting with the Libertarians, despite his interventionist views about economics, among other awkward policy stances. “I feel very comfortable with most of the values of the Libertarian party,” he recently told &lt;small>;CNN&lt;/small>;. The party holds its nominating convention in May. No Labels, for its part, has already secured a line on the ballot in 16 states.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration of a voting booth and three voters behind the red curtains.

In February the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing Mr Kennedy&#39;s campaign and a well-funded group that supports him of breaking the law by co-ordinating efforts to get him on the ballot. In January it hired a communications adviser to campaign against third parties. Some Democratic groups are trying to dig up embarrassing information on third-party candidates, while at least one is urging candidates to drop out of the race in swing states if they do not reach certain polling milestones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Third Way, a centre-left think-tank, is leading a charge against No Labels. “No Labels&#39; fantasy electoral map defies every rule of political physics in order to claim they can win 286 electoral votes,” says a recent memo from the group. “They are putting our democracy at risk if they go forward with this doomed plan that will re-elect Trump.” No Labels, for its part, has filed a complaint with the Justice Department over alleged intimidation from groups like Third Way which, it claims, are trying to keep No Labels off the ballot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;So far Republicans have been less vocal about the threat of third parties, presumably because they see the current lot as helping Mr Trump. But if Mr Kennedy shows signs of peeling away his supporters, Mr Trump will doubtless let rip. Much will depend on whether No Labels decides to put up a candidate and whether it recruits a strong one, on whether Mr Kennedy manages to secure the Libertarian nomination in May and so on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Above all, however, what will determine how important third parties are to the race is how close the competition between the two main candidates gets. If the margins widen in swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, third parties will have been little more than a distraction (or, from the view of the campaigns, a source of unnecessary anxiety). But minor candidates could easily tip the balance in a close election.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;This is not lost on many third-party voters, who are aware of the risks of their decisions. Chris Nelson, 29, attended a recent rally for Mr Kennedy in Charleston, West Virginia. Mr Nelson, a public defender, says he has already decided to support Mr Kennedy despite voting for Mr Trump in the past. Although a Trump victory is nearly guaranteed in West Virginia, he acknowledges that, should Mr Kennedy&#39;s campaign attract enough support, it could help usher Mr Biden into office. That, he says, is just part of the democratic process: “That&#39;s kind of what makes this country great, you know. That&#39;s the risk you take when you go to the ballot box.” &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/07/third-party-candidates-could-tip-americas-presidential-election<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/dm91k21uljlicrcv3nc36l7dhm6tr7ur</guid><pubDate> Thu, 07 Mar 2024 11:51:19 GMT</pubDate><category>美国</category><category>唐纳德·特朗普</category><category>选举</category><category>乔·拜登</category></item><item><title>America&#39;s ten-year-old fentanyl epidemic is still getting worse</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The image of a skull made up of an assortment of pills&quot;

After a decade of horrifying ascent, the administration of President Joe Biden points out, the yearly number of fatal overdoses appears at last to be slowing to a gentle climb (see chart 1). The figure for 2022 was just 5% higher than that of 2021. That still leaves fentanyl and other synthetic opioids like it killing some 75,000 people a year—more than double the figure of 2019. But in the fight against the deadliest narcotic in American history, that is what passes for success.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC591.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The meagre results are not for lack of effort.

Mr Mayorkas, for his part, argues the human toll would be much worse, and the profits of the drug traffickers even bigger, were it not for the administration&#39;s efforts.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Frontier justice&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet at the border itself, the scale of the challenge is clear. Fentanyl is highly concentrated and therefore relatively easy to smuggle. As Juan Gonzalez of the National Security Council points out, the agents are hunting not for narcotics shipped by the tonne, as cocaine is, but for caches of tiny pills. Traffickers can conceal them in any nook or cranny of a lorry or car. They hide them in commercial shipments, stuffed into Coca-Cola bottles, coconut shells, lawn ornaments or car batteries. They pack them into tyres and gear shafts. Small quantities are enough: fentanyl is so potent that it is commonly said that three lorry-loads from Mexico could supply all of America&#39;s demand for a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBC622.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Seizures of fentanyl at the border almost doubled last year (see chart 3). Mr Mayorkas is pleased with this growing haul, but it is hard to know whether it reflects more effective screening or simply higher volumes being trafficked. The &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; that he trumpets is used to determine whether there is anything odd about an &lt;small>;x&lt;/small>;-ray of a vehicle that warrants further investigation. At the beginning of 2023, he says, there were 11 such systems operating at border posts. Now the number is 31, with 26 more being installed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet only about 20% of lorries and less than 5% of cars are &lt;small>;x&lt;/small>;-rayed as they enter America. The administration&amp;nbsp;wants to increase that and send more agents to the border to curb both drug-trafficking and illegal immigration. (The two problems are quite distinct, Mr Mayorkas points out: the vast majority of drugs are intercepted at regular border crossings, not carried into America by undocumented migrants.) But last month Republicans in Congress killed a bipartisan bill that would have beefed up policing of the border, at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Trump seems to have wanted to deprive Mr Biden of any achievements to crow about regarding the border. Attention paid to America&#39;s opioid epidemic rises and falls with the political cycle. Expect to hear a lot more about it as November&#39;s election draws closer. Mr Trump delights in denouncing “border chaos” under Mr Biden. While migration is his main theme, that also includes fentanyl. He first floated the idea of sending American troops to destroy the drug gangs, with or without Mexico&#39;s co-operation, in 2020. The idea has since become doctrine within the Republican Party, along with officially labelling them terrorist organisations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As politicians grandstand, the traffickers adapt. As recently as 2022 more than half of all fentanyl seized at the border was intercepted near San Diego, California. But lately the stretch of the border south of Tucson, Arizona, has become the main transit point. “Everything comes through us,” says an officer in Nogales, Arizona, as he leads his sniffer dog, Rex, around yet another car. Some officers protect themselves with shoe covers, gloves and masks in case they come in contact with fentanyl while searching a vehicle. Others carry naloxone, a medication used to treat overdoses, in case of accidental exposure.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Trip up&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Their caution is warranted. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin. Some people die the first time they take it. It has long been prescribed in small doses as a painkiller. It is easy to make, so when American authorities began to crack down on the abuse of prescription opioids sold by pharmaceutical companies in the 2010s, drug gangs began to peddle fentanyl to addicts cut off from their former supply. Its potency is part of the appeal. AJ Haynes, a former addict in Tucson, recounts her first experience of it: “I tried it, and then lost three days of my life. I was like, &#39;Whoa, that was crazy. I want to do that again.&#39;”&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is hard to overstate how much fentanyl has blighted the country and the speed with which it has done so. In 2013-22 it killed more than a third of a million Americans. Deaths shot up during the covid-19 pandemic and have not diminished since. One reason for its rapid spread is how cheap it is. Ms Haynes first tried it because it was cheaper than heroin. A single dose can cost less than a dollar—and “one pill can kill”, as America&#39;s Drug Enforcement Agency (&lt;small>;DEA&lt;/small>;) puts it in a public-awareness campaign it launched three years ago.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Ms Haynes thinks she is alive only because she never took fentanyl by herself. She tended to smoke it as a powder, often mixed with methamphetamine, another powerful, addictive, synthetic drug whose use is on the rise in America. (The meth helped to keep her awake, so she could “do more fentanyl”.) She often asked strangers to keep an eye on her when she inhaled these concoctions. They would check her heartbeat and, if she seemed to have overdosed, administer naloxone. She overdosed seven times before she managed to escape what she calls fentanyl&#39;s “demonic” grip, with the help of a treatment centre where she now works.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;At first most fentanyl came to America directly from China. In 2019, however, China outlawed the sale of finished fentanyl and two of the chemicals most commonly used to make it. At that point Mexico assumed a critical role in the supply chain, importing different precursor chemicals from China, which are then “cooked” and sent north. Ashley, another former addict now in recovery in Tucson, used to be a partner of the Mexican gangsters who run this business. Having become a regular user first of prescription opioids, then of heroin and finally of fentanyl, she decided to cut out the middleman and go straight to the source: the Sinaloa cartel, a criminal gang based in north-western Mexico which, the &lt;small>;DEA&lt;/small>; believes, is the country&#39;s main fentanyl producer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Ashley used to take cash to Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa state, and other cities in Mexico. She would pay for large amounts of fentanyl, cocaine and meth. “They would deliver it over here to us so that we didn&#39;t have to worry about crossing it through, because it was just too big of an amount and I just wouldn&#39;t take that risk,” she recalls. Eventually the American authorities caught her anyway. In 2022 she was charged with drug-trafficking. She expects to serve 5-10 years in prison.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Hugs and thugs&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The American authorities, naturally, have tried to take the fight to the Sinaloa cartel. But that effort is complicated by the reluctance of Mexico&#39;s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to admit that any fentanyl is made in Mexico, despite ample evidence. (A year ago, for instance, the Mexican army said it had seized over half a million fentanyl pills in a drug lab in Culiacán.) He has lashed out against drug charges that were laid in April by American prosecutors against leaders of the Sinaloa cartel, calling them “abusive, arrogant interference that should not be accepted under any circumstances”. Mr López Obrador&#39;s government has amended a security law to make it harder for foreign narcotics agents to work in Mexico. He advocates the use of “hugs not bullets” to suppress the gangs, meaning that the government should boost help for the poor in order to reduce the allure of crime.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Despite the unhelpful rhetoric from on high, however, Mexico has recently stepped up its efforts to curb fentanyl trafficking. Messrs Blinken and Mayorkas both insist co-operation is close. Last year it enacted strong laws aimed at controlling imports of fentanyl&#39;s precursors. A year ago the Mexican army arrested one of the Sinaloa cartel&#39;s four main bosses, called the “Chapitos” because they are the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the founder of the cartel, who is now in prison in America. In September the captive Chapito, Ovidio Guzmán, was extradited to America. A few days later signs started to appear around Sinaloa warning people not to make fentanyl. They purported to be messages from the remaining Chapitos, and were interpreted as an indication that the cartel,&amp;nbsp;fearing more pressure from the authorities, is trying to distance itself from fentanyl production, on paper at least.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In the back of a shop in Culiacán, a 22-year-old man wearing a black baseball cap explains that he heads one of four local patrol groups who are enforcers for “the bosses” (he won&#39;t specify the Chapitos, but that is what he means). “We have the order to track down people cooking fentanyl without permission.” He reckons his group alone has killed “15 or so”. Those allowed to keep producing are “close to the bosses”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A fentanyl cook who got the message is a 29-year-old man who has clearly made a good living from his trade. He owns a newly built house on the outskirts of Culiacán and several other properties around Sinaloa. He drives a jeep and wears a Boss &lt;small>;T&lt;/small>;-shirt and gold signet-ring. He used to make heroin, but switched to fentanyl three years ago. He got the necessary chemicals via powerful people who had imported them from China or from firms that use the chemicals for more benign purposes as well. He says his profits doubled, but “everything changed” when America promised millions of dollars for information leading to the arrest of the Chapitos. “They threatened me. They said you move or cook a gram and you die and we will take all your property: my house, my ranch, my other properties, my car. So I stopped.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A 50-year-old fentanyl trafficker in Culiacán says he is also out of the business. He entered it two years ago, picking up precursors from airports, the coast and elsewhere and delivering them to others, as well as distributing finished fentanyl pills to mules. He made 15 to 20 such deliveries a month. Now he says he has no work “because of pressure from the &lt;small>;US&lt;/small>; government”.&amp;nbsp;He has started farming corn and wheat on land where he used to grow marijuana and opium poppies.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Spoils of defeat&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A Mexican official shows your correspondent around a warehouse in Culiacán that he says contains at least 2m fentanyl pills seized in police raids. Several confiscated pill-presses stand in the courtyard. Each can make 10,000 pills an hour. Despite the impressive haul, the official laments, stopping the drug trade is impossible. Sinaloa is big and rural. Roads are so bad that it can take five days to reach some parts of the state. Fentanyl cooks have plenty of places to hide and plenty of warning from informants in government that a raid is coming. Meanwhile, it can take “two to three weeks” to unload, disassemble and thoroughly search a single lorry before making it good again, the official says. The army and police help, but his unit is woefully understaffed given the scale of the problem. Even tripling his force would not guarantee success, however: “The &lt;small>;US&lt;/small>; has all the technology and they can&#39;t stop this.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;An American indictment last year said the Sinaloa cartel could turn $800-worth of precursors from China into $640,000 in profits. If the Sinaloa cartel really is reining in fentanyl production (as opposed to being more discreet about it), that will not stop the northward flow of the drug. Instead, American officials in Mexico say, production is simply becoming more diffuse and atomised. The former fentanyl cook says he has been invited to help set up fentanyl labs in Chiapas, a southern state, and Veracruz in the east, as well as Mexico City. “Los Chapitos can&#39;t control all of Mexico. It&#39;s so easy—I could set up a new lab easily,” he explains. “This won&#39;t end unless another drug takes over.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The game of whack-a-mole is being played in China, too 。 As in Mexico, the government&#39;s efforts to fight fentanyl vary in intensity depending on how well it is getting on with America. In 2018 the administration of Donald Trump praised China for making a “wonderful humanitarian gesture” by adopting its ban on fentanyl and the two precursors. It appeared a calculated move: Mr Trump was waging a tariff war against China in an effort to reduce America&#39;s trade deficit. Offering America a seeming gain in the fight against fentanyl appeared aimed, in part, at persuading Mr Trump to go easier on trade.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But the relationship between China and America has remained fraught. Mr Trump&#39;s successor, Mr Biden, has retained Mr Trump&#39;s tariffs and imposed wider curbs on exports of American technology to China. He has sought to strengthen America&#39;s military alliances in Asia in order to counter China&#39;s rise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;China does not seem to consider fentanyl an especially pressing topic 。 It denies it has a fentanyl problem, although officials there are known to have covered up abuse of prescription opioid painkillers. Its leaders claim they are being unfairly blamed for a problem of America&#39;s making. In 2022 China cut off talks with America about fentanyl in response to a visit to Taiwan by the speaker of America&#39;s House of Representatives at the time, Nancy Pelosi.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;American officials are now a bit more cheery. At a meeting with Mr Biden in San Francisco in November, Xi Jinping, China&#39;s leader, agreed that his government would resume talks about fentanyl: the two sides duly met to discuss the problem in January. According to an American official, the Chinese authorities have put chemical firms “on notice” that they will start to crack down on trade in precursors. “A similar notice to industry that China sent out in 2019 led to a drastic reduction in seizures of fentanyl shipments to the United States from China,” the official said. “We&#39;re starting to see reductions in seizures of precursors at some &lt;small>;US&lt;/small>; airports already.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Since the leaders&#39; encounter, China has taken “concrete steps to increase law-enforcement co-operation and restrict the activity of specific chemical companies of concern”, says the White House&#39;s homeland-security adviser, Liz Sherwood-Randall. Mr Blinken says this shift has “the potential to make a real difference in the lives of Americans”. He believes China understands that “to be seen as a responsible actor on the international stage…they have to be responsive to the need, the demand, for their positive engagement, for their leadership” on the fentanyl problem as it grows in other countries.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Chemical imbalance&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But it is still easy to find sellers in China of numerous chemicals that can be used to make fentanyl, meth, ecstasy and other drugs. &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; located several online. On Facebook, “Libby”, purporting to represent a chemical firm in the northern province of Hebei (home to many precursor-making companies), posted a message in January offering N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone, a chemical commonly used in fentanyl production and not specifically banned in China. Payment was required in cryptocurrency ($200 a kilogram); the product would be delivered to the customer&#39;s door, with all customs procedures to be taken care of by the vendor (ie, do not declare this to the authorities in your country). As usual with such offers, a Chinese mobile number was provided for secure communication by WhatsApp.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It will be hard for China to rein in the precursor trade. The country has a vast chemical industry. Companies that make precursors often enjoy the protection of local officials: they create jobs and tax revenue, and are happy to give bribes. The firms are nimble. If the government bans more precursors, they will produce other chemicals that can do the same job but are not yet proscribed. The Americans want China to adopt a “know your customer” regime that would make it incumbent on sellers to ensure their wares—even if not proscribed—are not used by criminals. China insists it is up to importers to make sure chemicals are used legally.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration of a stone cross surrounded by pills&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240302_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Illustration: Pablo Delcan&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Sino-&lt;small>;US&lt;/small>; tensions will make progress even harder. China often snipes at America about fentanyl. In October the Chinese embassy in Mexico said China had played a “significant role in preventing the illegal production, trafficking and abuse” of fentanyl-type substances. It accused America of making “unfounded negative remarks” about China&#39;s role in the crisis, and of “trampling on the spirit of international rule of law”. Mr Xi only agreed to renew talks on the matter after America said it would lift sanctions it had imposed on a Chinese police forensics institute for alleged complicity in human-rights abuses in Xinjiang in China&#39;s far west. “Ultimately we decided that given the steps China was willing to take to cut down on precursor trafficking, it was an appropriate step,” said a State Department spokesman.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even if Sino-American co-operation over fentanyl continues without further interruption, supply chains are always evolving. Recently India has emerged as an alternative source of some chemicals used to make fentanyl. Its regulators may not have the same political gripes as China&#39;s, but they may also not be as efficient. By the same token, some precursors are now flowing from China to Mexico via America itself, since that route is seen to be subject to less scrutiny.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;A world of pain&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In July America launched a “global coalition” to fight synthetic drugs, with such trends in mind. Senior officials from more than 80 countries took part in the first virtual meeting. China was not among the participants. But American officials hope that its view will change as it begins to recognise that this is not just an American problem, but a global one that will probably afflict China, too, sooner or later. “If a country thinks that it is only a transit country and therefore safe from the scourge of fentanyl, it is terribly and tragically mistaken. We have seen transit countries become countries of destination,” says Mr Mayorkas. “Mexico is not suffering as acutely as we are, but it is certainly seeing a rise in fentanyl.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is more likely to be the calculations of drug gangs, rather than users&#39; preferences, that decide how fentanyl and synthetics like it spread. Often users do not even know they are taking such drugs. Dealers may mix them in with others, such as heroin, meth or cocaine, to enhance their potency. Careless mixing can result in “hot spots”—lethal concentrations of fentanyl that a user cannot detect.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution, an American think-tank, notes that it was more than a decade after cocaine had swept America before it eventually reached Europe, too, in the 1990s. That was a result not of changing consumer tastes, but of a decision by Mexico&#39;s cartels to find a new market, she says. Ms Felbab-Brown argues they will do the same again with synthetic opioids.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Europe may seem an especially tempting target at the moment, since a crackdown by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan on the cultivation of opium poppies has reduced the supply of heroin to Europe, and thus left addicts looking for an alternative fix. More generally, drug gangs have an incentive to promote synthetic drugs like fentanyl over ones derived from plants, such as heroin and cocaine, since the former can be made anywhere, and so are not dependent on the rain or the political climate in any particular country.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As it is, fentanyl use is already spreading in Canada, where there were nearly 4,000 opioid deaths in the first half of 2023, up by 5% over the same period a year earlier. Recent autopsies by &lt;small>;NGO&lt;/small>;s in northern Mexico showed that at least a third of bodies that were brought to morgues had traces of fentanyl. Britain has seen a recent spike in deaths tied to a different class of synthetic opioids called nitazenes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;America&#39;s experience should be a cautionary tale for these国家。 In 2022 Mr Biden set out what he called a “unity agenda” in his State of the Union address, saying his first goal was to “beat the opioid epidemic”. Federal spending on drug control has more than doubled since 2008, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Biden administration has also made it easier to access proven treatments for opioid addiction, such as methadone and buprenorphine. Methadone, a milder opioid which reduces symptoms of withdrawal and cravings for stronger ones, could previously only be taken under supervision at a clinic. But a new rule that goes into effect this year will allow patients to take it at home and abolishes a requirement that a recipient must prove they have been addicted to opioids for at least a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The Biden administration has also worked to make it easier to obtain naloxone, the overdose antidote. It can now be sold over-the-counter at pharmacies. Some schools have begun to stock it, too, as fentanyl claims ever more young lives. The ultimate goal, says Rahul Gupta, the Biden administration&#39;s drugs tsar, is to make it part of the standard furniture of public places, much like fire extinguishers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But treatment and prevention programmes depend not just on the federal government, but also on the states and local authorities. Some are alarmingly disengaged. The state of Wyoming, for example, has no opioid treatment programmes that offer methadone.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;State banquet&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;States are starting to receive millions of dollars in settlement money from pharmaceutical companies and distributors who promoted the widespread use of prescription opioid pills in the 1990s and 2000s, getting many Americans hooked. More than $50bn will be disbursed, which could lead to a boom in treatment. The market for such services is projected to grow by about 9% each year through 2030, according to Capstone Partners, a consultancy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Funding for prevention efforts, such as education about drugs in schools, has also nearly doubled since 2008, although it remains a tiny fraction of total counter-narcotics spending. Such programmes have a poor reputation. Studies have concluded that in the 1980s and 1990s the Drug Abuse Resistance Education programme, or &lt;small>;DARE&lt;/small>;—in which police officers visited classrooms and told children to “just say no” to drugs—did not reduce drug use. But it could be different with fentanyl. It is vital to teach young people how much more dangerous it is than anything used before. Promoting the use of fentanyl-test strips, which can tell if the opioid is present in other drugs, would also save lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As sensible as all this is, America still has a long way to go. It has at least 6m opioid addicts. Four out of every ten Americans know someone who has died from an overdose. The epidemic&#39;s seeming plateau is very much welcome, but fentanyl remains one of the deadliest scourges America has ever faced. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/29/americas-ten-year-old-fentanyl-epidemic-is-still-getting-worse<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/bq6qf2ssaklvralti26ku62rbd4i2lge</guid><pubDate> Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:02:21 GMT</pubDate><category>美国</category></item><item><title>没有美国，欧洲能保卫自己吗？</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img fetchpriority=&quot;high&quot;

But as the annual gathering of bigwigs got under way, a series of additional blows fell. First came the death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity&quot;>;Alexei Navalny&lt;/a>;, Russia&#39;s foremost opposition leader, in a Siberian gulag on February 16th. The next day Ukraine&#39;s army withdrew from the town of Avdiivka, handing Mr Putin his first military victory in almost a year. America&#39;s Congress, meanwhile, showed no sign of passing a bill to dispense more military aid to Ukraine, which is starved of ammunition and therefore likely to suffer more setbacks on the battlefield. The auguries could scarcely have been more awful.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The deadlock in Congress reflects the baleful influence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/12/europe-must-hurry-to-defend-itself-against-russia-and-donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>;, whose opposition to aid for Ukraine has cowed Republican lawmakers. It was the spectre of Mr Trump&#39;s potential return to office in November&#39;s presidential election that cast the darkest pall over Munich. A week earlier Mr Trump had explained what he would say to an ally in &lt;small>;nato&lt;/small>; that had not spent as much as the alliance urges on defence and then suffered an invasion: “You&#39;re delinquent?不，我不会保护你。 In fact, I would encourage them [the invaders] to do whatever the hell they want.”&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Combined harms&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Russia&#39;s ever-deepening belligerence, Ukraine&#39;s deteriorating position and Mr Trump&#39;s possible return to the White House have brought Europe to its most dangerous juncture in decades. The question is not just whether America will abandon Ukraine, but whether it might abandon Europe. For Europe to fill the space left by America&#39;s absence would require much more than increased defence spending. It would have to revitalise its arms industry, design a new nuclear umbrella and come up with a new command structure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In Munich the mood was fearful, but determined rather than panicked. American and European officials remain hopeful that more American munitions will eventually get to Ukraine, but they are also making contingencies. On February 17th Petr Pavel, the Czech president, said his country had “found” 800,000 shells that could be shipped within weeks.

If American aid were to evaporate entirely, Ukraine would probably lose, an American official tells &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>;. Mr Pistorius is correct that European arms production is rising fast; the continent should be able to produce shells at an annual rate of 1m-2m late this year, potentially outstripping America. But that may come too late for Ukraine, which needs some 1.5m per year according to Rheinmetall, a European arms manufacturer. A sense of wartime urgency is still lacking. European shell-makers export 40% of their production to non-&lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; countries other than Ukraine; when the European Commission proposed that Ukraine should be prioritised by law, member states refused. The continent&#39;s arms firms complain that their order books remain too thin to warrant big investments in production lines.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A Ukrainian defeat would inflict a psychological blow on the West while emboldening Mr普京。 That does not mean he could take advantage right away. “There is no immediate threat to &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;,” says Admiral Rob Bauer, the head of &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s international military committee. Allies disagree over how long Russia would need to rebuild its forces to a pre-war standard, he says, and the timing depends in part on Western sanctions, but three to seven years is the range “a lot of people talk about”. The direction of travel is clear. “We can expect that within the next decade, &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; will face a Soviet-style mass army,” warned Estonia&#39;s annual intelligence report, published on February 13th. The threat is not just a Russian invasion, but attacks and provocations which might test the limits of Article 5, &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s mutual-defence clause. “It cannot be ruled out that within a three- to five-year period, Russia will test Article 5 and &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s solidarity,” Denmark&#39;s defence minister recently warned. But the concern is less the timing than the prospect of confronting Russia alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Change of station&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Europe has thought about such a moment for years. In 2019 Emmanuel Macron, France&#39;s president, told this newspaper that allies needed to “reassess the reality of what &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; is in the light of the commitment of the United States”. Mr Trump&#39;s first term in office, in which he flirted with withdrawing from &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; and publicly sided with Mr Putin over his own intelligence agencies, served as a catalyst. The idea of European “strategic autonomy”, once pushed only by France, was embraced by other countries. Defence spending, which began rising after Russia&#39;s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, has increased dramatically. That year just three members of &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; met the alliance&#39;s target of spending 2% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; on defence. Last year 11 countries did, ten of them in Europe (see chart 1). This year at least 18 of &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s 28 European members will hit the target. Europe&#39;s total defence spending will reach around $380bn—about the same as Russia&#39;s, after adjusting for Europe&#39;s higher prices.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Those numbers flatter Europe, however. Its defence spending yields disproportionately little combat power, and its armed forces are less than the sum of their parts. The continent is years away from being able to defend itself from attack by a reconstituted Russian force. At last year&#39;s summit, &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; leaders approved their first comprehensive national defence plans since the cold war. &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; officials say those plans require Europe to increase its existing (and unmet) targets for military capability by about a third. That, in turn, means Europe would have to spend around 50% more on defence than today, or about 3% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;. The only European members of &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; that currently reach that level are Poland and Greece, the latter flattered by bloated military pensions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Anyway, more money is not enough. Almost all European armies are struggling to meet their recruitment targets, as is America&#39;s. Moreover the rise in spending after 2014 delivered alarmingly little growth in combat capability. A recent paper by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (&lt;small>;IISS&lt;/small>;), a think-tank in London, found that the number of combat battalions had barely increased since 2015 (France and Germany each added just one) or had even fallen, in Britain by five battalions. At a conference last year, an American general lamented that most European countries could field just one full-strength brigade (a formation of a few thousand troops), if that. Germany&#39;s bold decision to deploy a full brigade to Lithuania, for instance, is likely to stretch its army severely.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even when Europe can produce combat forces, they often lack the things needed to fight effectively for long periods: command-and-control capabilities, such as staff officers trained to run large headquarters; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, such as drones and satellites; logistics capabilities, including airlift; and ammunition to last for longer than a week or so. “The things that European militaries can do, they can do really well,” says Michael Kofman, a military expert, “but they typically can&#39;t do a lot of them, they can&#39;t do them for very long and they&#39;re configured for the initial period of a war that the United States would lead.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Poland is an instructive case. It is the poster boy for European rearmament. It will spend 4% of its &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; on defence this year, and splurges more than half of that money on equipment, far above &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s target of 20%. It is buying huge numbers of tanks, helicopters, howitzers and &lt;small>;HIMARS&lt;/small>; rocket artillery—on the face of it, just what Europe needs. But under the previous government, says Konrad Muzyka, a defence analyst, it did so with little coherent planning and utter neglect of how to crew and sustain the equipment, with personnel numbers falling. Poland&#39;s &lt;small>;HIMARS&lt;/small>; launchers can hit targets 300km away, but its intelligence platforms cannot see that far. It relies on America for that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;One option would be for Europeans to pool their resources. For the past 16 years, for instance, a group of 12 European countries have jointly bought and operated a fleet of three long-range cargo aircraft—essentially a timeshare programme for airlift. In January Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain teamed up to order 1,000 of the missiles used in the Patriot air-defence system, diving down the cost through bulk. The same approach could be taken in other areas, such as reconnaissance satellites.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The hitch is that countries with big defence industries—France, Germany, Italy and Spain—often fail to agree on how contracts should be split among their national arms-makers. There is also a trade-off between plugging holes quickly and building up the continent&#39;s own defence industry. France is irked by a recent German-led scheme, the European Sky Shield Initiative, in which 21 European countries jointly buy air-defence systems, in part because it involves buying American and Israeli launchers alongside German ones. When Olaf Scholz, Germany&#39;s chancellor, recently called for Europe to adopt a “war economy”, Benjamin Haddad, a French lawmaker in Emmanuel Macron&#39;s Renaissance party, retorted, “It&#39;s not by buying American equipment that we&#39;re going to get there.” European arms-makers, he argued, will not hire workers and build production lines if they do not get orders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;These twin challenges—building up military capability and revitalising arms production—are formidable. Europe&#39;s defence industry is less fragmented than many assume, says Jan Joel Andersson of the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; Institute for Security Studies in a recent paper: the continent makes fewer types of fighter jets and airborne radar planes than America, for instance 。 But there are inefficiencies. Countries often have different design priorities. France wants carrier-capable jets and lighter armoured vehicles; Germany prefers longer-range aircraft and heavier tanks. Europe-wide co-operation on tanks has consistently failed, writes Mr Andersson, and an ongoing Franco-German effort is in doubt.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD003.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Illustration: The Economist/Getty Images&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The scale of the required changes raises broader economic, social and political questions. Germany&#39;s military renaissance will be unaffordable without cutting other government spending or junking the country&#39;s “debt brake”, which would require a constitutional amendment. Mr Pistorius says he is convinced that German society backs higher defence expenditure, but acknowledges, “We have to convince people that this might have an impact on other spending.” Thierry Breton, the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; commissioner in charge of defence, has proposed a €100bn ($108bn) defence fund to boost arms production. Kaja Kallas, Estonia&#39;s prime minister, backed by Mr Macron and other leaders, has proposed that the &lt;small>;EU &lt;/small>;fund such defence spending with joint borrowing, as it did the recovery fund it established during the covid-19 pandemic—a controversial idea among the thriftiest member-states.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Europe&#39;s manpower shortages are driving similarly fraught discussions. In December Mr Pistorius said that “in retrospect” Germany had erred in ending compulsory national service in 2011. In January General Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of the British Army, said preparing Western societies for a war footing would be a “whole-of-nation undertaking”, and that Ukraine showed that “regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them”. His remarks prompted a national furore over conscription, though he never used the word. Several western European countries are studying the “total defence” models of Sweden, Finland and other northern European countries, which emphasise civil defence and national preparedness.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot; css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot; https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn -cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality= 80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images /20240224_FBC458.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 96w, https://www .economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/ width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto /content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 384w , https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/ cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality =80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/ images/20240224_FBC458.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 1096w, https:// www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image /width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80 ,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBC458.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt; /span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Perhaps the hardest capability for Europe to replace is the one everyone hopes will never be needed 。 America is committed to using its nuclear weapons to defend European allies. That includes both its “strategic” nuclear forces, those in submarines, silos and bombers, and the smaller, shorter-range “non-strategic” &lt;small>;B61&lt;/small>; gravity bombs stored in bases across Europe, which can be dropped by several European air forces. Those weapons have served as the ultimate guarantee against Russian invasion. Yet an American president who declined to risk American troops to defend a European ally would hardly be likely to risk American cities in a nuclear exchange.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;During Mr Trump&#39;s first spell in office, that fear revived an old debate over how Europe might compensate for the loss of the American umbrella. Britain and France both possess nuclear weapons. But they have only 500 warheads between them, compared with America&#39;s 5,000 and Russia&#39;s nearly 6,000 (see chart 2 ). For advocates of “minimum” deterrence, that makes little difference: they think a few hundred warheads, more than enough to wipe out Moscow and other cities, will dissuade Mr Putin from any reckless adventure. Analysts of a more macabre bent think such lopsided megatonnage, and the disproportionate damage which Britain and France would suffer, give Mr Putin an advantage.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Nuclear posturing&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;This is not just a numerical problem. British nuclear weapons are assigned to &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;, whose Nuclear Planning Group (&lt;small>;NPG&lt;/small>;) shapes policy on how nuclear weapons should be used. The deterrent is operationally independent: Britain can launch as it pleases. But it depends on America for the design of future warheads and draws from a common pool of missiles, which is kept on the other side of the Atlantic. If America were to sever all co-operation, British nuclear forces “would probably have a life expectancy measured in months rather than years”, according to an assessment published ten years ago. In contrast, France&#39;s deterrent is entirely home-grown and more aloof from &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;: uniquely among &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s members, France does not participate in the &lt;small>;NPG&lt;/small>;, though it has long said that its arsenal, “by its existence”, contributes to the alliance&#39;s security.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Within &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;, nuclear issues were long on the “back burner”, says Admiral Bauer. That has changed in the past two years, with more and wider discussions on nuclear planning and deterrence. But &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s plans hinge on American forces; they do not say what should happen if America leaves. The question of how Britain and France might fill that gap is now percolating. On February 13th Christian Lindner, Germany&#39;s finance minister and head of the pro-business Free Democratic Party, called in the &lt;i>;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&lt;/i>;, a German newspaper, for a “rethink” of European nuclear arrangements. “Under what political and financial conditions would Paris and London be prepared to maintain or expand their own strategic capabilities for collective security?”他问。 “And vice versa, what contribution are we willing to make?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Such musings have a long history. In the 1960s America and Europe pondered a “multilateral” nuclear force under joint control. Today, the idea that Britain or France would “share” the decision to use nuclear weapons is a non-starter, writes Bruno Tertrais, a French expert involved in the debate for decades, in a recent paper. Nor is France likely to join the &lt;small>;NPG&lt;/small>; or assign its air-launched nuclear forces to &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;, he says. One option would be for the two countries to affirm more forcefully that their deterrents would, or at least could, protect allies. In 2020 Mr Macron stated that France&#39;s “vital interests”—the issues over which it would contemplate nuclear use—“now have a European dimension” and offered a “strategic dialogue” with allies on this topic, a position he reiterated last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The question is how this would be made credible. In deterrence, the crucial issue is how to make adversaries (and allies) believe that a commitment is real, rather than a cheap diplomatic gesture that would be abandoned when the stakes become apocalyptic. Mr Tertrais proposes a range of options. At the tame end, France could simply promise to consult on nuclear use with its partners, time permitting. More radically, if the American umbrella had gone entirely, France could invite European partners to participate in nuclear operations, such as providing escort aircraft for bombers, joining a task force with the eventual successor to the &lt;i>;Charles de Gaulle &lt;/i>;aircraft-carrier, which can host nukes, or even basing a few missiles in Germany. Such options might ultimately require “a common nuclear planning mechanism”, he says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Lindner&#39;s talk of a European deterrent was largely dismissed by German officials who spoke to &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; in Munich. But the nuclear question, involving as it does the deepest questions of sovereignty, identity and national survival, points to the vacuum that would be left if America abandons Europe. “There will be a European nuclear doctrine, a European deterrent, only when there are vital European interests, considered as such by the Europeans, and understood as such by others,” pronounced François Mitterrand, France&#39;s president, in 1994. “We are far away from there.” Today Europe is closer, but not close enough. The same doubt that drove France to develop its own nuclear forces in the 1950s—would an American president sacrifice New York for Paris?—is replicated within Europe: would Mr Macron risk Toulouse for Tallinn?&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The seemingly dry question of military command and control brings such issues to the fore. &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; is a political and diplomatic body. It is also a formidable bureaucracy that spends €3.3bn annually and operates a complex network of headquarters: a Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (&lt;small>;SHAPE&lt;/small>;) in Belgium, three big joint commands in America, the Netherlands and Italy, and a series of smaller ones below. These are the brains that would run any war with Russia. If Mr Trump withdrew from &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; overnight, Europeans would have to decide how to replace them.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240224_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Illustration: The Economist/AP&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;An “&lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>;-only” option would not work, says Daniel Fiott of the Elcano Royal Institute, a Spanish think-tank. In part that is because the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>;&#39;s own military headquarters is still small, inexperienced and incapable of overseeing high-intensity war. In part it is because this would exclude Britain, Europe&#39;s largest defence spender, as well as other non-&lt;small>;EU NATO&lt;/small>; members such as Canada, Norway and Turkey. An alternative would be for Europeans to inherit the rump &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; structures and keep the alliance alive without America. Whatever institution was chosen, it would have to be filled with skilled officers. Officials at &lt;small>;SHAPE&lt;/small>; acknowledge that much of the serious planning falls on just a few countries. Among Europeans, says Olivier Schmitt, a professor at the Centre for War Studies in Denmark, only “the French, the Brits and maybe the Germans on a good day can send officers able to plan operations at the division and corps level”, precisely those needed in the event of a serious Russian attack.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The question of command is also intrinsically political. Mr Fiott doubts that &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; member states could agree on a figure equivalent to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, the alliance&#39;s top general and, by custom, always an American. That epitomises how American dominance in Europe has suppressed intra-European disputes for decades, as captured in the cold-war quip that &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s purpose was to keep “the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans向下”。 Sophia Besch of the Carnegie Endowment observes caustically that Europeans still defer to America on the biggest questions of European security: “My impression is that Americans often think more strategically about &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; membership for Ukraine than many Europeans.” She sees little hope that Europe will bring bold new ideas to this year&#39;s &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; summit in Washington in July, which will mark the alliance&#39;s 75th anniversary.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is certainly possible that the shock to European security will be less dramatic than feared. Perhaps America will pass an aid package. Perhaps Europe will scrape together enough shells to keep Ukraine solvent. Perhaps, even if Mr Trump wins, he will keep America in &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;, claiming credit for the fact that a majority of its members—and all of those along the eastern front, and thus most in need of protection—are no longer “delinquent”. Some European officials even muse that Mr Trump, who is fond of nuclear weapons, might take drastic steps such as meeting Poland&#39;s demand to be included in nuclear-sharing arrangements. For the moment, there are still intense debates over how far Europe should hedge against American abandonment. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;, has repeatedly warned that the idea is futile. “The European Union cannot defend Europe,” he said on February 14th. “Eighty per cent of &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s defence expenditures come from non-&lt;small>;EU NATO&lt;/small>; allies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Forward-operating haste&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Advocates of European self-sufficiency retort that building up a “European pillar” within &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; serves a triple purpose. It strengthens &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; as long as America remains, shows that Europe is committed to share the burden of collective defence and, if necessary, lays the groundwork in case of a future rupture. Higher defence spending, more arms production and more combat-capable forces will be necessary even if America remains in the alliance and under current war plans. Moreover, even the most Europhile of presidents could be forced to divert forces away from Europe if, for instance, America were to be pulled into a big war in Asia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The difficult questions around command and control, and its implications for political leadership, are probably here to stay. In the worst case of a complete American exit from &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;, a “messy” solution would be needed, says Mr Fiott, perhaps one that would bring Europe&#39;s overlapping institutions into greater alignment. He suggests some radical options, such as giving the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; a seat on the North Atlantic Council, &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>;&#39;s main decision-making body, or even a fusion of the posts of &lt;small>;NATO&lt;/small>; secretary-general and president of the European Commission. Such notions still seem otherworldly. But less so with every passing week. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/18/can-europe-defend-itself-without-america<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/sasu1i83ig3i1gfmf7qvltaos73vb6ek</guid><pubDate> Sun, 18 Feb 2024 18:42:25 GMT</pubDate><category>美国</category></item><item><title>第一辆电动汽车。接下来，电力工厂？</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration of a large chimney with an electrical plug dangling out of it&quot;

As the world&#39;s biggest chemicals firm, with operations in more than 90 countries, it makes a lot of them. When those molecules contain carbon atoms (and a great many do—they are a wonderfully versatile resource) those carbon atoms tend to come from fossil fuels. When their manufacture requires high temperatures, which is also often the case, that heat comes from burning fossil fuels. Until recently &lt;small>;BASF&lt;/small>;&#39;s massive plant in Ludwigshafen in Germany accounted for 4% of the country&#39;s entire consumption of natural gas.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Conventional wisdom has it that such a firm cannot really hope to lower very much the number of carbon-dioxide molecules it creates in the course of its business. The path to decarbonisation will come instead from gathering up those molecules and disposing of them underground, a process known as carbon capture and storage (&lt;small>;CCS&lt;/small>;). The same conventional wisdom holds that if &lt;small>;BASF&lt;/small>; were to swear off burning molecules of gas to create heat, the obvious green alternative would be to burn hydrogen molecules instead. Those molecules would have to be manufactured, too, in an energy-intensive process.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;That is why the recent declaration by Martin Brudermüller, the boss of &lt;small>;BASF&lt;/small>;, that “the decarbonisation of energy-intensive industries can only be achieved through electrification” sounds, to many ears, like heresy. Electricity is for houses and light bulbs and maybe even for cars, but not for heavy industries built around burning heroic quantities of fossil fuel. Yet Dr Brudermüller is not alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;BASF&lt;/small>; has joined a consortium including &lt;small>;SABIC&lt;/small>;, a Saudi chemicals firm, and Linde, a European engineering firm, to develop an electric furnace that can generate heat intense enough for the chemical reactions that are their bread and butter. These firms are not the only recent converts to the electrification of industry. On February 8th Rio Tinto and &lt;small>;BHP&lt;/small>;, both gargantuan mining firms, announced a joint effort to build Australia&#39;s first electric smelter for iron ore. Fortescue, another mining giant, is introducing all-electric excavators and mining lorries, while Spain&#39;s Roca Group recently unveiled the first electric industrial tunnel kiln for ceramics. Such innovations offer a new path to slowing global warming which may in many cases prove quicker and easier than approaches based on &lt;small>;CCS&lt;/small>; and hydrogen.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Industrial fail&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;According to the International Energy Agency (&lt;small>;IEA&lt;/small>;), a research body, industry consumes a third of all global energy, with the generation of heat accounting for three-quarters of that. A staggering 90% of that heat is made by burning fossil fuels. All this makes industry a bigger source of greenhouse-gas emissions than power generation or transport. What is more, whereas carbon-dioxide emissions from power generation appear to have peaked and, if electric vehicles continue to proliferate, emissions from transport may soon stop growing, too, industrial emissions are projected to keep growing indefinitely (see chart 1). &lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC423.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Aware that this is impossible to square with their commitments to slash emissions, governments in advanced economies have showered subsidies on hydrogen and &lt;small>;CCS&lt;/small>; as the technologies most likely to help decarbonise industry. Both, however, have so far disappointed. Electrification, meanwhile, had long been dismissed for two reasons. First, it was argued, the very high temperatures and steam required by heavy industry would be difficult or at least uneconomic to produce with electricity. Second, the standard ways of making cement and steel require carbon as an input, which means emitting carbon dioxide is unavoidable even if clean electricity were to replace the burning of fossil fuels.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet McKinsey, a consultancy, predicts that 44% of the decarbonisation it foresees in Europe by 2050, should the &lt;small>;EU &lt;/small>;stick to its net-zero targets, will come from electrification, more than double the share of hydrogen and&lt;small>; CCS &lt;/small>;combined. Why is it so optimistic about an unheralded technology?&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Electrification is suddenly getting a second look for several reasons, argues Jeffrey Rissman in a new book: “Zero-Carbon Industry”. Most obviously, green electricity has become much cheaper and more widely available thanks to the remarkable decline in the cost of wind and solar power. Another factor is growing wariness of reliance on natural gas, thanks to the global price shock that followed Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. Supplies of gas ran so low in Germany, for example, that the government considered rationing it for industrial users like &lt;small>;BASF&lt;/small>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But the best reason for reconsideration is innovation. Making things hot with electricity is not that hard; think of an electric kettle. Such technologies can scale: if you want ten times as much boiling water, get ten kettles or one bigger one. But if you want to get to 1,000°C instead of 100°C, until recently there were few electric options. That is now changing.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Electric avenue&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For temperatures of up to 200°C, the technology attracting most attention is not the electric kettle but the industrial heat pump. Heat pumps, like refrigerators, move heat from one place to another. In a fridge the heat is removed from the inside (keeping the contents cooler) and dumped outside (making the kitchen a little warmer). Heat pumps, which are becoming increasingly common for domestic heating, take heat from outside and move it inside. Because the amount of energy needed to move heat this way is lower than the amount needed to heat things up directly, this can lead to big energy savings. And as the technology improves and sales increase, prices are falling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some companies are betting that what works in the home can work in the factory ， 也。 One such is AtmosZero, a startup that aims to reduce emissions at New Belgium Brewing, an American beermaker. AtmosZero is installing a heat pump that will soon replace one of the gas-fired boilers at New Belgium&#39;s brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado. Like most industrial firms over the past 150 years, New Belgium burns fossil fuel to produce steam, which in its case then heats the ingredients required to make beer. AtmosZero&#39;s heat pump will allow it to produce that steam without any burning. Since the electricity used to run the pump will be renewable in the future, that eliminates most greenhouse-gas emissions from the process. It is also more efficient, consuming less energy overall. And because the heat pump transfers warmth to water, just as in a conventional boiler, the equipment can be slotted into New Belgium&#39;s existing factory, without the need for a complete overhaul.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBC408.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Such heat pumps would allow a vast array of industrial processes that require heat of less than 200°C to be electrified, replacing fossil-fuelled dryers, stills, ovens and boilers. Using electricity to run a heat pump can be several times more efficient than using natural gas to heat a boiler. Using hydrogen, in contrast, is less efficient, because making hydrogen by splitting water molecules through hydrolysis powered by green electricity, although emission-free, involves a loss of at least 20% of the energy you started with (see chart 2).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some industrial heat pumps are in use in Europe and Japan, thanks both to subsidies and to a relatively high ratio of gas prices to electricity prices. Kobe Steel, a big Japanese industrial firm, sells commercial heat pumps capable of producing high-pressure steam at 165°C very efficiently. Heaten, a Norwegian startup boasting investment from the venture arm of Shell, a British oil giant, has developed a durable, low-maintenance heat-pump that can harness waste industrial heat to reach temperatures of up to 200°C. That makes it attractive for industries from pharmaceuticals to textiles that need middling heat.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even in developing countries in Asia, electrification of relatively low-heat industries is making headway, despite the region&#39;s abundance of cheap coal and lack of subsidies, which makes it harder for heat pumps and the like to compete. &lt;small>;RMI&lt;/small>;, a think-tank, calculates that some four-fifths of the increase in industrial electrification globally since 2014 has taken place in Chinese light industries. The &lt;small>;IEA&lt;/small>; predicts that the share of heat used in industry that is generated with electricity will rise from 4% in 2022 to almost 11% in 2028. China will account for almost half of that growth, boosting its use of renewable electricity to generate industrial heat more than five-fold.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In America, electrified solutions are making inroads even though natural gas is comparatively cheap 。 A study published in January by the Renewable Thermal Collaborative (&lt;small>;RTC&lt;/small>;), an industry consortium, finds it costs no more to run a heat pump than a gas boiler when trying to attain temperatures below 130°C. That would make heat pumps competitive for 29% of industrial demand for heat, without any subsidy or technological improvements. The &lt;small>;RTC&lt;/small>; expects heat pumps for temperatures of up to 200°C to become competitive by 2030. Harald Bauer of McKinsey expects that, in time, heat pumps will be able to reach temperatures of 500°C. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For the time being, however, higher temperatures require different technology. “You are looking at the future of industrial energy infrastructure right here!” declares John O&#39;Donnell, the head of Rondo Energy, a startup developing “thermal storage”. At first glance, the future does not seem that remarkable: the object of his enthusiasm is a big metal box.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It mainly contains bricks. Wires use electricity to heat the bricks, much as a toaster does bread, to temperatures over 1,000°C. The bricks, helped by extremely effective insulation, can then retain heat for days with only minimal losses. When it is needed, the heat can be released in controlled doses at variable temperatures. Air is blown through channels in the bricks, transferring heat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Rondo&#39;s thermal batteries are cheaper to manufacture than electric ones that require cobalt or lithium. The heat stored is intense enough to power a lot of heavy industry. As with AtmosZero&#39;s heat pumps, they can be slotted into existing factories without a complete redesign. And since each battery is so efficient, it can consume electricity to heat the bricks when power is cheapest but dispense heat any time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The box is generating lots of enthusiasm. Rondo recently raised $60m in financing from the venture-capital arms of such corporate titans as Microsoft, a software colossus, Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, and Rio Tinto. It counts various luminaries of tech investing among its backers. After a widely viewed &lt;small>;TED&lt;/small>; talk and a recent lecture to the great and the good at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr O&#39;Donnell chuckles, he is known as “the brick guy”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr O&#39;Donnell is planning a big global expansion. With the help of Thailand&#39;s Siam Cement Group, an investor with plenty of experience making bricks, Rondo hopes to manufacture enough boxes each year to store 90&lt;small>;GW&lt;/small>;h of electricity—double the capacity of Tesla&#39;s “gigafactory” for batteries in Nevada.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Other companies are developing variations of these “rocks in a box”. Brenmiller, an Israeli firm funded in part by the European Investment Bank, uses volcanic rock as a storage medium. Antora, a Californian startup, uses big cubes of solid carbon to store heat as intense as 1,800°C. Boston&#39;s Fourth Power uses molten tin flowing through a system of graphite bricks (and graphite plumbing) to provide storage at 2,400°C. Because the tin glows white hot, specialised photovoltaic cells inside the system mean that energy can be withdrawn in the form of electricity as well as heat. In areas with variable power prices, it can run at a profit simply by storing heat when power is cheap and dispensing electricity when the price rises. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The hardest industrial processes to electrify are those that require intense heat around the clock, especially if they use fossil fuels not only to generate heat but also to provide some sort of chemical necessity—such as the carbon used in steelmaking. This is the most experimental end of the spectrum of electrifying industry, but also potentially the most rewarding, since steel, chemicals and cement together account for more than half of industrial heat and thus for a similar proportion of industrial emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Several well-funded startups are pursuing radical innovations in aspects of steelmaking, one of the world&#39;s most polluting industries. Electra, which is backed by Amazon and &lt;small>;BHP&lt;/small>; among others, has found a way to make pure iron in a fire-free furnace. A picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s Terminator—who met a molten end in a steelworks—glares down at researchers at its laboratory in Colorado as they dissolve iron ore in a chemical cocktail and zap it with electricity. This “electrowinning” technique produces pure sheets of iron without using any coking coal or fossil fuels and so emitting hardly any greenhouse gases. The firm is chasing rivals including &lt;small>;SSAB&lt;/small>;, from Sweden, which plans to commercialise green steel by 2026.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration of the aerial view of an Oil refinery plant with power extension cords making up some of the buildings&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_BBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: Ricardo Tomás&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A more tried and tested method of reducing the carbon emissions from steelmaking replaces blast furnaces with electric-arc furnaces. These typically use electricity to melt and recycle scrap metal, rather than making steel from scratch using iron ore and coking coal. That makes the most sense in places with a carbon price, plenty of scrap and relatively stable demand for steel—rich countries, in other words. In January Tata Steel announced it would shut down blast furnaces and shift to electrified steelmaking in Britain. Wood Mackenzie, a research firm, predicts investment of $130bn in electric-arc furnaces in the coming years. That would allow low-emission steel production, currently 28% of global output, to rise to 50% by 2050.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Cement is another tricky industry to decarbonise because, like steelmaking, its emissions come from the chemical reactions involved, as well as from burning fossil fuels to generate heat. Sublime Systems has found a way to obtain the necessary chemicals without emissions at room temperature, using electrolysis—a process in which chemical reactions are stimulated by running an electric current through a solution. “We are basically replacing the kiln,” explains Leah Ellis, the firm&#39;s co-founder. Investors including Siam Cement poured in $40m last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The third giant, sooty industry is chemicals. One radical form of electrification involves feeding chemical precursors into a super-speedy rotor, spinning at more than 20,000 revolutions a minute. Coolbrook, a Finnish firm, is pioneering this sort of “roto-dynamic reactor”. It is backed by Braskem, a Brazilian firm, Cemex, a Mexican one and &lt;small>;SABIC,&lt;/small>; a Saudi one. In December it announced it had used this technique to crack (break down) naphtha, a common process for the industry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some chemicals firms are also looking at nuclear power as a source of electricity and heat. Dow, an American one, plans to build four small modular reactors made by &lt;small>;X&lt;/small>;-energy, a startup, at a plant in Texas. These will replace gas-fired boilers that currently provide electricity and steam.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Amping up&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even if such technologies work as advertised, electrifying industry will take time. Frederic Godemel of Schneider Electric, a big French manufacturer of industrial equipment, reckons existing technologies can in theory electrify 30% to 50% of heavy industry. In practice, however, he thinks only 10% is electrified now. That is because, even when new electrical kit is competitive over the long run with existing equipment, factory bosses often resist switching because it involves high upfront costs, disruptive stoppages, training on the new gear and so on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Carbon pricing or other incentives to cut emissions would obviously help. So do technologies that minimise the disruption. Addison Stark, the chief executive of AtmosZero, has explained that his firm explicitly set out to overcome managers&#39; objections by designing its electric boiler to slot into existing factories easily and so reduce the hassles of installation. “Steam powered the first Industrial Revolution,” he declares, “and decarbonised steam will power the next one.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;One indication that electrification may live up to its promise is the interest shown by oil and gas companies, whose products the technology is intended to supplant. Equinor, Norway&#39;s state-owned oil firm, has long been electrifying its offshore rigs to reduce the emissions involved in pumping for oil. Its most efficient offshore operations emit less than 1kg of carbon dioxide for every barrel of oil produced (or for the equivalent amount of gas) compared with a global average of 15kg a barrel. Oil firms drilling in America&#39;s Permian basin, under pressure from regulators to cut emissions, are spending billions to replace conventional equipment prone to leaking methane (a potent greenhouse gas) with electric alternatives. If even the natural enemies of electrification can see its worth, its prospects must be decent. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;i>;For more coverage of climate change, sign up for&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-climate-issue&quot;

Conferences bring together national conservative notables from around the world. At first glance, these powwows seem rather forced: the main thing Mr Orban, Mr Trump and Giorgia Meloni, Italy&#39;s prime minister, have in common is a tendency to rail against wokery, immigration and international institutions.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBC414.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But just because the networking is orchestrated rather than organic does not make it meaningless. At the level of pure political power, the movement has been doing extraordinarily well. The Republican Party has been captured by Donald Trump and his merry band of America Firsters. All over Europe, national conservative parties are on the rise (see chart).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Ms Meloni, who leads the Brothers of Italy, a party descended from admirers of Mussolini, took power in Italy in 2022. Of the European Union&#39;s five most populous countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland) four have hard-right parties in government or polling at 20% or more (Spain is the exception). Right-wing populists that were once excluded from governing coalitions, such as the Sweden Democrats and the Finns Party, have become too popular to sideline. Coalition negotiations in the Netherlands could yet install Geert Wilders, a national conservative firebrand, as prime minister. Another, Marine Le Pen, is leading in early polls for France&#39;s next presidential election, to be held in 2027.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;This new form of conservatism marks a radical departure from the sort that prevailed in the era of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Instead of sunny optimism and a view of America as a “shining city on a hill”, as Reagan had it, it sees decline and “American carnage”, as Mr Trump puts it. In place of muscular internationalism is a profound scepticism of foreign wars and multilateral organisations. Its economic policy is much more aligned with the left&#39;s style of thinking: sceptical of big business, willing to accept a large welfare state, concerned with working-class hardship and keen to preserve domestic industry and jobs through protectionism.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;The time is right&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Proponents of national conservatism argue that elections this year will cement it as the West&#39;s dominant right-wing ideology, dispelling any notion that it is simply a flash in the pan. “Just like in June 2016 when the Brexit vote shadowed Trump&#39;s November victory, I think you&#39;re going to see the European parliamentary elections in June of this year foreshadow a big sweeping victory for the populist movement in the United States,” says Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr Trump who has spent years trying to light populist fires. “President Trump is our leader in this movement, but this movement has got permanency to it. Now it&#39;s in the process of building institutions. It&#39;s not going away. It&#39;s only getting more powerful and bigger.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Several concerns distinguish national conservatism from the “default liberalism of neocons and libertarians”, says Yoram Hazony, an Israeli-American who runs a series of conferences called “NatCon” that aims to bring the movement around the world together: “immigration, hostility to what we could call wars of expansion…and the question: has the free market damaged the social fabric of the country?” In addition, “An awful lot of nationalists genuinely feel there is something like a neo-Marxist takeover of the educational institutions and the bureaucracies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In his book, “The Virtue of Nationalism”, Mr Hazony takes issue with foundational tracts of liberalism by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Locke, whose “political theory summoned into being a dream-world, a utopian vision, in which the political institutions of the Jewish and Christian world—the national state, community, family and religious tradition—appear to have no reason to exist.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Another influential thinker is Patrick Deneen of the University of Notre Dame, who argues that the current elite should be replaced with “a better aristocracy brought about by a muscular populism” who will use state power to advance the “common good”—at least as he understands it. In a book published in 2023, “Regime Change”, Mr Deneen decrees this common good to be “integration”, about which he is simultaneously verbose and vague, but which seems to mean, among other things, reuniting church and state.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Right mind&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;These intellectuals and like-minded politicians are actively forging ties. Past attendees at Mr Hazony&#39;s “NatCon” gatherings include Mr Orban, Ms Meloni and prominent figures from America&#39;s new right, including Ron DeSantis, Florida&#39;s governor, and Josh Hawley and JD Vance, both senators. In Washington, established conservative think-tanks such as the Heritage Foundation have been overhauled in the national conservative manner. “It is national conservatism—and not the corporatist, secular, neoliberal establishment—that bears the standard of Thatcherism and Reaganism in the 21st century,” declared Kevin Roberts, the president of Heritage, at a speech at NatCon in London in May.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On February 13th one of the architects of Heritage&#39;s Project 2025, a detailed plan to defang the deep state in a second Trump presidency, arrived in Budapest to present his findings at an event hosted by a state-sponsored think-tank. &lt;small>;CPAC&lt;/small>;, an annual meeting of the American right, invited Mr Orban to Dallas to give a speech in 2022. (“The globalists can all go to hell; I have come to Texas,” Mr Orban exulted.) &lt;small>;CPAC &lt;/small>;has begun holding annual conferences in Hungary, too, co-sponsored with the Centre for Fundamental Rights, a think-tank which receives government funding, albeit indirectly. Mr Wilders is expected to speak at the conference this year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In Hungary national conservatism is a state-led project. In 2020 the Hungarian parliament donated shares in state-owned companies worth $1.7bn to the Mathias Corvinus Collegium (&lt;small>;MCC&lt;/small>;), which educates talented young Hungarians at little cost, but with a distinct nationalist slant. As a share of Hungarian &lt;small>;gdp&lt;/small>;, the donation &lt;small>; &lt;/small>;was bigger than the combined endowments of Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Princeton are, relative to the American economy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Kim Lane Scheppele of Princeton University considers &lt;small>;MCC &lt;/small>;“a boot camp for Orban” that is “expanding its training programme to include right-wing allies from other states”. Its leadership denies that it is a tool of indoctrination. “The main purpose is to find the most gifted, most talented people,” says Zoltan Szalai, the director-general, who is also editor-in-chief of a pro-government weekly magazine called &lt;i>;Mandiner&lt;/i>;. Mr Orban, the prime minister&#39;s political director, is chairman of the board.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;MCC &lt;/small>;has branches in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. It has opened a centre in Brussels that advocates a Europe of “sovereign states” and “strong borders”. It is “against the culture war” and “unshackled from environmentalism”. It has also set up outposts in Berlin and Vienna and plans to do so in Britain, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The Hungarian government also funds conservative think-坦克。 It channels money to a foundation which in turn distributes it to think-tanks like the Centre for Fundamental Rights, the co-sponsor of &lt;small>;CPAC &lt;/small>;Hungary, and the Danube Institute, which gives fellowships to foreign conservative intellectuals. The same foundation pays for two English-language publications, the &lt;i>;European Conservative&lt;/i>; and &lt;i>;Hungarian Conservative&lt;/i>;. Istvan Kiss, the executive director of the Danube Institute, says its purpose is to be “a kind of beltway between our region and the Anglosphere”. Its chairman, John O&#39;Sullivan, is a former speechwriter for Margaret Thatcher and editor of the &lt;i>;National Review&lt;/i>;, an American conservative journal.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;He is not the only Anglophone intellectual drawn to Budapest. Gladden Pappin, one of the first political philosophers to try to intellectualise Trumpism, is president of the Hungarian Institute of International Affairs, which reports to the prime minister. Mr Pappin says, “Hungary has a national interest in fostering like-minded, nationally oriented parties in the European level.” That is necessary, he explains, because “Conservatives felt that liberal globalism was a kind of divide-and-conquer ideology and that conservatives had been kept incommunicado.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The networking has allowed national conservatives to borrow ideas from one another. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland&#39;s former ruling party, &lt;small>;P&lt;/small>;i&lt;small>;S,&lt;/small>; imported techniques of state capture from Hungary. In Florida Mr DeSantis approved a law banning lessons on homosexuality and gender ideology months after Mr Orban&#39;s government did the same. Another Floridian law banning the teaching of critical race theory in universities and the takeover of a small college deemed too liberal also echo Mr Orban&#39;s politics.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Human right&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;There are shared policies on the family, too. The phrase “family friendly Hungary” is plastered across the airport in Budapest in multiple languages. Women who have large numbers of children receive big tax breaks, student-loan forgiveness and considerable aid in buying homes. In Poland one of &lt;small>;P&lt;/small>;i&lt;small>;S&lt;/small>;&#39;s most popular policies was a grant of 500 zloty ($125) a month for every child, which helped reduce child poverty markedly. In America, too, some on the right support payments for working parents (“workfare”) as a way to help families, despite misgivings about the welfare state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The desire to defend the family sometimes manifests itself as a fixation with fertility. “Perhaps you weren&#39;t expecting to have to think about making babies at 9 o&#39;clock on a Monday morning,” mused Miriam Cates, a Tory &lt;small>;MP&lt;/small>;, at NatCon in 2023, “but if you want to be a national conservative, you need a nation to conserve.” At a recent conference hosted by Ms Meloni, Elon Musk, the world&#39;s richest man, urged those present to “make more Italians to save Italy&#39;s culture”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Despite all these exchanges, however, national conservatives are a disparate bunch with lots of disagreements. There are deep divisions on economics, foreign policy and social affairs. America Firsters and Fidesz are resoundingly opposed to giving Ukraine additional aid to resist Russia&#39;s invasion, but &lt;small>;P&lt;/small>;i&lt;small>;S&lt;/small>; was among Ukraine&#39;s staunchest allies when it was in government. In America, Hungary and Poland nationalists worry about gay and trans indoctrination of children; the most prominent nationalist conservatives in France and the Netherlands, Ms Le Pen and Mr Wilders, are more supportive of gay rights (which they trumpet in part as a way to bash Islam).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Trump wants to impose big tariffs to protect domestic industry, whereas as much as Hungary&#39;s government rails against bureaucrats in Brussels, it has no plans to leave the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; and its single market. “We are against globalism as an ideology, not globalisation,” explains Mr Orban, the prime minister&#39;s political director. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Ms Meloni provides a good case study of the internal contradictions of the coalition. Given her belligerent Euroscepticism before becoming prime minister, many had feared that she would ally with Mr Orban in his constant feuding with the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>;. “While defending Italian sovereignty, we cannot forget to defend Viktor Orban&#39;s Hungary or Kaczynski&#39;s Poland, once again under attack from the European progressive mainstream,” she declared at a NatCon conference held in Rome in 2020.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet in office she went along with other European leaders to suspend billions of euros in payments to Hungary over its dubious commitment to the rule of law. Ms Meloni has also strongly supported aid to Ukraine despite Mr Orban&#39;s objections, and helped twist his arm to allow a recent tranche of €50bn ($54bn) to go through. Since 1998 Ms Meloni has organised an annual conservative conference called Atreju (named after a character from the fantasy series “The Neverending Story”). In 2019 her honoured guest was Viktor Orban. Last year it was the thoroughly conventional prime minister of Britain, Rishi Sunak.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;There is little agreement among national conservatives about what a post-liberal international order should look like. To win broader support—and perhaps after witnessing the painful contortions of Brexit—European national conservatives have backed away from Frexit, Huxit and Nexit. Hungary has used its veto within the &lt;small>;EU &lt;/small>;and &lt;small>;NATO &lt;/small>;to win concessions from its fellow members, but does not want either supranational organisation—from which it draws big benefits in the forms of direct subsidies and security guarantees—to be disbanded. For all of the complaints about globalism, most national conservatives do not seem to want to go it alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt =&quot;Cut outs of various militant activists on a background of red and white concentric circles&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color: transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets /images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 384w, https:/ /www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/ image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format =auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002. jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist. com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424 ,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto /content-assets/images/20240217_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: Chantal Jahchan/Getty Images&lt;/ span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Indeed, some argue that national conservatism is so inchoate and incoherent that it is not worth taking严重地。 But even movements with deep internal inconsistencies can reshape the world. In America, the Reagan revolution relied on “fusionism”, an awkward assemblage of anti-communist hawks, anti-abortion social conservatives and libertarian free-marketers, in order to rewrite the meaning of conservatism for decades. The First International and Second International were motley 19th-century assemblies of left-wing groups that collapsed in acrimony, but nonetheless helped propagate both communism and social democracy.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In 1934 Italian fascists convened a conference in Montreux, Switzerland, with the aim of sketching a universal theory of fascism. The effort was a complete failure. Nazi Germany had been excluded due to diplomatic conflicts with Italy. “The delegates at Montreux disagreed on almost everything of ideological substance: the centrality of fascist corporatism; race and the so-called &#39;Jewish question&#39;; the role of Christianity…and, eventually, over the very balance between national independence and international collaboration,” writes Aristotle Kallis, a historian of fascist movements. And yet, as divided as the fascist movement was, it still proved capable of igniting the second world war.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Right and wrongs&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Modern-day national conservatives are not fascists, and are at pains to distinguish their movement from the destruction of the 1930s. Mr Hazony, for instance, claims that the Nazis were not true nationalists, but imperialists who sought to conquer Europe, and that real nationalism entails opposition to imperialism and other totalising ideologies, including liberalism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Of course, in practice, nationalists often overlook the distinction Mr Hazony is drawing. Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s president, bases his authoritarian power on corruption and the appropriation of nationalist causes. He embraces the Russian Orthodox church, seethes at Western thanklessness about the Soviet Union&#39;s sacrifices during the second world war and telegraphs revulsion for foreign immorality. To justify his invasion of Ukraine, he served up a smorgasbord of nationalist propaganda, insisting that the two countries were part of the same Slavic nation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;When George Orwell pondered the question of nationalism in the waning days of the second world war, he wrote of its dangers this way: “Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also—since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself—unshakeably certain of being in the right.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Much the same criticism could be levelled at many national conservatives. Although some, like Ms Meloni, govern within the rules, many of the movement&#39;s most prominent figures, including Mr Trump, Mr Orban and Mr Kaczynski, are so convinced of their own correctness that they do not mind subverting the state to maintain power. Courts are not seen as an important independent check on the executive, but as an obstruction that ought to be made more pliant. The media are treated in much the same way.

class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Chinese call an investment that has gone bad a “landmine explosion”. In Ms Xue&#39;s case, the blast came from a wealth-management product that had promised an annual return of about 8%. It had been recommended by a friend and was sold by Hywin, a big firm based in Shanghai but listed in both Hong Kong and New York. She put in 300,000 yuan ($42,000) last February and a further 500,000 a few months later. In December, however, it became clear that the firm was struggling to meet its obligations. It is uncertain how much of her original investment, if any, Ms Xue will ever see again.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Across China hundreds of thousands of the well-to-do have suffered landmine injuries in recent months. Zhongzhi, an investment firm which went bust in December, owes its 150,000 clients $36bn. And explosions are not confined to wealth-management firms. By far the most common investment in China is property, and property values have been falling for almost three years. The stockmarket, too, is sliding: the Shanghai Composite, one of the most prominent indices, has dropped by over 20% since its peak in 2021. And whereas the government has in the past stepped in to help investors hit by plunging asset prices, this time it shows little inclination for a bail-out. Ms Xue will have to try to stanch the bleeding on her own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;China publishes almost no official data about the distribution of wealth, perhaps for fear of revealing just how unequal it is. But &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; has analysed nationwide surveys from 2018 and 2020 that asked participants about their income and investments, weighting the responses to reflect China&#39;s demography. That has yielded a rough breakdown of who owns most of the financial assets that are losing value so fast, and so allowed us to infer what the swooning markets might mean for China&#39;s economy and society.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Year of the drubbing&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A huge share of the country&#39;s wealth, it turns out, is in the hands of people like Ms Xue. The drubbing the markets have been giving them, and the government&#39;s apparent indifference, is reshaping their investment preferences, in all likelihood for years to come. That, in turn, will impede the authorities&#39; plans to develop the financial system and thus slow China&#39;s future growth. Ms Xue and investors like her will suffer the most, but China&#39;s economy will also end up scarred by the detonations.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;631&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC330.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The survey data suggest that about 50% of China&#39;s wealth is in the hands of the 113m or so people with a net worth of 1m-10m yuan. This cohort—just 8% of the population—has even more influence over financial markets than their wealth would suggest. They own 64% of all publicly traded shares, for instance, and 61% of investment funds (see chart 1).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The group are the main beneficiaries of China&#39;s 40-odd years of booming growth. Born in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, they were some of the first to return to university after schools were closed during the Cultural Revolution. They were the first group to start small, private businesses. When the Shanghai stock exchange opened in 1990, they were among the first retail investors on the scene. They also propelled China&#39;s property market since the first mortgage was issued by a state bank in 1986. Many will have cashed in on the privatisation of housing in the 1990s, buying flats for meagre sums that are now worth a fortune. They have experienced a miraculous shift in living standards over their working lives, from communal kitchens to holiday homes. Deng Xiaoping declared in the late 1970s that China would reject Maoism and “let some people get rich first”, and these are the people who did.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Ms Xue appears to be a typical member of the “got-rich-first” group. She is a Beijinger in her late 40s, eyeing an early retirement after 25 years in advertising. She has saved and invested widely. In addition to the detonated wealth-management product, she owns a residential investment property and some commercial property that she rents out. About 20% of her savings are in the stockmarket. All of these investments are now losing value. It is not obvious where to turn. China&#39;s strict capital controls make it difficult and prohibitively expensive to move money abroad; the closest she has come to that is an insurance policy from Macau, a “special administrative region” with different financial regulations and its own currency. Ms Xue&#39;s only other form of diversification has been to stash away some gold.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For China&#39;s wealthy, the present market turmoil is unprecedented and disorienting. Property prices had risen steadily for decades, with only a tiny blip in 2008. Although the stockmarket has been more volatile, the state has typically intervened to prevent big routs. Investors in more esoteric wealth-management products have also benefited from bail-outs when things went wrong, while receiving high yields in the meantime. A recent survey of affluent Chinese by Charles Schwab, an American asset manager, found that more than half expected 20-40% annual returns.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Dragon mire&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Such expectations are looking ever less plausible. During Xi Jinping&#39;s first term as China&#39;s leader, in 2013-18, the average annual growth in personal income from investments was 10.8%. That fell during Mr Xi&#39;s second term to 7%. Over the past two years it has sunk below 5%.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In part, this reflects Mr Xi&#39;s determination to prevent bubbles and thus make the financial system more stable. To that end, he has tried to dispel the assumption that the state will come to the rescue of any struggling financial firm. In 2018, for example, he instigated a crackdown on online-lending platforms, wiping out an industry with 1trn yuan in outstanding loans. That was part of a broader campaign to restrict lending outside banks, which has shrunk by more than half since 2016.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The authorities still seem keen to shield the poor from turmoil in the financial system. This year, for instance, the central government will attempt to merge more than 2,000 rural banks with more than $6trn in assets, to strengthen institutions catering mainly to people on the lowest rung of China&#39;s economic ladder. But the rich are a different story. When several small banks collapsed in 2022, deposits in excess of 500,000 yuan were not reimbursed by the state. By the same token, as property developers have gone bust the state has dragged its feet about rescuing those who paid for apartments that were never built, many of whom are relatively affluent. Wealthier investors, the logic runs, can afford to absorb the losses and should understand the risks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But the risks are often opaque, and different investments more closely related than they at first appear. A search for “landmine investment” on Chinese social media reveals endless posts about trusts and other wealth-management products. These typically funnel cash from China&#39;s rich to risky borrowers willing to pay high interest rates. The trust industry alone has raised $2.9trn from 1.3m people and companies. About 30% of its loans are used to buy bonds, equities and investment funds. Another quarter is lending to conventional businesses. More than 7% has gone to property developers, almost all of whom are on the ropes.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Wang Yong&#39;s parents, who are got-rich-first types, were assured they were not investing in property when they bought a trust product last year. The family lives in a prosperous coastal port city. Mr Wang&#39;s father has long invested in stocks. His mother in recent years has dabbled in wealth-management products, often taking the recommendations of an adviser at an asset-management company. Last year she went big, buying a 3m yuan trust product issued by a state-owned industrial enterprise. She later discovered that her money had been lent to a property developer that had defaulted. The state firm said the problem would be resolved in 60 days. That deadline came and went in early January. That&#39;s when Mr Wang (a pseudonym) began posting complaints on social media.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Tens of thousands are doing the same. Trust defaults are rising at an alarming rate. The product Mr Wang bought was issued by a firm with about 740bn yuan ($100bn) in assets. Many other trust firms are expected to miss payments in the coming months. The government has so far refused to bail them out. Most clients have no way to recoup their money. Lawyers tend to advise that lawsuits are futile.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Property has also become a landmine for many investors. For years Chinese media celebrated the “explosive expansion” of urban apartment prices and urged people to cash in. Ms Xu, a finance executive in her 50s who did not want her full name published, made sure that she did. She moved to Shanghai 20 years ago but often returns to her hometown inland, where she bought two investment flats. (Her parents live in one of them.) By 2021 their value had more than doubled. Last year, as the downturn deepened, she put both flats on the market in the hope of realising some gains before prices fell further. But she has not been able to sell them. Developers have cut the prices of new flats in her city by more than 10%. Potential buyers are holding back in expectation of further drops. She fears all her gains will be wiped out.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Half of China&#39;s housing wealth belongs to the got-rich-first. There are no nationwide data on house prices and the official figures for individual cities seem to understate falling prices. The government&#39;s numbers claim that prices have barely budged in Shanghai. Local economists, in contrast, reckon they have crashed by 20-30% in some central districts and could fall further in 2024. People in smaller cities talk of 30-40% “discounts” on new flats.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Chinese spent about 16.3trn yuan buying homes in 2021. Analysts believe that up until that year about 30% of residential property was purchased as an investment, rather than to live in. That means punters pumped some 5trn yuan into investment properties at the top of the market and will have lost a big part of their savings. &lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data- nimg =“ 1” style =“颜色：透明” sizes =“（min-width：960px）834px，95VW“ srcset =” https://wwwww.economist.com/cdn-cgi/cgi/image/image/image/image/width = 360,1360,quality =80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/ images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 480w, https:// www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image /width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format= auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com /cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width =1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot; >;image: Carl Godfrey&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Again, the government does not seem too concerned. The central bank declined to cut rates in January, despite months of deflation. The authorities have long wanted to quell speculation in property and prevent bubbles forming. They worry that too much of China&#39;s household wealth—some 80%—is concentrated in housing, compared with about 30% in America, for example. There is little systemic risk: banks are well capitalised and mortgages form a relatively small share of their assets. Local governments, meanwhile, see a chance to acquire lots of apartments on the cheap, to be used as low-income housing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But this blasé view disregards the gloom that is spreading fast among the got-rich-first. On top of everything else, many are seeing their wages fall. About a third of white-collar workers say their salaries were cut last year, the highest proportion for several years, according to Zhaopin, a job-search firm. Many senior bankers&#39; pay has been slashed by 30%, one claims, as part of Mr Xi&#39;s push to rid the financial industry of Western-style extravagance. Wage growth in the private sector slowed to just 3.7% in 2022, down from double digits just a few years ago, the National Bureau of Statistics reports.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Financial reversals among the rich tend to reverberate through the economy. In an article entitled “My middle-class dream died in wealth management”, published late last year in a local newspaper, a 40-year-old woman named Zhou Ning described how she had lost millions of yuan to landmines. She explained how she has gone from holidaying in Europe and America to asking relatives for money. She has been forced to sell her luxury handbags and find part-time work. She can no longer pay for her mother-in-law&#39;s cancer treatment. She has moved her child from a fancy international kindergarten to one with nearly triple the number of pupils.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As their income declines and their assets atrophy, the got-rich-first are becoming more cautious about spending. This “negative wealth effect” is hurting the economy. Oxford Economics, a research firm, estimates that household savings jumped to 32.4% of disposable income in the last quarter of 2023. Excess savings that could be used to consume or invest probably hit around 4trn yuan, or 3.2% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;1178&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240210_FBC319.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As they become more cautious, the got-rich-first are reshaping China&#39;s markets. An executive at one of China&#39;s biggest asset-management firms says the collapse of Zhongzhi has been catastrophic for his industry. Clients used to grill him about the returns products would earn, he says; “Now they want proof we&#39;re not a scam.” Mutual funds, which invest in stocks and are hard to redeem, saw their smallest inflows in a decade last year. Money-market funds, which can be sold instantly, grew from 8.1trn yuan in 2020 to 12.3trn in July (see chart 2).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is into safe and liquid assets that China&#39;s wealth is moving like never before, says Philip Leung of Bain, a consulting firm. Fixed-term deposits at banks, one of the safest investments available, grew faster last year than at any point since they were introduced in 2015. By the same token, the few funds that are allowed to invest abroad grew fourfold to 400bn yuan in assets under management between 2020 and last July. And sales of insurance policies like Ms Xue&#39;s reportedly soared last year in Macau and Hong Kong, another special administrative region with its own currency and financial regulation.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;All this will have a baleful effect on the financial system and the broader economy. Retail investors&#39; hitherto growing interest in stocks, bonds and investment funds, which the government had hoped would reduce Chinese savers&#39; fixation with property, has reversed. In the long run, that will reduce the flow of capital to business. The got-rich-first will also be more cautious about investing in their own businesses. Li Wei of Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business (&lt;small>;CKGSB&lt;/small>;) in Beijing says entrepreneurs born in the 1960s and 1970s have been the driving force of company formation and wealth creation for decades. But a survey of business confidence conducted by &lt;small>;CKGSB&lt;/small>; has found declining expectations for profits for seven consecutive months—a first in the survey&#39;s 12-year history, excluding the pandemic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The landmines are also creating protesters among a previously apolitical group. The got-rich-first tended to look favourably on the government, which helped them to so massively improve their lot over the years. But Ms Xue and Mr Wang, at least, have been transformed into activists, hoping to bring attention to their causes. After posting a video on social media about her landmine injury, Ms Xue began receiving messages from people in different cities who had lost money on the same product. She has urged them to go to the police. She has also led small groups to the offices of Hywin in Beijing. Mr Wang, too, has linked up with fellow investors. They have visited the bank branches in their cities to complain. This appears to be a growing trend among wealthy Chinese who have experienced financial losses. &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; has spoken to several well-off investors over the past two years who have taken to the streets and even clashed with police in the hopes of spurring the authorities to action.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;None of these efforts has been successful. Ms Xue&#39;s visits to the police have resulted only in a warning not to “incite” others to complain. Mr Xi is keen to make financial markets more stable, but he does not want the Communist Party to be blamed when they malfunction. Protesters are usually safe if they stick to complaining about deadbeat firms, but if their actions could be construed as criticism of the government, they risk detention.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Dragon&#39;s denigrators &lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even if most got-rich-first keep quiet, however, the current turmoil is unwinding decades of goodwill between the government and its most productive citizens. Whereas previously China&#39;s thriving strivers and the authorities appeared to be on the same side, often in contrast to pampered young people, the state now appears indifferent if not hostile to the problems of the well-to-do. The got-rich-first, says an investment manager, “are just starting to realise that they have become the enemy”. That is a shift that will have grim consequences not just for them, but for all of China. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/08/chinas-well-to-do-are-under-assault-from-every-side<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/gstaiolscdrfhtjnsrbqjlehue5apae4</guid><pubDate> Thu, 08 Feb 2024 10:06:00 GMT</pubDate><category>中国</category></item><item><title>Facebook 20 岁了，政治已经过时了；非个人化的视频源</title><description>&lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img fetchpriority=&quot;high&quot;

So what if it&#39;s not even 10pm and it&#39;s a Tuesday night?…Let the hacking begin.” So typed a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, liveblogging from his Harvard dormitory as he began work on a website called Facemash. The site displayed randomly selected pairs of students&#39; mugshots, harvested from the university&#39;s intranet, and allowed users to vote on who was hotter. It caused a stir and was promptly shut down. But before long, a successor was in the making. On February 4th 2004 Mr Zuckerberg launched a new site: TheFacebook.com.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC246.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Facebook, as it later became, quickly overtook established social networks such as Friendster and MySpace to become the world&#39;s largest, a position it still holds on its 20th birthday. Today 3bn people—about 60% of all internet users—scroll its infinite feed every month (see chart 1). It has outwitted its rivals, or swallowed them, as it did Instagram and WhatsApp. Six of the ten most-downloaded mobile apps last year belonged to Meta, Facebook&#39;s holding company, which is now the world&#39;s largest seller of advertising after Google. Meta&#39;s market value has surpassed $1trn; in the third quarter of last year it reported revenue of $34bn.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Facebook and its imitators have done more than make money. Social media have become the main way that people experience the internet—and a substantial part of how they experience life. Last year nearly half of mobile screen-time worldwide was spent on social apps (and more than a quarter of waking hours were spent on phones), according to Data.ai, a research company. The networks have become what Mr Zuckerberg and others call a digital “town square”, in which the arguments of the day are thrashed out and public opinion is shaped. Social media have fomented social movements, from #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to the Arab spring and the Capitol riot.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Feedster&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Now, after two decades of evolution, the town square is being dug up and rebuilt. Following the arrival of competitors such as TikTok, powered by artificial intelligence, Facebook and other incumbents have been forced to reinvent themselves. Platforms that began as places for friends to interact and share their own content are turning into television-like feeds of entertainment, for passive consumption. At the same time, users are moving their conversations and arguments off the open networks and into closed, private groups on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. That migration, in turn, will have big implications for politics, in a year when countries with more than half the world&#39;s population are heading to the polls.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Social media are more popular than ever. The average internet user spent nearly two and a half hours a day on social platforms last year, according to &lt;small>;GWI&lt;/small>;, another data company. Usage ticked up during the pandemic and has not returned to pre-covid levels. As more people go online, more are signing up. Total time spent using social apps on Android devices, which account for about 70% of the world&#39;s phones and tablets, has risen by 42% since 2020, to 2.3trn hours last year, according to Data.ai.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But the sort of social networking that Facebook pioneered is disappearing. The most obvious change is the shift to video on today&#39;s networks. The explosive success of TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app which launched in 2017 and quickly had young people hooked, has sparked a wave of copycats. Meta has added a video feature called Reels to Facebook and Instagram. Similar products have been bolted onto Pinterest (Watch), Snapchat (Spotlight) and YouTube (Shorts). Elon Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, now claims it is a “video-first” platform. Of the 64 minutes per day that the average American spent on social media last year, 40 were spent watching video, up from 28 minutes three years earlier, estimates Bernstein, a broker.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The bigger change to social feeds is under the bonnet. At first, social networks showed chronological updates from users&#39; contacts: their friend just got engaged, their uncle was storming the Capitol and so on. As the volume of posts grew, the networks employed algorithms to prioritise posts that had proved popular among the user&#39;s friends. Now a new phase has begun. TikTok decided that, rather than guessing what people would like based on their “social graph”—that is, what their family and friends liked—it would use their “interest graph”, which it inferred from the videos they and people like them lingered在。 And rather than show content created by people they followed, it would serve up anything it thought they might like.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Every other big platform has followed套装。 In 2022 Mr Zuckerberg announced that Facebook&#39;s feed would become a “discovery engine” to seek out engaging content from around the internet. Since last year half of the posts X shows its users come from outside the network of people they follow. Threads, Meta&#39;s Twitter-clone, launched last year with a similar approach. The resulting feeds of unrelated content from strangers can be jarring: “Here&#39;s a healthy breakfast option! You should kill your mom!” quipped Bo Burnham, a YouTube comedian, in a satirical song. But users seem to like it. Time spent on Instagram has risen by 40% since Meta launched Reels. Even the geriatric Facebook somehow added 5m new users in America and Canada last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Google -&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As users&#39; newsfeeds become unmoored from their network of friends and family, they are posting less about themselves. “The average user is now more of a consumer,” says Michael Bossetta of Lund University. In a survey last year by Gartner, a market-research company, only 28% of Americans said they liked documenting their life online, down from 40% in 2020. Some 61% say they have become more selective about what they post, finds Morning Consult, another research firm, which speculates that an influx of “influencer” content may have made users think “their everyday life is too mundane to justify frequent posts”. Video, the new format of choice, is harder to create than dashing off a quick status update. And some platforms, such as X, prioritise posts by users who pay, reducing incentives for the rest.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Instead, conversations have been moving for some time to private groups. In 2021 Mr Zuckerberg wrote that, as well as debating in the “town square” of Facebook and Instagram, “People increasingly also want to connect privately in the digital equivalent of the living room.” Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, said last year that more photos and videos were being shared in direct messages than on the app&#39;s main feed. “All the friends-sharing is moving in that direction,” he concluded. Morning Consult asked people how they would be most likely to recommend a movie. Only 30% said they would post on social media, behind the 43% who chose text or email and the 35% who opted for group chats.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;At the same time, in the digital town square, fun is in and politics is out. Although (and perhaps because) social networks are accused of driving political polarisation, they seem increasingly eager to steer users away from news and current affairs. A study by Joshua Tucker of the Centre for Social Media and Politics at New York University (&lt;small>;NYU&lt;/small>;) and colleagues compared a group of Facebook and Instagram users who were on chronological newsfeeds in the run-up to America&#39;s election in 2020 with another group who used the platforms&#39; recommendation algorithm. Those using the chronological feed saw 15% more political content on Facebook and 5% more on Instagram than those who were fed by the algorithm. (They also saw a lot more information from what Meta classified as untrustworthy sources: 69% more on Facebook and 22% more on Instagram, albeit from low bases.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Since then, the platforms have shied even further from news. The &lt;small>;U&lt;/small>;-turn has been sharpest at Meta, whose boss said ten years ago that he wanted Facebook&#39;s newsfeed to be a “perfect personalised newspaper for every person in the world”. The firm now says that news makes up less than 3% of what people see on the platform. Mr Mosseri, who is also in charge of Threads, wrote at its launch last year, “Politics and hard news are inevitably going to show up on Threads…but we&#39;re not going to do anything to encourage those verticals.” A week later he added, “From a platform&#39;s perspective, any incremental engagement or revenue they might drive is not at all worth the scrutiny, negativity (let&#39;s be honest), or integrity risks that come along with them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A campaign by some publishers to make social-media firms pay to share their content has reinforced the networks&#39; view that news is more trouble than it is worth. In Canada, which will hold a general election this year or next, Facebook and Instagram are blocking all news content, in response to a demand by the government that Meta pay publishers for hosting links to their stories. Under Mr Musk, who is scathing about what he calls the “legacy media”, X has removed headlines from posted news articles, and appeared to throttle traffic to out-of-favour publications such as the &lt;i>;New York Times&lt;/i>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The squeezing of news has been felt by publishers, some of which had built their business around the platforms. Last year the amount of internet traffic sent from Facebook to media companies fell by 48%, and from X by 27%, according to Chartbeat, which measures such things. Former kings of the viral social-post have struggled: last year BuzzFeed News shut down and Vice News drastically cut back.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBC231.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As they see less news in their feed, people are becoming less likely to share or comment on the news in public (see chart 2). Whereas in 2018 some 26% of people reported sharing news articles on social media at least weekly, last year only 19% did, according to a 36-country study by the Reuters Institute at Oxford University. The decline in sharing seems to affect the amount of political content in particular. Mr Tucker and colleagues found that removing shared content from users&#39; Facebook feeds reduced the amount of political news they saw by more than half. (Again, it also reduced the amount of content from suspect sources, by nearly a third.) The authors found that this left the users less knowledgeable about the news—though they did not find evidence that it had changed their minds about anything much.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The decline of sharing and posting has given rise to what the Reuters Institute calls the “passive news consumer”, who sees the news but doesn&#39;t comment, share or otherwise engage with it. This trend is most advanced in rich countries: in Britain 68% of adults are “passive” consumers of news, with only one in ten posting about it in a typical week. The remaining hard core of “active” participants in the online public square are disproportionately male, and highly opinionated. A third of those who call themselves “very” right or left-wing still take part, whereas only 22% of centrists bother weighing in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For political strategists, “the job has totally changed”, says Teddy Goff, who ran Barack Obama&#39;s digital campaign in 2012 before co-founding Precision Strategies, a consultancy. In the past the dominance of a handful of mega-platforms meant there was “a sort of political monoculture”, he argues. “At least in major moments, like an election campaign, something could happen and the whole country could hear about it pretty quickly… It doesn&#39;t work that way any more.” Today different groups lurk in different places. Young people are on Snapchat. Journalists cling to X (while claiming to hate it). LinkedIn is the best place to reach parliamentary aides, says an activist in Britain. So politicians need to be everywhere. Joe Biden has even joined Truth Social, the social network owned by his Republican rival, Donald Trump. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;“It&#39;s a lot, lot, lot harder for us to reach the same number of people as we used to,” says Matthew McGregor, another former Obama staffer who runs 38 Degrees, a British campaigning outfit. Social networks&#39; algorithms serve up less political content, he finds, and the way they optimise for engagement incentivises provocative posts. “We need to make people laugh, make people cry, or make people angry,” he laments. He admits to wrestling with how far to push this. “It&#39;s a simple fact that you can get more numbers by being a bit more vitriolic, by being a bit more critical, by being a bit more personal…There is a tension and it is hard.” Candidates with uncompromising messages seem to travel furthest.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The surest way to win attention, of course, is to pay for it. American candidates and their backers will spend nearly $16bn on advertising in the run-up to November&#39;s elections. Television will take the lion&#39;s share: its ageing audience puts off some advertisers, but not politicians, who know that the elderly vote. &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; ads are still believed to be the best when it comes to persuasion; those on social media are mainly about fundraising. Still, more than a quarter of American political-ad spending in this cycle will be on digital platforms, forecasts Insider Intelligence, a research firm. In the past week alone, Mr Biden has spent more than $750,000 on ads just on Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But even candidates willing to pay are finding it harder to get their message out in the new public square. For one thing, some of the new digital platforms don&#39;t want their money. TikTok bans political advertising altogether. Threads, less than a year old, does not yet sell ads at all. Streaming services, which make up a bigger share of &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; viewing in America than either broadcast or cable, are also wary: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, the biggest streamers, all refuse to take political ads for now, though that may change.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The bigger problem is that political ads on social media don&#39;t work as well as they used to. Anti-tracking changes introduced by Apple in 2021 have made it harder to target ads and so reduced the return on investments in them. Spending on Facebook ads will be lower in this election cycle than in 2020, predicts AdImpact, a consultancy, even though total political ad spending is expected to be up by 30% or so.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In the past six months politicians spent $244m on ads on Facebook and Instagram in America, down from $320m during the same period in the 2020 cycle, according to our analysis of data collected by Andrew Arenge, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. Meta&#39;s ad library shows that in the 90 days before the Iowa caucuses last month, Donald Trump spent only about $400,000 on the two platforms. “These are pretty startling numbers compared with what we&#39;ve seen in years past,” says Reid Vineis of Majority Strategies, a Republican consultancy. His explanation: “The platform is less effective.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240203_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: Ricardo Rey&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As social networks bury political posts, email is proving a useful way of sidestepping Silicon Valley&#39;s algorithms. “There isn&#39;t some big, bad Mark Zuckerberg or Nick Clegg [another Meta executive] sitting in California deciding whether or not we get to email people, and whether people get to open those emails,” says Mr McGregor. The most effective way to make something go viral on Facebook, 38 Degrees finds, is to email its members and ask them to post it there. Morning Consult argues that, given the wilting of online sharing, brands will need to come up with messages simple enough to be remembered and passed on in person, rather than creating memes designed to be shared.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;NotYourSpace&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Hardest of all is infiltrating the millions of small group-chats into which the public square has splintered. What goes on in these encrypted spaces is opaque, even to the platforms that operate them. But the groups seem to be picking up some of the slack in terms of news-sharing. The proportion of adults posting news articles weekly via instant-messaging platforms rose from 17% to 22% in the five years to 2023, the Reuters Institute found.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Getting into the group chats pays dividends for campaigners. A recent petition by 38 Degrees to strip a bungling former boss of Britain&#39;s Post Office of a medal—the kind of campaign that in the past would have relied on Facebook—got the most traffic from its email list, and the second-most from WhatsApp.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Elections were easier to fight when there were just a few big social-media platforms, acknowledges Mr Goff. However, he says, “I don&#39;t think it was altogether good when it was more of a public square…These are channels that put their thumbs on the scale for certain kinds of content over other kinds of content.” The design of the platform is such that, “You&#39;re going to have a laugh about a stupid gaff, or a hot-mic moment or something like that, and not have good-faith, in-depth conversations about what we ought to do about Gaza.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Good-faith debate can be hard to find online. But campaigners report that getting people to share something in a group chat calls for a calmer tone than grabbing their attention on the open platforms. “They don&#39;t want their friends to think, &#39;Oh God, here he goes again…why is he always whanging on at us about this annoying issue?&#39;” says Mr McGregor.

Each day, it cost what a typical local made in several months. The handset was as heavy as a half-brick and only somewhat more useful. Practically no one else in Congo had one, bar cabinet ministers and tycoons, so there were not many people to call. In those days, mobile phones had made no detectable difference to most people&#39;s lives in the world&#39;s poorest countries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Today, many farmers in Congo have phones: the number of connections has grown 5,000-fold as the population has doubled. Mobile devices have transformed lives throughout the developing world, especially as more and more of them are hooked up to the internet (see chart 1). The 4bn people who live in low or lower-middle income countries have vastly more access to information, chat daily to far-off friends and use their phones like bank cards even when they don&#39;t have bank accounts.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC831.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/topics/artificial-intelligence&quot;>;artificial intelligence&lt;/a>; (&lt;small>;ai&lt;/small>;) bring similarly dramatic changes? There are three main reasons for optimism. First, the technology is improving fast. Second, it has the potential to spread fast, too. As usually happens with new technologies, rich countries will benefit first. But if the high cost of training &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; models falls, the expense of providing the technology to the poor could be minimal. They will not need a new device, just the smartphones that many of them already own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The third reason is that developing countries have gaping shortages of skilled workers: there are nowhere near enough teachers, doctors, engineers or managers. &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; could ease this shortfall, not by replacing existing workers, but by helping them become more productive, argues Daniel Björkegren of Columbia University, which in turn could raise the general level of health and education. Although &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; may also eliminate some jobs, the &lt;small>;IMF&lt;/small>; predicts that labour markets in poorer countries will be less disrupted than those in rich ones. Another tantalising possibility is that &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; could help provide fine-grained, up-to-date data about poor places, and so assist in all manner of development work. &lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;1196&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBC862.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Start with education. A typical sub-Saharan pupil spends six years in school but retains only three years&#39; worth of learning, Wolfgang Lutz of the Wittgenstein Centre in Vienna estimated in 2015. A typical Japanese student spends 14 years in classes and absorbs 16 years&#39; worth of education 。 Using a different methodology, the World Bank also finds that education is spectacularly worse in poor countries than in rich ones (see chart 2).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Tonee Ndungu, an entrepreneur in Kenya, thinks &lt;small>;AI &lt;/small>;could help bridge this gap. He has developed two apps that he hopes to launch this year. One, called Somanasi (“Learn with me”), is for children. It allows pupils to ask a talking chatbot questions related to the Kenyan school curriculum. &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; asked, “How do I work out a percentage from a fraction?” The chatbot offered a step-by-step worked example.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Machine learning&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A chatbot can give undivided attention to each child, at any time of day, and never gets tired (so long as your phone is charged). It can also be adapted to local cultures. “I never saw an apple till I was 30,” says Mr Ndungu. “So we say &#39;A is for animal.&#39;” The service can be tailored to different learning styles, too. It might illustrate division by telling children to break a pencil in half and then again. Depending on how different pupils respond, the &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; can figure out whether this approach works, and fine-tune the way it interacts with them. Some kids want more numbers; some like stories. The chatbot adapts.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It cannot yet mark homework. But Mr Ndungu&#39;s firm, Kytabu, offers an app for teachers, too, called Hodari (“Brave”). It lightens their workload by crafting step-by-step lesson plans. It helps track what pupils understand, by getting each one to answer questions on a smartphone. (One phone per classroom is enough, he says.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As far as &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; could tell from playing with them in a café with good Wi-Fi, the two apps work well. But the proof will come—and bugs will be fixed—when more people use them in classrooms and homes. They will be given away to begin with; Mr Ndungu hopes eventually to charge for add-ons. The more children are enrolled, the cheaper it will be to provide the service. If half a million were to join, Mr Ndungu predicts the cost per child would fall from $3.50 a month (not including the phone) to about 15 cents.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Chat GPA&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Many entrepreneurs are pursuing similar projects, often using open-source models developed in rich countries, sometimes with help from charities like the Gates Foundation. The cost of getting &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; to learn new languages appears low. It is already being used to write children&#39;s books in tongues previously too obscure for commercial publishers to bother with.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The need is glaring. Developing countries have too few teachers, many of whom have not mastered the curriculum. A study in 2015 (using data going back to 2007) found that four-fifths of grade six maths teachers in South Africa did not understand the concepts they were supposed to teach. Nearly 90% of ten-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa cannot read a simple text.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Dr Björkegren points to recent studies suggesting that big gains are possible even with basic tech. One analysed an approach under which schools hire modestly qualified teachers and give them detailed “scripts” for lessons, delivered via tablet computers. Michael Kremer, a Nobel-prize-winning economist, and others studied 10,000 pupils taught this way in Kenya, at schools run by Bridge International Academies, a chain of cheap private schools. They found that after two years on average Bridge students had mastered nearly an extra year&#39;s worth of the curriculum, compared with pupils enrolled in normal schools. Another study in India found that personalised computerised instruction was especially helpful for pupils who were far behind. &lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Using &lt;small>;AI &lt;/small>;in health care is riskier. If an educational chatbot misfires, a pupil might flunk a test; if a medical one hallucinates, a patient could die. Nonetheless, optimists see great potential. Some &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-powered medical kit is already widely used in rich countries and is starting to be adopted in poorer ones. Examples include handheld ultrasound devices that can interpret scans, and a system for spotting tuberculosis on chest &lt;small>;X&lt;/small>;-rays. Accurate &lt;small>;ai&lt;/small>; translation could also make it easier for patients and health-care workers in the global south to tap into the world&#39;s medical knowledge. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even imperfect &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; tools may improve health-care systems in the developing world, whose failures cause more than 8m deaths a year, by one estimate. In a study of nine poor and middle-income countries by Todd Lewis of Harvard and others, 2,000 recently graduated primary health-care workers were observed dealing with visitors to clinics. They performed the correct, essential tasks required by clinical guidelines only about half the time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For people in remote areas, even a substandard clinic may be too far away or too costly. Many rely on traditional medicine, much of which is useless or harmful. South African folk healers sometimes cut patients to rub in toxic powder suffused with mercury, for example. &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; tools need not be infallible to be better than that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A team at the University of São Paulo is training an &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; to answer health-related questions. The aim is to give a tool to primary-health workers in Brazil, who sometimes have little training. They are using a database of clinical guidelines from Brazil&#39;s health ministry, rather than the whole internet, which is full of voodoo health tips. Before the &lt;small>;ai&lt;/small>; can be widely deployed, it must be tested, tweaked and tested again. Currently, when you ask precise, technical questions, such as “Is Ivermectin effective in preventing covid-19?”, its success rate is “so, so high”, says Francisco Barbosa, one of the team. The trouble comes when you ask it something vague, as humans often do. If you say, “I&#39;ve fallen in the street. How can I get to a pharmacy?”, then the &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;, which may not know where you are, might give terrible advice.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The &lt;small>;AI &lt;/small>;will have to improve and its users will have to learn how to get the best out of it, says Mr Barbosa. He is confident that this will happen: “It&#39;s a cliché [to say it], but it&#39;s changing everything.” Equipping a new hospital costs millions of dollars. Training a new doctor takes years. If &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; helps cheap primary-care workers treat more patients successfully, so that they do not need to go to a hospital, Brazil can keep its population healthier without spending more.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Brazil has one doctor for every 467 people; Kenya has one for every 4,425. &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; could help, says Daphne Ngunjiri of Access Afya, a Kenyan firm that runs mDaktari, a virtual health-care platform with 29,000 clients. For a small monthly fee, they can ask for advice when they feel unwell.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Bard to handle&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For a test group of 380 users, mDaktari has added an &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-powered chatbot to the system. It records their queries, prompts them for more information and presents that information, along with a suggested response, to a clinician, often a nurse. The clinician reads it and, if the advice is sound, approves it and sends it back to the customer, perhaps referring her to a pharmacy or a clinic. Thus, a human is in the loop, to guard against errors, but the &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; does the time-consuming gathering of information about symptoms, enabling the nurse to deal with more patients. If necessary, the nurse can call the patient. For embarrassing ailments such as sexually transmitted diseases, some patients prefer talking to a chatbot. It never judges them.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Virginia, a client from a Nairobi slum whose family subsists on casual labour and backyard vegetables, says mDaktari is simple and helpful. One time she felt sick, consulted the app, and was steered to drugs that cleared up what turned out to be a urinary-tract infection. “I can even contact a [nurse] through my phone and get [an] answer,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Several firms are testing &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-enhanced medical devices to see how well they work in poor areas. Philips, a Dutch firm, has a pilot programme in Kenya for a handheld ultrasound with an &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; add-on that can interpret the images it spits out. This helps solve a common problem: lots of pregnant mothers and not enough people with the expertise to read scans.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Sadiki Jira is a midwife at a rural health facility in Kenya that serves nearly 30,000 people but has no doctor. He recalls a pregnant patient a couple of years ago whose baby had died in the womb. She had not realised for several weeks and had only sought help when she started haemorrhaging. Mr Jira referred her to a hospital, but it was too late: she died.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Jira now uses an &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-powered scanner. Any&amp;nbsp;midwife can, with minimal training, swipe a Philips device over a pregnant woman&#39;s stomach. The &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; reveals such vital information as the fetus&#39;s gestational age, whether it is in the breech position and whether there is adequate amniotic fluid. “It&#39;s easy to use,” says Mr Jira.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Philips is planning to offer the device and &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; together for $1 or $2 a day in poor countries. The biggest obstacles to its rollout are regulatory, says Matthijs Groot Wassink of Philips. Will governments allow midwives to handle a process that previously required someone more qualified? What will happen in places like India, where regulations are especially tight for fear that people will use ultrasound to identify and abort baby girls?&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Poorer places collect poorer data. Forty-nine countries have gone more than 15 years since their most recent agricultural census; 13 have not conducted a population census in that period. Official numbers, when they exist, tend to flatter the government. For example, a study compared official estimates of how much maize was being grown on small farms in Ethiopia, Malawi and Nigeria with the results of painstaking (but rare) household surveys. The official numbers were much rosier.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Satellite imagery and machine-learning could improve the quality and timeliness of data in developing countries, argue Marshall Burke of Stanford University and his co-authors in a recent paper in &lt;i>;Science&lt;/i>;. Roughly 2.5bn people live in households that depend on tiny plots of land. Until recently the output of such farms was hard to measure: satellite pictures were not sharp enough and data drawn from them were too hard to interpret. But by setting &lt;small>;AI &lt;/small>;to work on new high-resolution images of vegetation, Dr Burke and David Lobell, also of Stanford, were able to measure crop yields as accurately as surveys do, but faster and more cheaply. This could allow frequent, detailed analysis of farming practices. How much fertiliser is needed on this hillside? Which seeds work best in that valley? Such knowledge could transform rural livelihoods, the authors predict.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;So could better weather forecasts. Atmo, an American firm, says its &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-powered weather forecasts are as much as 100 times more detailed and twice as accurate as a conventional meteorological bulletin, because the &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; processes data so much faster. It is also cheap. “A dirty secret of meteorology…is that there are vast inequalities,” says Alex Levy, Atmo&#39;s boss. Forecasts are less detailed or reliable in poor countries. ”The places [with] the most extreme weather also have the worst forecasts, [so] they are most likely to be surprised and unable to prepare adequately.” Atmo&#39;s service is being used in Uganda and may soon be deployed in the Philippines.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Population counts in poor countries are rare, because they are costly, and prone to manipulation. In Nigeria the money each state gets from the central government is tied to its population. This gives states an incentive to fiddle. In 1991, on a census form with space for up to nine members per household, some states reported exactly nine members in every one. When the results of the census of 2006 were published, Bola Tinubu, the governor of Lagos, angrily claimed that its population was double the official tally. Nigeria has not held another census since. A new president—Mr Tinubu, as it happens—promises one in 2024.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A robot teaching assistant&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;702&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240127_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Illustration: Cristina Spano&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; can generate more frequent, detailed estimates of how many people live where—and how well-off they are. Lights at night are often used as a proxy for economic buzz. Neal Jean of Stanford and others took day and night images of slums in Africa and trained a convolutional neural network (a form of machine learning) to predict from daytime images how much light there would be at night. In other words, &lt;small>;AI &lt;/small>;learnt to recognise the kinds of buildings, infrastructure and other markers that tend to go with economic activity. It was able to predict 55-75% of the variation in assets between households.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot; adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Such information could help governments and charities assess better the effects of efforts to help the needy ; it could also help companies understand markets. Researchers are avidly trying out such techniques, but governments have been slow to adopt them, laments Dr Burke. He attributes this in part to “the potential benefits to some policymakers of not having certain outcomes be measured”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; could also help people deal with the red tape that throttles productivity in so many poor countries. Registering a property takes 200 times longer in Haiti than in wealthy Qatar, according to the World Bank. Suppose an &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;, which is immune to boredom, were able to fill in the forms accurately enough to spare humans the chore? In September India launched a chatbot that lets illiterate farmers pose oral queries about applications for financial aid. Some 500,000 tried it on the first day.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Deep minefield&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;AI &lt;/small>;poses risks to poor countries, too. They are generally less democratic than rich ones, so many governments will adopt &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; surveillance tools, pioneered by China, to monitor and control their people. They are less stable, so incendiary deepfakes may be more likely to warp politics or spark violence. Underfunded and inexpert regulators may struggle to impose proper guardrails against potential abuses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;And there are big obstacles to deploying &lt;small>;AI &lt;/small>;in the developing world. Access to the internet will have to improve. Some countries will benefit faster than others. India has 790m mobile broadband users, plus a universal digital identity system and a super-cheap, real-time payments system, note Nandan Nilekani and Tanuj Bhojwani, two tech bosses, in &lt;i>;Finance &amp;amp; Development&lt;/i>;. This, they argue, “puts it in a favourable position to be the world&#39;s most extensive user of &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; by the end of this decade”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Enormous uncertainty remains about how powerful the technology will eventually prove. But the potential upside is big enough to warrant a tremor of excitement. In the best-case scenario, &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; could help make whole populations healthier, better educated and better informed. In time, that could make them a lot less poor. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/25/could-ai-transform-life-in-developing-countries<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g8h9cmsuihce6qpikr2mi60uq9gppm79</guid><pubDate> Thu, 25 Jan 2024 11:50:56 GMT</pubDate><category>人工智能</category></item><item><title>拉姆和强人：莫迪在印度大选中看起来势不可挡</title><description>&lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img fetchpriority=&quot;high&quot;

It is also central to the fortunes of India&#39;s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (&lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;). Starting in the late 1980s, the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; agitated for the replacement of a 450-year-old mosque in Ayodhya with a temple, because it occupied the spot where Ram had supposedly been born. In 1992 a mob worked into a frenzy by fire-breathing speeches by the &lt;small>;bjp&lt;/small>;&#39;s leaders did indeed destroy the mosque, prompting riots across India in which some 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Since then, despite the bloodshed, the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; has pledged at election after election to get the temple built. It is therefore hard to imagine a more triumphant moment for Narendra Modi, the prime minister, than the ceremony he will lead on January 22nd, when the long-awaited temple will at last be consecrated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Unofficially, the consecration will also serve as the launch of the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s campaign for the next national election, expected to be held over several weeks in April and May. Mr Modi has asked all Indians to celebrate the temple&#39;s inauguration by lighting lamps, much as Hindus do on Diwali, a holiday that commemorates Ram&#39;s triumphant return to Ayodhya after slaying the king of the demons. But only 80% of Indians are Hindu, and not all of them see the construction of the temple as a victory, let alone the 14% who are Muslim. Business tycoons and Bollywood stars will attend the consecration, to flatter Mr Modi, but most opposition politicians—and some Hindu priests—are staying away.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;1082&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBC092.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 18w36g1&quot;>;.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}&lt;/style>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1ui9tv6&quot;>;.css-1ui9tv6{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant:small-caps no-common-ligatures no-discretionary-ligatures no-historical-ligatures no-contextual lining-nums;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e6ii4pq0+.css-1ui9tv6{margin-left:0.25rem;}&lt;/style>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;To Mr Modi&#39;s detractors, the fact that he would make the source of such bloodshed the centrepiece of his campaign is proof of his malign intentions.

Hence the jamboree in Ayodhya, which is above all a rallying cry to the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s electoral base. The guest list is dominated by leaders of the party and affiliated Hindu nationalist groups, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (&lt;small>;RSS&lt;/small>;), a sort of pious cadet corps, and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (&lt;small>;VHP&lt;/small>;), which launched the temple-building campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The ceremony concludes “500 years of continuous struggle for Hindus”, says Champat Rai, the &lt;small>;VHP&lt;/small>;&#39;s vice-president and general secretary of the trust building the temple. The event, he says, will send a clear message to Indian Muslims: “They should search for their roots: who were they four or five hundred years ago?” They were Hindus, he continues, and should “say that this land is our mother”.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But Hindutva is not the only thing the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; cares about in Ayodhya. It is also boosting the local economy by pouring $9.6bn into development schemes, including a new airport and a new railway station. It has grand plans to turn the city into a tourist hotspot, with a Ram “experience centre”, a fountain park, some 60 hotels and “patriotic” wedding venues.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The city thus neatly captures the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s sales pitch: that it is building a prosperous, confident new India by restoring Hinduism to its rightful place as the bedrock of society. The violence of 1992 was a “sad moment”, says Ayodhya&#39;s &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; mayor, Girish Pati Tripathi. “But Indian civilisation has passed it.我们正在前进。 Why are Muslims worrying so much?” &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;This blend of economic development and Hindu revivalism is an appealing formula for many, especially in Hindi-speaking northern and central India. Pollsters believe it will win the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; another majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of Parliament, either on its own or as head of a coalition. That would make Mr Modi India&#39;s only prime minister to win three consecutive terms since the first, Jawaharlal Nehru of Congress.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Modi, who is 73, is another of the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s strengths. The image he has cultivated—muscular, pious and avuncular—appeals across India. His humble origins as the son of a tea-seller strike a chord with poorer Indians. His nationalist rhetoric resonates with the aspirational middle class. His reputation as an adept, industrious administrator appeals to the wealthy. Many also applaud his efforts to raise India&#39;s international status.&amp;nbsp;Mr Modi&#39;s popularity accounted for up to a third of the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s votes in the most recent national election, surveys suggest.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;No Meru accident&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Modi has not earned this reputation by chance, of course. The &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; carefully cultivates it, in part by strong-arming media to ensure positive coverage. In July a survey of Indian journalists showed that 82% thought their employers favoured the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;.&amp;nbsp;The party also enhances Mr Modi&#39;s image by attaching his name and face to popular government programmes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Above all, the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; has a clear organisational edge. The party claims to be the world&#39;s biggest, with over 180m members, including 100m “active” ones (China&#39;s Communist Party has 98m). Verifying that is hard: a call to a toll-free number is all that is needed to join. Still, academics who study the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; say it can mobilise vast cohorts of party workers and volunteers, many of whom also belong to other Hindu nationalist groups. Managing them using a dedicated website and smartphone app, it appoints several to oversee each of India&#39;s million-odd polling stations, and even individual polling booths within them, with a party worker responsible for each page of the electoral roll.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Among them is Sachin Nahar, a 39-year-old Hindu farmer in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. Like his father and grandfather, he joined the &lt;small>;RSS&lt;/small>; as a child, attending weekly sessions of exercise and political discussion. He then volunteered as a &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; booth worker in 2013 and now oversees 30 voters. He regularly visits them in person, adds them to WhatsApp groups and ensures that they turn out to vote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For Mr Nahar Hindutva is central to the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s message. He reminds voters that Mr Modi has fulfilled many long-standing Hindu-nationalist demands, such as ending the special constitutional status of India&#39;s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir, and getting the temple in Ayodhya built. He and other &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; supporters in his constituency, which is 11% Muslim, are celebrating the temple&#39;s consecration with daily marches during which they chant, “Jai Shri Ram” (“Victory to Lord Ram”). As for the future, he hopes—and tells voters—that the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; will replace more mosques with temples and scrap special laws for Muslims regarding inheritance, divorce and other family matters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But the &lt;small>;bjp&lt;/small>; arms him with more than talking points about communal disputes. It also provides a completely different means to target voters, by giving him a list of the beneficiaries in his district of various forms of government welfare. Under Mr Modi the government has rolled out new digital identification, payment and data-management platforms which allow most Indians to access public services and receive direct cash transfers from the state. Mr Nahar highlights this system in his outreach, crediting the prime minister.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; is equally organised and efficient when it comes to social media. It claims only 20 people work in its National Digital Operation Centre, producing posts for its official accounts and trawling platforms for &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;-friendly content to promote. The heavy lifting is done by an army of volunteers (the party says it does not pay them), who help circulate official &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; content and create material of their own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;These digital campaigners often use WhatsApp, even after Meta, its parent company, tried to counter disinformation by restricting mass messages. “We invite like-minded people to the group, they invite their friends, they make separate groups and invite more people, and so it spreads,” says Rathan Ramesh Poojary, a &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; media co-ordinator in Karnataka. He denies responsibility when volunteers advocate violence against Muslims: “We don&#39;t support killing.” Still, he admits, “These guys support our ideology.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The popularity of the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s Muslim-bashing puts opposition parties in a bind. Most are reluctant to denounce Hindutva&lt;i>; &lt;/i>;policies for fear of irking Hindu voters. In fact, some Congress leaders have embraced “soft Hindutva”—visiting temples, building statues of Hindu deities and schmoozing with holy men. So far, that has annoyed secular and non-Hindu supporters without luring many votes from the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But Hindutva&lt;i>; &lt;/i>;presents problems for the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; as well. Its appeal is much more limited in south India, where Islam arrived not by conquest but with proselytising merchants. Hindu reformist movements have more influence in that part of the country and fewer people speak Hindi, in which the &lt;small>;bjp&lt;/small>;&#39;s leaders deliver their fiery speeches.&amp;nbsp;The &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; no longer runs any of the region&#39;s states, having lost an election in May in Karnataka to Congress. And of the 130 seats representing South India in the Lok Sabha, the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; holds only 29.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;That helps explain why the &lt;small>;bjp&lt;/small>; is not really the overwhelming force it appears. Its share of the national vote in Mr Modi&#39;s first election victory, in 2014, was only 31%. At the most recent national election, in 2019, it improved to 38%, still well short of a majority. If anything, Indian politics has become more competitive over the years, as Congress&#39;s star has faded and other parties, including the &lt;small>;bjp&lt;/small>;, have grown bigger. The &lt;small>;bjp&lt;/small>; is just remarkably good at translating its plurality of the vote into thumping parliamentary majorities, aided by India&#39;s first-past-the-post electoral system.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Were the opposition less divided and disorganised, the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; would have much more of a fight on its hands. The most obvious problem is Congress&#39;s ossified structure, epitomised by the dynasticism at the top. The party&#39;s most prominent leader is the 53-year-old Rahul Gandhi, whose father, grandmother and great-grandfather all served as prime minister. He has recently become more confident, but has always seemed ambivalent about politics—not surprisingly, given that both his father and his grandmother were assassinated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet Congress has hemmed and hawed about replacing him and, to the extent that it has done so, has plumped for an even less inspiring figure. In 2022 it chose a party veteran, Mallikarjun Kharge, as its first leader from outside the Gandhi family since 1998. He also heads the opposition&#39;s 28-party Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. At 81, though, he lacks the charisma and vigour to challenge Mr Modi. And both Mr Gandhi and his mother, Sonia, remain very much on the scene.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A similar dynamic plays out in the lower echelons of the派对。 Whereas the &lt;small>;bjp&lt;/small>; is ruthless about sidelining unpopular veterans and picking candidates based on their electoral prospects, Congress is dominated by ageing stalwarts who resist both new blood and new tactics. That, in turn, causes bright young things to defect to the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;, where their prospects for advancement are much better.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;When Congress does appoint younger, more charismatic leaders and uses modern election techniques, it can do well. It won state elections in December in Telangana, for instance, helped by both a fresh face as local party leader and by the number-crunching of Sunil Kanugolu, an election-data specialist. But the party lost two other state elections held at the same time, in which local party chiefs of long standing declined Mr Kanugolu&#39;s help.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Congress is trying fitfully to reform. It has initiated a recruitment drive to expand its membership beyond the current 60m and launched an app for members, much like the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;. It remains a contender, even in the Hindi-speaking heartland. Its average vote share in the three state elections there in December was 41%, not so far from the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s 46%. In fact, it had led two of the three outgoing state governments, so could hardly be described as a long-spent force.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;None of this, of course, excuses the underhanded methods Mr Modi uses to retain power. He has a troubling record of eroding democratic institutions. His government has harassed and jailed journalists and activists. It has undermined the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission. Its investigative agencies have targeted opposition leaders. In December an astonishing 146 opposition &lt;small>;MP&lt;/small>;s were suspended from Parliament.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Opposition leaders are billing the coming election as a fight for the “soul of India” and a turning point in a global struggle between freedom and autocracy. They fear that Mr Modi wants to change the constitution to purge secular language and empower the executive. A revision of electoral boundaries, due in a couple of years, could facilitate that by expanding the Lok Sabha to around 750 seats, with most new ones going to the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s strongholds in the north.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Opposition parties are attempting to fight back, in part by promoting themselves better. The digital &lt;small>;id&lt;/small>; and payments system for which the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; takes credit was in fact initiated under Congress; Mr Modi oversaw only the final stages of its roll-out but receives endless adulation for it. Schooled by such experiences, opposition parties are trumpeting welfare schemes run by state governments they control.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Kailashings of failings&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The opposition also decries Mr Modi&#39;s failures, including the sudden withdrawal of most banknotes in 2016, the ditching of agricultural reforms after protests in 2021 and a botched response to the pandemic. Several of the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;&#39;s promises, to double farmers&#39; incomes, for example, and to boost manufacturing as a share of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;, remain unmet. By some measures the economy has done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/15/how-strong-is-indias-economy-under-narendra-modi&quot;>;worse under Mr Modi&lt;/a>; than under the previous Congress government.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Another potentially potent line of attack is Mr Modi&#39;s close relationship with a handful of Indian tycoons, especially Gautam Adani, whose conglomerate was accused a year ago of fraud and insider trading by a short-selling firm based in New York (Mr Adani denied the allegations). Indian voters dislike cronyism and punished the previous Congress government after a series of corruption scandals.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https:// www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image /width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format= auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com /cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096, quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets /images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot; https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240120_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class= &quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css tupg4d&quot;>;.css-tupg4d{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);font-size:var(--ds-type- scale--1);font-weight:600;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);}.css-tupg4d del,.css-tupg4d s{-webkit-text-decoration:strikethrough ;text-decoration:strikethrough;}.css-tupg4d strong,.css-tupg4d b{font-weight:700;}.css-tupg4d em,.css-tupg4d i{font-style:italic;}.css-tupg4d sup{font-feature-settings:&#39;sups&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d sub{font-feature-settings:&#39;subs&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d small,.css-tupg4d .small-caps{display:inline ;字体大小：继承；字体变体：小型大写字母 无通用连字 无任意连字 无历史连字 无上下文衬里数字；行高：var(--ds-type-leading- lower);text-transform:lowercase;}.css-tupg4d u,.css-tupg4d .underline{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;text-decoration -thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var (--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago -30);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago -95);颜色:var(--ds-color-london-5);大纲:无;-webkit-text-decoration:下划线;text-decoration:下划线;text-decoration-color:var(--ds- color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:active{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds- color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness: 0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover,.css-tupg4d a:active{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{outline:solid transparent;- webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tupg4d b,.css-tupg4d strong{font-weight:800;}&lt;/style>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-tupg4d e6ii4pq0&quot;>;Under Narendra Modi, the BJP is cleaning up&lt;/span>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: Alicia Tatone/Alamy&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component =&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet the opposition has not landed many punches. That is partly owing to Mr Modi&#39;s reputation for probity. Mainly, however, the opposition has not united around a single message or, critically, a single slate of candidates. Such a seat-sharing agreement could dramatically alter the electoral arithmetic, turning the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>; from the favourite to the underdog in many districts. But it would require strong, decisive party leaders, able to impose unpopular choices on the lower ranks. In Congress&#39;s case, neither Mr Kharge nor Mr Gandhi fits the bill.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some opposition politicians have concluded that, after 25 years of messy coalition governments from 1989 to 2014, India has reverted to the “dominant party system” of the prior four decades. Back then, Congress won big majorities and ruled with few constraints. It often passed laws and constitutional changes to empower the central government and so get its way. It sometimes resorted to abject authoritarianism. Most notably, Indira Gandhi, Rahul&#39;s grandmother, cancelled elections, jailed critics and suspended civil liberties during the Emergency of 1975-77.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The pessimists should remember, however, that India&#39;s democracy managed to correct itself. Mrs Gandhi lifted the Emergency under pressure from courts, students and political allies. She lost the subsequent election, badly. And although Congress soon returned to power, it could not reverse a long-term decline caused largely by its over-reliance on charismatic, centralised leadership. That may be scant comfort for opposition parties facing another drubbing—but it should be food for thought for the &lt;small>;BJP&lt;/small>;. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot;

That is more or less the same as the Porsche Carrera, a German petrol-powered sportscar beloved by adrenalin junkies. Chinese electric vehicles (&lt;small>;ev&lt;/small>;s) are setting new standards for speed—in terms both of how fast they go and of how fast they are spreading around the globe. Already China&#39;s streets are clogged with them. And if Chinese manufacturers have their way, America&#39;s and Europe&#39;s soon will be, too. An industry used to a sedate cycle of marginal improvements is being upended at “China speed”, says Ralf Brandstätter, Volkswagen&#39;s boss in the country.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In 2023, Chinese industry groups claim, China overtook Japan to become the world&#39;s biggest exporter of cars, in part because of surging sales of &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s. In the final quarter of 2023, &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>;, a Chinese firm, surpassed Tesla as the world&#39;s biggest manufacturer of purely battery-powered vehicles, selling 526,000 of them to the American firm&#39;s 484,000. As the shift away from the internal-combustion engine (&lt;small>;ice&lt;/small>;) gathers pace, established carmakers are beginning to worry that Chinese upstarts might run them off the road.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The anxiety is well-founded. Western firms&#39; expertise making &lt;small>;ice&lt;/small>;s counts for little in the electrical age. What is more, the Chinese government has hugely subsidised the &lt;small>;ev&lt;/small>; industry. China dominates the manufacture of electric cars&#39; most critical component, batteries. And China&#39;s vast domestic market allows local firms to benefit from economies of scale.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Chinese firms face some obstacles, too. For starters, many of the country&#39;s new &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; startups are not yet profitable, despite the generous handouts. As their exports increase, the Chinese government may balk at subsidising Western consumers as lavishly as it has Chinese ones. Countervailing subsidies and other protectionist measures are on the rise around the world. And fears that Chinese-made cars might somehow compromise the security of importing countries may also become an impediment to exports. All that notwithstanding, however, it seems all but certain that Chinese &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s will become a big presence on the world&#39;s roads, just as Japanese and South Korean cars did before them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>; shows what China can do. A tech firm that once specialised in batteries, it began making cars in 2003—at first with limited success. Although it managed to become the world&#39;s biggest manufacturer of electric buses, as recently as 2017 it sold only 420,000, mostly &lt;small>;ICE&lt;/small>;, cars. Sales were falling. Last year, however, it sold 3m pure electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles—at a profit. It exports to over 70 countries and on December 22nd announced that it would build an &lt;small>;ev&lt;/small>; factory in Hungary, to serve the European market from within.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Roadkill&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Firms like &lt;small>;byd&lt;/small>; are frightening to foreign carmakers because China has the world&#39;s most developed market for &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s, and local brands dominate it. That is not because foreign carmakers have no presence in the country—far from it. Until recently, firms like Volkswagen and &lt;small>;BMW&lt;/small>; were thriving in China. Since the 1990s they have made and sold lots of cars there through joint ventures with local firms. As these joint ventures grew, China became the world&#39;s biggest producer of cars in 2009. It also became the world&#39;s biggest market and the biggest source of profits for many Western brands. Volkswagen Group, for instance, sold 3.2m cars in China in 2023, around a third of its global sales.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC027.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In 2017 the government allowed Tesla to make cars in China without a local partner. It opened a factory in Shanghai in 2019. This was part of a concerted effort to promote the adoption of &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s, which have quickly become the fastest-growing element of China&#39;s car industry (see chart 1). In November some 42% of car sales in China were either pure battery or hybrids. That is well ahead of both the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>;, at 25% or so, and America, at just 10%. What is more, although the pace is slowing, Chinese &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; sales are still growing fast: by 28% in the third quarter of 2023 compared with a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Most forecasters reckon that by 2030 some 80-90% of cars sold in China will be &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s. And China is now by far the biggest car market in the world, with about 22m passenger vehicles sold in 2022, compared with less than 13m in both America and Europe.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;That is why it alarms foreign carmakers that Chinese brands are pre-eminent in local &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; sales. The Chinese market as a whole remains roughly evenly split between foreign and domestic brands (see chart 2). But for &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s, the ratio is more like 80:20, according to &lt;small>;UBS&lt;/small>;, a Swiss bank. As a result, Volkswagen&#39;s market share in China has slumped, from nearly 20% in 2020 to 14% in 2023. Its share of &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; sales is a puny 3%.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC038.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Chinese firms&#39; advantage stems partly from subsidies for local firms. Government handouts for electric and hybrid vehicles added up to $57bn in 2016-22, says AlixPartners, a consultancy. Rhodium Group, a research firm, estimates that between 2015 and 2020 &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>; alone received $4.3bn via cheap loans and equity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Perhaps just as important was $2.5bn in similar support for &lt;small>;CATL&lt;/small>;, which in 2017 became the world&#39;s biggest manufacturer of the lithium-ion batteries used in most &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s. All told, China now makes 70% of the world&#39;s lithium-ion batteries. Purchase subsidies, which will be worth more than $4,000 a car this year, have also helped the &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; industry. Protectionism has played a part, too: only cars with domestically made batteries are eligible for the purchase subsidies, a rule which in effect shut out Japanese and South Korean competition.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;All this has helped build a vast local supply chain, which now benefits from economies of scale. &lt;small>;VW&lt;/small>; reckons it cuts manufacturing costs by at least 30% by sourcing locally. Chinese-made “infotainment” systems for its cars, for example, are 34% cheaper than older versions bought abroad, even though they have 70% more computing power, says Ludger Lührmann, chief technology officer at &lt;small>;VW&lt;/small>;&#39;s new innovation centre in the city of Hefei.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Low costs mean low prices, which are also kept in check through furious competition. There are around 150 carmakers in China, including foreign brands, big state-owned companies and &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; startups, all vying with one another for market share. Tesla recently initiated a price war, in an effort to sustain sales.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But Chinese &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s are not just cheap, they also enjoy superior technology in some respects. Analysts believe that one of the main ways that brands of &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s will differentiate themselves is by their software and styling. Here China has an edge, because its drivers are so much younger than Western buyers. They value sophisticated infotainment systems with first-rate sound and images. Research from Langston, a consultancy, suggests that they rank &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>; and &lt;small>;NIO&lt;/small>; higher on these measures than Western carmakers, even though they do not consider Chinese &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s safer, more reliable or more comfortable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As Pedro Pacheco of Gartner, another consultancy, points out, Chinese firms are also managed differently. They are less risk averse and move faster than foreign firms, quickly updating tech and introducing new models to keep customers interested. Treating new cars like consumer-tech products, such as smartphones, extends to ditching duds quickly. Li Auto now ceases production of new models in a matter of months if they do not sell well.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; startups such as Li Auto, &lt;small>;NIO&lt;/small>; and Xpeng were all founded by tech billionaires who, like Tesla&#39;s Elon Musk, regard their firms as tech companies that happen to make cars. In fact, lots of Chinese tech firms are getting involved in the car industry. Whereas Apple has mulled such a venture long and indecisively, Xiaomi, a big Chinese smartphone-maker, unveiled its first vehicle in December (a fancy and expensive saloon). It plans to make cheaper models in&amp;nbsp;future with the immodest goal of becoming one of the world&#39;s top five carmakers in 15-20 years. Huawei, a telecoms firm, and Baidu, a search engine, have also teamed up with car firms to make vehicles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Foreign carmakers, in contrast, are struggling to transform into Tesla-like software firms. They are used to the slower cycles of the&lt;small>; ICE&lt;/small>; age. But firms that launch a new model every six or seven years cannot keep pace with buccaneering Chinese rivals, which move almost twice as fast. Foreign firms&#39; habit of “localising” global models with small adaptations for specific markets also results in cars that are far behind Chinese customers&#39; expectations.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Old bangers&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As a result, foreign brands are losing an allure that allowed them to charge double or triple what a Chinese firm might ask for an &lt;small>;ICE&lt;/small>; car. Naturally, they are trying to adapt. Most have long had &lt;small>;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/small>; outposts in China as well as other important locations such as Silicon Valley. &lt;small>;VW&lt;/small>;&#39;s facility in Hefei is one of its main global innovation centres, in part to keep up with the tech demands of Chinese buyers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Foreign firms are also forming new alliances with Chinese ones. &lt;small>;VW&lt;/small>; agreed in July to acquire a 5% stake in Xpeng for $700m. Together they plan to develop two new electric &lt;small>;SUV&lt;/small>;s by 2026, which may help &lt;small>;VW&lt;/small>; regain some of the ground it has lost. It has also struck deals with Horizon Robotics, a Chinese software firm, and Gotion, a Chinese battery-maker.&amp;nbsp;Stellantis (whose largest shareholder owns a stake in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>;) has had little presence in China since a joint venture to make Jeeps folded in 2022. But in October it signed a deal with Leapmotor to make and sell low-cost &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s outside China.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Such is the drubbing foreign firms are receiving at the cheaper end of the market that they may all depart in the next five years, reckons Michael Dunne of Dunne Insights, a consultancy. The fancier German brands, &lt;small>;BMW&lt;/small>; and Mercedes, and Lexus, Toyota&#39;s upmarket arm, may hang on for longer. Dedicated new &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>; platforms, to replace ones shared with &lt;small>;ICE&lt;/small>; models, will be introduced in the next few years, bringing better tech and lower costs. But some analysts see the market as a lost cause: Patrick Hummel of &lt;small>;UBS&lt;/small>; suggests that, instead of throwing money at China to regain market share, firms should just cash in while they still can.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;This grim outlook is especially troubling because, although China&#39;s adoption of &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s has been rapid, the rest of the world is clearly headed in the same direction. The &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; has banned sales of &lt;small>;ICE&lt;/small>; cars from 2035. America is encouraging drivers to switch by offering lavish subsidies of its own. By 2035 &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s should account for perhaps&amp;nbsp;70% of global sales. That would amount to 60m-70m vehicles a year. Chinese firms are already looking to new markets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBC034.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Chart: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Europe is likely to become the next battleground. Chinese firms&#39; models, which are mostly small hatchbacks and &lt;small>;SUV&lt;/small>;s, suit the continent&#39;s motorists. Tariffs of 10% are relatively low and the Chinese already have a foothold. Geely, a big Chinese carmaker, owns several European brands, including Volvo, Lotus and Polestar (an &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;-only spin-off from Volvo). It hopes its European expertise will help it sell Chinese-made&lt;small>; ev&lt;/small>;s from its&amp;nbsp;Lynk&amp;amp;Co and Zeekr brands. &lt;small>;MG&lt;/small>;, which belongs to &lt;small>;SAIC&lt;/small>;, a state-owned carmaker, is Europe&#39;s best-selling pure-electric brand from China. Cars made by &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>;, Great Wall Motors, &lt;small>;NIO&lt;/small>; and Xpeng are on sale in a number of European countries. Other firms, such as HiPhi, are on the way.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;So far the influx is small. Around 40% of Chinese exports in 2023, some 2.2m cars, will have been &lt;small>;ev&lt;/small>;s reckons Canalys, a consultancy. Nonetheless, 9% of the purely battery-powered &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s sold in Europe in the first ten months of 2023 were made by Chinese firms, according to Schmidt Automotive, a data firm. Mass-market European firms such as Renault, Stellantis and &lt;small>;VW&lt;/small>; are struggling to make smaller, cheaper &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s that can compete both with &lt;small>;ICE&lt;/small>; equivalents and Chinese imports. &lt;small>;VW&lt;/small>;&#39;s &lt;small>;ID&lt;/small>;.3 and Tesla&#39;s Model 3 are both about 15% more expensive in Europe than &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>;&#39;s Seal, a midsized saloon that is bigger and arguably better. In China the Seal costs less than half what it does in Europe but is still profitable. Even taking into account shipping costs and tariffs, &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>; could cut prices in Europe and still make money. Thanks to such arithmetic, &lt;small>;UBS&lt;/small>; thinks Chinese carmakers&#39; market share in Europe could rise from 3% in 2022 to 20% in 2030.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Chinese carmakers will face obstacles on their advance into Europe. Most of their brands are unknown to European consumers. Winning customers away from firms with a loyal following, such as &lt;small>;BMW&lt;/small>; and Mercedes, will be especially tricky. Establishing a retail network, either through direct sales or dealers, takes time and money. So does setting up after-sale servicing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;These expensive tasks will be especially onerous for the many Chinese &lt;small>;ev&lt;/small>; startups that are losing money. Fast introduction of new models has its downside. Costs have to be amortised over a much shorter period than is typical in the industry, says Mr Hummel. Bernstein, a broker, reckons that&amp;nbsp;Li Auto might report a profit for 2023 but that &lt;small>;NIO&lt;/small>; and Xpeng will lose money for the next few years. &lt;small>;NIO&lt;/small>; has already had a state bail-out, is said to lose $35,000 per sale and in November said it would lay off 10% of its employees.&amp;nbsp;(Although in December it secured $2.2bn from an investment fund from the United Arab Emirates.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The consolidation of the industry that China&#39;s government has long desired looks inevitable. In the long run, however, that should create a clutch of stronger firms, better able to compete internationally. Mr Hummel thinks China will eventually&amp;nbsp;end up with 10-12 firms making over 1m cars, some of which will go global.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Speedtraps&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Chinese exporters may find that European governments put roadblocks in their way. In December France introduced a new subsidy scheme that favours cars made in Europe and Italy is considering doing the same. The European Commission initiated an investigation of state subsidies for Chinese car firms in October, which could lead to an increase in tariffs.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;An employee works on an assembly line producing electric vehicles at Dongfeng Motor&#39;s Voyah Automobile factory in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240113_FBP001.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css tupg4d&quot;>;.css-tupg4d{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:600;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);}.css-tupg4d del,.css-tupg4d s{-webkit-text-decoration:strikethrough;text-decoration:strikethrough;}.css-tupg4d strong,.css-tupg4d b{font-weight:700;}.css-tupg4d em,.css-tupg4d i{font-style:italic;}.css-tupg4d sup{font-feature-settings:&#39;sups&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d sub{font-feature-settings:&#39;subs&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d small,.css-tupg4d .small-caps{display:inline;font-size:inherit;font-variant:small-caps no-common-ligatures no-discretionary-ligatures no-historical-ligatures no-contextual lining-nums;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;}.css-tupg4d u,.css-tupg4d .underline{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);outline:none;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:active{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover,.css-tupg4d a:active{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{outline:solid transparent;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tupg4d b,.css-tupg4d strong{font-weight:800;}&lt;/style>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-tupg4d e6ii4pq0&quot;>;Coming soon to a street near you&lt;/span>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Photograph: Getty Images&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet these protectionist measures are unlikely to halt Chinese firms&#39; advance. Higher tariffs are not “live or die”, according to Lihong Qin, a co-founder of &lt;small>;NIO&lt;/small>;. Europe&#39;s carmakers are not baying for them. China remains a big market for most of them, and they worry about retaliatory measures. Moreover, cars exported from European firms&#39; factories in China would also be hit by higher tariffs. Even Stellantis, whose boss, Carlos Tavares, warns of a “terrible fight” with the Chinese and once loudly called for protection, is critical of the probe. It may be worried about the implications for its tie-up with Leapmotor.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Higher tariffs may also prompt more Chinese firms to start making cars in Europe. &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>; is said to be planning at least one more factory in Europe in addition to the one in Hungary. Japanese and South Korean car firms started to thrive abroad only after they localised production. This strategy, argues Bernstein, not only makes it easier to cater to local tastes, but also “brings local governments and local defenders on-board”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even America&#39;s efforts to slam the door on China&#39;s car firms may not succeed. It levies tariffs of 27.5% on imported &lt;small>;EV&lt;/small>;s and restricts purchase subsidies to vehicles that are made in America. But Chinese carmakers are making inroads in Mexico, a country with a free-trade agreement with America. Their market share has roared ahead, from 0.5% in 2016 to 20% today. &lt;small>;NAFTA&lt;/small>;&#39;s rules-of-origin requirements prevent vehicles made in China from being re-exported to the United States duty-free. But there is nothing to stop Chinese firms from building factories in Mexico. Several of them, including &lt;small>;BYD&lt;/small>;, Geely and &lt;small>;SAIC&lt;/small>; are nosing around for locations. As long as the putative factories used enough locally made parts, their output would escape America&#39;s prohibitive tariffs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Again, building factories and setting up supply chains takes time. It took Japanese and South Korean carmakers decades to establish themselves in America and Europe and win the trust of local consumers. Chinese firms appear to be making faster progress. But whether they arrive at “China speed” or simply very quickly, Chinese cars are on their way. The monitors that are often fitted to new cars to detect if a driver is nodding off should be pinging urgently in Western carmakers&#39;&amp;nbsp;boardrooms. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/11/western-firms-are-quaking-as-chinas-electric-car-industry-speeds-up<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g0fqlgos2rk9ioo6u07gpt9glq4tgb8a</guid><pubDate> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 10:52:13 GMT</pubDate><category>中国</category></item><item><title>Joe Biden&#39;s chances do not look good.

The most recent to do so was Lyndon Johnson, in 1968. And that is a year that his party, the Democrats, would rather forget. Johnson was unpopular. The country and the party were divided by the Vietnam war and the civil-rights movement. After a surprisingly strong challenge in the first primary, he stood aside, only to unleash chaos. One of the leading candidates to replace him, Robert Kennedy, was assassinated. The nomination was eventually awarded by party grandees to a man who had not won a single primary, Hubert Humphrey. In the end the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, who had been widely considered unelectable at the beginning of the year, won convincingly. He went on to do more damage to the presidency than anyone bar the Republicans&#39; likely candidate this year, Donald Trump.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Trump, too, should be unelectable, owing to the 91 felonies with which he has been charged in different parts of America. Yet Joe Biden, the incumbent president, is so unpopular he may well lose to Mr Trump. There have been occasional calls for Mr Biden to step aside, like Johnson. But there is no sign that he is willing to do so and no guarantee that the Democrats would end up with a stronger candidate if he did. For that reason, although many Democratic operatives have grave misgivings about his candidacy, most are keeping quiet. As one puts it, if you&#39;re all stuck on a boat of questionable seaworthiness, it is natural to wish for a finer vessel, but unproductive to poke holes in the hull or stoke a mutiny.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Whitmer and wisdom&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is Mr Biden&#39;s feeble polling that is seeding the angst. &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-republican-primaries-tracker&quot;>;poll tracker for the Republican primary&lt;/a>; puts Mr Trump more than 50 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival, making him the prohibitive favourite. A polling average for the general election compiled by RealClearPolitics shows Mr Trump ahead of Mr Biden by a margin of 2.3 percentage points. This is well above his showing in the past two presidential contests, in which he consistently lagged in the polls. At this point in 2016 Mr Trump&#39;s support was seven points lower: he trailed Hillary Clinton by a margin of five points. At this point in 2020 he trailed Mr Biden by five points.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;With most states so partisan that they are not worth contesting, the presidential campaign will be centred on six where the outcome is actually uncertain: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Early polling in these states also shows Mr Biden several points behind. And some Democrats fear that these polls may be underestimating Mr Trump&#39;s support, because his conspiracy-minded voters may not be open with those taking the surveys.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;931&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC827.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Underpinning Mr Trump&#39;s strength is a broad political shift. Partisan allegiance in America may seem hysterically entrenched, but in fact it is mutable. White working-class voters powered Mr Trump to victory in 2016; in the years since, the non-white working class has begun to shift, too. Between 2016 and 2020 Hispanic Americans, once fairly loyal Democratic voters, moved 18 points towards the Republicans. Black men are also slowly peeling away from the Democrats. Only the influx of white college graduates has kept the Democratic Party competitive nationally. These demographic trends are sizeable enough to determine the outcome of the election if they persist—and they do appear to be. The latest polls indicate higher support for Mr Trump among African-American and Hispanic voters than he enjoyed in 2020 (see chart 1). “It seems like the 2024 polls right now are 2020 trends carried forward,” says Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Secular trends aside, there is plainly a problem with Mr Biden himself. The president&#39;s net approval rating is -16 points, according to several public polling averages. That is notably worse than Mr Trump&#39;s at this point in his presidency. Voters are worried about his fitness for office. One of YouGov&#39;s weekly polls for &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; in December found that 55% of Americans think that the 81-year-old Mr Biden&#39;s health and age “severely limit his ability to do the job” of president, including 25% of Democrats. Only 24% of Americans want him to run for president again. Fully 61% of them do not, including 38% of those who voted for him in 2020.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Americans are only marginally more enthusiastic about the 77-year-old Mr Trump&#39;s revenge bid for the White House, but they are much less likely to think that he is too old or frail to resume the office. Mr Biden, after all, did not do much campaigning in 2020, owing to the pandemic. He does not seem to relish the arduous campaign ahead, whereas Mr Trump appears to like nothing better than rambling on in front of adoring crowds. Four years ago Mr Biden reportedly toyed with promising to remain in office for just a single term. “If Trump wasn&#39;t running, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be running,” he said to a room full of donors in December. When asked how many other Democrats could beat Mr Trump, he said, “Probably 50 of them…I&#39;m not the only one who could defeat him. But I will defeat him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;There is almost no chance that Mr Biden will voluntarily abandon his re-election bid. He sees himself as a divinely appointed Trumpbuster and believes his electoral record reflects that. First he vanquished Mr Trump in 2020. Then in the midterm elections of 2022, when Republicans had expected to deliver a terrible rebuke to Democrats, the Democrats&#39; support held up surprisingly well.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Biden&#39;s supporters, naturally, express great confidence. “If you play poker, which I do, you&#39;d rather have our cards than their cards,” says Jim Messina, the manager of Barack Obama&#39;s successful re-election bid in 2012—although he admits, “This thing will be really close ”。 The campaign argues that the president has been underestimated before, as in the hotly contested Democratic primary of 2020, when he looked fatally unpopular before suddenly becoming the consensus candidate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Campaign staffers point to the mid-terms as proof that Republican candidates who champion abortion and reject the election results of 2020 will fare poorly. They argue, correctly, that polls conducted ten months from an election are a poor guide to the outcome. Most voters will not devote much thought to the election for months and the billion-dollar campaign machines are only just gearing up. When Americans are paying more attention, the campaign insists, the spectacle of Mr Trump shuttling between rallies and court appearances will remind Americans of the chaos of his time in office.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Biden&#39;s polling deficit is not insurmountable. Bidenworld also thinks that, with time, voters will give the president more credit for his achievements. The labour market is robust, unemployment is low and wage growth is strongest at the bottom of the income distribution, reducing wage inequality. Inflation, which has infuriated many voters, is abating without a recession. YouGov&#39;s polling for &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; suggests Americans are unduly gloomy: 58% think the country has high unemployment (it does not); 44% think the country is in a recession (it is not); and 40% think inflation will be higher in six months (quite unlikely). The Democrats are hoping that voters will notice that the economy is doing better than they thought by election day. But Republicans keep talking about “Bidenomics” as a pejorative, suggesting that they doubt the topic will end up helping the president.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Biden&#39;s apologists also argue, in effect, that he will win because he must. “We&#39;re going to win because democracy and freedom and the very ideas that make America America are on the line. We have no other choice,” says Quentin Fulks, his deputy campaign manager.&lt;i>; &lt;/i>;They see a battle for the very “soul of the nation”, as Mr Biden often says. This is a stirring appeal, but only for the converted. A new study by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group finds that Americans like to invoke democratic norms to chide someone from the opposing party, but are willing to suspend them when it comes to their own preferred candidate. Mr Trump is also muddying things by deploying apocalyptic rhetoric of his own: he has recently taken to calling Mr Biden “the destroyer of American democracy”. Republicans in Congress may pursue a farcical impeachment inquiry against Mr Biden in order to claim that both men are equally disreputable.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Newsom fine day&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Anyway, the end-of-days argument cuts both ways. It could be used to assert that the Democrats cannot risk as weak a candidate as Mr Biden. The party has plenty of non-geriatric politicians who could helm a presidential ticket. The problem is that none of them has dared to enter the primaries, in part for fear that they would not be able to beat Mr Biden and instead would only harm his chances in the general election. Only little-known politicians such as Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, have put themselves forward. “President Biden—a man I respect and I think a person of decency and integrity—is perhaps one of the only Democrats who could lose and probably will lose to Donald Trump,” explains Mr Phillips. He says he is merely saying “the quiet part out loud” about the president&#39;s advanced age and unpopularity.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As reasonable as Mr Phillips&#39;s criticisms may be, his challenge looks doomed (“keep the faith” is one of his catchphrases). He could score unexpectedly highly in the New Hampshire primary, to be held on January 23rd, which Mr Biden is boycotting over a scheduling spat within the Democratic Party. Thereafter, things will be harder. Some states, such as Florida, have in effect cancelled their Democratic primaries altogether, declaring that there is only one qualified candidate. The difficulty of getting on the ballot prompted Robert Kennedy junior, the son of the candidate assassinated in 1968, to abandon an attempt to stand in the primaries against Mr Biden and instead try to get on the ballot in the general election as a third-party candidate.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBC769.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Even if more plausible candidates saw any hope of defeating Mr Biden, they are too late to initiate a serious primary challenge. The deadlines to file as a candidate in the primary have already passed in more than 20 states, and several more loom in early January. In recent years the primary calendar has become much more compressed: most of the almost 4,000 ordinary delegates will be allocated by the end of March (see chart 2), giving an insurgent candidate very little time to gain any momentum.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;All of which suggests that Mr Biden will easily secure his party&#39;s nomination. It is possible, of course, that he might be forced to step aside by what pundits politely call a “health event”. But such an outcome would not necessarily be providential for the Democrats. As when Johnson declared in 1968, “I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president”, pandemonium would probably follow. The party might have to rewrite the rules of the primaries, to allow more candidates late access to the ballot, but even so, the campaign would presumably be nasty, brutish and short. Only a few candidates, with the resources to crank up an electoral machine at short notice, would be able to compete.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Harris teeters&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Kamala Harris, the vice-president, would be the presumptive nominee, with the institutional support of the party behind her and perhaps even Mr Biden&#39;s endorsement. Democrats are a hierarchical bunch. The last time they denied a vice-president seeking the presidential nomination was in 1952. The unfortunate man was Harry Truman&#39;s deputy, Alben Barkley, a septuagenarian whose abysmal eyesight required documents to be set in inch-tall font.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But Ms Harris, who ran a disastrous campaign for the presidency in 2020 that ended before the first votes were cast, would almost certainly attract challengers. Only 36% of Americans think she is qualified to be president, according to YouGov. Only 23% think she would beat Mr Trump (including 43% of those who voted for Mr Biden in 2020 and just 3% of Trump voters). Although it would be awkward in an identity-conscious party to attempt to step over the first black and the first female vice-president, some rivals would probably be willing to take the plunge.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240106_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: Mark Harris&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, is plainly clamouring for the chance to be president, although he denies it, and has built a formidable political machine. The governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, has both ambition and an inherited fortune worth billions. But the moderate governors whom many Democrats see as best-placed to take on Mr Trump—such as Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan—might not have enough money to hand to compete properly in a suddenly open primary or enough time to build a viable campaign. The biggest political talents in Mr Biden&#39;s cabinet, such as Pete Buttigieg, the secretary of transportation, and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, would probably have to resign if they wanted to enter the fray. A coronation of Ms Harris might simply be unavoidable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;If Mr Biden were forced to abandon his bid for the White House after lots of primaries had concluded, the confusion would be all the more intense. The big parties&#39; rules for nominating a candidate are fiendishly complicated, but in essence they require a majority of delegates to back the winner at a national convention. For Democrats this will be held in Chicago in August—the same city as the traumatic convention of 1968, where police brutally dispersed anti-war protesters outside while bewildered delegates debated the way forward inside. Normally, most delegates are “pledged” meaning that they are expected to reflect the outcome of the primary in their home state. But if they are pledged to a candidate who is no longer in the race they are treated much as “superdelegates”, the 746 party grandees who get to vote as they please.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;If Mr Biden were to withdraw after winning a big share of delegates, candidates to replace him would be forced to woo the party&#39;s patricians rather than its plebeians. The convention would revert from its present form—a four-day bout of pageantry—to its old-fashioned format: four days of haggling in smoke-filled rooms. Hans Noel, a political scientist at Georgetown University, argues that a contested convention is more likely to produce a candidate able to unite a fractious modern party than the current “sports tournament” system. But most Democratic operatives think the party would emerge more divided rather than united after such tumult. American voters, too, are unused to such machinations. They have not witnessed such a contested convention since 1976, when Republican grandees plumped for Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;If Mr Biden fell ill and were unable to contest the election after securing the nomination in August, the Democratic National Committee, which consists of a few hundred party operatives, would decide who to place at the top of the ticket. Such a meeting has only been required once before, in 1972, when the Democrats&#39; vice-presidential candidate, Thomas Eagleton, had to withdraw after revelations that he had suffered from depression and received electroshock therapy. Again, it is likely that the crown would pass in this instance to Ms Harris. Mr Biden appears loyal to her as his running-mate. Yet her shakiness as a candidate is thought to be one of the reasons Mr Biden is reluctant to bow out.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Biden&#39;s swooning poll numbers leave the Democrats in a miserable predicament. The alternatives that might still be possible are not obviously preferable. When asked whether it would be better if Mr Biden withdrew, the party&#39;s preferred public-relations strategy is to pretend that the idea is absurd. Mr Biden&#39;s staffers tell heroic stories about the punishing days he routinely endures and insist that he is so alert, informed and mentally agile that the reporter asking the awkward questions “couldn&#39;t survive a ten-minute policy briefing with the president”. What they really mean is that there is no Plan &lt;small>;B&lt;/small>;. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;i>;Stay on top of American politics with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance&quot;>;Checks and Balance&lt;/a>;, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter examining the state of American democracy, and read other articles about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/us-election-2024&quot;>;the elections of 2024&lt;/a>;.&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/c9afnf98s4qqnm5bah8lgadbsua4u0c2</guid><pubDate> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 09:50:22 GMT</pubDate><category>美国</category><category>选举</category><category>乔·拜登</category></item><item><title>Brexit?哈！ Lockdowns?耸耸肩！ Can nothing stop London?</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A pigeon flies in front of a crowd outside in Trafalgar Square, London.&quot;

&lt;/b>;partner took over the Eagle on Farringdon Road, Britain was in recession. Undeterred, they bought mismatched crockery from car-boot sales, removed the fruit machine and darts board and installed an open-plan kitchen and a blackboard menu. The pub was relaunched in January 1991.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In the decades since, the struggles and success of the Eagle—reputedly Britain&#39;s first “gastropub”—have encapsulated those of London itself. At first its Mediterranean dishes were novel; but as the city&#39;s tastes and population diversified, its formula of refined but affordable grub was widely imitated. The Eagle was unruffled by the financial crash of 2007-09; it scraped through covid-19 and its devastating social-distancing rules. For a venue that has always hired migrants from Europe, says Mr Belben, Brexit may prove “a dreadful problem”. But not yet.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;“It&#39;s amazing how resilient we are,” he concludes. The same can be said of London. In the early 1990s a city that had seemed to be on the skids was rejuvenated. After shrinking by over a fifth since the second world war, the population began to grow. Enterprising foreigners poured in. The economy boomed, fuelled by financial deregulation, European integration and communism&#39;s collapse. By the time it hosted the Olympic games in 2012, London had a fair claim to be the capital of the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Cue a perfect storm of woes that threatened to capsize cities in general and London in particular. Already its mercantile heart had been shocked by the financial crisis. Then a cosmopolis that runs on immigration faced the shuttering of Brexit and the pandemic barred tourists from one of the planet&#39;s most visited places.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A boy stands holding a basketball in front of flats in Peckham, London&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;3194&quot; height=&quot;4000&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBP003.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css tupg4d&quot;>;.css-tupg4d{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:600;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);}.css-tupg4d del,.css-tupg4d s{-webkit-text-decoration:strikethrough;text-decoration:strikethrough;}.css-tupg4d strong,.css-tupg4d b{font-weight:700;}.css-tupg4d em,.css-tupg4d i{font-style:italic;}.css-tupg4d sup{font-feature-settings:&#39;sups&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d sub{font-feature-settings:&#39;subs&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d small,.css-tupg4d .small-caps{display:inline;font-size:inherit;font-variant:small-caps no-common-ligatures no-discretionary-ligatures no-historical-ligatures no-contextual lining-nums;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;}.css-tupg4d u,.css-tupg4d .underline{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);outline:none;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:active{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover,.css-tupg4d a:active{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{outline:solid transparent;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tupg4d b,.css-tupg4d strong{font-weight:800;}&lt;/style>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-tupg4d e6ii4pq0&quot;>;Passing through Peckham&lt;/span>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Photograph: Max Miechowski&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet like the Eagle, London is thriving—a hardiness that holds lessons for cities everywhere. Its globalised economy has weathered Britain&#39;s exit from the European Union far better than doomsayers had predicted. For all the political bluster on immigration, it remains a magnet for ambitious newcomers. And it is better-placed than many cities to absorb the disruptions of covid-19. Traverse London from south to north and west to east, and you find that its biggest challenges are the results of its dynamism rather than decline. Begin in the south London neighbourhood of Peckham.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A regal woman in ceremonial Yoruba attire rides a horse down Peckham&#39;s high street. Youngsters playing basketball and shoppers at west African grocers watch in wonder (with classic London insouciance, some don&#39;t bat an eyelid). Adeyemi Michael&#39;s short film, recently on show at the South London Gallery in Peckham, honoured the Nigerians who began thronging to this part of the capital in the 1970s, earning it the nickname “Little Lagos”.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Southern crossroads&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;You can still eat knockout jollof rice at Lolak Afrique, a café just off Peckham&#39;s main drag. But the neighbourhood, and London&#39;s Nigerian community, are changing. As cocktail bars and sushi restaurants have moved in, the Nigerians have spread out, their numbers falling in Southwark, the borough which includes Peckham, and rising elsewhere. London has never been as ethnically segregated as some American cities; as analysis by Gemma Catney of Queen&#39;s University Belfast shows, it has become progressively less so over the past few decades, the black African population dispersing especially fast.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As it spreads, London&#39;s Nigerian population is growing. In the past couple of years post-Brexit immigration policies have admitted many more students and workers (largely in health care) from beyond Europe. In the year to June 2023, 141,000 Nigerians moved to Britain, more than the total from the entire &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>;, to which there is now net emigration.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On December 4th the government announced plans to cut immigration. But so far, at least, the fear that Brexit might stem the flow of migrants to London has not been realised. In one of Brexit&#39;s ironies, other arrivals have more than compensated for the shortfall of Europeans. Partly as a result, London&#39;s population, which dipped during the pandemic, is nudging 9m and is expected to hit 10m by 2040. Taking into account the inflow of skills and students, says Jonathan Portes of King&#39;s College London, Brexit&#39;s effect on the city “has if anything been positive”, in terms of immigration, at least. It remains “a roost for every bird”, as Benjamin Disraeli wrote in 1870.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Nor does the latest influx into what was already a spectacularly diverse city seem to have stirred much tension. According to Ipsos, a pollster, Londoners are more than twice as likely as Parisians to say immigrants have had a positive impact on their home town. Suella Braverman, twice forced out as home secretary in Conservative governments, recently claimed multiculturalism has “failed”. She is walking proof of the opposite: a Buddhist brought up in London by parents from Mauritius and Kenya, she found a Jewish husband and rose to one of the highest offices in the land. The London dream, you might call it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In another widely predicted way, Brexit has indeed bruised London: by damaging the City, an engine of growth already beleaguered by the financial crisis and the rise of other hubs. Yet as at the Eagle, the consequences have, so far, been manageable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Brexit&#39;s overall costs will be felt as much in things that don&#39;t happen—internships forgone, romances that never blossom—as in those that do. The same goes for its impact on the City, says William Wright of New Financial, a think-tank. He points to the hundreds of new jobs created in Paris by American investment banks, which in different circumstances would probably have come to London. As for things that have happened: London&#39;s share of new listings, and of trade in European equities and derivatives, has dwindled.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Still, relatively few existing jobs have been relocated from the City because of Brexit. The latest estimate by &lt;small>;EY&lt;/small>;, a consultancy, is around 7,000, far lower than the tens of thousands once anticipated. The City will no longer be the default financial centre &lt;i>;for &lt;/i>;Europe, predicts Mr Wright; but because of its status in global financial markets, it is set to remain the dominant hub &lt;i>;in&lt;/i>; Europe. It is big enough to cope.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 4nk67h&quot;>;.css-4nk67h{width:100%;display:block;height:auto;}&lt;/style>;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://infographics.economist.com/2023/20231216_FBM970/&quot; title=&quot;Most common ethnicity excluding white British, in London&#39;s wards, 2021&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;css-4nk67h e14263u30&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Besides sheer size, the City and the rest of London enjoy two other advantages in Brexit&#39;s aftermath. The first is that they already did lots of business with the world beyond Europe, receiving copious foreign direct investment (&lt;small>;FDI&lt;/small>;) from America especially. London has become even more reliant on American investment since Brexit, observes Riccardo Crescenzi of the London School of Economics (&lt;small>;lse&lt;/small>;). Worryingly, when downsizing and divestment are included, in 2021 there was a net outflow of foreign capital from both London and Britain for the first time since 1984. Even so, says Professor Crescenzi, London is still the top city in Europe for new &lt;small>;FDI&lt;/small>; projects.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The other plus is that the industries in which London specialises—not just finance but law, accounting, consulting, the media and higher education—have been less hampered by post-Brexit rules than other sectors. Between 2016 and 2021 London&#39;s exports of services grew by 47%, notes Emily Fry of the Resolution Foundation, another think-tank; for the rest of Britain the rise was just 4%. Places that import parts and export goods have suffered more Brexit-related costs and bureaucracy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The momentum of the tech scene, in particular, is too strong to be “stopped in its tracks”, insists Brent Hoberman, a tech guru and investor. Because of Brexit “we have to be more paranoid” about competition, but, he reckons, London remains the best place to start a tech firm in Europe. American venture capitalists are still keen. The record supports his confidence: London has produced more tech unicorns than its three nearest European rivals—Berlin, Paris and Stockholm—combined.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Unhobbled hub&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Its perennial virtues—the time zone, English language and rule of law—are reinforced by the proximity of top universities and an abundance of skills and capital. Babs Ogundeyi, the founder of Kuda, a fintech firm based in London, says savvy local angel investors helped attract more capital. Kuda runs a digital-only bank in Nigeria and a remittance service for Africans in Britain. For all Brexit&#39;s hassles, Mr Ogundeyi notes, it has led to closer ties to Africa.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The upshot is another irony of Brexit; you might also call it karma or poetic justice. London, the only region of England that in the referendum of 2016 voted to stay in the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>;, has fared better than regions that wanted to leave. For overlapping reasons, it has bounced back faster from the pandemic. Head to north London to see why.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Sally north&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On a chilly evening at Arsenal&#39;s football stadium, the club&#39;s new anthem rings around the ground: “North London for ever/Whatever the weather/These streets are our own.” It is a sentimental but affecting tune, especially after the lockdown months in which spectators were barred. Now the stadium is packed; Gunnersaurus, the team&#39;s mascot, is high-fiving young fans. The faithful are loudly outraged by lunging tackles on their hero, the winger Bukayo Saka (he duly scores).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Like the carousing at the Eagle, London&#39;s entertainment economy is buoyant again after the deathly doldrums of covid-19. Its seven Premier League football clubs project soft power around the globe. Tourism has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels, boosted by a rise in American visitors. The Society of London Theatre says audiences are up. On some weekends the Tube is busier than in 2019.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;All told, London&#39;s nimble economy has recovered much more strongly than has the rest of the country&#39;s. Like other cities, it faces obstacles in the post-covid world. But it is better equipped for them than many.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Already under pressure from online shopping, some retail districts are struggling—notably Oxford Street, which this year looks somewhat bedraggled beneath its Christmas lights. Along with a rise in rough sleeping, vacant shops have contributed to a dilapidated air in parts of central London. By some accounts, however, the main threat to its pizzazz is Londoners&#39; reluctance to return to the office full-time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;One Triton Square, an office tower a mile from the Eagle, near Regent&#39;s Park, is an emblem of this trend. It stands in a snazzy development with all the modish appurtenances of a modern office complex, including a climbing wall and an art gallery. But the building is empty. Lights blink eerily in the dark atrium; the escalators are frozen. Earlier this year Meta, the parent company of Facebook, paid a whopping fee to cancel its lease on the tower before it even moved in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The ghostly building is not unique. Vacancy rates in commercial property in central London are high, in part because—as elsewhere, only more so—people are loth to kick the working-from-home (&lt;small>;WFH&lt;/small>;) habit acquired during the pandemic. A recent survey for the Centre for Cities, also a think-tank, found that, on average, workers in central London were in the office 2.3 days per week, less than other Britons. Of 32 countries surveyed for research by Nick Bloom of Stanford University, British workers stayed home more than any bar Canadians. Taken together, these findings imply Londoners are among the most absent workers anywhere.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Face-to-face interactions are good for productivity, already stalling in London before the pandemic. Low office attendance could in time deter foreign investors. Then again, in a &lt;small>;WFH&lt;/small>; future, London has enticements that other places lack.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;A three-days-a-week office will have to look different from the antediluvian sort: more flexible and alluring. Yet networking, transport and entertainment possibilities mean the case for keeping a central-London &lt;small>;HQ&lt;/small>; is stronger than for having a satellite office. Notably, the &lt;small>;WFH&lt;/small>; culture has not led armies of Londoners to retreat beyond striking distance of the workplace. Most inner Londoners who moved home between the summers of 2021 and 2022 circulated around the city,&lt;b>; &lt;/b>;rather than fleeing it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0 &quot;>;It has brushed off another crisis that some thought would nobble it: the war in Ukraine and ensuing sanctions on Russia&#39;s elite, who had brought joy to London&#39;s libel lawyers, estate agents,&lt;small>; PR&lt;/small>; firms and football fans 。 For all their notoriety and flamboyance, their largesse was always less important than that from China and the Middle East, says Oliver Bullough, author of “Butler to the World”, an exposé of Britain&#39;s services to kleptocracy. In any case, plenty of other high-rollers still call London home, or one of them. (For an Ozymandian monument to London&#39;s indulgence of oligarchs, stroll west from Harrods and look out for a disused Tube station. In 2014 the government sold it for £53m—$87m at the time—to Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian tycoon wanted in America on charges of alleged corruption, which he denies.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;London, after all, has absorbed all manner of shocks in its 2,000-year history. Its most precarious period, considers Tony Travers of the &lt;small>;lse&lt;/small>;, came after the Romans left in the fifth century &lt;small>;AD&lt;/small>;. The Black Death killed much of its population in the 1340s; the Great Fire of 1666 razed swathes of it. A port city that adapted to the decline of its port, it was also an imperial capital that acclimatised to the loss of empire. It defied the Blitz of 1940-41—when, rather than sheltering in the Tube as urban myth has it, most Londoners simply slept at home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;That phlegmatism is one of London&#39;s abiding traits. Its biggest worries now may not be external threats but the repercussions of success. Moscow, Paris, Seoul, Tokyo: other cities dominate both the politics and economies of their country. Even so, London stands out for its grip on government, finance, media and the arts (worlds that collide at the Eagle, a watering hole for moneymen and media types and home to an art gallery). Equally glaring are the differences in the demography and outlook of Londoners and their compatriots.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;At the last count, disposable household income per person was 43% higher in London than in the country as a whole. Londoners are younger, more left-wing and far more diverse: ethnic minorities account for 46% of residents, over double the proportion in England and Wales. Two-fifths of Londoners were born abroad. Contrary to its reputation in the shires as a latter-day Gomorrah, on average London is slightly more socially conservative and less boozy than other regions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For that, thank its immigrants, many of whom are devout. They have also helped raise standards in London&#39;s schools, which this century have been transformed from the worst-performing of any English region to the best. For a close-up look at that phenomenon, go west.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Known as “Little India”, the western suburb of Southall is studded with Punjabi and Afghan restaurants, mosques and Sikh temples. Nathan Walters, head of the local Featherstone High School, says 85% of its pupils use another language at home. Almost a third receive free school meals (a standard measure of poverty). Whether or not they speak English themselves, parents are “unfailingly positive” about education; results far outstrip the national average. Proximity to opportunity is a motivation, says Mr Walters. Pupils “can almost see it from their bedroom windows”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;London&#39;s dominance, and voracity for people and capital, have been concerns for centuries. Over 400 years ago King James I griped, “Soon, London will be all England.” In the 19th century it was dubbed “the great wen” (cyst).

As a recent parliamentary report noted, for instance, schemes to shift civil-service jobs to the regions are reliably launched every ten to 15 years. Often such efforts involve constraining London&#39;s growth in hope of diverting it elsewhere. A good example was a misguided rule of 1964 (since discarded) that in effect banned new office developments in central London.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Too often, policies have corseted the capital without boosting other places—and have wound up punishing everyone.

Home, for her, is one of 26 houses in a beguiling development in Stratford, in the east London borough of Newham. Set amid unlovely 20th-century estates, the units, some of them public housing, form what looks like a Moorish citadel, with turrets and crenellations but also welcoming arches, balconies and a tree-lined central courtyard.

Newham&#39;s council, he recalls, initially expected a design for a block of flats. Instead he emulated the Georgian terraces that are the acme of efficient London housing, with a distinctive twist. &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Clogged roads, air pollution, long and pricey commutes, a discredited police force—inevitably London suffers from many big-city ailments. Compared with their compatriots, Londoners report a low sense of neighbourhood belonging; as is common amid such hurly-burly, life can feel lonely and atomised. (“It is strange with how little notice”, wrote Charles Dickens, “a man may live and die in London.”)&lt;b>; &lt;/b>;But the most acute problem, and most enduring, is the scarcity and cost of housing—and it is sharpest, and most intransigent, in the East End.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Orient compress&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In late Victorian times the East End was known as “the empire of hunger” and “the city of dreadful night”. Today overcrowding in Newham runs at double the rate for the city, itself more than double the national average. The basic causes of the shortage are a failure over decades to provide sufficient new homes and to use space as imaginatively as does Mr Barber.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The result has been at once inevitable and stunning. James Carville, an American political strategist, once joked that he&#39;d like to be reincarnated as the bond market, because then he could intimidate everybody. Another good choice would be to come back as the London house price: perhaps only the city&#39;s brazen foxes can match its indestructibility. True, a finance-driven boom that lasted two decades has recently flattened, but at a dizzying plateau.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading =&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com /cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32, quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets /images/20231216_FBC747.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 64w, https:/ /www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/ image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format =auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747. png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 384w, https://www.economist. com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600 ,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content- assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 960w, https: //www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi /image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80, format=auto/content-assets/images/20231216_FBC747.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/ images/20231216_FBC747.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/ figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In 2020 the average house in the capital sold for over 13 times average earnings, almost double the ratio two decades earlier (see chart 2）。 A two-bedroom flat near the Eagle will set you back around £1m. Since 1981, meanwhile, the share of Londoners living in public housing has fallen from over a third to a fifth. Rents in the private sector have soared: in 2022 the median rent was 35% of median income. As Jack Brown of King&#39;s College London says, the city “has never been quite this big or quite this expensive”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;All this means the perception of Londoners as wealthy is incomplete. It is a rich city with many poor people. Factor in housing costs and the poverty rate is higher than in the rest of England. Eight times as many London households live in temporary accommodation as in the country overall. The most affluent decile has nearly ten times the income of the poorest. Because of London&#39;s unusually integrated economic geography, deprived and well-heeled families rub shoulders more than in Paris or New York, pound shops abutting artisan bakeries on the high street.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-5&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Complaints about how packed London is, notes Professor Travers, recall the old joke of the restaurant that is so crowded, no one wants to go there any more. Still, the pandemic may open up solutions to this age-old problem. In a place with an oversupply of offices and a deficit of homes, it would make sense, where possible, to repurpose commercial buildings as residential ones. More than ever, in an age of hybrid work it is time to build on some of the protected land of the “green belt”, starting with existing commuter corridors.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Something like this happened after crises of yore. Christopher Wren reimagined the city in the ashes of the Great Fire. Idealistic urban planners did so again in the rubble of the Blitz. The evidence of the past few years, and of the past two millennia, is that London—one of the world&#39;s greatest cities, and perhaps its most resilient—will find a way to cope, and to thrive. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/12/14/brexit-hah-lockdowns-shrug-can-nothing-stop-london<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/0uj96uc0a8884cmmdc2d1p9f3jire2kt</guid><pubDate> Thu, 14 Dec 2023 14:06:18 GMT</pubDate><category>英国</category></item><item><title>Despite the war in Gaza, talk of a two-state solution persists</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img fetchpriority=&quot;high&quot;

That was how America&#39;s president saw it, at least. Though he backed Israel&#39;s right to defend itself, he argued that the fighting should be a wake-up call for Israelis and Palestinians alike. “The moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people,” he said in a televised interview.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The president, in this case, was a newly inaugurated Barack Obama almost 15 years ago. But it could just as well be Joe Biden today. History has a way of repeating itself in the Middle East. War in Gaza has once again led to talk of peace, which may seem far-fetched, given the massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis on October 7th and the subsequent killing of some 16,000 Palestinians during the Israeli assault on Gaza. The Holy Land has not seen this much bloodshed since Israel was founded in 1948. Peace has never seemed so far away.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 7kdh9m&quot;>;.css-7kdh9m{--infobox-background-color:#fef8e6;--infobox-font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);--infobox-font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);--infobox-line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);--infobox-font-family-small-caps:var(--ds-type-system-serif);--infobox-color-crosshead:var(--ds-color-london-5);background-color:var(--infobox-background-color);font-family:var(--infobox-font-family);font-weight:400;font-size:var(--infobox-font-size);line-height:var(--infobox-line-height);padding:1.5rem;}.css-7kdh9m .e1nk3r6v0{color:var(--infobox-color-crosshead);padding-bottom:0.4375rem;border-bottom:0.0625rem solid var(--ds-color-london-85);}.css-7kdh9m *+.e1nk3r6v0{margin-top:1.75rem;}.css-7kdh9m >;*+*{margin-top:0.875rem;}.css-7kdh9m .e1tt35bk0,.css-7kdh9m .e16ilo480{font-family:inherit;}.css-7kdh9m .e1tt35bk0,.css-7kdh9m .e16ilo480{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}.css-7kdh9m .e1tt35bk0 a,.css-7kdh9m .e16ilo480 a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-london-5);text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;}.css-7kdh9m .e1tt35bk0 a:hover,.css-7kdh9m .e16ilo480 a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-7kdh9m .e1tt35bk0 a:focus,.css-7kdh9m .e16ilo480 a:focus{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);outline:none;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-london-5);text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-7kdh9m .e1tt35bk0 a:active,.css-7kdh9m .e16ilo480 a:active{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-7kdh9m .e1tt35bk0 small,.css-7kdh9m small{font-family:var(--infobox-font-family-small-caps);font-variant:small-caps no-common-ligatures no-discretionary-ligatures no-historical-ligatures no-contextual lining-nums;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;}&lt;/style>;&lt;aside data-component=&quot;infobox&quot; class=&quot;css-7kdh9m ed7sk540&quot;>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;i>;Read all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas&quot;>;our coverage&lt;/a>; of the war between Israel and Hamas.&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Biden hopes it will emerge nonetheless. “When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution,” he said in October. At a conference in Bahrain in November, one Arab official after another offered a similar message. “We need to go back to a two-state solution, to an Israeli and Palestinian state living side by side,” said Anwar Gargash, an adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates (&lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>;).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some see such talk as a fig leaf, intended to dispel misgivings about Western support for Israel and Arab inaction amid a horrifying war. After all, the 30-year peace process between Israelis and Palestinians is littered with failures. A revival of negotiations would be doomed from the start without, at the very least, three essential changes. First is new leadership. The political parties on either side of the current war in Gaza are the same ones that laboured to spoil the nascent peace process 30 years ago; they must go. Next is an effort to make the negotiations credible: both sides are ever more doubtful about the other&#39;s sincerity. Last, both sides need incentives to make a deal. Palestinians need to feel that their state is viable, and Israelis need to feel that theirs will be secure.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The two-state solution has been around, in one form or another, for almost a century. The United Nations adopted a partition plan for Palestine in 1947 that would have created two states, one Arab and one Jewish, with international control of Jerusalem. Arab states rejected it, Israel declared independence, and its neighbours promptly invaded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;After decades of conflict, Israelis and Palestinians began talks at a peace conference in Madrid in 1991. Then came the Oslo accords in 1993, which set a five-year deadline to create a Palestinian state and in the meantime established the Palestinian Authority (&lt;small>;PA&lt;/small>;), a government of sorts, albeit with limited powers and jurisdiction over only part of the occupied territories. A string of failures followed: the summits at Camp David and Taba, the Bush administration&#39;s “road map for peace”, Mr Obama&#39;s diplomacy. The last direct talks collapsed in 2014 and were never resuscitated.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Unattainable yet indestructible&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;All along, the outline of a two-state solution changed little. There would be a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank—around 22% of the area of historic Palestine—with its capital in east Jerusalem. Israel would keep some settlements in the West Bank, in exchange for territorial swaps, and evacuate others. A token number of refugees would be allowed to return to Israel and a greater number to Palestine.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBC659.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The idea was once popular, but many have lost faith. Even before October 7th, only a third or so of Palestinians and Israeli Jews supported a two-state solution, down from almost half just five years ago (see chart). “Every failed process has a price tag,” says Nimrod Novik, who was a foreign-policy adviser to Shimon Peres, an Israeli politician. “It reinforces the erroneous conclusion that it cannot be done.” Since October 7th support for peace negotiations of any kind has plunged in Israel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Despite the disillusionment, there is no clear alternative. Polls show both Israelis and Palestinians divided about how to end the conflict. Some hope for a “one-state solution” that would see them live in a single country with equal rights. Others support apartheid or ethnic cleansing (they disagree, of course, on who the victims of such an approach should be).&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;These are all non-starters. The events of October 7th blew up the status quo. Expulsion or discrimination are abhorrent. A one-state solution might sound reasonable, but it is practically unworkable: most Israelis and Palestinians reject the idea.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;That leaves two states. The hitch is that this solution requires big sacrifices from both sides. Israelis would have to give up land, while Palestinians would have to give up on much of the land they have lost since 1948. Leaders on both sides would need to sell these concessions to a sceptical public. But neither side has such leaders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Israel has Binyamin Netanyahu, who has spent his entire career trying to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state. In a sop to Mr Obama, he did endorse a two-state solution in a speech in 2009 at Bar-Ilan University—though six years later he declared that the Middle East had changed and his speech was “irrelevant”. His Likud party has adopted resolutions opposing Palestinian statehood. Kan, Israel&#39;s public broadcaster, reported in November that Mr Netanyahu met backbenchers from Likud to plead for his political survival. “I am the only one who can prevent a Palestinian state in Gaza and Judea and Samaria after the war,” he said, using the Hebrew name for the West Bank.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But Mr Netanyahu&#39;s days are numbered. Most Israelis want him gone—fully 76% according to a poll published in November. Surveys suggest that, if an election were held, his Likud party would lose around half of the 32 seats it now holds in the 120-member Knesset.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The frontrunner to succeed Mr Netanyahu is Benny Gantz, a former army chief who reluctantly joined Mr Netanyahu&#39;s war cabinet in October. His centre-right National Unity party has opened a wide lead in the polls. He is becoming a rarity in Israel&#39;s fractious politics: a unifying figure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some of this is down to his vague position on the two-state解决方案。 He has said little about it in public. His party&#39;s official position is a woolly call for “separation from the Palestinians”, without any detail on how this might be achieved. Sources close to Mr Gantz say he has no interest in being more specific. To do so, they say, would play into the hands of Mr Netanyahu. Palestinian statehood is a wedge issue, and therefore Mr Gantz will try to avoid it in the interest of wooing voters away from the prime minister.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;“In Benny&#39;s conversations with the Americans he says that we should stop using old words for new situations,” says an aide. In other words, he is open to discussing a form of the two-state solution but is wary of using the discredited term. In surveys carried out by his party, most Israelis are in favour of a two-state solution when it is described in other terms, such as “two separate entities”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;If Mr Gantz were to pursue some variation on the two-state solution, he would face political obstacles. His party includes hawkish lawmakers who would oppose such a push. “Gantz has some very, very right-wing people in there,” says Dan Ben-David of the Shoresh Institute, an Israeli think-tank. The same goes for some of his prospective coalition partners—and the Israeli public, which has swung to the right over the past few decades.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt; div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Palestinian politics look even more forbidding 。 A peace process is unthinkable with Hamas, which has spent three decades playing spoiler. It started a campaign of suicide-bombings to sabotage the Oslo accords, and then soured a generation of Israelis on the idea of peace with continued attacks during the Palestinians&#39; second &lt;i>;intifada&lt;/i>;, or uprising.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, supports a two-state solution, as does his nationalist Fatah party. But he is 88 years old and will soon start the 20th year of what should have been a four-year term. Few Palestinians (or Israelis, for that matter) think he has the legitimacy or acumen to lead a serious push for peace. “He&#39;s in a delusional bubble, surrounded by three or four very powerful yes-men,” says an Israeli officer, an assessment shared by many of Mr Abbas&#39;s former associates.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The White House has mused about Salam Fayyad, a technocratic ex-prime minister and former &lt;small>;IMF&lt;/small>; official, coming back to his old job. Even Arab officials now say in private that they want a change in Palestinian leadership. The Saudis are pushing for Hussein al-Sheikh, Mr Abbas&#39;s right-hand man, to succeed the president. The &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; hopes to see a role for Muhammad Dahlan, a former Fatah security chief who has spent the past decade in exile in Abu Dhabi. They would all be acceptable to Israel—but perhaps not to Palestinians. Polls put their popularity in the single digits.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Plausible but unavailable&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Another option is Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah leader serving five life sentences in Israel for orchestrating attacks on Israeli civilians. (He refused to present a defence, denouncing the trial as illegitimate.) Some hope he could become a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, emerging from prison to unite a fractured movement and negotiate with Israel. He often polls as the most popular Palestinian leader—but that is mostly because he has spent decades out of the public eye, at a time when Fatah descended into corruption and senescence. Even if Israel allowed him out, it is unclear how capable a leader he would be.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;American and Arab officials have pushed for Palestinian elections. At least in the West Bank, though, that could lead to victory for whatever remains of Hamas, seen by Palestinians as the only party willing to stand up to Israel. For Fatah to regain popularity, it would need to do two things. One is to curb its members&#39; rampant graft (asked to name the most pressing problem for the &lt;small>;PA&lt;/small>; to tackle, more Palestinians mention corruption than occupation). The other is to show that a non-violent approach can yield results. “They have to make Hamas ineffective,” says Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian academic from Gaza. “People have to see that Hamas is not really doing anything good.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;That requires concessions from Israel, which points to a second question: how to make negotiations credible. After decades of failure, both Israelis and Palestinians would be sceptical. For Israelis, though, those decades were nonetheless good ones: they coincided with an economic boom, a long stretch of relative peace and burgeoning relations with Arab states. For Palestinians, they brought only deepening despair. “The whole project of an independent Palestinian state is becoming part of the past,” says Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister. The onus would be on Israel to dispel that perception.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBM937.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Novik is part of Commanders for Israel&#39;s Security, a group of retired security officials who advocate a two-state solution. He offers a “menu” of steps Israel could take to show renewed commitment. It could shrink Area &lt;small>;C&lt;/small>;, the two-thirds of the West Bank under full Israeli control, and expand Area &lt;small>;B&lt;/small>;, where the &lt;small>;PA&lt;/small>; has authority over civil matters, but not security. (Area &lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;, where the &lt;small>;PA&lt;/small>; has full control, is even smaller: see map.) It could stop demolishing unlicensed homes in Area &lt;small>;C&lt;/small>;, where it refuses to grant Palestinians construction permits (it usually issues ten or fewer each year). It could curtail army raids in Palestinian cities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For Palestinians, though, these steps would be woefully insufficient. A slightly expanded Area &lt;small>;B&lt;/small>; would hardly be a resounding achievement that Fatah could sell to a dubious public. “We&#39;ve waited 30 years for a state,” says a diplomat. “We don&#39;t want some construction permits.” The Oslo accords, after all, were undone by gradualism: the idea that both sides needed to build trust with symbolic moves before agreeing on more substantive steps.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Asked what would constitute a more serious gesture, several Palestinian analysts point to the settlements in the occupied West Bank, home to around 465,000 Israelis. It would not be enough to freeze new construction, they say; that has been tried before, including under Mr Obama. Israel should go further and dismantle some of the settlements it would have to relinquish in a peace deal. That would both build confidence and advance a final-status agreement. It also seems politically impossible in Israel, especially after October 7th, since it would be seen as rewarding a massacre.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;After decades of foot-dragging, Israel is unlikely to make any big gestures without pressure from America. “Unless the Israeli system actually feels there&#39;s a cost for going in this direction, I don&#39;t see how you free up some space for different politics,” says Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator. An Arab diplomat suggests this pressure, too, should initially be aimed at settlers: “America needs to get rough.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On December 6th America announced that it would impose visa bans on violent settlers who attack Palestinians and their property. That is an unprecedented step—but it, too, is symbolic. Settlers motivated by ideology are unlikely to be dissuaded by a visa ban. Anyway, some of them cannot be banned: they are American citizens.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For an American squeeze on settlements to succeed, it would need to encompass the Israeli state, too. International law obliges the Israeli army to protect Palestinians in occupied territory, but it often stands by as settlers carry out attacks. If it continues to allow (and sometimes abet) such violence, America could threaten to cut military aid. That would be a clear signal, to the Palestinians and the Arab world, that America was serious about trying to play a less biased role. But such a threat is hard to imagine in an election year—or if Donald Trump wins the presidency in 2024. If Mr Biden secures a second term, though, such a move would be popular with the progressive wing of his party.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Along with threats, America and its partners would also have to offer incentives. For the Palestinians, these would probably be mainly financial. The most immediate question is how to rebuild a shattered Gaza, the bill for which will easily run into tens of billions of dollars. Wealthy Gulf states would be willing to contribute—but only if Gaza becomes part of a Palestinian state and their investments are unlikely to be blown up again.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231209_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Illustration: Alicia Tatone/Getty Images&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;At the same time, the Gulf states could help assuage Israel&#39;s security concerns. When the Oslo process began, only one Arab state, Egypt, had diplomatic ties with Israel. Today six of them do, and Saudi Arabia appears willing to join the club. The prospect of normal relations with the Arab world seems real in a way it never did in decades past. Ending conflict not only with the Palestinians but also with the entire region should be a powerful inducement.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;At a meeting in Qatar earlier this month, the Gulf states talked about a plan for post-war Gaza. They resolved to work with Jordan, Egypt and Western powers to form an international coalition to push for a two-state solution. Arab states would demand that the &lt;small>;PA&lt;/small>; choose new leaders, while America would press Israel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But even if the Gulf states recognise Israel, Iranian-backed militant groups that have weighed in on Hamas&#39;s side, such as Hizbullah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen, would not do the same. “We would have to get Iran on board,” says a diplomat from the Gulf. Asked if that was realistic, he demurred. Hostility toward Israel has been a core tenet of the Islamic Republic&#39;s ideology for decades. The creation of a rump Palestinian state may not turn them into Zionists overnight.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Familiar but uncertain&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The risk, then, is that history repeats itself again. A new crop of leaders might pay lip service to a two-state solution. Israel might soften its hostility toward the &lt;small>;PA&lt;/small>; and offer a few concessions. Gulf states would pledge money and recognition. But the deal on offer would be, fundamentally, the same as before—a deal that a far more optimistic generation of Israelis and Palestinians rejected.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In recent years intellectuals on both sides have begun calling for more creative thinking. One idea is of a confederation in which there would be both a Jewish and a Palestinian entity. Citizens of one part would be entitled to live and work in the other. The idea is to diminish the importance of exactly how such a small parcel of land is carved up and to give each side greater interest in the stability of the other.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;There are even more obstacles to this idea than to the standard two-state blueprint, but there is a virtue in novel concepts. “Israel benefits from the unseriousness of an international approach which simply says, go back to two-state negotiations,” says Mr Levy. Those negotiations too often become an end rather than a means, even though by now there is little left to negotiate: it has all been discussed ad infinitum. The events of the past few months show the status quo is untenable.改变是不可避免的。 The only question is what form it will take. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/12/07/despite-the-war-in-gaza-talk-of-a-two-state-solution-persists<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/of9f959q94l39u3lapp6p2hjtssbdphq</guid><pubDate> Thu, 07 Dec 2023 10:47:40 GMT</pubDate><category>以色列</category></item><item><title>How Putin is reshaping Russia to keep his war-machine running</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img fetchpriority=&quot;high&quot;

A pavilion celebrating Russia&#39;s regions features Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhia, four provinces the Russian army is currently attempting to seize from Ukraine. The only hint of the continuing bloodshed is a flower composed of bits of shrapnel. The initiation of the biggest war in Europe since 1945, the re-imposition of a police state within Russia and the categorical reversal of the reforming and Westernising trends of the early post-Soviet period are nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It is an especially far cry from the shock and confusion of the early days of the war, when the rouble plunged, hundreds of thousands fled the country and protests rocked Russia&#39;s城市。 Mr Putin has since succeeded in stabilising the economy, thanks to the high price of oil, and in squelching dissent, thanks to fierce repression. That has allowed him to retain the allegiance of the elite, who in turn are helping the country adapt. The new equilibrium is unstable, however, with the economy and military recruitment, in particular, threatening further upheaval.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Unsheepish sheep&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On the face of things, most Russians have meekly accepted the war in Ukraine, which will soon be two years old. Two-thirds tell Russian Field, a pollster, that the country is moving in the right direction and over half say the war in Ukraine is going well. “I knew that society is totally conformist, but I still didn&#39;t expect that incredible measure of psychological adaptation. People have just shut themselves off and tried to live their usual old lives,” Nalalya Zubarevich, an academic, said in a recent interview.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Open protest is rare, for obvious reasons. On November 16th Alexandra Skochilenko, an artist and activist, was jailed for seven years for replacing price tags in a St Petersburg supermarket with anti-war messages. (“My great-grandfather did not fight in &lt;small>;WW&lt;/small>;2 so that Russia could become a fascist state and attack Ukraine,” read one.) It is not just peaceniks who are persecuted: at least one ultra-nationalist dissenter, Igor Girkin, a retired soldier and blogger, has been jailed for complaining that Mr Putin is not fighting forcefully enough.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC589.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But just because the majority of Russians have accepted the war does not mean that they are enthusiastic about it. A hastily concocted propaganda film about dastardly Ukrainian “fascists”, which cost $2m to make, was a spectacular flop, collecting just $150,000 at the box office. Despite their professed support for the war, the respondents to Russian Field&#39;s polls are firmly against a further round of mobilisation, even if Mr Putin himself calls for it. In October, for the first time during the war, a majority of respondents expressed support for peace talks over continued fighting (see chart 1). Fully 74% say they would be happy for Mr Putin to sign a peace deal right away.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;1006&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBC594.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the younger people are, and the more they get their news from social media rather than state-run television, the more sceptical about the war they are. More strikingly, however, the richer and more educated people are, the more supportive they are (see chart 2). As an anonymous Russian academic explains in a recent article in &lt;i>;Meduza&lt;/i>;, an online publication, there is a big class of bureaucrats and businessmen who have attained their status through patronage and who will uphold the regime to protect it. “They number millions and they have fitted into the moral economy of military aggression,” the academic writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In part, such people are kept in line by fear, like everyone else. In the first months of the war a spate of mysterious deaths of businessmen and managers at state-owned firms helped to instil fealty. The chairman of the board of Lukoil, Russia&#39;s biggest private oil firm, fell to his death from a hospital window in Moscow a few months after the board issued a statement calling for a ceasefire. Western sanctions against oligarchs have helped keep the monied class on board, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Look away&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But civil servants and businessmen also have long experience of suppressing scruples and working the system. Many have transitioned smoothly from the Soviet bureaucracy. “They are driven not by ideology, but by loyalty to their corporation, be it the central bank or finance ministry,” says Mikhail Komin, who has been surveying Russian technocrats. They see the task of keeping the ship of state afloat as a professional challenge, not a moral quandary.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Maksut Shadaev, the 44-year-old minister for digital transformation, is a good example. He worked at private&lt;small>; IT&lt;/small>; firms in the 1990s, before joining the government to help build a sleek, user-friendly web portal and mobile app that allows citizens to access such public services as making a doctor&#39;s appointment and enrolling children in school. He is now using those same skills to build a system dubbed the “digital gulag”—a comprehensive register to help track men eligible for the draft.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;By the same token, Russian businesses have helped stabilise the economy not out of any affection for the state, but because they excel at coping with big, unexpected and often arbitrary shifts in their circumstances. Andrei Yakovlev of Harvard University, who has conducted a survey of Russian entrepreneurs, says that having lived through several financial crises and done constant battle with predatory bureaucrats, they put a premium on preparing for the worst. The disappearance of Western imports and the closure of Western firms, meanwhile, has opened new niches for Russian companies. At the same time, the capital controls imposed by the central bank have left them with few options but to invest in Russia. The government has offered loans and even ordered bureaucrats not to harass them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It helps, of course, that vast quantities of petrodollars have been sloshing around the economy. In the first year of the war Russia earned $590bn in export revenues—most of it from oil and gas. According to calculations by Re: Russia, a network of experts, that is $160bn more than the annual average over the prior decade. In the second year, revenues should still be some $60bn above the average. Re: Russia believes that the war costs at least $100bn a year—so the extra income from oil covers most of the expense of waging it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The government&#39;s budget increased by 26% last year and will rise by another 16% next year. Defence spending will almost double next year, to 6% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;—the highest it has been since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It now accounts for a third of all government expenditure. Spending on health and education, meanwhile, is falling in real terms. As Anton Siluanov, the finance minister, recently declared, “The main emphasis is on ensuring our victory. The army, defence capability, armed forces, fighters—everything needed for the front, everything needed for victory is in the budget.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Such lavish outlays will not be sustainable无限期地。 The central bank is struggling to restrain rising inflation, which reached an annualised rate of 12% in the third quarter of this year. It has raised interest rates to 15%. The authorities, meanwhile, are forcing exporters to convert their revenues to roubles to stave off further devaluation, which would exacerbate inflation. Some 43% of Russians expect their economic situation to worsen in the next year or two, while only 21% expect it to improve, according to Russian Field.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For the moment, however, there is a bonanza, especially in certain parts of the economy and certain segments of Russian society. “Unlike oil, guns drive industrial growth,” argue Alexandra Prokopenko and Pavel Luzin at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, a think-tank. Construction, consumption and services are growing in regions close to the war zone or with lots of munitions factories. In the far east there is heavy investment in infrastructure to expand trade with Asia, since ties to Europe have withered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Moscow and St Petersburg do not benefit much from the new order, but depressed industrial regions—Mr Putin&#39;s heartland—are living better than they have for years. In Izhevsk, a poor city close to the Ural mountains which produces guns, missiles and equipment for electronic warfare, the average salary has gone up by 25% since the start of the war. An organic supermarket, VkusVill, and a pan-Asian restaurant, Royal Rolls, recently opened. In Rostov-on-Don, the headquarters of the military district encompassing the front, catering businesses are seeing a 77% increase in turnover. “A lot of men with good appetites have arrived there,” says Ms Zubarevich.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Russia&#39;s vast and poor hinterland has also benefited from the cash the authorities are dangling in order to secure more recruits to the army. Those who volunteer are paid around 195,000 roubles a month, four times the newly increased average salary in Izhevsk, and a one-off bonus on enlistment of 195,000 roubles. The families of those killed in battle receive generous payments, too. Vladislav Inozemtsev, a Russian economist at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw, estimates that the family of a soldier who gets killed after five months&#39; service would receive about 15m roubles in total, including pay and compensation. It would take an average Russian man 30 years to earn as much. Life expectancy for a Russian man is only 65. Mr Putin&#39;s regime is trying to turn getting killed into an economically rational choice, argues Mr Inozemtsev.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Nonetheless, Russia appears to have a manpower problem. The forced mobilisation announced a year ago—the first since the second world war—caused panic and anger. Enlistment commissions were set ablaze and hundreds of thousands of young men fled the country or hid within Russia. Those who were called up then remain at the front, despite promises that they would serve for only six months. That has spawned a protest movement led by their wives and mothers called &lt;i>;Voina Zaebala&lt;/i>; (Fucked off by the war). “We don&#39;t give birth for our children to be killed,” complains an agitated mother in a video that has circulated widely on social media.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The police are searching energetically not only for draft-dodgers, but also for migrants from Central Asia, whom they seem to be press-ganging into military service. They recently raided warehouses belonging to Wildberries, Russia&#39;s largest online retailer, bringing its service to a halt. There are often raids on student dormitories, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Meanwhile the Duma, Russia&#39;s parliament, is preparing for more rounds of mobilisation. The maximum age subject to conscription has been raised from 27 to 30 years. The time former servicemen remain reservists has been extended by five years, to 60 in the case of junior officers. The law has been changed to require employers to turn in their staff for military service. As Andrei Kartopolov, chairman of the Duma&#39;s defence committee, explained, “This law was written for a big war, for a general mobilisation. And you can already smell that big war in the air.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But a shortage of manpower is not the army&#39;s only problem. Aleksandr Golts, author of “Military Reform and Militarism in Russia”, argues that it is also short of junior officers, training capacity and equipment. The higher military spending is, in all likelihood, wildly inefficient. Russia&#39;s arms industry is notoriously corrupt: kickbacks are estimated by some to double the cost of procurement. It is also starved of skilled labour. Yuri Borisov, the deputy prime minister, says it needs another 400,000 engineers, &lt;small>;IT&lt;/small>; specialists and managers.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231202_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Illustration: Carl Godfrey/Shutterstock&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;There is talk of increasing state control over the economy, to abet the war effort. Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister who oversees military procurement, has said that state planning may have to be reintroduced in the defence industry. “We are talking about economic security in war conditions…Let&#39;s go down the path of nationalisation of the main sectors of our economy,” Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the anti-corruption agency and a university classmate of Mr Putin&#39;s, said recently. Eighteen big companies have been nationalised in 2023, many of them in the name of restoring looted property to the state. The prosecutor-general has reported to Mr Putin that the courts have heard 24,000 cases involving the loss of state property.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;State-owned firms are playing an ever bigger and more varied part in Russian life. Gazprom, Russia&#39;s state-owned gas monopoly, for example, owns several media outlets. It has also manned, equipped and funded several military brigades. Rosneft, the state-owned oil giant, builds ships and oversees a research project on the Eurasian variants of the human genome.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The bureaucrats who oversee these sprawling empires are often businessmen in their own right, with overlapping interests. Mr Manturov, for instance, sits on the board of Rostec, a state-owned defence conglomerate. The chairman of Rostec is Sergei Chemezov, a former &lt;small>;KGB&lt;/small>; agent who served with Mr Putin in East Germany. Mr Chemevoz&#39;s and Mr Manturov&#39;s families jointly own ports, hotels, luxury properties and a vineyard, among other investments.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;An increasingly common pattern is for the children of Mr Putin&#39;s friends and associates to take prominent roles in industry and government. Dmitry Patrushev, the minister of agriculture, is the son of Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the national security council. Ekaterina Tikhonova, Mr Putin&#39;s own daughter, chairs a business lobby group&#39;s committee on import substitution. VKontakte, Russia&#39;s biggest social-media platform, is partly owned by various state-owned companies and jointly run by the son of Mr Putin&#39;s deputy chief-of-staff and by the great nephew of a rich businessman who is said to be one of Mr Putin&#39;s closest confidants and an advocate of the invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Russia&#39;s decision to ban Facebook and Instagram at the start of the war boosted VKontakte&#39;s users by 4m in just a few weeks. It now has a penetration rate of 75%, is assumed to be closely monitored by the security services and is instrumental in spreading pro-war messages. “This is Putin&#39;s dream and an ideal model: everything in one place, run by the children under the supervision of the &lt;small>;KGB&lt;/small>;,” says Kirill Rogov, the founder of Re: Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Hero of a crime&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;To justify his reconstruction of the Russian economy and to explain away his lack of military successes, Mr Putin is reframing the war as one not with Ukraine, but with the West, in which Ukraine is simply “a battering ram” used to pummel Russia. New history textbooks explain to pupils that Russia has always been and will always be in a state of war with the West. This narrative allows Mr Putin to depict everyday activities as a triumph. “Enabling Russian companies to successfully tap the market is a victory…Building cutting-edge factories and kilometres of new roads is a victory…Scientific discoveries and new technologies—these are also victories,” he boasted in a speech on the anniversary of the invasion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Such talk hints at the contradiction at the heart of Mr Putin&#39;s approach to the war. He wants both to mobilise ever more manpower and money for the fight and at the same time to secure Russians&#39; acquiescence by disrupting their lives as little as possible. As ever more power and resources are redistributed within Russia, this contradiction will become even more glaring. His regime&#39;s wobbliest moment yet came in June, when bickering between the army and Wagner, a mercenary group led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close friend of Mr Putin, escalated into outright mutiny. Although Mr Prigozhin quickly backed down and later died in a convenient plane crash, it was a reminder that it is not easy to balance the competing interests within Russia&#39;s elite.

That is about $100,000 for every Emirati citizen. But oil is not the only reason the country is prospering. In a time of war and economic fragmentation, the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; seems to be a port in a storm. Multinationals are setting up factories and offices at a rate not previously seen in the &lt;small>;UAE&#39;&lt;/small>;s five decades of independence. Oil and gas now account for just a third of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;, and the oily bits of the economy are growing more slowly than the rest of it. The economy as a whole grew by 3.7% in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 2022. Excluding oil and related industries, it grew by 5.9% (see chart 1).&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>;&#39;s standing in the world seems to be growing rapidly, too. Hosting &lt;small>;COP&lt;/small>;28 is one indication. The country is home to just 10m people, of whom only 1m are citizens. But through both its embrace of global business and its foreign investments, including in clean energy and logistics, it is binding itself to other countries around the world. Its economic openness and its apolitical approach to business give it broad appeal: it is one of the few places where Americans, Chinese, Iranians, Israelis and Russians all rub shoulders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; is not without its challenges. As oil becomes less central to the economy, the social contract is changing. The government does not simply rake in petrodollars and distribute them to citizens in the form of cushy jobs and subsidised goods; it has begun levying taxes and prodding locals to seek more demanding work in the private sector. Since the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; is an absolute monarchy (or rather, seven of them combined in a federation dominated by the richest, Abu Dhabi), there is little outlet for popular discontent. The lack of checks on the rulers&#39; authority can lead to arbitrary and ill-considered policymaking, especially in foreign relations.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Can-dhow spirit&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The country is no stranger to economic transformation. Pearl-diving, the previous mainstay of the sleepy trading outposts along the shores of the Gulf, collapsed in the early 20th century after Japanese researchers worked out how to farm pearls. Oil was discovered in the 1950s; by 1971, when the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; gained independence from Britain, it was well on its way to becoming a petrostate. It sits atop more oil than Russia, and is the world&#39;s seventh-biggest producer, pumping more than 3m barrels a day. Only Guyana and Kuwait have more oil relative to their population.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Despite this bounty, the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>;&#39;s rulers were among the first in the Gulf to try to diversify their economy. Dubai, which has little oil of its own, led the way, creating lightly regulated, low-tax economic zones designed to attract multinationals. Although it needed bailing out by Abu Dhabi after a spectacular property crash in 2009, its basic economic formula, of turning itself into a trading entrepot, transport hub and financial centre, remains successful. At the same time, the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; has invested its oil wealth in strategically important industries and strategically important parts of the world. The intention is to make itself a force in global trade, finance and geopolitics. Much of this approach, locals note with condescension, is being copied by Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince of neighbouring Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Start with the Emirates&#39; role as an entrepot. The fact that it is within easy flying and shipping distance of most of Africa, Europe and Asia makes it a natural hub. &lt;small>;DP&lt;/small>; World, a firm owned by the government of Dubai, runs Jebel Ali, one of the world&#39;s biggest container ports. Dubai airport is the busiest in the world for international travel. Logistics have grown to account for nearly 8% of the country&#39;s &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But the business climate is as important as geography. In an index of economic freedom compiled by the Heritage Foundation, an American think-tank, the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; ranks 24th out of 176 countries—one notch above America. Foreigners laud the ease with which offices can be set up, flats rented, visas approved. “Everyone thinks commercially, and no one thinks politically,” notes an Israeli entrepreneur with a big office in Dubai. On a trip to the country a few weeks after the war between Israel and Hamas began, he found the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; just as welcoming as ever. Local governments run “customer happiness centres”. The name is cringeworthy, and local services can be expensive, but they work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In recent years, businesses have set up in Dubai at a frenetic pace: the number of new businesses joining the city&#39;s chamber of commerce rose by more than 40% in the first half of the year, compared with 2022. A fifth went to Indian firms; the numbers of companies from China and elsewhere in the Middle East also grew rapidly. Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, has had some success luring financial firms.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The influx reflects the varied roles the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; can play for firms from different countries. For Chinese ones, it has become an offshore trading hub. One example is Dragon Mart, a wholesale and retail complex in Dubai that bills itself as the biggest trading hub for Chinese goods outside China. Last year &lt;small>;DP&lt;/small>; World helped set up Yiwu Market, which hopes to eclipse it. For Indian firms, the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; offers what Hong Kong and Singapore do for China and South-East Asia: an easier place to do business internationally, with more efficient courts, better infrastructure and access to capital and talent. It is also becoming a second home of sorts. Mukesh Ambani, India&#39;s richest man, has twice broken Dubai&#39;s record for the most expensive residential property, most recently for a $163m beach villa.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Indifference towards Western sanctions has made the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; a haven for businesses from shunned places. Iranian oil is often exchanged at sea off the emirate of Fujairah, blended with other crude and sold on. After traders in Geneva began shunning Russian crude, Dubai became the place to finance and trade shipments. Russian businessmen, no longer able to live in America or Europe, have relocated to waterfront villas in Dubai. Hong Kong&#39;s seemingly never-ending lockdowns during the pandemic, meanwhile, sent some of its professionals fleeing to Dubai, where covid restrictions lasted only three months.&amp;nbsp;Last year more millionaires moved to the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; than anywhere else in the world, in net terms.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A couple walk along the Corniche backdropped by commercial and residential skyscrapers in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP003.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css tupg4d&quot;>;.css-tupg4d{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:600;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);}.css-tupg4d del,.css-tupg4d s{-webkit-text-decoration:strikethrough;text-decoration:strikethrough;}.css-tupg4d strong,.css-tupg4d b{font-weight:700;}.css-tupg4d em,.css-tupg4d i{font-style:italic;}.css-tupg4d sup{font-feature-settings:&#39;sups&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d sub{font-feature-settings:&#39;subs&#39; 1;}.css-tupg4d small,.css-tupg4d .small-caps{display:inline;font-size:inherit;font-variant:small-caps no-common-ligatures no-discretionary-ligatures no-historical-ligatures no-contextual lining-nums;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;}.css-tupg4d u,.css-tupg4d .underline{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);outline:none;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;}.css-tupg4d a:active{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-tupg4d a:hover,.css-tupg4d a:active{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-tupg4d a:focus{outline:solid transparent;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tupg4d b,.css-tupg4d strong{font-weight:800;}&lt;/style>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-tupg4d e6ii4pq0&quot;>;Cohabitation without representation&lt;/span>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: Getty Images&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The welcome for foreign business has become warmer still in recent years—most probably to ensure the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; retains its edge over Saudi Arabia, which is now also chasing foreign firms. Outsiders once needed to team up with an Emirati to set up shop in the country, providing locals with fat rents and slowing business formation. That “agency” rule has been relaxed. The weekend has been shifted from Friday and Saturday to Saturday and Sunday, to align with most of the rest of the world (the emirate of Sharjah, keen to ensure Friday remains a holiday, has plumped for a four-day week).

Its various sovereign-wealth funds have assets of more than $1.5trn in all manner of businesses (see chart 2). The varied holdings of Mubadala, one of them, include stakes in Chime, an American fintech firm, XPeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, and Jio, Mr Ambani&#39;s telecom network, among other things.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Many of the investments are in logistics. &lt;small>;DP&lt;/small>; World runs ports everywhere from London to Sydney.

The &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; is one of the largest investors in capital-starved Africa, albeit mainly in North Africa. “We are replicating&amp;nbsp;Dubai&#39;s success in African countries,” said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, &lt;small>;DP&lt;/small>; World&#39;s&amp;nbsp;boss, in 2020. In 2022 an Emirati consortium including Abu Dhabi Ports signed an agreement to invest $6bn in a port and agricultural project in Sudan. &lt;small>;DP&lt;/small>; World operates on dry land, too: in Rwanda it has invested in a Road Transport Centre that has, according to a report by Knight Frank, a consultancy, reduced domestic shipping times from weeks to days. In India it has invested in railway lines; in southern Africa, in a logistics firm.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Another niche is clean energy. In 2006 the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; made a prescient bet, setting up a firm called Masdar to diversify its energy supply and build on its energy expertise by investing in renewables (the firm was initially run by Sultan al-Jaber, who now heads Abu Dhabi&#39;s national oil company and is the president of &lt;small>;COP&lt;/small>;28). Masdar is now one of the world&#39;s biggest developers of wind farms and solar power.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Emirati officials hope to pull off a similar feat in another emerging industry: artificial intelligence. Abu Dhabi was quick to try to seize on the technology&#39;s potential, setting up a research institute, making available vast amounts of capital and recruiting talented Western and Chinese researchers. The result was Falcon, an open-source large language model which some technologists consider better than Meta&#39;s offering, Llama 2. The government now wants to use this as the basis for a layer of proprietary models in specific fields, such as health care, which it hopes to sell. It is still too soon to say whether Falcon will take flight, but unlike most governments that blather on about their &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; strategy, the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; actually seems to have one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; has also tried to advance its commercial interests through a string of bilateral economic and investment agreements. It was one of the first signatories of the Abraham accords, under which several Arab states have established relations with Israel. That was followed by a trade deal with Israel earlier this year. Even as Western carriers suspended flights to Tel Aviv after Hamas&#39;s attacks on October 7th, Flydubai and Etihad, two Emirati carriers, have maintained regular services.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;India signed a free-trade pact with the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; last year, its first in a decade. Bilateral trade has since risen by 16% in nominal terms. A similar deal has been agreed with Indonesia; talks with Thailand and Malaysia are under way. Negotiations move much faster than the equivalent efforts of the Gulf Co-operation Council, a grouping of all the oil-rich Gulf states, allowing the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; to steal a march on its neighbours.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Sometimes, however, it appears to be diplomatic imperatives that dictate commercial decisions, rather than the other way around. The &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; is eager to build influence in its region. Earlier this month it signed a deal with Jordan to jointly invest $2bn in infrastructure and development projects. It has plied Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey&#39;s president, with promises of trade and investment. It has also energetically backed Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia&#39;s embattled prime minister, including by initiating big projects involving &lt;small>;DP&lt;/small>; World and Masdar.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-0 e18kpe850&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sudanese women who fled the conflict in Darfur, Sudan line up to receive rice from Red Cross volunteers near Adre, Chad&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231125_FBP002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-tupg4d e6ii4pq0&quot;>;The downside of Emirati foreign policy&lt;/span>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;image: Reuters&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Indeed, it is in foreign policy that the absolute and sometimes unpredictable power of the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>;&#39;s president and Abu Dhabi&#39;s ruler, Muhammad bin Zayed, is most evident.

But as its economy grows more diverse and the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>;&#39;s foreign entanglements become more complex, managing all the competing interests becomes a more delicate task. &amp;nbsp;The &lt;small>;cop&lt;/small>;, meanwhile, is a reminder that the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>;&#39;s seemingly unfathomable riches may in fact be a wasting asset.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Oil money made it possible for the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; to open its economy to the world without exposing Emiratis to any pain. Abu Dhabi is one of the world&#39;s lowest-cost producers, so would remain in the oil business even in a world of declining consumption. But it is preparing for a time when the bonanza may dwindle. In part, that means making the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; still more attractive to foreign labour and business. But it also means finding alternative revenue streams and cutting costs. The government has introduced a value-added tax and a corporate income tax. Fuel subsidies were phased out in 2015. No one says it out loud, but a personal income tax also seems inevitable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;More Emiratis will need to move from the public into the private sector, but many are ill-qualified, meaning they are unlikely to become richer as a result. Schoolchildren lag far behind their rich-country counterparts in standardised testing, and drop-out rates are high. So far the unpicking of the social contract has led to grumbling but no unrest. To keep it that way will require a more concerted effort at training the labour force, and a delicate touch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>; has been quick to spot the opportunities in a fragmenting world. Yet the new age brings dangers, too. A global transition away from fossil fuels, if it ever materialises, will be a shock. The Emirates&#39; assertive foreign policy will continue to strain its alliances. In particular, its relationship with Saudi Arabia could become more complicated and more competitive. The past 50 years suggest it would be foolish to bet against the &lt;small>;UAE&lt;/small>;, but the hardest tests still lie ahead. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/23/the-messier-the-world-gets-the-more-the-uae-seems-to-thrive<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/f3nl20jrtr1s646avd0bceevg8igder5</guid><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 10:52:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title> Now AI can write, sing and act, is it still possible to be a star?</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of two ghostly celebrities emerging from a limousine at a onto a red carpet&quot;

The technology is “disgusting”, said another, who considered its use “an infringement of yourself, of your career”. The deal actors struck on November 8th to end their strike included protections from their artificial rivals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Five thousand miles away another animated crowd can regularly be found chattering about &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;, usually in gloomier weather but brighter spirits. Outside a purpose-built stadium in east London, giddy groups of all ages, some in fancy dress, gather seven times a week to watch &lt;small>;ABBA&lt;/small>; Voyage, a performance in which a septuagenarian pop group plays an energetic 90-minute set via virtual avatars, generated with the help of &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;. The show, launched in 2022, played to 1m people in its first year and still almost sells out on most nights, bringing in a reported $2ma week while &lt;small>;ABBA&lt;/small>;&#39;s four members put their feet up.&lt; /p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data -component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Will &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; leave talent impoverished, as Hollywood&#39;s protesting actors and writers fear, or further enrich them, as &lt;small>;ABBA&lt;/small>;找到了？ It is easy to see why stars are nervous. Over the years technology has automated away many routine jobs in entertainment, but the creative work at the heart of the business has been protected.不再。 Generative &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; is hoovering up copyrighted work and churning out remixed literature, music and video of all varieties, increasingly competing with humans in quality and already far outpacing them in quantity.

Hollywood&#39;s screenwriters, who ended their five-month strike in September, won a promise from studios to employ a minimum number of human writers on films and &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; shows. The studios have retained the right to use &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; to generate or polish scripts, but the &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; will not be recognised as an author, so human writers&#39; royalties will not be diluted. Writers, for their part, have kept the right to use &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; in their own work.

In the words of Matthew Sag of Emory University, &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; does not copy a book “like a scribe in a monastery” so much as learn from it like a student. Pieces of training data, whether novels or songs, usually play such a small role in the model&#39;s output as to be barely traceable.但不总是。 “If you say, &#39;Write in the style of Dan Brown [of “The Da Vinci Code”],&#39; of course it will pull from Dan Brown&#39;s books,” declares Mary Rasenberger, head of the Authors Guild, which represents writers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;As the courts grind into action, governments are also getting involved.

Others, citing past waves of tech-driven disruption, see room for compromise. When music-streaming arrived, “We got very defensive, and only defensive,” admits another senior record-company executive. It took a decade for the labels to realise that the technology was good for business, and do a deal with the streaming platforms. Negotiations with &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; companies will take less than half that time, he predicts. “It&#39;s co-existence that&#39;s required.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;When the law is settled, who will win and lose from the technology? On the face of it, the biggest stars seem most vulnerable. &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; helps ordinary people narrow the gap with the most gifted. Less glamorous industries have already witnessed this. In April a working paper by Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University and others found that novice customer-support agents were 35% more productive when given access to a chatbot, whereas experienced agents hardly benefited.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Something similar is happening in show business. Even before &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;, tools like autotune were helping ordinary mortals to sound more like their idols. The next generation of technology promises to make such features more powerful. TikTok&#39;s parent company, ByteDance, is trialling an app called Ripple which takes any melody that users sing into their phone and turns it into a polished song. Boomy, an American startup, lets amateur composers generate original tunes with a few clicks and upload them to earn royalties on streaming platforms such as Spotify.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot; >;Frumpy actors can vie with gorgeous ones thanks to the digital facelifts of tools such as Vanity &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;, which are used in productions like “Stranger Things” and “The Walking Dead” to make actors look prettier or scarier ， 按要求。 Dull writers can get inspiration from apps such as Sudowrite, which suggests new ideas and edits. It bills itself pithily as “the non-judgmental, always-there-to-read-one-more-draft, never-runs-out-of-ideas-even-at-3am &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; writing partner you always wanted”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Not much &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-made work is good, let alone dazzling enough to compete with the stars at the top of the talent tree. But it is starting to have an impact through sheer scale. Boomy claims to have generated nearly 18m songs (for comparison, Spotify&#39;s entire catalogue is a little over 100m). Spotify now adds more than 100,000 new tracks every day, many of them &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-made. Sir Lucian Grainge, the head of Universal Music, has warned that real music could drown in a “sea of noise” as streaming platforms fill up with amateur tracks. Professional artists&#39; share of listening is indeed sinking. In 2017 artists signed to record labels accounted for 87% of the streams on Spotify. Last year their share was only 75%.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; struggles to make real hits, but is good at churning out the kind of music that people have on in the background while working or going to sleep. Those tracks are played for long hours and so earn big returns under the payment model used by streamers. Some in the industry suspect that the streaming platforms welcome the rise of amateur artists, who have less bargaining power than the big labels. The idea that streamers might nudge listeners towards this content is “absolutely a concern”, says another record-company executive. He thinks the only thing stopping them is the risk of annoying listeners. The streamers retort that it is hardly in their interest to promote bad music. Earlier this year Spotify purged lots of &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-made songs and is said to be rejigging its rules to make low-quality wallpaper music less profitable; Deezer and Tidal, two smaller rivals, have taken similar measures.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The publishing world has similar complaints. Producing entire books by &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; is so quick and easy that, in September, Amazon banned authors from self-publishing more than three e-books a day on its Kindle platform and required publishers to clearly label books by robot作家。 Most &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; texts are full of cliché and waffle (which makes them competitive in the management genre, an agent quips). But some are taking sales away from human authors by deception: the Authors Guild has spotted a tendency for &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-made biographies to land just before real memoirs are published, for instance. “Click farms” have also been deployed to manipulate Amazon&#39;s rankings. The guild says that, at one point this summer, 40 of the top 100 young-adult romance books on Kindle were &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-written.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;The winner makes it all&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet far from sinking in this sea of &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-made entertainment, the biggest stars of all seem to be more buoyant than ever. As record labels worry about robot composers, Taylor Swift is halfway through what will probably be the highest-earning concert tour in history, with projected sales of $1.4bn or more (no previous tour has breached $1bn). An accompanying film has made an additional $230m at the box office. Colleen Hoover, a writer of romantic young-adult fiction, crushed the robot writers last year to bag eight places on the top-25 bestseller list in America, selling 14m copies, according to &lt;i>;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i>;, a trade title.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;One of the paradoxes of the internet age is that, amid an explosion in online content on platforms from YouTube to TikTok, fans have flocked as never before to the biggest acts. It has been a good time to be an amateur creator, but an even better time to be a superstar. Data from Spotify show that between 2017 and 2022, as the platform was flooded with tens of millions of amateur tracks, the number of artists making at least $1,000 a year in royalties increased by 155%. At the same time, the number making $5m or more increased by 165%, and the handful of headliners making $10m or more increased by 425% (see chart 1 on previous page). Those who have done least well are middling-to-big artists, who face more competition from entertainment&#39;s long tail but have been unable to break into the elite group at the top.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Similar patterns can be seen across the entertainment world. Better and cheaper technology has democratised filmmaking. The number of movies released each year in America more than doubled during the first two decades of the 21st century, but the audience-share of the biggest blockbusters has grown, not shrunk. In 2019 (the last year before the pandemic) America&#39;s five biggest films took a quarter of the domestic box office, nearly double the share they took in the less crowded market of 2000 (see chart 2). Meanwhile, the ten bestselling authors have accounted for a steady 2-3% of book sales in Britain over the past decade, according to Nielsen, a data company, even though 2m more books are self-published each year.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Lay all your likes on me&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;“Hits will persist in an infinite-content world,” argues Doug Shapiro, a former media executive. The bewildering variety makes it hard for consumers to pick, so they rely more on recommendations, whether from friends or algorithms. Rather than browse, people seek out what they have already heard of, says Ms Rasenberger of the Authors Guild. “Known writers are selling. And everyone else is having a much harder time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; also helps superstars shine brighter by creating opportunities for their admirers to become superfans. Followers of a music act used to express themselves chiefly through “records, &lt;small>;T&lt;/small>;-shirts and mix-tapes”, says an industry executive. Now the internet offers “mix-tapes on steroids”. Fans can duet with their idols or dance to their music on social media. Games like “Fortnite” have provided a venue for interactive experiences: Ariana Grande held a concert-game hybrid on the platform in 2021, attracting 27m participants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-powered technology promises to allow the biggest stars to be in even more places, gratifying even more fans. The producers of &lt;small>;ABBA&lt;/small>; Voyage are in talks to bring the show to cities in North America, South-East Asia and Australasia, according to Per Sundin, head of Pophouse, a Swedish entertainment company that is the biggest investor in the enterprise. Other artists have been in touch, looking to “cement and elevate their legacies” with similar shows, he says. “We now have a proven template.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Stars do not need to build their own arena like &lt;small>;ABBA&lt;/small>; to use &lt;small>;ai&lt;/small>; to be in more places at once. Spotify is working with Open&lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; to translate podcasts into different languages, allowing broadcasters to be heard in more markets, in their own voice. Other firms such as HeyGen provide dubbing services for video, using &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; to change the movement of the actor&#39;s lips to match what they are saying. HeyGen recently created a viral video of Ms Swift appearing to speak fluent Chinese. Such platforms can adapt content in other ways, too, for instance by toning down strong language for a broader audience. Technology like this will allow stars to reach more viewers—and presents a problem to the lowlier actors who specialise in dubbing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Stars are also using &lt;small>;ai&lt;/small>; to travel in time. John Lennon re-entered the charts on November 2nd with “Now and Then”, old recordings of his voice having been salvaged using &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;. (“I hope someone does this to all my crap demos after I&#39;m dead—make them into hit songs,” said his late fellow Beatle, George Harrison, of an earlier attempt to resurrect Lennon&#39;s work.) James Earl Jones, who is 92 and first voiced Darth Vader almost 50 years ago, has sold Disney the right to replicate his gravelly tones artificially. A virtual Darth appeared in Disney&#39;s “Obi-Wan Kenobi” last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some artists are experimenting with licensing their voice or image more widely. In April Grimes, a Canadian singer, invited amateur composers to clone her voice for use in their songs, provided they share any royalties with her. In September Meta launched 28 chatbot characters, played by celebrities. Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and Charlie D&#39;Amelio are among the &lt;small>;B&lt;/small>;-listers to be botified, with one reportedly being paid $5m over two years.

But even if they do not license their voice or likeness, others may still borrow them. A company called Socialdraft sells $5 “prompts” to make chatbots take on the personality of celebrities ranging from Tom Cruise to Josef Stalin, who do not appear to have given their permission. It is named in a legal complaint by a group of authors including Mr Grisham, whom it also impersonates. (Socialdraft denies wrongdoing. Antonio Evans, its chief executive, says, “The interplay between &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;, copyright and individual rights is a thrilling narrative we are all part of.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Some unauthorised clones have become hits. In April an anonymous amateur composer released a song called “Heart On My Sleeve”, using the &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-replicated voices of two rappers, Drake and The Weeknd. The song was streamed 20m times before Universal, which represents the two artists, demanded it be taken down.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The track caused alarm, but it also demonstrated how cloning can work in artists&#39; favour. Analysis by Will Page, author of “Pivot” and a former chief economist at Spotify, suggests that being cloned can help stars sell genuine music. He calculates that after David Guetta, a French &lt;small>;DJ&lt;/small>;, posted a clip of an &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-generated rap in the style of Eminem in February, streams of real Eminem tracks rose by about五分之一。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet antipathy to &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; remains fierce. A group of actors, writers and directors has set up an outfit called Credo23 to certify films and &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; shows made without &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; (it has yet to take off). Many singers, burned by digital piracy in the past, are also hostile. Sir Cliff Richard, an 83-year-old crooner, recently declared that his singing “didn&#39;t use artificial insemination”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Others fear that &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; will simply make entertainment derivative and boring. Three-quarters of Americans tell YouGov, a pollster, that they worry &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; will sap human creativity. The process of ingesting everything and then spitting out an average may lead to a stylistic and conceptual regression to the mean, says a literary agent, who sees similarities with the algorithms on social media that help propagate the most pedestrian views. Sir Lucian, at Universal, has said that &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; “will always lack the essential spark that drives the most talented artists to do their best work, which is intention”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Everything depends on whether audiences embrace artificial performances. “Is the next generation of moviegoers going to want to see a different actor in James Bond, as an example? Or are they going to want to see Sean Connery come back?” asks a Hollywood agent. &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>;-generated performances may prove to be most successful for the biggest stars, whose uncritical superfans cannot get enough of them. As Liam Gallagher, a former Oasis frontman and John Lennon devotee, replied when asked on social media what he thought of the remastered “Now and Then”: “The Beatles could shit in my hand bag I&#39;d still hide my polo mints in there ”。 &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot;

On October 18th the ten-year Treasury yield, which incorporates long-term expectations for interest rates and was below 1% as recently as 2021, hit 4.9%, its highest since 2007. The 30-year Treasury yield crossed 5% the same day 。 Analysts at Bank of America may have sounded a little breathless when they declared last month that rates were “coming off 5,000-year lows”.&amp;nbsp; But that is indeed how it feels to economists, investors and anyone in the uncomfortable position of servicing debts they incurred when almost everyone expected rates to be low for ever.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1m7l96h&quot;>;.css-1m7l96h{width:21rem;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media (min-width: 37.5rem){.css-1m7l96h{float:left;margin-right:var(--ds-grid-gutter);}.css-1m7l96h .e1197rjj0{padding-top:0.375rem;}}&lt;/style>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;1166&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC214.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The conviction that rates will remain “higher for longer” is spreading around the world. The euro zone saw negative interest rates in 2021; now Germany must pay nearly 3% to borrow for a decade. Britain&#39;s bond yields are nearly as high as America&#39;s. Even Japan, whose apparently permanently low rates were seen as a harbinger for the rest of the world, has faced upward pressure on its bond yields (see chart 1). Bets that its central bank will have to raise interest rates in 2024 for the first time since 2007 are mounting.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;If markets are right, a new era is beginning and the consequences will be far reaching. Households and companies will have to pay much more to borrow. The financial system will have to adjust to a painful new reality. And governments will find they have to divert more tax revenue to pay the interest on their accumulated debt. The higher-for-longer scenario that many investors are now predicting is a potentially toxic mix.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Start with the real economy. One of the surprises of the past year is how resilient the world economy—and particularly America—has been in the face of higher rates. On October 26th it was revealed that America&#39;s &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; grew at an annualised pace of 4.9% in the third quarter. Consumer spending has been supported by the excess savings households built up thanks to the lockdowns and stimulus payments of the covid-19 pandemic. Many firms issued long-term debt when rates were low, and so continue to enjoy low financing costs today. Net interest payments by America&#39;s companies have actually fallen this year, because the interest they earn on the cash they keep to hand has risen faster than the cost of servicing their debts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;These protective buffers will last for a while yet. In September statisticians revised up the estimate of savings accumulated during the pandemic, which had previously looked like they were on the verge of exhaustion. It now appears that America&#39;s households are still sitting on about $1trn of excess cash, equal to nearly 5% of annual personal income in aggregate.&amp;nbsp; It will also take time for higher rates to slow companies down. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that just 16% of America&#39;s corporate debt will mature over the next few years. Refinancing it will lift the average interest rate on the total stock of debt from 4.2% this year to just 4.5% in 2025.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Not all companies are resilient to higher rates, however. Smaller American firms, whose debts typically fall due sooner than those of big ones, are under strain even though the economy is booming. There and in Europe, where growth is weaker, corporate bankruptcies are rising (see chart 2). In some economies firms are much more exposed to rising rates: at the end of 2021 the median maturity of Spanish and Italian businesses&#39; debts was only 2.6 years and 2.1 years respectively.&amp;nbsp; In Sweden, where corporate debt is an eye-watering 155% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;, the average effective interest rate on outstanding bank loans to companies rose from 1.5% to 3.9% in the year to March and will be higher still by now. In September the number of corporate bankruptcies was 14% higher than a year earlier.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Were rates to reach a permanently higher plateau, even long-dated debt would eventually start to cost companies dear. That would be painful because during the 2010s firms borrowed heavily: America&#39;s non-financial corporations issued a net $4.1trn in debt over that decade while retiring a net $3.2trn of equity through dividends and buy-backs. In advanced economies as a whole, corporate debt is around 93% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;, up from less than 80% in the mid-2000s, according to data from the &lt;small>;IMF&lt;/small>;. If rates stay higher for longer, this borrowing binge may need to be unwound. A long period of deleveraging could therefore inhibit investment in the 2020s, just as low growth inhibited it in the 2010s.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 1g1r205&quot;>;.css-1g1r205{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-1);line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}&lt;/style>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;Home is where the hurt is&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Households, too, will eventually find that higher rates bite. In America and some European countries interest rates on mortgages can be fixed for decades, which protects borrowers from rate rises as long as they do not move house. But house prices are likely to fall, because they depend mostly on buyers who borrow afresh, and therefore face much higher costs. On October 18th Mortgage News Daily, a data provider, reported that the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in America carried an interest rate of 8% for the first time since 2000.&amp;nbsp;As a result the monthly payment required to buy the median American home with a mortgage worth 90% of the property&#39;s value is now nearly 60% of average earnings, up from 33% in July 2021.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It strains credulity to think that housing markets can sustain such ratios. According to the Bank for International Settlements, real house prices in 12 advanced economies fell by 10% between the start of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023. Should rates follow the path implied by markets, real house prices should fall by another 14% by the end of 2025. In a scenario in which interest rates stabilise slightly above their current level, the peak-to-trough fall in real house prices would reach 35%. For comparison, the fall prompted by the global financial crisis was 13%.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Next, consider the implication of higher rates for the financial sector. Traders often joke that interest rates go up until something breaks. In the spring of 2023 something did: banks. They own lots of government bonds, which lose value as rates rise. The jump in the yield of ten-year Treasuries from 1.5% at the end of 2021 to around 3.5% a year later drove down the value of a broad index of Treasury bonds by about 10%. That inflicted over $600bn of losses on American banks, the most vulnerable of which—Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic—suffered runs and failed. The crisis was eventually forestalled by the Federal Reserve offering to lend to banks against the face value, rather than the market value, of their Treasuries, easing the pressure on their balance sheets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;But in a higher-for-longer world, the crisis could return. The last loans under the Fed&#39;s new lending scheme are to be made in March.&amp;nbsp;Even if it is extended, banks may find themselves unable to afford to pay the interest on the Fed loans (which is similar to prevailing short-term rates and so has been rising steadily).&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;And it is not just Treasuries whose market value falls when rates rise. More or less any loan paying a fixed return over a medium-to-long duration will follow the same pattern. Erica Jiang, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski and Amit Seru, a group of economists, undertook an analysis that valued all the assets of American banks at the market prices that prevailed in March and then tested to see what would happen if half or all of their uninsured depositors withdrew their savings. They found that, even under the less apocalyptic scenario, some 200 or so banks, with collective assets of $300bn, would potentially be insolvent.&amp;nbsp;Another paper, by Mark Flannery and Sorin Sorescu, two more economists, concluded, “If all unbooked losses were fully reflected in bank balance sheets, roughly half of all banks, holding roughly half of all bank assets, would not meet their minimum regulatory capital requirements.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Since March the bond index has fallen by 5% more. Ms Jiang and her co-authors have repeated their analysis. They find that unrealised losses have climbed modestly, but are now concentrated at bigger banks. In March only some 30% of the $2.2trn of these losses were at banks labelled “systemically important” by regulators. Now there are $2.5trn of unrealised losses, with about two-thirds at such banks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;There are other sources of financial vulnerability, too. Commercial property loans make up around a tenth of bank assets, and the value of office buildings has collapsed owing to higher interest rates and lower occupancy. Some owners have simply handed the keys to lenders. What is more, much lending has migrated in recent years from banks to other sorts of financial institutions, such as pension funds and insurance firms. They have never gone through a cycle of rising rates as big lenders before. Although the dispersal of risk is in principle helpful, it also means a greater number of firms face potential losses.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBC216.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: The Economist&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Last, consider the vulnerability of governments. After the global financial crisis, rich countries&#39; public debts surged to the highest level since 1946.&amp;nbsp;Since the pandemic they have been larger, relative to &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;, than at any time since the Napoleonic wars (see chart 3). The sustainability of these massive debts depends not just on interest rates, but on how those rates compare with economic growth. In the low-rate era it became fashionable to note that if &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; expands faster than interest accrues, then a government&#39;s debt-to-&lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; ratio can shrink even as it borrows afresh to pay its interest bill. It may even be able to borrow more still to fund extra spending while keeping its debt-to-&lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; ratio stable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;In October the &lt;small>;IMF&lt;/small>; projected that, between 2023 and 2028, the economic growth rate in advanced economies will continue to exceed the interest rate their governments pay on their debts, by 1.4 percentage points on average, despite recent rate rises. The reason is that governments, like companies, have locked in low rates to some degree by issuing long-term debt.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet debt-to-&lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; ratios are mostly set to rise anyway, because many governments continue to run excessive deficits. America especially is borrowing with abandon: strip out accounting distortions and its deficit for the past year was 7.5% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a think-tank. Deficits that high are typically seen only during wars or catastrophic recessions. &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; calculated the fiscal adjustments that advanced economies would need to make to keep their debts stable, given the &lt;small>;IMF&lt;/small>;&#39;s projections. In every big advanced economy bar Germany and Japan, belt-tightening is needed to stop the debt-to-&lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; ratio from rising further. America would have to trim its primary budget deficit—ie, its deficit excluding interest on its debt—by an annual 2.4% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;. Such parsimony will be especially difficult given the extra spending that is needed to cope with ageing populations, the climate crisis and rising geopolitical tensions—the annual bill for all of which, the &lt;small>;IMF&lt;/small>; estimates, will add up to about 7.5% of &lt;small>;gdp&lt;/small>; in rich countries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;What is more, in a higher-for-longer world governments, like companies, must refinance eventually. Ten-year yields are now above plausible estimates of long-run growth in most rich economies. That means much more belt-tightening could be needed to keep debts from rising. It is hard to escape the conclusion that, on current growth forecasts, higher-for-longer would force governments into another round of painful budget-balancing like that suffered by Europe in the 2010s. If upheaval in the finance industry prompts expensive bail-outs, the fiscal outlook would become yet bleaker.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;There is always cope&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Can the world economy cope with corporate deleveraging, falling house prices, turmoil at banks and fiscal frugality? Surprisingly, the answer is, perhaps—if rates have risen for the right reason. Economists typically think that interest rates are determined in the long term by the balance between the world&#39;s desire to save and to invest. All else equal, more saving pulls down the so-called “natural” rate of interest; more investment pushes it up. The most popular explanation for the rock-bottom rates of the 2010s was that&amp;nbsp;ageing populations were stashing away more money for retirement, while insipid long-term growth prospects had sapped companies of the desire to expand—a phenomenon sometimes called “secular stagnation”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;For rates to have shifted permanently, that outlook must have changed. One possible reason it might have is the anticipation of faster economic growth, driven, perhaps, by recent advances in artificial intelligence (&lt;small>;ai&lt;/small>;). In the long term, growth and interest rates are intimately linked. When people&#39;s incomes rise over time, they have less need to save. Companies, expecting higher sales, become keener to invest. Central banks have to keep rates higher to stop economies from overheating.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;It might seem farfetched to say that optimism about &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; is pushing up bond产量。 Yet it would explain why the prospect of higher-for-longer has not caused stockmarkets to fall much. In theory, higher bond yields should reduce the value of companies&#39; future earnings, an effect that bites hardest for technology firms, since they tend to promise jam tomorrow. In fact, as optimism about &lt;small>;AI&lt;/small>; has spread, the value of big tech firms such as Microsoft and Nvidia has soared. Their rising value has kept the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio of the &lt;small>;S&lt;/small>;&amp;amp;&lt;small>;P &lt;/small>;500 at around pre-pandemic levels, even though bond yields—and hence the rate used to discount future profits—are now much higher.&amp;nbsp;And America&#39;s strong growth in the third quarter was not driven by an unusual jobs boom; in fact, the labour market is cooling. If the growth number is accurate, productivity must have risen.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1m7l96h e18kpe851&quot;>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;703&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; data-nimg=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color:transparent&quot; sizes=&quot;300px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg 1424w&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_FBD002.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2&quot;>;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ui9tv6 e6ii4pq1&quot;>;Image: Patrick Leger&lt;/span>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;To the extent that productivity growth explains higher rates, the new era could be a happy one. Alongside the rise in debt-service costs, households will have higher real incomes, firms will have higher revenues, financial institutions will enjoy low default rates and governments will collect more tax. Healthy competition for capital might even bring benefits of its own. Some economists long suspected that the low-rate era of the 2010s made the economy less dynamic. “It was easy for relatively inefficient companies to stay afloat, so there wasn&#39;t much creative destruction,” says Kristin Forbes of &lt;small>;MIT&lt;/small>;. In a higher-rate world underpinned by faster growth, there would be plenty of dynamism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Alas, there is a more worrying explanation for higher rates: that government debt has grown so large that it has sopped up the world&#39;s surplus savings, leaving the private sector to compete for the scraps. In the short term, many traders blame the avalanche of debt issuance since the pandemic, as well as the unwinding of big bond purchases at central banks, for rising bond yields. Economists often pooh-pooh the significance of existing bonds changing hands, but they do think the size of the outstanding stock of debt matters. A rule of thumb proposed in 2019 by Larry Summers of Harvard University and Lukasz Rachel, then at the Bank of England, is that a ten-percentage-point increase in debt-to-&lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; raises interest rates by 0.35 percentage points in the long run, while every percentage point increase in deficits raises rates by a similar amount. That would imply that spendthrift governments have contributed to today&#39;s high rates.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;To the extent government debt is to blame for “higher-for-longer”, then the world economy will have to deal with higher rates without any accompanying fillip to growth. That would be painful. “You can&#39;t really take the view that deficits will continue to push interest rates up and will also continue unchecked,” says Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Something&#39;s got to give, whether it&#39;s a more restrictive fiscal policy or some sort of debt crisis.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Other than a fiscal crisis, how could the tension be resolved? One possibility is that persistently high inflation could erode the real value of government debts, as it has in the past after moments of economic crisis.&amp;nbsp;In that case, though nominal interest rates might be higher-for-longer, the real interest rate would not have risen as much. Companies and governments would survive high rates because their incomes would be strong in cash terms. Relative to the high real yields they expect today, bondholders would be squeezed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Another possibility is that high rates push the world economy into a recession, which in turn causes central banks to cut them. In line with this thesis, on October 23rd Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital announced that his fund was no longer betting that rates would keep rising, pushing down the value of Treasuries. “There is too much risk in the world to remain short bonds at current long-term rates,” he wrote. “The economy is slowing faster than recent data suggests.” If he is right, higher may not be for that much longer. &lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/l9lqenpjs2dom81bsiij1dhabr3a32hr</guid><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 09:59:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title> Why Israel&#39;s invasion of Gaza has been delayed</title><description> &lt;section class=&quot;css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0&quot;>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css sscfcz&quot;>;.css-sscfcz img{display:block;}.css-sscfcz .e6ii4pq2{margin-top:0.25rem;}&lt;/ style>;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-sscfcz e1197rjj0&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The silhouette of a man standing on the rubble of buildings destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.&quot;

On October 25th he confirmed that a ground offensive is still planned. But it will be smaller and slower than anyone would have expected in the days after the massacre, in which Hamas militants murdered more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;According to the latest count from Israeli officials, the tally of at least 220 people seized during the attack includes scores of children and old people, and citizens of at least a dozen foreign countries. The hostages have become a source of pressure on Mr Netanyahu&#39;s government.

The hostages&#39; relatives often give television and radio interviews. The issue is deeply political. Many of those from the kibbutzim that were attacked are the secular, left-leaning sorts of Israelis most likely to have joined protests against Mr Netanyahu&#39;s government throughout the year. They feel his government forsook them on October 7th and is still failing them. Pressure from the families has already forced the government to change its plans. Originally inclined to rush into Gaza without regard for the hostages&#39; safety, it has since declared that their rescue is a “top priority”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Qatar, host to some leaders of Hamas, is also feeling the heat.

Israeli officials had been scathing about Qatar in recent weeks.

On Israel&#39;s northern border with Lebanon, there have been daily exchanges of fire. Hizbullah, the Shia militia cum political party, has attacked Israeli towns and army posts with anti-tank missiles, and Israel has shelled and bombed southern Lebanon. Hizbullah admits that some 40 of its fighters have been killed (the real toll is probably higher). It is the most sustained fighting since the war they fought in 2006, though it has yet to escalate beyond tit-for-tat bombardment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Militias in Syria and Iraq have used drones to attack American bases, where two dozen soldiers were lightly injured. On October 19th the Pentagon said an American destroyer, the &lt;i>;&lt;small>;USS&lt;/small>;&lt;/i>; &lt;i>;Carney,&lt;/i>; had shot down missiles and drones launched from Yemen over the Red Sea.

But they are risky. A strike that kills a lot of people in either Israel or Lebanon would be enough to upset the balance. To make that less likely, Israel has evacuated around two dozen communities in the north, including Kiryat Shmona, a city of more than 20,000 people near the Lebanese border. Villages on the Lebanese side have also emptied as residents flee farther north.&lt;/p>;&lt;style data-emotion=&quot;css 15hubx8&quot;>;.css-15hubx8{width:100%;display:block;height:22.5rem;}&lt;/style>;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZ_BZ-knasU?enablejsapi=1&quot; title=&quot;What is Hizbullah?&quot; class=&quot;css-15hubx8 e14263u30&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Israel has hardened its border too: many reservists called up this month were sent north, not south. America has deployed two aircraft-carrier strike groups, one to the eastern Mediterranean, the other to the Persian Gulf. On October 21st it said it would deploy more Patriot air-defence battalions and a &lt;small>;THAAD&lt;/small>; anti-ballistic missile battery.

Talk in the war cabinet of launching a pre-emptive strike on the group has died down. Of late, oil markets seem more sanguine, too. The price of Brent crude, which spiked from $85 a barrel before the Hamas attack to $92 on October 19th, has slipped to below $90.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/18/a-short-history-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict&quot;>;Every Israeli war&lt;/a>; is fought watching the clock, as international condemnation grows and eventually America qualifies its support. In 1973 America urged a ceasefire ending the Yom Kippur War, even though Israeli forces were on the advance. In 2006 it imposed a ceasefire before Israel could achieve its objectives in Lebanon. As one Israeli official puts it, “Our window of international legitimacy is limited.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The scenes of horror in Gaza mean the window is already关闭。 The &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; says 1.4m people in the territory have been displaced; its shelters are crammed to two-and-a-half times their capacity. On October 13th Israel told the entire population of northern Gaza to flee south. Thousands who heeded that order have since travelled back the other way. If nowhere feels safe, they reckon, better to be in one&#39;s own home than a tent or a crowded shelter.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Israel refuses to allow any supplies to cross its border until Hamas releases all the hostages it holds captive. On October 21st the first shipment of aid, a convoy of 20 lorries containing food, water and medicine entered Gaza from Egypt. Several more deliveries followed. This is only a small fraction of what the territory needs (the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; says at least 100 lorries a day are required). Families have cut back to one meal a day. People have resorted to drinking salty water from wells. Aid workers say poor sanitation has led to cases of scabies and diarrhoea and fear that even more serious diseases will spread.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;No fuel has entered Gaza since October 7th.

The World Health Organisation says six of Gaza&#39;s 13 hospitals have run out of fuel. Most bakeries are closed for the same reason; queues at those still working stretch up to six hours. Israel refuses to allow fuel shipments.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Arab states want an immediate ceasefire. The European Union is split, but Josep Borrell, its top diplomat, has called for a “humanitarian pause” to allow more supplies to enter. Rishi Sunak, Britain&#39;s prime minister, has signalled support for one too. America still offers Israel staunch backing, but will not do so indefinitely.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Yet Mr Netanyahu faces mounting pressure from his hard-right base to prove he is clobbering Hamas, and is loth to admit that Mr Biden or the hostages&#39; families have stayed his hand. Instead, using proxies, he has begun to brief that the army is not ready for a ground campaign. Rather than risk soldiers&#39; lives, it is argued, Israel should launch more devastating air strikes, including the use of bunker-busting bombs, to destroy Hamas&#39;s tunnel network.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The army has pushed back, saying it is “fully ready” for an invasion. There have been days of ugly but accurate headlines in the Israeli media about discord between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant in March, after the latter voiced criticism of the government&#39;s plan to weaken the supreme court. He was forced to retreat after massive public protests. There has been growing distrust between the two ever since, and it is now hampering Israel&#39;s war-planning effort.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On October 11th leaders of one opposition party, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot—both former army chiefs—joined the war cabinet. But they have failed to restore unity. “The [army] and the intelligence community were severely hit by their failure to detect and prevent the Hamas attack,” says a defence official. “But they&#39;ve got back on their feet and are now just waiting for a clear idea from the government what to do.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1g1r205 e1nk3r6v0&quot;>;General confusion&lt;/h2>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The army&#39;s orders remain to destroy Hamas&#39;s military capabilities and end its control of Gaza. Some within the army and the wider defence establishment believe a more gradual ground campaign would be better. But generals were told to prepare for a broad offensive; they cannot change that plan unless the cabinet gives them a different timetable or a different goal. And the cabinet is dithering.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;General Herzi Halevi, the army chief, has acknowledged the army&#39;s failure to prevent the massacre. So has Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet, Israel&#39;s internal-security service, and General Aharon Haliva, the head of military intelligence. All three are expected to do the honourable thing and resign after the war. Most Israelis want their prime minister to accept similar responsibility—but he has not.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Instead Mr Netanyahu spends most of his time huddling with political advisers and briefing journalists. He has assembled his own shadow cabinet of former generals and security officials to second-guess Mr Gallant and the army. “There are many who shoulder the blame for thinking that Hamas wouldn&#39;t dare do something like this,” says one Knesset member from Mr Netanyahu&#39;s coalition. “Obviously Bibi is more to blame than all the others, but don&#39;t wait for him to say so.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot;

While the polls show broad backing among Israelis for the ground offensive in Gaza, they also show support for Mr Netanyahu has plummeted. Some 40% of voters who supported his Likud party less than a year ago now say they would vote for someone else. Calls are growing for a national commission of enquiry to be held once the conflict has ended.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;On October 25th Israeli officials said they had agreed to delay the invasion of Gaza to allow America to shore up its air defences in the region. But Mr Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from his hard-right base to prove his readiness to destroy Hamas. The prime minister&#39;s proxies have been briefing journalists that the &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; is not fully prepared for the ground campaign and that, instead of jeopardising the lives of Israeli soldiers with a rapid invasion, as Israel&#39;s generals suggest, even more devastating air-strikes are needed to destroy Hamas&#39;s network of tunnels. This has led to angry responses from the &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; that it is, in fact, ready. It has also prompted ugly—and accurate—headlines in the Israeli media about the discord in the war cabinet between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Divisions within this government are not new. In March Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant after he publicly criticised the government&#39;s plan to weaken the powers of the Supreme Court. The prime minister was forced to retreat in the face of massive public protests. But the growing distrust between the two since then is now hampering Israel&#39;s war-planning. The establishment of a “unity government” with leaders of one of the opposition parties, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot—both of whom are former &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; chiefs of staff and also part of the war cabinet—has failed to bring about any actual unity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;Mr Netanyahu&#39;s relationship with Israel&#39;s generals has long been tense. That tension has been heightened by their responses to Hamas&#39;s attack on October 7th. “The &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; and the intelligence community were severely hit by their failure to detect and prevent the Hamas attack,” says a senior defence official. “But they&#39;ve got back on their feet and are now just waiting for a clear idea from the government [about] what to do.” By contrast Israel&#39;s politicians, and its prime minister in particular, still seem to be floundering.&lt;/p>;&lt;div class=&quot;adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot; class=&quot;adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The army&#39;s chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, has already publicly acknowledged the failure of October 7th, as have Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet, Israel&#39;s security service, and the chief of the military intelligence branch, Major General Aharon Haliva. All are expected to resign once the war is over. The prime minister, though, has not accepted any such responsibility, beyond saying vaguely on October 25th that “only after the war” would questions be asked “of me as well”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;“There are many who shoulder the blame for thinking that Hamas wouldn&#39;t dare do something like this,” says one Knesset member from Mr Netanyahu&#39;s coalition. “Obviously Bibi is more to blame than all the others but don&#39;t wait for him to say so.” Instead, when he has not been in meetings with his war cabinet or welcoming foreign leaders, Mr Netanyahu has spent most of his time in recent days huddled with his political advisers and briefing journalists. He has also assembled a shadow cabinet of former generals and security officials to second-guess Mr Gallant and the &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>;&#39;s generals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;The prime minister is not the only one focused on politicking. The coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties that backs Mr Netanyahu knows it may not last long: public anger and another election could sweep them away. But they are anxious to cling on for as long as possible—and to make the most of their power. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister and leader of Jewish Power, a far-right party, has made a show of handing weapons to civilians, ostensibly to prevent further terrorist attacks. But he has been trying to stoke tensions between Israeli Jews and Arab-Israelis. For now, at least, he has had no success. (He was pointedly not included in the war cabinet.) Other coalition partners have blocked efforts to get cash to help the thousands of Israeli families uprooted by the war, because they worry the money will be diverted from funding the special interests of their own communities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-component=&quot;paragraph&quot; class=&quot;css-1xm1z6f e1tt35bk0&quot;>;All the talk is of the next stage of the fighting in Gaza, not what follows it. Israel&#39;s security establishment would prefer to see the Palestinian Authority, which was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in a bloody coup in 2007, return and take control of the area. But one senior official admits that no planning is being done on that front. For over a decade Mr Netanyahu has isolated and neglected Gaza, believing it could safely be left to fester. The attack on October 7th demonstrated how tragically that policy has failed. His politicising of the war now, and his reluctance to plan for the future, could cost Israel even more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;</description><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/25/israels-prime-minister-and-its-army-are-damagingly-divided<guid ispermalink="false"> /content/km2iggca1c1tagbrt08k9qhrph1e4onf</guid><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:00:16 GMT</pubDate><category>以色列</category></item></channel></rss>
